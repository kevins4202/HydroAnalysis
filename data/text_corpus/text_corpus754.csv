3770,the widespread use of surveillance cameras has become an emerging means for rainfall observations with the advantages of high spatial temporal resolution rainfall information obtained from surveillance videos is highly suitable for meteorological related research and has bright prospects however due to the complex and variable monitoring scenarios the quality of the rainfall data estimated by each camera is always inconsistent resulting in low practical value dense ground level surveillance cameras have temporal and spatial correlations that can be used to improve the accuracy of rainfall estimation through mutual verification in this study we first introduce camera parameters to refine the spatial volume of rainfall svor 1 1 most acronyms used in this study appear in the appendix 1 perceived by cameras to improve the accuracy of rainfall intensity ri estimation next a novel quality control qc model of rainfall estimation with multi surveillance camera collaboration that takes the rainfall observations of all cameras as input is proposed i we build a reliability evaluation re model for the estimation of ri in accordance with raindrop imagery features to provide a reference for the subsequent correction of ri estimation ii inspired by the first law of geography tobler 1970 we then construct a spatial temporal consistency filter and a situation consistency filter by using the spatial temporal constraints between cameras to coarsely evaluate the ri values and iii the correlation between cameras is calculated based on the fuzzy method to further build a correlation filter for the fine grained correction of ri values experiments show that our method can effectively eliminate ri outliers and improve the accuracy and reliability of rainfall estimation results moreover our method is highly suitable for heavy and violent rainfall application scenarios and can provide high resolution rainfall data support for flooding warnings and simulations in urban areas keywords rainfall estimation camera collaboration quality control model ground level spatial temporal resolution 1 introduction rainfall data are one of the most basic inputs of urban rainfall runoff simulations rainfall is unevenly distributed in time and space and the temporal and spatial resolutions of rainfall data are crucial for the quality of hydrological analyses and urban flooding management notaro et al 2013 rabiei et al 2013 xiao et al 2018 sun et al 2018 nevertheless under the effect of global climate change and rapid urbanization urban heat island and rain island effects occur frequently min et al 2011 resulting in rainfall in urban areas presenting high degrees of randomness and complexity current rainfall observation systems however have difficulty producing rainfall data with relatively high resolutions to meet the needs of urban floods and waterlogging simulations niemczynowicz 1999 berne et al 2004 mccabe et al 2017 njue et al 2019 i rain gauges are the fundamental means of measuring precipitation at the ground level however rain gauges are usually spatially sparse due to the high expense of a dense rain gauge network rabiei et al 2016 thus they cannot adequately capture the spatial variability in precipitation especially over complicated topography e g mountainous areas and urban areas kathiraveluet al 2016 kidd et al 2017 ii based on remote sensing rs techniques weather radar and satellites can obtain data with relatively high spatial and temporal resolution and these data are widely used for rainfall estimation purposes brunetti et al 2018 zorzetto and marani 2020 nevertheless such measurements suffer from the intrinsic weakness of the principle in rainfall estimation applications i e finding the relationship between observable variables from space e g cloud top temperature and the presence of frozen particles aloft and rainfall information lorenz and kunstmann 2012 allamano et al 2015 mccabe et al 2017 hence rs based rainfall estimation must be calibrated and validated with ground level precipitation measurements ochoa rodriguez et al 2019 moreover recent studies have shown that this method is difficult to apply to real time urban flood forecasting mccabe et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 iii coupling rs e g satellite and radar measurements with ground level rain gauge observations partially bridges the gap between the discrete description of rainfall provided by the rain gauge network and the real spatial dynamics related to the precipitation fronts brocca et al 2014 allamano et al 2015 the combination of the various signals however requires working at the interface between multi source heterogeneous data which is complicated particularly when short duration rainfall is considered therefore developing a high resolution low cost ground level rainfall monitoring network has become an important research domain in meteorology related fields many organizations and or institutions e g international hydrological programme ihp world meteorological organization wmo national aeronautics and space administration nasa national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa have proposed initiatives to identify new rainfall measurement methods barthès and mallet 2013 buytaert et al 2014 mccabe et al 2017 and several innovative ideas have been discussed njue et al 2019 for example commercial cellular communication networks overeem et al 2013 2016 windshield wipers or optical sensors in moving vehicles rabiei et al 2012 2013 2016 fitzner et al 2013 2015 smartphones guo et al 2018 and surveillance cameras garg and nayar 2007 allamano et al 2015 jiang et al 2019 have been regarded as alternative rain gauges by scholars for example densely distributed camera based surveillance methods can increase the spatial resolution of rainfall observations moreover the rapid transmission processing and interpretation of surveillance videos can improve the temporal resolution of rainfall measurements by multi camera cooperation video or camera based rain gauges vrgs can form a vrg network making it possible to produce rainfall data with high spatial and temporal resolutions captured by surveillance cameras therefore vrgs have become an important development direction of rainfall observations at present vrg research has yielded some achievements but it is still in the exploratory stage existing studies focus mainly on improving the accuracy and effectiveness of a single vrg nevertheless additional regional rainfall products obtained by interpolating the rainfall estimations from each vrg are needed in meteorology related fields however the above operation is inevitably limited to the following problems i for a single vrg the complexity and variability of the video scenarios reduce the accuracy of the estimation resulting in the inconsistent quality of rainfall observations for each vrg ii for the vrg network under the effect of error propagation the inconsistent accuracy of each vrg within the network leads to instability of the interpolation results making it difficult to ensure the availability of regional rainfall data del giudice et al 2016 yang and ng 2017 altogether for rainfall estimation from vrg networks and its further applications the most important step is to handle rainfall data from different cameras with uneven qualities and resolutions unfortunately few studies have focused on this issue against this background the goal of this work is to build a quality control qc method for rainfall observations collected by a vrg network this paper constructs a novel qc model from the perspective of multi camera cooperation the qc model combines the methods of geography meteorology and fuzzy mathematics to obtain precise rainfall observations by vrg networks the novelties of this model includes the following i improving the estimation accuracy of each vrg by introducing camera parameters to refine the spatial volume of rainfall svor ii building a reliability evaluation re model based on raindrop imagery features to provide a reference for the correction of rainfall observations iii constructing a spatial temporal consistency filter situation consistency filter and correlation filter to automatically check and correct observations with multiple granularities the rest of this paper is organized as follows following this introduction we present a review of vrgs in section 2 we explain our improved vrg in section 3 we detail the proposed models in section 4 and finally we discuss the experimental results in section 5 and conclude in section 6 2 review of video based rain gauges vrgs by interpreting surveillance videos a vrg can obtain rainfall information including rainfall intensity ri and cumulative rainfall cr the implementation of a vrg can be roughly divided into two steps a identifying rain streaks pixels rain streaks the blurred pixels made by raindrops in the video wang et al 2019 a and b establishing the mapping relationship between rain pixels and ri or cr how to precisely separate the rain layer from the video and accurately identify rain pixels is the primary premise of a vrg in this section we review the development of a vrg with rain streak extraction technology as the main focus video rain removal research in the computer vision cv field has important reference value for our task kathiravelu et al 2016 wang et al 2019 a wei et al 2019 from the perspective of cv technology for rain streak identification the existing vrgs can be divided into the following categories vrgs based on the spatial and temporal properties of rain low rank and sparsity based vrgs and deep learning based vrgs 2 1 vrgs based on the spatial and temporal properties of rain the earliest vrg was designed based on a comprehensive analysis of the visual effects of rain on images videos and this vrg utilized a space time correlation model to capture the dynamics of rain garg et al 2005 2007 after rain streaks were detected based on the definition of ri in meteorology the ri was measured by observing the size and number of drops in an estimated volume of rain over time note this estimated volume refers to svor in our study sampling volume in allamano et al 2015 and depth of field in jiang et al 2019 here the svor was set to a smaller value to reduce the possibility of overlapping rain streaks for ease of discussion we refer to this kind of mapping method between rain streaks and ri as the meteorological based approach however this method fails to address heavy rain and fast moving objects that are close to the camera moreover the camera parameters and the grey threshold of rain pixels must be set manually to further improve the rain streak detection accuracy especially over the dynamic background additional temporal and spatial rain properties were introduced bossu et al 2010 utilized a gaussian mixture model gmm and geometric moments to estimate the histogram of the orientation of rain steaks and an expectation maximization algorithm was used to separate rain layers in contrast to garg s vrg garg et al 2005 2007 the authors derived a relative estimate of ri by counting the number of rain streak pixels the experimental results showed that there was a positive correlation between the number of rain streak pixels and ri for ease of discussion we refer to this mapping method between rain streaks and ri as the fitting based approach however this method was suitable for heavy rain but not for light or moderate rain and error identification problems occurred in rain free periods haurum et al 2019 further discussed this vrg bossu et al 2010 employing the same rain streak identification method proposed by garg et al 2005 2007 allamano et al 2015 presented a precision svor calculation model based on the fundamentals of camera optics here the authors believed that the svor was the volume of the focus area moreover a novel meteorological based mapping method that utilizes raindrops that are the focus of cameras to measure the ri value was proposed this vrg has received promising results with errors on the order of 25 performance however similar to garg s vrg this vrg is applicable only in ideal conditions and is unsuitable for complicated and dynamic backgrounds jiang et al 2019 furthermore judging whether rain streaks are in out of focus is also an important issue to discriminate the raindrops that are in and out of focus in the images videos the average colour tensor response and average intensity difference were used in dong s et al 2017 vrg moreover a more robust approach to identify rain streaks was proposed using grey tone functions and the direction of rain streaks after that a meteorological based model similar to garg et al 2005 2007 and allamano et al 2015 was employed to measure the ri value the measurements obtained by these models were not very accurate consequently the method was applied in limited scenarios only jiang et al 2019 2 2 low rank and sparsity based jiang et al 2019 presented a convex optimization algorithm to decompose rain streaks from surveillance videos then based on geometrical optics and photographic analyses a new accurate raindrop size calculation method was proposed in this way the accuracy of the ri calculation achieved state of the art performance however this vrg uses the alternating direction method of multipliers admm algorithm boyd et al 2011 to detect rain pixels requiring high time and hardware costs more details about this vrg can be found in section 3 1 2 3 deep learning based with the development of deep learning technology in recent years zen et al 2019 used a convolutional neural network cnn based algorithm to extract rain features from videos and employed a trained supervised neural network based regression model to interpolate the relationship between rain streaks and ri however due to the difference between the synthetic rainfall dataset and the real rainfall video wei et al 2019 the rain streak detection accuracy was greatly reduced in practical applications in addition the ri estimated accuracy of this vrg is greatly limited by the quality of the training dataset the comparison of different vrgs is shown in table 1 3 vrg from a single camera in section 3 1 we briefly introduce the camera model for the vrg then in section 3 2 we improve the rainfall estimation by refining the calculation of svor to increase the accuracy performance of this vrg and the factors that may affect the reliability of vrg results in real world applications 3 1 camera model the vrgs in our studies act on cameras that work based on the pinhole imaging principle a schematic of a pinhole imaging principle based camera is shown in fig 1 the definitions of the parameters in the following studies are shown in table 2 3 2 improved rainfall estimation to provide a clear description we divide the implementation of our improved vrg into the following three steps step 1 rain streak detection from videos the goal of rain streak detection is to estimate the number of rain pixels or clean images videos in rainy images videos this typical inverse problem is often solved by regularization methods that incorporate additional prior knowledge wang et al 2019 b after comprehensively considering the accuracy efficiency and cost our study chooses jiang s vrg 2019 as the basis of the rain streak detection algorithm from the surveillance videos in their vrg convex optimization was used to extract rain streak layers from complex videos with moving objects wind and illumination changes etc the authors jiang et al 2019 formulated an optimized model for achieving satisfactory rain streak identification results from video frames more details about this model can be found in appendix 2 step 2 raindrop size and speed calculation the rain streaks in videos represent the information on the size and speed of falling raindrops after rain streaks are detected in step 1 the size of raindrop particles corresponding to each rain streak is estimated by combining geometrical optics and photographic knowledge garg et al 2005 2007 allamano et al 2015 jiang et al 2019 referring to jiang s approach 2019 the speed of raindrops can be expressed in two ways i based on physical optics analysis the size of raindrops d in fig 1 can be inferred based on the size of the respective rain streaks h pixel and w pixel in fig 1 in the image and the object distance distances between the respective raindrops and the camera lenses then the terminal speed of raindrops can be estimated from the exposure time and the true size of the raindrops ii in the field of physics empirical formulas between raindrop diameter and terminal speed can be used to express the speed of raindrops therefore taking the speed of raindrops as a bridge the object distance of raindrops can be calculated and the size and speed of raindrops can be inferred more details on the inference procedure can be found in jiang s study 2019 step 3 rainfall intensity estimation as a common variable utilized to describe the characteristics of rainfall events in meteorology rainfall intensity is defined as the ratio of the total amount of rain rainfall depth falling during a given period to the duration of the period it is expressed in depth units per unit time usually as mm per hour mm h according to its definition the ri value can be estimated based on the size and speed of all identified rain streaks within the svor of each vrg the accuracy of svor plays an important role in ri estimation in previous studies svor has utilized different setting strategies for different purposes garg and nayar 2007 allamano et al 2015 dong et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 proposed an accurate calculation model for the theoretical svor v v the volume of the truncated rectangular pyramid between the near focus point and the far focus point in fig 1 based on geometric reasoning moreover the authors employed the gamma distribution based raindrop size distribution dsd to reduce the ri estimation error resulting from the number and size of raindrop calculation uncertainties v can be calculated by eq 1 note the definitions of the symbols in eq 1 and those that follow can be found in table 2 1 v 1 3 10 9 l f l f 2 w sensor h sensor l 2 3 l 1 3 however in practical applications the svor is usually smaller than the theoretical value calculated by eq 1 garg and nayar 2007 jiang et al 2019 due to the influence of the vrg s external and or internal parameters such as the camera height pitching angle and focal length therefore our study refines svor to improve the accuracy of the vrg according to the spatial structure models of svor as shown in fig 2 we divide the svor solution into four categories considering that the theoretical svor is a truncated rectangular pyramid we regard the svor occluded by the ground surface as a right prism in the following calculation to reduce the complexity of our algorithm in addition eq 1 can be rewritten as follows i if l l 2 tan θ h 2 2 the spatial structure of svor is shown in fig 2 a whose v can be calculated by eq 1 ii if l 2 l tan θ h 2 2 and l l 1 tan θ h 1 2 the spatial structure of svor is shown in fig 2 b whose v 1 can be calculated by eq 2 2 v 1 v 1 6 h 2 2 l 2 l tan θ l 2 1 2 l sin ψ 2 h 2 w 2 iii if l sin ψ 2 h 2 2 and l l 1 tan θ h 1 2 the spatial structure of svor is shown in fig 2 c whose v 2 can be calculated by eq 3 3 v 2 1 3 s w 1 1 6 l l 1 tan θ h 1 2 cos θ e tan θ ψ 2 e tan θ 2 ψ w 1 iv if l sin ψ 2 h 2 2 and l l 1 tan θ h 1 2 the spatial structure of svor is shown in fig 2 d whose v 3 can be calculated by eq 4 4 v 4 v w 2 3 l 2 l cos ψ 2 l 2 l tan θ h 2 w 1 3 l 1 l cos ψ 2 h 1 l 1 l tan θ where l 1 l f 2 f 2 f 2 δ l f l 2 l f 2 f 2 f 2 δ l f h 1 h sensor l f l f l 1 h 2 h sensor l f l f l 2 w 1 w sensor l f l f l 1 w 2 w sensor l f l f l 2 ψ 2 arctan h sensor 2 f and l e sin θ l e sin θ ψ 2 l e sin θ ψ 2 in summary rain streak extraction is a basic part of rainfall estimation previous studies have shown that environmental factors e g wind and moving targets significantly impair the effectiveness of rain streak detection wei et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 the calculation of svor has an important influence on the accuracy of a vrg it should be emphasized that rainfall has almost the same dsd in different svor sizes in theory nevertheless large svors can usually perceive more stable real and comprehensive rainfall information in real application scenarios the same environmental factors especially moving targets appear in different svor sizes and the interference to ri calculation results is also different as shown in fig 3 for the same rain scene with moving targets the proportion of rain streaks disturbed by the moving target in a vrg with a large svor is smaller than that in a vrg with a small svor hence a vrg with a large svor is considered more reliable than one with a small svor 4 rainfall quality control for video based rain gauges the original intention of vrg design was to obtain regional rainfall data with a high spatial and temporal resolution to service relevant hydrology research to achieve this blueprint a large number of vrg network estimation results need to be obtained and interpolated yang and ng 2017 however in this process due to the influence of interpolation propagation the inconsistent observations and outliers of the vrg network reduce the availability of regional rainfall products and have made the advancement of vrgs from theory to practical applications difficult for the above problems from the perspective of cv improving the accuracy of a single vrg in a complex environment is a direct and mainstream method but it still needs additional long term research to overcome some pain spots such as the production of real world rainfall training datasets pixel level discrimination of moving objects and cross scenario model migration wang et al 2019 a wei et al 2019 in contrast the perspective of camera collaboration is another novel strategy that is based on the constraints of the spatial and temporal information between vrgs to study the dependence between vrg observations and then correct the rainfall observations to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to apply such an idea for rainfall observations as previously mentioned the estimation accuracy of a single vrg and the consistency of rainfall data produced by the vrg network determine the application value of regional rainfall data tobler s first law of geography points out that everything is related to everything else but near things are more related to each other tobler 1970 therefore rainfall events observed by dense surveillance cameras exhibit temporal and spatial correlations taking the spatial temporal constraints between cameras as clues we vertically analyse the ri variation of a single vrg and longitudinally compare the ri differences between different vrgs and present a multi camera cooperative rainfall qc method in this section this method consists of two parts in section 4 1 we present an re model for ri values calculated by each vrg according to the raindrop imagery features based on this in section 4 2 we build a multi camera based rainfall qc model that is composed of three filters a spatial temporal consistency filter a situation consistency filter and a correlation filter suppose there are vrgs randomly distributed in the study area x definition r is the set of ri values estimated by all vrgs in the study area mm h r i is the set of ri values estimated by the i t h vrg mm h as shown in fig 4 r 1 labelled light yellow represents the set of ri values estimated by the first vrg vrg id 1 r t is the set of ri values estimated by all vrgs in the t t h sampling interval mm h as shown in fig 4 r 3 labelled by the light red zone represents the set of ri values estimated by all vrgs in the third sampling interval r i t is the ri value estimated by the i t h vrg in the t t h sampling interval mm h as shown in fig 4 r i 2 labelled by the light blue zone represents the ri value estimated by the i t h vrg vrg id i in the second sampling interval f i t t 1 is the ri increment of the i t h vrg from the t 1 t h to t t h sampling intervals mm min as shown in fig 4 f 2 t t 1 r 2 t r 2 t 1 represents the ri increment of the second vrg vrg id 2 from the t 1 t h to t t h sampling intervals and f t t 1 is the set of ri increments of all vrgs from the t 1 t h to t t h sampling intervals mm min the conversion relationship between the above variables can be expressed by eqs 5 and 6 and the relationship between the above variables is shown in fig 4 5 r r 1 r 2 r 3 r n r 1 r 2 r 3 r t r 1 1 r 1 2 r 1 3 r 1 t r 2 1 r 2 2 r 2 3 r 2 t r n 1 r n 2 r n 3 r n t 6 f t t 1 f 1 t t 1 f 2 t t 1 f i t t 1 4 1 reliability evaluation re model we analyse the reliability or uncertainty of rainfall estimation results from the perspective of the vrg implementation process which can be divided into two parts 4 1 1 rain streak detection the extraction accuracy of rain streaks from videos is constrained by the visual characteristics of raindrops and directly determines the accuracy of rainfall inversion results generally clear and realistic video imaging of rain particles is conducive to the extraction of rain streaks from videos garg et al 2005 2007 wang et al 2019 a wei et al 2019 nevertheless there are differences in the appearance of raindrops i e shape brightness and distribution in the videos filmed by different outdoor surveillance cameras leading to inconsistent accuracy even if the same rain streak extraction algorithm is employed in different types of vrgs that is in natural scenes the reliability of the rainfall inversion results varies based on different vrgs the visual characteristics of raindrops are influenced by many factors which can be roughly divided into three categories internal camera parameters i e focal length depth of field image resolution garg et al 2004 2005 external camera parameters i e camera erection height pitching angle and complex changes in video scenarios i e the appearance of moving targets lighting conditions wang et al 2019 a in contrast a vrg with a large focal length and a high image resolution is helpful for the depiction of rain particles in a natural scene from rain streak videos inevitably providing an important and advantageous alternative for the recognition of rain streaks and vice versa therefore we regard the focal length and image resolution of a vrg as two important indexes to measure the reliability of rain streak detection results 4 1 2 ri calculation determining whether the svor matches the extracted rain streaks is crucial for the ri estimation accuracy in section 3 2 we propose an accurate svor calculation model and analyse the influence of svor size on ri estimation reliability that is a large svor can improve the ability of a vrg to cope with the interference of external environmental factors moving objects and obtain more reliable rainfall information open and natural rainfall scenes are an ideal location for vrg deployment however with the development of urbanization the number of high rise buildings in urban areas is increasing the phenomenon of rain particles breaking after hitting buildings or trees or falling again after being collected by buildings or leaves leads to changes in their physical properties near the ground for example lee 1978 points out that leaves have a significant effect on the shape and speed of raindrops which is not conducive to the collection of real rainfall information by a vrg from a massive observation study we found that a high camera usually has a large rain perception space to sense complete rainfall information over a wide range at the same time a high camera can effectively reduce the possibility of the video scene being blocked by trees buildings etc or the interference from moving objects to obtain a real and stable rainfall video therefore the size of the svor and the height of the vrg greatly influence the reliability of the ri estimation results by a vrg in real world applications in summary it can be concluded that the reliability of the ri inversion value of a single vrg is affected by many factors among which the focus length image resolution svor size and vrg height have relatively large impacts on the rainfall perception ability the reliability of the i t h vrg can be expressed by eq 7 7 reliabilit y i w q w 1 q 1 w 2 q 2 w 3 q 3 w 4 q 4 where q 1 q 2 q 3 and q 4 represent the focal length image resolution svor size and height of the i t h vrg respectively w 1 w 2 w 3 and w 4 are the equilibrium coefficients based on eq 7 we present an re model algorithm for the ri values calculated by each vrg the re algorithm takes the focal length definition and erection height of each vrg as the inputs and divides all vrgs in the study area into two categories high reliability and low reliability which are represented by sets c h and c l respectively the pseudocode of the re algorithm is shown in appendix 3 moreover according to the evaluation results of the re algorithm we use eq 8 to correct the estimated ri of each vrg 8 r i w r r i w 1 r r i vr g i c h w 2 r r i vr g i c l i 1 2 n where w r is the ri correction weight of vrgs of different reliability levels 4 2 quality control model some existing studies have shown that many environmental variables such as rainfall can be considered spatially random variables oliver et al 2014 canli et al 2018 additionally according to tobler s first law of geography this study considers rainfall within a certain small spatial scope with low spatial variability which has homogeneity consistency and correlation canli et al 2018 we apply this law to the expression of rainfall which can be described as the rainfall estimates of multiple vrgs within a certain spatial scope having the characteristics of spatial temporal consistency situation consistency and cross correlation note that some existing research has reported that hydrological applications for urban catchments of the order of 1000 ha require a temporal resolution of approximately 5 min and a spatial resolution of approximately 3 km urban catchments on the order of 100 ha require resolutions of approximately 3 min and 2 km berne et al 2004 lorenz and kunstmann 2012 ahm et al 2013 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 therefore we suggest setting the spatial scope to smaller than 2 km by 2 km without loss of generality we set the study area x 2 k m 2 k m considering that the ri outliers have great interference with the interpolated regional rainfall yang and ng 2017 canli et al 2018 the detection of outliers becomes the core of inconsistency detection within the spatial scope three filters are constructed where the spatial temporal consistency filter and the situation consistency filter are coarse grained and the correlation filter is fine grained thus forming an automated multi grained ri outlier check the structure of the qc model is shown in fig 5 4 2 1 spatial temporal consistency filter although the ri values within x are different they are still correlated that is the judgement of rainfall events by multiple vrgs at the same time is consistent f i l t e r 1 is used to represent the spatial temporal consistency filter referring to the knowledge of meteorology f i l t e r 1 first removes the elements with ri 0 mm h and those greater than the historical peak of ri r threshold mm h obtained from available meteorological research then the boxplot method li et al 2016 is used to eliminate the ri outliers at the same time to ensure the spatial temporal consistency of the ri inversion values the pseudocode of the spatial temporal consistency filter algorithm is shown in appendix 4 suppose r t is the set of ri values estimated by all vrgs in the t t h sampling interval after the ri values of all vrgs are corrected by eq 8 r t can be updated to r t as shown in eq 9 9 r t f i l t e r 1 r t from eq 9 we can find that r i t within r t is smaller than r threshold assuming k is the length of r t it can be inferred that lim i k min r i t 0 and lim i k max r i t r threshold the spatial temporal consistency filter is the primary operation of the qc model because of its ability to determine the temporal and spatial range of rainfall in practical applications which provides a premise for subsequent models 4 2 2 situation consistency filter based on spatial temporal consistency we can infer that without the interference of external environmental factors although different vrgs have different ri estimation accuracies section 4 1 their perceptions of changes in rainfall should be consistent that is as rainfall increases or decreases in the real world the estimated ri value of each vrg in the study area should also increase or decrease to a certain extent hence the simulation of rainfall has the characteristic of consistency which can be regarded as another indicator of the vrg quality filter combined with eq 9 the ri change vector of each vrg can be calculated by eq 10 from eq 10 we know that f i t t 1 r i t f j t t 1 r j t in theory f i l t e r 2 is used to represent the situation consistency filter f i l t e r 2 employs eq 11 to determine the degree of each vrg s estimated ri at the current moment and uses the quantile method to filter f t t 1 eq 12 selects the second and third quartiles of f t t 1 after that r t can be updated to r t by eq 13 if r i t 1 is invalid the previous valid observation in r i is used for the calculation of eq 10 10 f i t t 1 r i t r i t 1 t r threshold t r i t r t 11 f t t 1 f 1 t t 1 r 1 t f 2 t t 1 r 2 t f i t t 1 r i t 12 f t t 1 q u a n t i l e f t t 1 2 4 q u a n t i l e f t t 1 3 4 13 r t f i l t e r 2 r t e i t r i t r i t r t e i t 0 f i t t 1 f t t 1 1 f i t t 1 f t t 1 4 2 3 correlation filter f i l t e r 1 and f i l t e r 2 can be regarded as coarse grained ri outlier elimination checks under the premise of the spatial consistency of regional rainfall in the real world regional rainfall also has the characteristics of spatially continuous changes therefore the measurements of vrgs within x are consecutive cross correlated and mutually supportive however this supportability is destroyed by the outliers f i l t e r 3 is used to represent the correlation filter based on the theory of information fusion and fuzzy mathematics f i l t e r 3 represents a correlation calculation model and reliability measurement model to conduct a fine granularity check of the ri outliers since the measurement noise is mainly caused by independent factors such as sensor internal noise and environmental interference the ri estimation noise of each vrg can be regarded as independent white noise for this study the pseudocode of the correlation filter is shown in appendix 5 5 experiments and analysis 5 1 experimental data the experimental site is located in nanjing city jiangsu province china which belongs to a sub tropical monsoon climate zone with abundant rainfall and hot conditions in the same season in early summer june to mid july affected by the frontal rain band nanjing enters the meiyu period when rainfall increases significantly and heavy or violent rainfall events occur frequently which provides advantages for rainfall observations in our study on 11 15 17 and 19 july 2020 four long term rainfall events occurred in the study area including a variety of rainfall types from light rain to heavy rain and these rainfall data were typical and representative for our research as shown in table 3 the ri grade rainfall duration and vrgs used for the observation of each rainfall event are listed for more information about the vrg id please see appendix 6 as shown in fig 6 we selected a site with an area of approximately 11 ha 350 m 320 m which is smaller than the recommended minimum spatial resolution 2 km for the qc model the study area is considered to meet the prerequisite for the model to run effectively then 12 cameras are deployed as vrgs for rainfall observation and the reading from a high precision electronic rain gauge zjc v zhejiang hengda instrument metre co ltd as shown in fig 6 is regarded as the verification data an electronic rain gauge is a kind of siphon rain gauge capable of reporting rainfall information every 0 1 mm of cumulative rainfall or every minute it has the highest accuracy of 0 01 mm h of ri estimation the rain gauge transmits back readings every 0 1 mm in heavy and violent rain scenarios and every minute in light and moderate rain to obtain relatively accurate rainfall information during the rainfall events in the experiments there was fewer breezes that appeared with a short duration therefore it can be concluded that readings from electronic rain gauges are less affected by wind and have high confidence the types of cameras widely used in city surveillance systems are selected to make the experimental results more suitable for practical applications for camera parameters see appendix 6 the relative error of ri is used as the evaluation standard which can be calculated by eq 14 14 r e r r i k r i k r k r k where r e r r i k is the relative error of the k t h observation of the i t h vrg r k is the k t h ri reading of the electronic rain gauge and r i k is the k t h ri value estimated by the i t h vrg to reduce the uncertainty of the vrg readings the average ri value within the sampling interval is regarded as an effective estimation we set the sampling interval to 30 s in the following parts 5 2 evaluation of the improvement in svor in this section we evaluate the effectiveness of the svor improvement in section 3 2 through experiments according to eqs 2 3 and 4 vrg with ids of a2 a3 and 2 correspond to the monitoring scenes in b c and d in fig 2 respectively rainfall events 1 2 and 3 in table 3 were selected to compare the ri accuracy estimated by different vrgs before and after svor correction and the results are shown in fig 7 the box plot in fig 7 is described as follows quartiles q 1 25th percentile q 3 75th percentile median 50th percentile interquartile range iqr iqr q 3 q 1 and outliers 1 5 i q r for a single vrg rain streak extraction is solved in the admm framework the parameter settings of the rain streak extraction model optimization jiang et al 2019 are shown in table 2 1 in appendix 2 for a more detailed introduction to the parameter settings please see jiang et al 2019 and wang et al 2019 as shown in fig 7 the average relative errors dotted line in fig 7 calculated by a theoretical svor are 0 24334 vrg a2 0 3539 vrg a3 and 0 38254 vrg 2 and these values become 0 21295 vrg a2 0 29807 vrg a3 and 0 29068 vrg 2 when using the improved svor in contrast the improved svor can reduce the average relative error by 12 489 vrg a2 15 776 vrg a3 and 24 013 vrg 2 additionally the accuracy improvement in vrg 2 is greater than that of vrg a2 and a3 which indicates that the larger the svor correction value is the more obvious the improvement in the ri estimation accuracy in summary the svor correction strategy is conducive to the improvement in the ri estimation accuracy hence in the remaining experiments the improved svor is applied to all vrgs for ri estimation 5 3 evaluation of the vrg accuracy in this section we compare the accuracy of vrgs constructed by the three most common cameras in practical applications vrg a1 f 8 m m vrg a2 f 6 m m and vrg a3 f 4 m m additional camera parameters are provided in appendix 6 as discussed in section 4 1 the accuracy of a vrg is affected by internal camera parameters external parameters and environmental factors among them environmental factors are the most difficult to evaluate quantitatively to minimize the interference of environmental factors on the ri calculation of vrgs we try to make these three vrgs have the same surveillance scenarios as shown in fig 8 the rainfall information of rainfall events 1 2 3 and 4 collected by each selected vrg is shown in fig 9 it should be noted that for visualization purposes not all ri estimates are shown in fig 9 the distribution of the relative error of ri calculated by each vrg in these rainfall events is shown in fig 10 fig 9 and fig 10 show the following 1 in general the cr calculated by vrgs is lower than that calculated by an electronic rain gauge fig 9 shows that the relative errors of the ri calculated by vrgs a1 a2 and a3 are concentrated at 8 to 33 13 to 44 and 28 to 47 respectively therefore in terms of the accuracy of the cr calculation vrg a1 vrg a2 vrg a3 2 fig 10 shows that approximately 83 of the relative error of the ri calculated by vrg a1 is between 0 3 and 0 1 approximately 63 of the relative error of ri calculated by vrg a2 is between 0 3 and 0 1 and approximately 89 of the relative error of ri calculated by vrg a3 is between 0 5 and 0 3 combined with the camera parameters it can be considered that a vrg with a large focal length and high image resolution always achieves a high cr calculation accuracy the main reason for this result is that a high quality vrg has a strong ability to depict and distinguish raindrops and helps extract rain streaks as shown in fig 11 compared with vrg a3 the rain images videos taken by vrg a1 and vrg a2 can clearly depict rain streaks making them conducive to rain streak extraction this conclusion echoes the principle of the re model in section 4 1 3 for rainfall scenarios the combination of fig 9 a and c reveals that the average error of the cr from vrgs during moderate and light rainfall events is approximately 8 22 to 25 37 and the cr curves fluctuate relatively smoothly however combined with fig 9 b and d the average error of the cr from vrgs during heavy and violent rainfall events is approximately 28 57 to 42 85 and the cr curves fluctuate greatly it can be considered that the accuracy and stability of the cr calculated from vrgs during light and moderate rainfall events rainfall events 1 and 3 perform better than those during heavy and violent rainfall events rainfall events 2 and 4 the possible reasons include the following in heavy and violent rain scenarios with the increase in rainfall duration the phenomena of rain and fog appear and the rain streaks seriously overlap in the video leading to a reduction in video definition and visible rain streaks as shown in fig 12 the mist fog effect formed by rain streak accumulation is a difficult area not only in the study of rain removal in the cv field but also in rain streak detection in the vrg design 4 there are some ri estimations that are obviously larger than the corresponding validation data in fig 9 these can be regarded as ri outliers by comparing and analysing the surveillance video we find that almost all videos corresponding to ri outliers have moving objects as shown in fig 13 we take the rain streak extraction results of rainfall event 2 from 09 10 23 to 09 10 30 as an example fig 13 shows that the edge or part of the content of the moving target is often misjudged as a rain streak when it appears resulting in the high ri estimation how to alleviate the reduction in the rain streak detection accuracy caused by moving objects is a classic topic in vrg design and video image rainfall removal in the cv field from the perspective of cv technology solving the above problems is currently a mainstream topic and for vrgs modifying the rainfall information observed by vrgs is an alternative topic from the perspective of camera cooperation 5 4 evaluation of the effectiveness of the qc model this section selects rainfall events 1 4 and 5 as observation objects to verify the effectiveness of our proposed qc model before that we need to calibrate the parameters in the qc model the analysis in section 3 2 indicates that cameras with different parameter settings impact the reliability of the ri inversion results the experiments in sections 5 2 and 5 3 confirm the above analysis that there are differences in the reliability of the ri results retrieved by cameras with different parameters fig 7 and fig 10 show that the relative error of the ri inversion results of the vrgs with low quality vrg id 2 and a3 has a larger error distribution and are less robust than those of vrgs with high quality vrg id a1 and a2 to improve the reliability of the qc model inputs and reduce the interference of ri outliers on the stability of the filtering results we have narrowed the distribution of the ri values calculated by low quality vrgs and manually set w 1 to 0 9 on the other hand the existing research jiang et al 2019 and many experimental results in our study show that the ri value estimated by vrgs is generally lower than the verification data therefore we manually improve the ri estimations of high quality vrgs and set w 2 to 1 1 the above operation can increase the probability that the ri estimates fed into the qc model have high accuracy while not affecting the consistency filter in the qc model interference with the other two filters occurs in very few cases e g very few storm scenarios where the ri estimations are higher than the historical peak of the ri value r threshold after multiplying by w 2 moreover based on the research results on the characteristics of meiyu period chen et al 2013 mei et al 2020 and considering that the ri estimation by a vrg is generally low r threshold in the spatial temporal filter is set as 0 4 mm min 5 4 1 results and analysis we record the rainfall data cr and ri obtained by the vrg network and processed by the qc model as observation results and the qc model calculation results respectively fig 14 shows the relative error of ri estimated by each vrg before and after using the qc model note that for visualization purposes each comparison of the estimates from vrgs and the readings from rain gauge during the rainfall event is considered one observation therefore figures in this section employ the observation sequence instead of the duration time of rainfall as the horizontal coordinate fig 14 indicates that our qc method is effective in reducing the outliers of the relative error of ri in all three rainfall events in addition the most significant improvement is achieved in the rainfall event on 17 07 2020 to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of the qc model in fig 15 the boxplot was used to show distribution of the relative error of ri before and after using the qc model the parameters of the box plot in fig 15 are set as in fig 7 moreover the distribution characteristics of the relative error of ri are shown in table 4 through the experimental results we find the following 1 fig 15 illustrates that the distribution range relative error of ri is significantly narrower and the number of ri outliers is significantly reduced after using the qc model table 4 shows that the standard deviation of the relative error of ri reduced by our method is approximately 10 83 29 31 and 21 05 in rainfall events 1 4 and 5 respectively even in different rainfall scenarios the statistical indicators of the relative error of ri can be improved to varying degrees in terms of the mean value standard deviation maximum value and minimum value we can conclude that our qc model can effectively detect ri estimation outliers narrow the distribution range of the relative error of ri and improve the consistency and stability of rainfall observations by vrgs 2 combined with fig 14 the ri filtering results are dynamically composed of the ri values estimated by high quality and low quality vrgs among them the proportion of high quality vrgs is larger than that of low quality vrgs consistent with the re modelling principle that the ri calculated by high quality vrgs has high reliability the advantage of using low quality vrg observations for calculations is that the spatial density of rainfall observations can be effectively guaranteed at the same time these data provide abundant spatial and temporal information between vrgs for the qc model furthermore we evaluate the effectiveness of the qc model in the production of surface rainfall data as follows i first considering that our study area is relatively small and that rain gauges vrgs are dense we use the arithmetic mean method to estimate the surface rainfall information of the study area lee et al 2018 therefore the average value of rainfall information cr and ri obtained by the vrg network both before and after qc model calculation is regarded as the surface rainfall data of the study area ii second it can be seen from section 4 2 that the premise of the validity of the qc model is that the rainfall in the study area is consistent therefore we regard the readings of electric rain gauges as the verification value the result of subtracting the estimated value of the vrg network from the verification value is used to evaluate the accuracy of the surface rainfall information and the results are shown in fig 16 fig 16 shows that our method can effectively improve the estimation accuracy of surface rainfall information moreover the qc model is more effective in heavy and violent scenarios fig 16 b and c there are differences in the effectiveness of our method in various rainfall scenarios that is the ri correction effect is most obvious in heavy and violent rainfall scenarios this result is mainly because the ri estimation accuracy of vrgs is generally higher in light and moderate rain than in heavy and violent rain this also offers good evidence that our method is highly suitable for the correction of vrg observations in heavy and violent rainfall events 5 5 discussion high quality regional rainfall data are one of the foundations of meteorological and other related research the estimation quality of regional rainfall on the one hand depends on the availability of data i e gauge network density spatial resolution data and other information on the other hand the quality depends on the interpolation technique yang and ng 2017 for our research as shown in fig 17 the sub area can be set up in a buffer or grid manner considering the amount of computation we prioritize the grid method as shown in fig 17 after the study area has been divided by the grid the spatial temporal consistency filter can be applied to determine the spatial range of the rainfall event based on the vrgs of each sub grid then after the qc model is employed to correct the vrg observations in each grid two kinds of data can be used as inputs of the regional rainfall interpolation model i the corrected vrg observations for the whole rainfall area and ii the surface rainfall information of each sub grid similar to section 5 4 1 in this way the regional rainfall information cr and ri can be obtained our proposed qc model can effectively filter out a large number of outlier values without losing vrg density while improving the availability of the observations moreover the experimental results in section 5 4 1 also show the effectiveness of our method in the surface rainfall calculation therefore the qc model is effective for high quality regional rainfall calculations through either of the above methods generally heavy and violent rainfall has a great impact on urban flooding disasters while a single vrg has low accuracy and poor stability in such scenarios our proposed method model can effectively alleviate the abovementioned problems and provide useful support for urban hydrological simulations 6 conclusion rainfall estimation based on an urban surveillance camera network can provide support for high resolution rainfall estimation on the basis of existing surveillance resources nevertheless solving the problem of the inconsistent quality of observations by multiple cameras has become a key issue in the production of high precision regional rainfall data first we rely on the camera parameters to refine the svor calculation to improve the rainfall observation accuracy of each vrg second a multi vrg collaborative rainfall qc model that relies on the temporal and spatial relationship between vrgs to construct an re model and three automatic quality filters to realize the self correction of rainfall estimation is proposed the experimental results show that our method can effectively improve the accuracy of a single vrg effectively eliminate the ri outliers and improve the reliability and stability of rainfall estimation results by vrg networks especially within heavy and violent rainfall scenarios our research is an important complement and enrichment to the current ground based rainfall sensing methods which is very useful for urban flooding monitoring and early warning relevant applications in the future we will further quantitatively evaluate the interference of environmental factors on the accuracy of rain streak extraction and ri estimation results to build a scientific index system for vrg reliability measurements it is worth mentioning that the qc model is still valid when the cameras in the vrg network are the same in which case the effectiveness of the re algorithm is reduced based on the present re model evaluating the reliability of rainfall estimation based on the difference of surveillance scenarios is another option worth trying therefore a more accurate calibration scheme of some parameters i e w 1 and w 2 in eq 8 in the qc model will also be considered to make the model more reasonable credit authorship contribution statement xing wang

correlated and r i t is supported by r j t if ϕ ij ϕ ji 1 r i t and r j t have a strong correlation and support each other for our study if r i t is supported by most r j t values usually more than k 2 it is retained otherwise it is deleted from r t however the empirical setting of β ij may lead to the problem that the judgement is greatly influenced by subjective factors in this study we improve the above problem based on fuzzy mathematics first according to the definition of the correlation function in fuzzy theory we can make 4 7 g ij t log 1 2 1 d ij t 1 i j 1 2 k then the dependency

3770,the widespread use of surveillance cameras has become an emerging means for rainfall observations with the advantages of high spatial temporal resolution rainfall information obtained from surveillance videos is highly suitable for meteorological related research and has bright prospects however due to the complex and variable monitoring scenarios the quality of the rainfall data estimated by each camera is always inconsistent resulting in low practical value dense ground level surveillance cameras have temporal and spatial correlations that can be used to improve the accuracy of rainfall estimation through mutual verification in this study we first introduce camera parameters to refine the spatial volume of rainfall svor 1 1 most acronyms used in this study appear in the appendix 1 perceived by cameras to improve the accuracy of rainfall intensity ri estimation next a novel quality control qc model of rainfall estimation with multi surveillance camera collaboration that takes the rainfall observations of all cameras as input is proposed i we build a reliability evaluation re model for the estimation of ri in accordance with raindrop imagery features to provide a reference for the subsequent correction of ri estimation ii inspired by the first law of geography tobler 1970 we then construct a spatial temporal consistency filter and a situation consistency filter by using the spatial temporal constraints between cameras to coarsely evaluate the ri values and iii the correlation between cameras is calculated based on the fuzzy method to further build a correlation filter for the fine grained correction of ri values experiments show that our method can effectively eliminate ri outliers and improve the accuracy and reliability of rainfall estimation results moreover our method is highly suitable for heavy and violent rainfall application scenarios and can provide high resolution rainfall data support for flooding warnings and simulations in urban areas keywords rainfall estimation camera collaboration quality control model ground level spatial temporal resolution 1 introduction rainfall data are one of the most basic inputs of urban rainfall runoff simulations rainfall is unevenly distributed in time and space and the temporal and spatial resolutions of rainfall data are crucial for the quality of hydrological analyses and urban flooding management notaro et al 2013 rabiei et al 2013 xiao et al 2018 sun et al 2018 nevertheless under the effect of global climate change and rapid urbanization urban heat island and rain island effects occur frequently min et al 2011 resulting in rainfall in urban areas presenting high degrees of randomness and complexity current rainfall observation systems however have difficulty producing rainfall data with relatively high resolutions to meet the needs of urban floods and waterlogging simulations niemczynowicz 1999 berne et al 2004 mccabe et al 2017 njue et al 2019 i rain gauges are the fundamental means of measuring precipitation at the ground level however rain gauges are usually spatially sparse due to the high expense of a dense rain gauge network rabiei et al 2016 thus they cannot adequately capture the spatial variability in precipitation especially over complicated topography e g mountainous areas and urban areas kathiraveluet al 2016 kidd et al 2017 ii based on remote sensing rs techniques weather radar and satellites can obtain data with relatively high spatial and temporal resolution and these data are widely used for rainfall estimation purposes brunetti et al 2018 zorzetto and marani 2020 nevertheless such measurements suffer from the intrinsic weakness of the principle in rainfall estimation applications i e finding the relationship between observable variables from space e g cloud top temperature and the presence of frozen particles aloft and rainfall information lorenz and kunstmann 2012 allamano et al 2015 mccabe et al 2017 hence rs based rainfall estimation must be calibrated and validated with ground level precipitation measurements ochoa rodriguez et al 2019 moreover recent studies have shown that this method is difficult to apply to real time urban flood forecasting mccabe et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 iii coupling rs e g satellite and radar measurements with ground level rain gauge observations partially bridges the gap between the discrete description of rainfall provided by the rain gauge network and the real spatial dynamics related to the precipitation fronts brocca et al 2014 allamano et al 2015 the combination of the various signals however requires working at the interface between multi source heterogeneous data which is complicated particularly when short duration rainfall is considered therefore developing a high resolution low cost ground level rainfall monitoring network has become an important research domain in meteorology related fields many organizations and or institutions e g international hydrological programme ihp world meteorological organization wmo national aeronautics and space administration nasa national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa have proposed initiatives to identify new rainfall measurement methods barthès and mallet 2013 buytaert et al 2014 mccabe et al 2017 and several innovative ideas have been discussed njue et al 2019 for example commercial cellular communication networks overeem et al 2013 2016 windshield wipers or optical sensors in moving vehicles rabiei et al 2012 2013 2016 fitzner et al 2013 2015 smartphones guo et al 2018 and surveillance cameras garg and nayar 2007 allamano et al 2015 jiang et al 2019 have been regarded as alternative rain gauges by scholars for example densely distributed camera based surveillance methods can increase the spatial resolution of rainfall observations moreover the rapid transmission processing and interpretation of surveillance videos can improve the temporal resolution of rainfall measurements by multi camera cooperation video or camera based rain gauges vrgs can form a vrg network making it possible to produce rainfall data with high spatial and temporal resolutions captured by surveillance cameras therefore vrgs have become an important development direction of rainfall observations at present vrg research has yielded some achievements but it is still in the exploratory stage existing studies focus mainly on improving the accuracy and effectiveness of a single vrg nevertheless additional regional rainfall products obtained by interpolating the rainfall estimations from each vrg are needed in meteorology related fields however the above operation is inevitably limited to the following problems i for a single vrg the complexity and variability of the video scenarios reduce the accuracy of the estimation resulting in the inconsistent quality of rainfall observations for each vrg ii for the vrg network under the effect of error propagation the inconsistent accuracy of each vrg within the network leads to instability of the interpolation results making it difficult to ensure the availability of regional rainfall data del giudice et al 2016 yang and ng 2017 altogether for rainfall estimation from vrg networks and its further applications the most important step is to handle rainfall data from different cameras with uneven qualities and resolutions unfortunately few studies have focused on this issue against this background the goal of this work is to build a quality control qc method for rainfall observations collected by a vrg network this paper constructs a novel qc model from the perspective of multi camera cooperation the qc model combines the methods of geography meteorology and fuzzy mathematics to obtain precise rainfall observations by vrg networks the novelties of this model includes the following i improving the estimation accuracy of each vrg by introducing camera parameters to refine the spatial volume of rainfall svor ii building a reliability evaluation re model based on raindrop imagery features to provide a reference for the correction of rainfall observations iii constructing a spatial temporal consistency filter situation consistency filter and correlation filter to automatically check and correct observations with multiple granularities the rest of this paper is organized as follows following this introduction we present a review of vrgs in section 2 we explain our improved vrg in section 3 we detail the proposed models in section 4 and finally we discuss the experimental results in section 5 and conclude in section 6 2 review of video based rain gauges vrgs by interpreting surveillance videos a vrg can obtain rainfall information including rainfall intensity ri and cumulative rainfall cr the implementation of a vrg can be roughly divided into two steps a identifying rain streaks pixels rain streaks the blurred pixels made by raindrops in the video wang et al 2019 a and b establishing the mapping relationship between rain pixels and ri or cr how to precisely separate the rain layer from the video and accurately identify rain pixels is the primary premise of a vrg in this section we review the development of a vrg with rain streak extraction technology as the main focus video rain removal research in the computer vision cv field has important reference value for our task kathiravelu et al 2016 wang et al 2019 a wei et al 2019 from the perspective of cv technology for rain streak identification the existing vrgs can be divided into the following categories vrgs based on the spatial and temporal properties of rain low rank and sparsity based vrgs and deep learning based vrgs 2 1 vrgs based on the spatial and temporal properties of rain the earliest vrg was designed based on a comprehensive analysis of the visual effects of rain on images videos and this vrg utilized a space time correlation model to capture the dynamics of rain garg et al 2005 2007 after rain streaks were detected based on the definition of ri in meteorology the ri was measured by observing the size and number of drops in an estimated volume of rain over time note this estimated volume refers to svor in our study sampling volume in allamano et al 2015 and depth of field in jiang et al 2019 here the svor was set to a smaller value to reduce the possibility of overlapping rain streaks for ease of discussion we refer to this kind of mapping method between rain streaks and ri as the meteorological based approach however this method fails to address heavy rain and fast moving objects that are close to the camera moreover the camera parameters and the grey threshold of rain pixels must be set manually to further improve the rain streak detection accuracy especially over the dynamic background additional temporal and spatial rain properties were introduced bossu et al 2010 utilized a gaussian mixture model gmm and geometric moments to estimate the histogram of the orientation of rain steaks and an expectation maximization algorithm was used to separate rain layers in contrast to garg s vrg garg et al 2005 2007 the authors derived a relative estimate of ri by counting the number of rain streak pixels the experimental results showed that there was a positive correlation between the number of rain streak pixels and ri for ease of discussion we refer to this mapping method between rain streaks and ri as the fitting based approach however this method was suitable for heavy rain but not for light or moderate rain and error identification problems occurred in rain free periods haurum et al 2019 further discussed this vrg bossu et al 2010 employing the same rain streak identification method proposed by garg et al 2005 2007 allamano et al 2015 presented a precision svor calculation model based on the fundamentals of camera optics here the authors believed that the svor was the volume of the focus area moreover a novel meteorological based mapping method that utilizes raindrops that are the focus of cameras to measure the ri value was proposed this vrg has received promising results with errors on the order of 25 performance however similar to garg s vrg this vrg is applicable only in ideal conditions and is unsuitable for complicated and dynamic backgrounds jiang et al 2019 furthermore judging whether rain streaks are in out of focus is also an important issue to discriminate the raindrops that are in and out of focus in the images videos the average colour tensor response and average intensity difference were used in dong s et al 2017 vrg moreover a more robust approach to identify rain streaks was proposed using grey tone functions and the direction of rain streaks after that a meteorological based model similar to garg et al 2005 2007 and allamano et al 2015 was employed to measure the ri value the measurements obtained by these models were not very accurate consequently the method was applied in limited scenarios only jiang et al 2019 2 2 low rank and sparsity based jiang et al 2019 presented a convex optimization algorithm to decompose rain streaks from surveillance videos then based on geometrical optics and photographic analyses a new accurate raindrop size calculation method was proposed in this way the accuracy of the ri calculation achieved state of the art performance however this vrg uses the alternating direction method of multipliers admm algorithm boyd et al 2011 to detect rain pixels requiring high time and hardware costs more details about this vrg can be found in section 3 1 2 3 deep learning based with the development of deep learning technology in recent years zen et al 2019 used a convolutional neural network cnn based algorithm to extract rain features from videos and employed a trained supervised neural network based regression model to interpolate the relationship between rain streaks and ri however due to the difference between the synthetic rainfall dataset and the real rainfall video wei et al 2019 the rain streak detection accuracy was greatly reduced in practical applications in addition the ri estimated accuracy of this vrg is greatly limited by the quality of the training dataset the comparison of different vrgs is shown in table 1 3 vrg from a single camera in section 3 1 we briefly introduce the camera model for the vrg then in section 3 2 we improve the rainfall estimation by refining the calculation of svor to increase the accuracy performance of this vrg and the factors that may affect the reliability of vrg results in real world applications 3 1 camera model the vrgs in our studies act on cameras that work based on the pinhole imaging principle a schematic of a pinhole imaging principle based camera is shown in fig 1 the definitions of the parameters in the following studies are shown in table 2 3 2 improved rainfall estimation to provide a clear description we divide the implementation of our improved vrg into the following three steps step 1 rain streak detection from videos the goal of rain streak detection is to estimate the number of rain pixels or clean images videos in rainy images videos this typical inverse problem is often solved by regularization methods that incorporate additional prior knowledge wang et al 2019 b after comprehensively considering the accuracy efficiency and cost our study chooses jiang s vrg 2019 as the basis of the rain streak detection algorithm from the surveillance videos in their vrg convex optimization was used to extract rain streak layers from complex videos with moving objects wind and illumination changes etc the authors jiang et al 2019 formulated an optimized model for achieving satisfactory rain streak identification results from video frames more details about this model can be found in appendix 2 step 2 raindrop size and speed calculation the rain streaks in videos represent the information on the size and speed of falling raindrops after rain streaks are detected in step 1 the size of raindrop particles corresponding to each rain streak is estimated by combining geometrical optics and photographic knowledge garg et al 2005 2007 allamano et al 2015 jiang et al 2019 referring to jiang s approach 2019 the speed of raindrops can be expressed in two ways i based on physical optics analysis the size of raindrops d in fig 1 can be inferred based on the size of the respective rain streaks h pixel and w pixel in fig 1 in the image and the object distance distances between the respective raindrops and the camera lenses then the terminal speed of raindrops can be estimated from the exposure time and the true size of the raindrops ii in the field of physics empirical formulas between raindrop diameter and terminal speed can be used to express the speed of raindrops therefore taking the speed of raindrops as a bridge the object distance of raindrops can be calculated and the size and speed of raindrops can be inferred more details on the inference procedure can be found in jiang s study 2019 step 3 rainfall intensity estimation as a common variable utilized to describe the characteristics of rainfall events in meteorology rainfall intensity is defined as the ratio of the total amount of rain rainfall depth falling during a given period to the duration of the period it is expressed in depth units per unit time usually as mm per hour mm h according to its definition the ri value can be estimated based on the size and speed of all identified rain streaks within the svor of each vrg the accuracy of svor plays an important role in ri estimation in previous studies svor has utilized different setting strategies for different purposes garg and nayar 2007 allamano et al 2015 dong et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 proposed an accurate calculation model for the theoretical svor v v the volume of the truncated rectangular pyramid between the near focus point and the far focus point in fig 1 based on geometric reasoning moreover the authors employed the gamma distribution based raindrop size distribution dsd to reduce the ri estimation error resulting from the number and size of raindrop calculation uncertainties v can be calculated by eq 1 note the definitions of the symbols in eq 1 and those that follow can be found in table 2 1 v 1 3 10 9 l f l f 2 w sensor h sensor l 2 3 l 1 3 however in practical applications the svor is usually smaller than the theoretical value calculated by eq 1 garg and nayar 2007 jiang et al 2019 due to the influence of the vrg s external and or internal parameters such as the camera height pitching angle and focal length therefore our study refines svor to improve the accuracy of the vrg according to the spatial structure models of svor as shown in fig 2 we divide the svor solution into four categories considering that the theoretical svor is a truncated rectangular pyramid we regard the svor occluded by the ground surface as a right prism in the following calculation to reduce the complexity of our algorithm in addition eq 1 can be rewritten as follows i if l l 2 tan θ h 2 2 the spatial structure of svor is shown in fig 2 a whose v can be calculated by eq 1 ii if l 2 l tan θ h 2 2 and l l 1 tan θ h 1 2 the spatial structure of svor is shown in fig 2 b whose v 1 can be calculated by eq 2 2 v 1 v 1 6 h 2 2 l 2 l tan θ l 2 1 2 l sin ψ 2 h 2 w 2 iii if l sin ψ 2 h 2 2 and l l 1 tan θ h 1 2 the spatial structure of svor is shown in fig 2 c whose v 2 can be calculated by eq 3 3 v 2 1 3 s w 1 1 6 l l 1 tan θ h 1 2 cos θ e tan θ ψ 2 e tan θ 2 ψ w 1 iv if l sin ψ 2 h 2 2 and l l 1 tan θ h 1 2 the spatial structure of svor is shown in fig 2 d whose v 3 can be calculated by eq 4 4 v 4 v w 2 3 l 2 l cos ψ 2 l 2 l tan θ h 2 w 1 3 l 1 l cos ψ 2 h 1 l 1 l tan θ where l 1 l f 2 f 2 f 2 δ l f l 2 l f 2 f 2 f 2 δ l f h 1 h sensor l f l f l 1 h 2 h sensor l f l f l 2 w 1 w sensor l f l f l 1 w 2 w sensor l f l f l 2 ψ 2 arctan h sensor 2 f and l e sin θ l e sin θ ψ 2 l e sin θ ψ 2 in summary rain streak extraction is a basic part of rainfall estimation previous studies have shown that environmental factors e g wind and moving targets significantly impair the effectiveness of rain streak detection wei et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 the calculation of svor has an important influence on the accuracy of a vrg it should be emphasized that rainfall has almost the same dsd in different svor sizes in theory nevertheless large svors can usually perceive more stable real and comprehensive rainfall information in real application scenarios the same environmental factors especially moving targets appear in different svor sizes and the interference to ri calculation results is also different as shown in fig 3 for the same rain scene with moving targets the proportion of rain streaks disturbed by the moving target in a vrg with a large svor is smaller than that in a vrg with a small svor hence a vrg with a large svor is considered more reliable than one with a small svor 4 rainfall quality control for video based rain gauges the original intention of vrg design was to obtain regional rainfall data with a high spatial and temporal resolution to service relevant hydrology research to achieve this blueprint a large number of vrg network estimation results need to be obtained and interpolated yang and ng 2017 however in this process due to the influence of interpolation propagation the inconsistent observations and outliers of the vrg network reduce the availability of regional rainfall products and have made the advancement of vrgs from theory to practical applications difficult for the above problems from the perspective of cv improving the accuracy of a single vrg in a complex environment is a direct and mainstream method but it still needs additional long term research to overcome some pain spots such as the production of real world rainfall training datasets pixel level discrimination of moving objects and cross scenario model migration wang et al 2019 a wei et al 2019 in contrast the perspective of camera collaboration is another novel strategy that is based on the constraints of the spatial and temporal information between vrgs to study the dependence between vrg observations and then correct the rainfall observations to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to apply such an idea for rainfall observations as previously mentioned the estimation accuracy of a single vrg and the consistency of rainfall data produced by the vrg network determine the application value of regional rainfall data tobler s first law of geography points out that everything is related to everything else but near things are more related to each other tobler 1970 therefore rainfall events observed by dense surveillance cameras exhibit temporal and spatial correlations taking the spatial temporal constraints between cameras as clues we vertically analyse the ri variation of a single vrg and longitudinally compare the ri differences between different vrgs and present a multi camera cooperative rainfall qc method in this section this method consists of two parts in section 4 1 we present an re model for ri values calculated by each vrg according to the raindrop imagery features based on this in section 4 2 we build a multi camera based rainfall qc model that is composed of three filters a spatial temporal consistency filter a situation consistency filter and a correlation filter suppose there are vrgs randomly distributed in the study area x definition r is the set of ri values estimated by all vrgs in the study area mm h r i is the set of ri values estimated by the i t h vrg mm h as shown in fig 4 r 1 labelled light yellow represents the set of ri values estimated by the first vrg vrg id 1 r t is the set of ri values estimated by all vrgs in the t t h sampling interval mm h as shown in fig 4 r 3 labelled by the light red zone represents the set of ri values estimated by all vrgs in the third sampling interval r i t is the ri value estimated by the i t h vrg in the t t h sampling interval mm h as shown in fig 4 r i 2 labelled by the light blue zone represents the ri value estimated by the i t h vrg vrg id i in the second sampling interval f i t t 1 is the ri increment of the i t h vrg from the t 1 t h to t t h sampling intervals mm min as shown in fig 4 f 2 t t 1 r 2 t r 2 t 1 represents the ri increment of the second vrg vrg id 2 from the t 1 t h to t t h sampling intervals and f t t 1 is the set of ri increments of all vrgs from the t 1 t h to t t h sampling intervals mm min the conversion relationship between the above variables can be expressed by eqs 5 and 6 and the relationship between the above variables is shown in fig 4 5 r r 1 r 2 r 3 r n r 1 r 2 r 3 r t r 1 1 r 1 2 r 1 3 r 1 t r 2 1 r 2 2 r 2 3 r 2 t r n 1 r n 2 r n 3 r n t 6 f t t 1 f 1 t t 1 f 2 t t 1 f i t t 1 4 1 reliability evaluation re model we analyse the reliability or uncertainty of rainfall estimation results from the perspective of the vrg implementation process which can be divided into two parts 4 1 1 rain streak detection the extraction accuracy of rain streaks from videos is constrained by the visual characteristics of raindrops and directly determines the accuracy of rainfall inversion results generally clear and realistic video imaging of rain particles is conducive to the extraction of rain streaks from videos garg et al 2005 2007 wang et al 2019 a wei et al 2019 nevertheless there are differences in the appearance of raindrops i e shape brightness and distribution in the videos filmed by different outdoor surveillance cameras leading to inconsistent accuracy even if the same rain streak extraction algorithm is employed in different types of vrgs that is in natural scenes the reliability of the rainfall inversion results varies based on different vrgs the visual characteristics of raindrops are influenced by many factors which can be roughly divided into three categories internal camera parameters i e focal length depth of field image resolution garg et al 2004 2005 external camera parameters i e camera erection height pitching angle and complex changes in video scenarios i e the appearance of moving targets lighting conditions wang et al 2019 a in contrast a vrg with a large focal length and a high image resolution is helpful for the depiction of rain particles in a natural scene from rain streak videos inevitably providing an important and advantageous alternative for the recognition of rain streaks and vice versa therefore we regard the focal length and image resolution of a vrg as two important indexes to measure the reliability of rain streak detection results 4 1 2 ri calculation determining whether the svor matches the extracted rain streaks is crucial for the ri estimation accuracy in section 3 2 we propose an accurate svor calculation model and analyse the influence of svor size on ri estimation reliability that is a large svor can improve the ability of a vrg to cope with the interference of external environmental factors moving objects and obtain more reliable rainfall information open and natural rainfall scenes are an ideal location for vrg deployment however with the development of urbanization the number of high rise buildings in urban areas is increasing the phenomenon of rain particles breaking after hitting buildings or trees or falling again after being collected by buildings or leaves leads to changes in their physical properties near the ground for example lee 1978 points out that leaves have a significant effect on the shape and speed of raindrops which is not conducive to the collection of real rainfall information by a vrg from a massive observation study we found that a high camera usually has a large rain perception space to sense complete rainfall information over a wide range at the same time a high camera can effectively reduce the possibility of the video scene being blocked by trees buildings etc or the interference from moving objects to obtain a real and stable rainfall video therefore the size of the svor and the height of the vrg greatly influence the reliability of the ri estimation results by a vrg in real world applications in summary it can be concluded that the reliability of the ri inversion value of a single vrg is affected by many factors among which the focus length image resolution svor size and vrg height have relatively large impacts on the rainfall perception ability the reliability of the i t h vrg can be expressed by eq 7 7 reliabilit y i w q w 1 q 1 w 2 q 2 w 3 q 3 w 4 q 4 where q 1 q 2 q 3 and q 4 represent the focal length image resolution svor size and height of the i t h vrg respectively w 1 w 2 w 3 and w 4 are the equilibrium coefficients based on eq 7 we present an re model algorithm for the ri values calculated by each vrg the re algorithm takes the focal length definition and erection height of each vrg as the inputs and divides all vrgs in the study area into two categories high reliability and low reliability which are represented by sets c h and c l respectively the pseudocode of the re algorithm is shown in appendix 3 moreover according to the evaluation results of the re algorithm we use eq 8 to correct the estimated ri of each vrg 8 r i w r r i w 1 r r i vr g i c h w 2 r r i vr g i c l i 1 2 n where w r is the ri correction weight of vrgs of different reliability levels 4 2 quality control model some existing studies have shown that many environmental variables such as rainfall can be considered spatially random variables oliver et al 2014 canli et al 2018 additionally according to tobler s first law of geography this study considers rainfall within a certain small spatial scope with low spatial variability which has homogeneity consistency and correlation canli et al 2018 we apply this law to the expression of rainfall which can be described as the rainfall estimates of multiple vrgs within a certain spatial scope having the characteristics of spatial temporal consistency situation consistency and cross correlation note that some existing research has reported that hydrological applications for urban catchments of the order of 1000 ha require a temporal resolution of approximately 5 min and a spatial resolution of approximately 3 km urban catchments on the order of 100 ha require resolutions of approximately 3 min and 2 km berne et al 2004 lorenz and kunstmann 2012 ahm et al 2013 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 therefore we suggest setting the spatial scope to smaller than 2 km by 2 km without loss of generality we set the study area x 2 k m 2 k m considering that the ri outliers have great interference with the interpolated regional rainfall yang and ng 2017 canli et al 2018 the detection of outliers becomes the core of inconsistency detection within the spatial scope three filters are constructed where the spatial temporal consistency filter and the situation consistency filter are coarse grained and the correlation filter is fine grained thus forming an automated multi grained ri outlier check the structure of the qc model is shown in fig 5 4 2 1 spatial temporal consistency filter although the ri values within x are different they are still correlated that is the judgement of rainfall events by multiple vrgs at the same time is consistent f i l t e r 1 is used to represent the spatial temporal consistency filter referring to the knowledge of meteorology f i l t e r 1 first removes the elements with ri 0 mm h and those greater than the historical peak of ri r threshold mm h obtained from available meteorological research then the boxplot method li et al 2016 is used to eliminate the ri outliers at the same time to ensure the spatial temporal consistency of the ri inversion values the pseudocode of the spatial temporal consistency filter algorithm is shown in appendix 4 suppose r t is the set of ri values estimated by all vrgs in the t t h sampling interval after the ri values of all vrgs are corrected by eq 8 r t can be updated to r t as shown in eq 9 9 r t f i l t e r 1 r t from eq 9 we can find that r i t within r t is smaller than r threshold assuming k is the length of r t it can be inferred that lim i k min r i t 0 and lim i k max r i t r threshold the spatial temporal consistency filter is the primary operation of the qc model because of its ability to determine the temporal and spatial range of rainfall in practical applications which provides a premise for subsequent models 4 2 2 situation consistency filter based on spatial temporal consistency we can infer that without the interference of external environmental factors although different vrgs have different ri estimation accuracies section 4 1 their perceptions of changes in rainfall should be consistent that is as rainfall increases or decreases in the real world the estimated ri value of each vrg in the study area should also increase or decrease to a certain extent hence the simulation of rainfall has the characteristic of consistency which can be regarded as another indicator of the vrg quality filter combined with eq 9 the ri change vector of each vrg can be calculated by eq 10 from eq 10 we know that f i t t 1 r i t f j t t 1 r j t in theory f i l t e r 2 is used to represent the situation consistency filter f i l t e r 2 employs eq 11 to determine the degree of each vrg s estimated ri at the current moment and uses the quantile method to filter f t t 1 eq 12 selects the second and third quartiles of f t t 1 after that r t can be updated to r t by eq 13 if r i t 1 is invalid the previous valid observation in r i is used for the calculation of eq 10 10 f i t t 1 r i t r i t 1 t r threshold t r i t r t 11 f t t 1 f 1 t t 1 r 1 t f 2 t t 1 r 2 t f i t t 1 r i t 12 f t t 1 q u a n t i l e f t t 1 2 4 q u a n t i l e f t t 1 3 4 13 r t f i l t e r 2 r t e i t r i t r i t r t e i t 0 f i t t 1 f t t 1 1 f i t t 1 f t t 1 4 2 3 correlation filter f i l t e r 1 and f i l t e r 2 can be regarded as coarse grained ri outlier elimination checks under the premise of the spatial consistency of regional rainfall in the real world regional rainfall also has the characteristics of spatially continuous changes therefore the measurements of vrgs within x are consecutive cross correlated and mutually supportive however this supportability is destroyed by the outliers f i l t e r 3 is used to represent the correlation filter based on the theory of information fusion and fuzzy mathematics f i l t e r 3 represents a correlation calculation model and reliability measurement model to conduct a fine granularity check of the ri outliers since the measurement noise is mainly caused by independent factors such as sensor internal noise and environmental interference the ri estimation noise of each vrg can be regarded as independent white noise for this study the pseudocode of the correlation filter is shown in appendix 5 5 experiments and analysis 5 1 experimental data the experimental site is located in nanjing city jiangsu province china which belongs to a sub tropical monsoon climate zone with abundant rainfall and hot conditions in the same season in early summer june to mid july affected by the frontal rain band nanjing enters the meiyu period when rainfall increases significantly and heavy or violent rainfall events occur frequently which provides advantages for rainfall observations in our study on 11 15 17 and 19 july 2020 four long term rainfall events occurred in the study area including a variety of rainfall types from light rain to heavy rain and these rainfall data were typical and representative for our research as shown in table 3 the ri grade rainfall duration and vrgs used for the observation of each rainfall event are listed for more information about the vrg id please see appendix 6 as shown in fig 6 we selected a site with an area of approximately 11 ha 350 m 320 m which is smaller than the recommended minimum spatial resolution 2 km for the qc model the study area is considered to meet the prerequisite for the model to run effectively then 12 cameras are deployed as vrgs for rainfall observation and the reading from a high precision electronic rain gauge zjc v zhejiang hengda instrument metre co ltd as shown in fig 6 is regarded as the verification data an electronic rain gauge is a kind of siphon rain gauge capable of reporting rainfall information every 0 1 mm of cumulative rainfall or every minute it has the highest accuracy of 0 01 mm h of ri estimation the rain gauge transmits back readings every 0 1 mm in heavy and violent rain scenarios and every minute in light and moderate rain to obtain relatively accurate rainfall information during the rainfall events in the experiments there was fewer breezes that appeared with a short duration therefore it can be concluded that readings from electronic rain gauges are less affected by wind and have high confidence the types of cameras widely used in city surveillance systems are selected to make the experimental results more suitable for practical applications for camera parameters see appendix 6 the relative error of ri is used as the evaluation standard which can be calculated by eq 14 14 r e r r i k r i k r k r k where r e r r i k is the relative error of the k t h observation of the i t h vrg r k is the k t h ri reading of the electronic rain gauge and r i k is the k t h ri value estimated by the i t h vrg to reduce the uncertainty of the vrg readings the average ri value within the sampling interval is regarded as an effective estimation we set the sampling interval to 30 s in the following parts 5 2 evaluation of the improvement in svor in this section we evaluate the effectiveness of the svor improvement in section 3 2 through experiments according to eqs 2 3 and 4 vrg with ids of a2 a3 and 2 correspond to the monitoring scenes in b c and d in fig 2 respectively rainfall events 1 2 and 3 in table 3 were selected to compare the ri accuracy estimated by different vrgs before and after svor correction and the results are shown in fig 7 the box plot in fig 7 is described as follows quartiles q 1 25th percentile q 3 75th percentile median 50th percentile interquartile range iqr iqr q 3 q 1 and outliers 1 5 i q r for a single vrg rain streak extraction is solved in the admm framework the parameter settings of the rain streak extraction model optimization jiang et al 2019 are shown in table 2 1 in appendix 2 for a more detailed introduction to the parameter settings please see jiang et al 2019 and wang et al 2019 as shown in fig 7 the average relative errors dotted line in fig 7 calculated by a theoretical svor are 0 24334 vrg a2 0 3539 vrg a3 and 0 38254 vrg 2 and these values become 0 21295 vrg a2 0 29807 vrg a3 and 0 29068 vrg 2 when using the improved svor in contrast the improved svor can reduce the average relative error by 12 489 vrg a2 15 776 vrg a3 and 24 013 vrg 2 additionally the accuracy improvement in vrg 2 is greater than that of vrg a2 and a3 which indicates that the larger the svor correction value is the more obvious the improvement in the ri estimation accuracy in summary the svor correction strategy is conducive to the improvement in the ri estimation accuracy hence in the remaining experiments the improved svor is applied to all vrgs for ri estimation 5 3 evaluation of the vrg accuracy in this section we compare the accuracy of vrgs constructed by the three most common cameras in practical applications vrg a1 f 8 m m vrg a2 f 6 m m and vrg a3 f 4 m m additional camera parameters are provided in appendix 6 as discussed in section 4 1 the accuracy of a vrg is affected by internal camera parameters external parameters and environmental factors among them environmental factors are the most difficult to evaluate quantitatively to minimize the interference of environmental factors on the ri calculation of vrgs we try to make these three vrgs have the same surveillance scenarios as shown in fig 8 the rainfall information of rainfall events 1 2 3 and 4 collected by each selected vrg is shown in fig 9 it should be noted that for visualization purposes not all ri estimates are shown in fig 9 the distribution of the relative error of ri calculated by each vrg in these rainfall events is shown in fig 10 fig 9 and fig 10 show the following 1 in general the cr calculated by vrgs is lower than that calculated by an electronic rain gauge fig 9 shows that the relative errors of the ri calculated by vrgs a1 a2 and a3 are concentrated at 8 to 33 13 to 44 and 28 to 47 respectively therefore in terms of the accuracy of the cr calculation vrg a1 vrg a2 vrg a3 2 fig 10 shows that approximately 83 of the relative error of the ri calculated by vrg a1 is between 0 3 and 0 1 approximately 63 of the relative error of ri calculated by vrg a2 is between 0 3 and 0 1 and approximately 89 of the relative error of ri calculated by vrg a3 is between 0 5 and 0 3 combined with the camera parameters it can be considered that a vrg with a large focal length and high image resolution always achieves a high cr calculation accuracy the main reason for this result is that a high quality vrg has a strong ability to depict and distinguish raindrops and helps extract rain streaks as shown in fig 11 compared with vrg a3 the rain images videos taken by vrg a1 and vrg a2 can clearly depict rain streaks making them conducive to rain streak extraction this conclusion echoes the principle of the re model in section 4 1 3 for rainfall scenarios the combination of fig 9 a and c reveals that the average error of the cr from vrgs during moderate and light rainfall events is approximately 8 22 to 25 37 and the cr curves fluctuate relatively smoothly however combined with fig 9 b and d the average error of the cr from vrgs during heavy and violent rainfall events is approximately 28 57 to 42 85 and the cr curves fluctuate greatly it can be considered that the accuracy and stability of the cr calculated from vrgs during light and moderate rainfall events rainfall events 1 and 3 perform better than those during heavy and violent rainfall events rainfall events 2 and 4 the possible reasons include the following in heavy and violent rain scenarios with the increase in rainfall duration the phenomena of rain and fog appear and the rain streaks seriously overlap in the video leading to a reduction in video definition and visible rain streaks as shown in fig 12 the mist fog effect formed by rain streak accumulation is a difficult area not only in the study of rain removal in the cv field but also in rain streak detection in the vrg design 4 there are some ri estimations that are obviously larger than the corresponding validation data in fig 9 these can be regarded as ri outliers by comparing and analysing the surveillance video we find that almost all videos corresponding to ri outliers have moving objects as shown in fig 13 we take the rain streak extraction results of rainfall event 2 from 09 10 23 to 09 10 30 as an example fig 13 shows that the edge or part of the content of the moving target is often misjudged as a rain streak when it appears resulting in the high ri estimation how to alleviate the reduction in the rain streak detection accuracy caused by moving objects is a classic topic in vrg design and video image rainfall removal in the cv field from the perspective of cv technology solving the above problems is currently a mainstream topic and for vrgs modifying the rainfall information observed by vrgs is an alternative topic from the perspective of camera cooperation 5 4 evaluation of the effectiveness of the qc model this section selects rainfall events 1 4 and 5 as observation objects to verify the effectiveness of our proposed qc model before that we need to calibrate the parameters in the qc model the analysis in section 3 2 indicates that cameras with different parameter settings impact the reliability of the ri inversion results the experiments in sections 5 2 and 5 3 confirm the above analysis that there are differences in the reliability of the ri results retrieved by cameras with different parameters fig 7 and fig 10 show that the relative error of the ri inversion results of the vrgs with low quality vrg id 2 and a3 has a larger error distribution and are less robust than those of vrgs with high quality vrg id a1 and a2 to improve the reliability of the qc model inputs and reduce the interference of ri outliers on the stability of the filtering results we have narrowed the distribution of the ri values calculated by low quality vrgs and manually set w 1 to 0 9 on the other hand the existing research jiang et al 2019 and many experimental results in our study show that the ri value estimated by vrgs is generally lower than the verification data therefore we manually improve the ri estimations of high quality vrgs and set w 2 to 1 1 the above operation can increase the probability that the ri estimates fed into the qc model have high accuracy while not affecting the consistency filter in the qc model interference with the other two filters occurs in very few cases e g very few storm scenarios where the ri estimations are higher than the historical peak of the ri value r threshold after multiplying by w 2 moreover based on the research results on the characteristics of meiyu period chen et al 2013 mei et al 2020 and considering that the ri estimation by a vrg is generally low r threshold in the spatial temporal filter is set as 0 4 mm min 5 4 1 results and analysis we record the rainfall data cr and ri obtained by the vrg network and processed by the qc model as observation results and the qc model calculation results respectively fig 14 shows the relative error of ri estimated by each vrg before and after using the qc model note that for visualization purposes each comparison of the estimates from vrgs and the readings from rain gauge during the rainfall event is considered one observation therefore figures in this section employ the observation sequence instead of the duration time of rainfall as the horizontal coordinate fig 14 indicates that our qc method is effective in reducing the outliers of the relative error of ri in all three rainfall events in addition the most significant improvement is achieved in the rainfall event on 17 07 2020 to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of the qc model in fig 15 the boxplot was used to show distribution of the relative error of ri before and after using the qc model the parameters of the box plot in fig 15 are set as in fig 7 moreover the distribution characteristics of the relative error of ri are shown in table 4 through the experimental results we find the following 1 fig 15 illustrates that the distribution range relative error of ri is significantly narrower and the number of ri outliers is significantly reduced after using the qc model table 4 shows that the standard deviation of the relative error of ri reduced by our method is approximately 10 83 29 31 and 21 05 in rainfall events 1 4 and 5 respectively even in different rainfall scenarios the statistical indicators of the relative error of ri can be improved to varying degrees in terms of the mean value standard deviation maximum value and minimum value we can conclude that our qc model can effectively detect ri estimation outliers narrow the distribution range of the relative error of ri and improve the consistency and stability of rainfall observations by vrgs 2 combined with fig 14 the ri filtering results are dynamically composed of the ri values estimated by high quality and low quality vrgs among them the proportion of high quality vrgs is larger than that of low quality vrgs consistent with the re modelling principle that the ri calculated by high quality vrgs has high reliability the advantage of using low quality vrg observations for calculations is that the spatial density of rainfall observations can be effectively guaranteed at the same time these data provide abundant spatial and temporal information between vrgs for the qc model furthermore we evaluate the effectiveness of the qc model in the production of surface rainfall data as follows i first considering that our study area is relatively small and that rain gauges vrgs are dense we use the arithmetic mean method to estimate the surface rainfall information of the study area lee et al 2018 therefore the average value of rainfall information cr and ri obtained by the vrg network both before and after qc model calculation is regarded as the surface rainfall data of the study area ii second it can be seen from section 4 2 that the premise of the validity of the qc model is that the rainfall in the study area is consistent therefore we regard the readings of electric rain gauges as the verification value the result of subtracting the estimated value of the vrg network from the verification value is used to evaluate the accuracy of the surface rainfall information and the results are shown in fig 16 fig 16 shows that our method can effectively improve the estimation accuracy of surface rainfall information moreover the qc model is more effective in heavy and violent scenarios fig 16 b and c there are differences in the effectiveness of our method in various rainfall scenarios that is the ri correction effect is most obvious in heavy and violent rainfall scenarios this result is mainly because the ri estimation accuracy of vrgs is generally higher in light and moderate rain than in heavy and violent rain this also offers good evidence that our method is highly suitable for the correction of vrg observations in heavy and violent rainfall events 5 5 discussion high quality regional rainfall data are one of the foundations of meteorological and other related research the estimation quality of regional rainfall on the one hand depends on the availability of data i e gauge network density spatial resolution data and other information on the other hand the quality depends on the interpolation technique yang and ng 2017 for our research as shown in fig 17 the sub area can be set up in a buffer or grid manner considering the amount of computation we prioritize the grid method as shown in fig 17 after the study area has been divided by the grid the spatial temporal consistency filter can be applied to determine the spatial range of the rainfall event based on the vrgs of each sub grid then after the qc model is employed to correct the vrg observations in each grid two kinds of data can be used as inputs of the regional rainfall interpolation model i the corrected vrg observations for the whole rainfall area and ii the surface rainfall information of each sub grid similar to section 5 4 1 in this way the regional rainfall information cr and ri can be obtained our proposed qc model can effectively filter out a large number of outlier values without losing vrg density while improving the availability of the observations moreover the experimental results in section 5 4 1 also show the effectiveness of our method in the surface rainfall calculation therefore the qc model is effective for high quality regional rainfall calculations through either of the above methods generally heavy and violent rainfall has a great impact on urban flooding disasters while a single vrg has low accuracy and poor stability in such scenarios our proposed method model can effectively alleviate the abovementioned problems and provide useful support for urban hydrological simulations 6 conclusion rainfall estimation based on an urban surveillance camera network can provide support for high resolution rainfall estimation on the basis of existing surveillance resources nevertheless solving the problem of the inconsistent quality of observations by multiple cameras has become a key issue in the production of high precision regional rainfall data first we rely on the camera parameters to refine the svor calculation to improve the rainfall observation accuracy of each vrg second a multi vrg collaborative rainfall qc model that relies on the temporal and spatial relationship between vrgs to construct an re model and three automatic quality filters to realize the self correction of rainfall estimation is proposed the experimental results show that our method can effectively improve the accuracy of a single vrg effectively eliminate the ri outliers and improve the reliability and stability of rainfall estimation results by vrg networks especially within heavy and violent rainfall scenarios our research is an important complement and enrichment to the current ground based rainfall sensing methods which is very useful for urban flooding monitoring and early warning relevant applications in the future we will further quantitatively evaluate the interference of environmental factors on the accuracy of rain streak extraction and ri estimation results to build a scientific index system for vrg reliability measurements it is worth mentioning that the qc model is still valid when the cameras in the vrg network are the same in which case the effectiveness of the re algorithm is reduced based on the present re model evaluating the reliability of rainfall estimation based on the difference of surveillance scenarios is another option worth trying therefore a more accurate calibration scheme of some parameters i e w 1 and w 2 in eq 8 in the qc model will also be considered to make the model more reasonable credit authorship contribution statement xing wang

is introduced as follows 4 3 d ij t 2 r i t r j t p i r r i t d r d ji t 2 r j t r i t p j r r i t d r where d ij t is the confidence distance measured from r i t to r j t which can be solved by the

correlated and r i t is supported by r j t if ϕ ij ϕ ji 1 r i t and r j t have a strong correlation and support each other for our study if r i t is supported by most r j t values usually more than k 2 it is retained otherwise it is deleted from r t however the empirical setting of β ij may lead to the problem that the judgement is greatly influenced by subjective factors in this study we improve the above problem based on fuzzy mathematics first according to the definition of the correlation function in fuzzy theory we can make 4 7 g ij t log 1 2 1 d ij t 1 i j 1 2 k then the dependency

3771,with the ongoing rapid urbanization across the globe its interference with groundwater resources is critical to freshwater sustainability the groundwater transit time distribution ttd lumps the flow and transport processes of a regional groundwater system and therefore characterizes the aquifer s resilience to nonpoint source contamination however the influence of large scale urban areas on the regional groundwater ttd is not clear this study proposed a novel analytical model for groundwater ttds accounting for the effects of impervious urban structures after the verification against results from particle tracking we apply this analytical expression to investigate how the position and spatial extent of the urban area change the ttds from the pre urban ones the sensitivity analysis suggests that urban areas tend to increase both the mean and the variance of groundwater transit times moreover modeling results highlight the importance of the spatial relationship between the urban area and the aquifer in determining the urban groundwater ttds for aquifers intersected by a local urban area mean transit time mtt is dominated by the horizontal extent of the urban area i e the impervious area whereas for aquifers intersected by a regional urban area mtt is strongly controlled by the vertical extent of the urban area in addition to its horizontal size being computationally efficient the proposed analytical model can aid decision making in urban freshwater resources management and urban planning keywords transit time distribution analytical solution urbanization aquifer 1 introduction rapid urbanization threatens the safety and sustainability of freshwater resources especially in developing countries in 2014 around 3 9 billion people lived in cities and this number is expected to rise to two thirds of the global population in 2050 connor 2015 urbanization and the improvement of living standards lead to an increasing demand for water in cities connor 2015 besides rapid urbanization modifies the water cycle in several ways cities extract substantial amounts of water from streams and groundwater and challenge the sustainability of regional water resources larsen et al 2016 ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021 besides urbanization also extends the area of impervious surface and prevents groundwater recharge therefore causing higher flood risks golian et al 2020 vázquez suñé et al 2005 finally urbanization may threaten the downstream surface water body by discharging pollutants from cities in this context urban aquifers play a critical part in sustaining the urban water supply and must be integrated into the strategies of water resources management on one hand the expansion of impervious areas may reduce groundwater recharge and further reduce baseflows although the actual baseflow in urban watersheds can be increased by anthropogenic influences bonneau et al 2018 lerner 2002 ostad ali askari et al 2019 vázquez suñé et al 2010 on the other hand modern construction technologies tend to extend not only the area but also the depth of the urban impact region which typically cuts the aquifer and alters the local and regional groundwater flow field attard et al 2017 font capo et al 2015 ostad ali askari et al 2020 pujades et al 2012 previous works have investigated the influence of urbanization on groundwater quantity and flux related aspects attard et al 2016b underground structures intersecting the confined aquifer may exert a barrier effect on groundwater heads which can be expressed as the increase in head difference across the underground structure after the construction pujades et al 2012 pujades et al 2016 this barrier effect may cause many environmental problems such as ground settlements xu et al 2019 and contaminants mobilization font capo et al 2015 jurado et al 2012 in addition some studies have focused on the modification in water budget partitioning and baseflow generation bhaskar et al 2016 bonneau et al 2017 hamel and fletcher 2014 janke et al 2014 schwartz and smith 2014 despite these works few have focused on the modification in water transit times in urban aquifers for a local regional groundwater system the transit travel time is defined as the time spent by a water parcel from its entrance as recharge till its discharge into the surface water body i e streams lakes or seas the transit travel time distribution ttd is the distribution of transit times and it provides a lumped description of the transport and mixing processes in a regional aquifer system groundwater ttds have important implications for the interpretation of tracer data benettin et al 2015 kuppel et al 2020 małoszewski and zuber 1982 stewart et al 2010 zuber 1986 biogeochemical processes van der velde et al 2010 groundwater vulnerability to nonpoint source contamination basu et al 2012 jing et al 2019 kumar et al 2020 ostad ali askar et al 2018 and groundwater response to external changes including climate change engdahl and maxwell 2015 havril et al 2018 jing et al 2020 the mean transit time mtt of groundwater in an aquifer system ranges typically from years to decades which is highly relevant to the lag in streamwater response to nonpoint source pollutants the climate forcing topography geometry and hydraulic properties of aquifers cause ttds to present unique shapes that reflect the transport and mixing processes within the aquifer abrams and haitjema 2018 jing et al 2019 leray et al 2016 talebmorad et al 2021 many analytical solutions have been reported for catchments or aquifers among which the exponential model is one of the most popular models eriksson 1958 haitjema 1995 luo and cirpka 2008 małoszewski and zuber 1982 analytical models bridge the gap between observations and the systems intrinsic properties which helps to understand why the real world aquifer systems deviate from the reference ones leray et al 2016 unfortunately most analytical models about groundwater ttds assume natural conditions with few considering the disturbance of urbanization on their shape and breadth despite some previous studies that have employed the tracer data to infer the transit times in urban catchments and aquifers these tracer based studies often apply presumed lumped parameter models that typically fit the natural aquifers rather than urban aquifers hrachowitz and clark 2017 kuhlemann et al 2020 mccance et al 2018 soulsby et al 2015 moreover presuming simple travel time models without considering the impact of impervious urban zones may bias the interpretation of tracer data and cause unrealistic results jing et al 2019 mccallum et al 2015 with the development of modern construction techniques such as the cut and cover method the urban structure often intersects with the water table and obstructs the natural groundwater flow which could also strongly regulate the transport process and the transit times attard et al 2016a font capo et al 2015 consequently it is useful to derive explicit expressions for groundwater ttds in urban aquifers accounting for the influence of such impervious urban structures in this paper we aim to quantify the influence of impervious urban construction on the shape and breadth of groundwater ttds by deriving novel analytical solutions to the best of our knowledge this paper is the first ever attempt to explicitly account for the composite effect of imperviousness and deep underground structures on groundwater ttds specifically we expect to answer the following scientific questions 1 sps refid e1 how does the impervious urban area affect the regional scale groundwater ttds 2 sps refid e2 what is the most important factor that causes the deviation of groundwater transit times from the pre urban ones 3 sps refid e3 how can we take adaptive strategies to reduce environmental risks caused by the modification in groundwater transit times to answer these questions we start by deriving novel analytical solutions for an idealized aquifer intersected by an urban sealing area we then verify the analytical solutions by comparing them with numerical simulations and conduct a comprehensive parametric study under different scenarios considering a range of parameters of analytical expressions finally we discuss the results and their implications for urban water resources management and urban planning 2 model and methods 2 1 problem description this study focuses on the saturated groundwater system in an unconfined aquifer intersected by an impervious urban area compared to deep confined aquifers shallow unconfined aquifers are more vulnerable to urban constructions and typically interact more actively with surface water which is of great concern from an environmental perspective the geometry and boundary conditions bcs of real world watersheds are typically very complex which hinders the derivation of analytical solutions fig 1 a for the sake of simplification we consider an idealized rectangular aquifer bounded by an upgradient natural groundwater divide and a downgradient water body fig 1b and c the upgradient and downgradient boundaries are assigned with a no flux bc and a fixed head bc respectively this aquifer is embedded in an aquitard and therefore the lateral boundaries are also impervious the discharge zone is at the downstream limit which is normally a body of impounded surface water such as a river a lake or a sea the groundwater flow is at steady state meaning that the outflow equals the total amount of recharge we only consider the groundwater flow in the saturated zone which is assumed to be purely advective the groundwater flow is horizontal based on the dupuit forchheimer assumption dupuit 1863 forchheimer 1886 this can be justified since the thickness of the saturated aquifer is typically small relative to its horizontal length and the vertical component of flow velocity is neglectable relative to the horizontal one therefore the groundwater head and velocity do not change with depth the upper surface of the unconfined aquifer receives a uniform diffuse recharge r lt 1 except for the impervious urban area fig 1b and c an impervious urban area seals the ground and prevents infiltration and therefore no recharge occurs in this area this is an idealized case because in reality leakages from water mains or sewage systems often significantly recharge groundwater vázquez suñé et al 2005 horizontally the urban area is rectangular with a length of 2 w a at the flow direction a a in fig 1 and a length of 2 w b perpendicular to the flow direction b b in fig 1 the bottom of the urban structure can be either higher or lower than the water table under natural conditions depending on the spatial extent of urban areas interacting with groundwater flows we categorize them into local urban areas and regional urban areas in cases that the urban structure is above the natural water table it is defined as a local urban area fig 1b the local urban area does not confine the aquifer section since the phreatic surface exists alongside the local urban area this urban scenario is named urban scenario i if the urban structure is deep enough to intersect with the water table and large enough to fully penetrate the horizontal boundaries of the aquifer it is defined as a regional urban area fig 1c and this scenario is named urban scenario ii in this scenario the urban structure partially confines the aquifer fig 1c because this study aims to unveil the alteration of urban construction on regional groundwater ttds we first introduce the analytical solution for the pre urban scenario and then derive the analytical solutions for the urban scenarios 2 2 solutions in the pre urban scenario we consider a 2 d cross sectional model for the derivation of analytical solutions in the pre urban scenario fig 2 a the water table h against distance x at this cross section can be expressed using the dupuit forchheimer ellipse dupuit 1863 1 h x r k l 2 x 2 h l 2 where l is the length of the aquifer l r is the recharge rate lt 1 k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 and h l is the fixed head at the downstream boundary given that the groundwater mounding is small to moderate the groundwater ttds can be modeled as an exponential function haitjema 1995 leray et al 2016 raats 1977 2 ρ a 1 τ p exp 1 τ p where τ p is the mtt which is controlled by the system s properties 3 τ p θ h r where θ is the effective porosity of aquifer h is the mean saturated thickness l and r is the recharge rate lt 1 the mean saturated thickness for the unconfined aquifer h is expressed by eq a1 in appendix a 2 3 solutions in the urban scenarios in the urban scenario the urban area divides the a a cross section of the unconfined aquifer into three compartments the upgradient zone the urban area and the downgradient zone fig 2 the upgradient and downgradient zones have a recharge rate of r whereas the urban area has a reduced recharge rate r c fig 2b which is calculated by 4 r c 1 2 w b r where w b w b w w b is half of the length of the urban area perpendicular to the flow direction l and w is the aquifer length perpendicular to the flow direction l fig 1b given that the groundwater flow is purely advective the groundwater ttd can be expressed by the flux weighted average of three sub systems leray et al 2016 5 ρ t a i 0 2 λ i ρ i a where λ i is the weight of the recharge in the i th sub system and ρ i a is the ttd in the i th sub system in the following subsections we derive the explicit expressions of groundwater ttds in unconfined aquifers intersected by a local urban area urban scenario i and by a regional urban area urban scenario ii respectively 2 3 1 urban scenario i aquifer intersected by a local urban area this subsection provides the explicit expressions of groundwater ttds for three sub systems in urban scenario i in the downgradient zone the aquifer is recharged by the diffuse recharge on the upper boundary besides it is also recharged by the upgradient section of the aquifer the total inflow for the downgradient zone q in can be expressed as 6 q in ζ r l l w a 4 w a w b ζ where ζ is the distance to the downgradient end of the urban area l and l is the distance from the center of the urban area to the downgradient boundary l fig 2b the fluid velocity v ζ is only dependent on the horizontal position ζ and it can be expressed as 7 v ζ r l l w a 4 w a w b ζ θ h ζ because the mounding of the water table is small compared to the length of the aquifer the mean thickness of the downgradient saturated aquifer h d can be used to approximate h ζ h ζ h d and h d can be calculated using eq a2 in appendix a the transit time of water parcel recharged at the position ζ can be determined through integrating the inverse of v ζ 8 a ζ ζ l w a r l l w a 4 w a w b ζ θ h d 1 d ζ τ d ln l 4 w a w b l l w a 4 w a w b ζ where τ d is expressed as 9 τ d θ h d r then the inverse function of a ζ ζ a is expressed as 10 ζ a l 4 w a w b exp a τ d l l w a 4 w a w b a a 0 where 11 a 0 τ d ln l 4 w a w b l l w a 4 w a w b eq 10 describes the relationship between the recharge position and its corresponding transit time hence the outflux with an age inferior or equal to a q out a can be expressed as 12 q out a r l w a ζ a the cumulative ttd for water parcels recharged from the downgradient zone p d a equals to the mass fraction of outflux with a transit time inferior or equal to a etcheverry and perrochet 2000 13 p d a q out a q out where q out is the total outflux l2t 1 the probability density function pdf of ttd for downgradient recharge ρ 0 a is then expressed as 14 ρ 0 a d p d a da 1 q out d q out a da combining eqs 10 12 and 14 the ttd of water parcels recharged from the downgradient zone can be expressed as 15 ρ 0 a l 4 w a w b τ d l w a exp a τ d a a 0 0 a a 0 the mtt for water mass recharged from the downgradient zone τ 0 is determined by 16 τ 0 1 l l w a 4 w a w b l w a ln l l w a 4 w a w b l 4 w a w b τ d in the urban area the recharge rate is reduced by the impervious urban area as shown in eq 4 the derivation of ttds for water parcels recharged in this zone is similar to that in the downgradient zone except for the fact that it experiences a lag to reach the discharge area małoszewski and zuber 1982 the ttd for water recharged from the urban area ρ 1 a is expressed as 17 ρ 1 a l l w a 4 w a w b 2 w a τ c 1 2 w b exp a a 0 τ c a 0 a a 1 where a 0 is determined using eq 11 and 18 τ c θ 0 h c r 1 2 w b 19 a 1 a

urban area τ 1 is given by 21 τ 1 1 l l w a 2 w a 1 2 w b ln l l w a l l w a 4 w a w b τ c a 0 the derivation of groundwater ttd for the upgradient zone is similar to that in the urban area which means it also has an exponential form with a shift a 1 22 ρ 2 a 0 a a 1 1 τ u a a 1 τ u a a 1 where 23 τ u θ h u r the mean saturated thickness for the upgradient zone h u is expressed by eq a4 in appendix a similarly the mtt for water parcels recharged from the upgradient zone τ 2 is expressed as 24 τ 2 τ u a 1 having derived individual ttds for three independent sub systems we can now assemble them to estimate the overall ttd the groundwater ttds for the whole aquifer ρ t a can be simply expressed as a mass weighted average of three individual ttds 25 ρ t a 1 τ d exp a τ d a a 0 l

parameters 26 a a τ p τ τ τ p l l l w a w a l d d h l where d is the depth of the urban area below the downstream fixed head l with these dimensionless parameters eq 25 can be transformed into the following dimensionless form 27 ρ t a 1 τ d exp τ p a τ d a a 0 1 l w a 4 w a w b τ c 1 4 w a w b exp τ p a a 0 τ c a 0 a a 1 1 l w a τ u 1 4 w a w b exp τ p a a 1 τ u a a 1 similarly the mtt for the whole aquifer can also be expressed by calculating the mass weighted average of three individual mtts 28 τ 1 τ p l w a 1 4 w a w b τ 0 2 w a 4 w a w b 1 4 w a w b τ 1 1 l w a 1 4 w a w b τ 2 where τ 0 τ 1 and τ 2 can be determined using eq 16 eq 21 and eq 24 respectively 2 3 2 urban scenario ii aquifer intersected by a regional urban area unlike the above scenario of a local urban area the scenario of a regional urban area is defined such that it fully penetrates the horizontal boundaries of the aquifer hence w b is a constant of 0 5 rather than a variable since the bottom of the urban area is beneath the water table the aquifer section beneath the regional urban area is essentially confined the derivation of the analytical solution for urban scenario ii is similar to that for urban scenario i except for the fact that 1 sps refid e1 the groundwater recharge in the urban area is completely suppressed by the impervious urban area and 2 sps refid e2 no phreatic surface of groundwater exists in the urban area accordingly the dimensionless form of groundwater ttds for urban scenario ii is expressed as 29 ρ t a 1 τ d exp τ p a τ d a a 0 0 a 0 a a 1 1 l w a τ u 1 2 w a exp τ p a a 1 τ u a a 1 where τ p τ d and τ u can be determined using eq 3 eq 9 and eq 23 30 a 0 τ d τ p ln 1 2 w a 1 l w a 31 a 1 a 0 δ a 1 δ a 1 2 w a 1 d 1 l w a the mtt for the whole groundwater

numerical simulation we set up numerical models to test the reliability and accuracy of analytical solutions the numerical codes used in this study are modflow 2005 for the simulation of groundwater flow and modpath version 6 for particle tracking harbaugh 2005 pollock 2012 numerical simulations are established in 2 d cross sections as depicted by fig 2 all geometric and hydrogeologic configurations of the numerical model are consistent with the analytical model specifically the test aquifer has a length of 500 m l 500 with a no flux base and upstream boundary and a fixed head of 10 m h l 10 at the downstream boundary the aquifer is discretized into a 500 50 mesh in the horizontal and vertical directions a large number 2000 5000 depending on the scale of the urban area of particles are released from the phreatic surface of groundwater the transit time pdfs are estimated using the histogram of transit times of the whole set of particles 2 5 sensitivity analysis to quantify the relative change in ttds before and after urbanization we use the normalized form of the mean transit time τ and the normalized form of variance of transit times σ 2 as two summary statistics σ 2 is expressed by 35 τ τ τ p σ 2 σ 2 τ p 2 where σ 2 is the variance of transit times in the urban scenario and τ p 2 is the expected variance in the pre urban scenario where the variance is equal to the square of the mean these two summary statistics serve as performance metrics for the parametric and sensitivity study we applied two approaches to analyze the parametric sensitivity first we conducted a local sensitivity analysis focusing on every single parameter and evaluated their perspective effects on water tables and ttds this helps to better understand how the spatial extent and location of the urban area alter the groundwater transit times second we conducted a global sensitivity analysis gsa in the full parameter space and considered their interactions using sobol variance based method gsa can quantify the interactive contributions among parameters to the total variance in ttds as a variance based approach the sobol method has become one of the most popular gsa methods in environmental modeling rosolem et al 2012 saltelli et al 1999 sobol 2001 sobol method relates the fraction of the variability in the entity i e the performance metrics to the variance in the values of various parameters it typically produces two indices the first order sensitivity indices s i and the total order sensitivity indices s ti the s i index specifies the individual contribution of factor i to the total variance in performance metrics whereas the s ti index quantifies the contribution from both individual parameters and the interactions among them to the total variability in performance metrics rosolem et al 2012 the adjustable ranges of parameters are shown in table 1 parameter ranges are set broadly to incorporate potential urban conditions based on the problem conceptualization in figs 1 and 2 since transit times are independent of d there are five parameters to be evaluated for urban scenario i l w a w b r and k with w b being fixed the total number of adjustable parameters for urban scenario ii is also five l w a d r and k 3 results in this section we first display the detailed comparison between the ttds derived from analytical and numerical solutions we also show the results of the sensitivity analysis including the sensitivity analysis for individual parameters and the gsa using sobol method 3 1 verification of the analytical solution we first set up six scenarios ranging from val1 to val6 for the verification of analytical solutions the parameter values for these scenarios are shown in table 2 note that val1 represents the pre urban scenario whereas val2 to val4 represent urban scenario 1 and val5 to val6 belong to urban scenario 2 as shown in table 1 the parameter settings in val5 and val6 are identical to val3 and val 4 respectively except for the fixed value of w b the verification results of analytical solutions for six verification scenarios are shown in fig 3 as can be seen from fig 3 the derived ttds using analytical solutions correspond well with those using numerical methods for all six verification scenarios some minor discrepancies between analytical and numerical results can be found in val1 wherein the analytical method seems to slightly underestimate the frequency of early breakthrough and overestimate the frequency of the late breakthrough of water parcels this minor discrepancy could be due to the simplification of using the average value to represent the sloping water table this discrepancy is less pronounced for urban scenarios since the water table mounding in subsystems is smaller than that in the entire aquifer system which can be further evidenced by the good correspondence between analytical and numerical results from fig 3b to f for both urban scenario i and ii the results from analytical solutions fit well with those estimated from numerical models the urban areas significantly modify the shapes of ttds leading to abrupt changes in ttds across the urban area fig 3 the simulated flow pathlines marked by their transit times in six verification scenarios are shown in fig 4 from this figure we can see different organizations of flow pathlines in urban scenario i val2 to val4 and urban scenario ii val5 and val6 phreatic surfaces can be observed in urban areas in urban scenario i whereas in urban scenario ii the corresponding aquifer section is confined by the impervious urban area fig 4 besides a small portion of flow pathlines with extremely old ages can be observed at the bottom of the aquifer denoted by the red color which corresponds with the long tails of ttds fig 3 overall through the comparisons with the numerical simulations the analytical solution seems accurate in characterizing groundwater ttds 3 2 influence on the water table groundwater ttds are closely related to the water table as higher water tables lead to longer transit times as long as the recharge rate does not change indicated by eq 3 it is therefore necessary to evaluate the influence of the impervious urban area on the water table before evaluating the influence on ttds fig 5 reveals the influence of urbanization on water tables in two urban scenarios in urban scenario i the impervious urban area tends to drop the water table compared to the pre urban scenario specifically the drop of the water table in the upgradient zone is greater than that in the downgradient zone the position of the urban area l has a marginal impact on the water table whereas the lengths in the horizontal directions w a and w b strongly control the drop in the water table these above mentioned correlations also hold for urban scenario ii except for the depth of the urban area d fig 5 in urban scenario i d does not impact the water table because the transmissivity in the urban area depends on the height of the phreatic surface however in urban scenario ii the upgradient water table increases with d which is because the urban structure diminishes the transmissivity by confining the aquifer and reducing the saturated aquifer thickness overall in urban scenario i the urbanization decreases the water table on both the upgradient and the downgradient zones whereas in urban scenario ii the upgradient water table can be either higher or lower than the pre urban one depending on the horizontal extent and depth of the urban area the distance from the urban area to the downstream boundary appears to have a minor influence on the water table 3 3 influence on groundwater ttds this subsection presents a sensitivity analysis to investigate the sensitivity of the groundwater ttds to individual parameters here we present results on the sensitivity for two summary statistics to model parameters see appendix b for the sensitivity of the entire pdfs of ttds sensitivities of the normalized mtt τ to six model parameters in two scenarios are shown in fig 6 those six model parameters can be classified into construction related parameters l w a w b and d and aquifer related parameters r and k our results indicate that l has only a minor influence on τ in urban scenario i which is consistent with its marginal influence on the water table in urban scenario ii τ is more sensitive to l than in urban scenario i there is also a positive correlation between τ and w a for both two scenarios which is not surprising since the sealing of urban areas reduces the recharge and slows down the movement of groundwater what stands out from fig 6c is the abrupt drop when the urban area transits from local to regional i e when the urban structure interferes with the natural groundwater flow this is because the confinement of the aquifer section reduces the water transit times across the urban area due to the reduction in aquifer transmissivity τ has a non monotonous correlation with d in urban scenario ii fig 6c this is because the regional urban area impacts τ in two ways first external disturbance of the aquifer section through the introduction of urban areas reduces the total pore space and increases the fluid velocity accordingly transit times across the urban area are reduced second the urban structure reduces the aquifer transmissivity and lifts the water table in the upgradient zone therefore increasing the transit times of water recharged upgradient depending on the interplay between these two cases τ experiences an early drop followed by a rise with d and the minimum τ occurs when d equals 0 71 fig 6d except for those construction related parameters ttds are not independent of the aquifer related parameters r and k specifically τ and σ 2 correlate negatively with r whereas they correlate positively with k this can be attributed to the different degrees of changes in water tables with varying r and k as indicated in fig 5g and i in addition to τ we also investigated the sensitivities of the normalized variance of transit times σ 2 to model parameters in two scenarios fig 7 as shown in fig 7 σ 2 is positively correlated with l and w a in both scenarios σ 2 also increases with w b in urban scenario i fig 7c similar to the correlation between τ and d σ 2 has a non monotonous correlation with d which is also attributed to the interplay between the increase in transit times across the upgradient zone and the decrease in transit times across the urban area two aquifer related parameters r and k however appear to have minor effects on the total variance in σ 2 as indicated by the small fluctuations in τ fig 7e and f 3 4 sobol sensitivity indices for model parameters the above local sensitivity analysis reveals the relationship between summary statistics and individual parameters the gsa in this subsection focuses more on disentangling the influences of individual parameters and interactions among them on the summary statistics fig 8 displays sobol sensitivity indices for τ and σ 2 in two urban scenarios in urban scenario i the variance in τ is strongly controlled by the horizontal lengths of the urban area and it is not sensitive to r and k in contrast σ 2 is not only sensitive to horizontal lengths but also the position of the urban area in urban scenario ii τ is most sensitive to w a and d with s ti of 0 67 and 0 38 and σ 2 is dominantly controlled by w a l and d the contributions from aquifer related parameters i e r and k to the variances in τ and σ 2 are quite limited compared to those construction related parameters in both scenarios the variances in τ are mainly controlled by the direct influence of parameters by contrast the indirect influence i e the interaction among parameters significantly contributes to the variance in σ 2 this indicates that the urban area has a potentially greater disturbance on the variance of transit times than the mtt overall sobol sensitivity analysis reveals that the parameter sensitivity depends on the chosen summary metrics despite the urban scenario τ and σ 2 appear to be most sensitive to the horizontal size of the urban area they are also strongly controlled by d in urban scenario ii 4 discussion 4 1 implications for urban water resources management pujades et al 2012 have defined the barrier effect of underground construction as the increase in head loss across the construction area relative to the natural head loss before construction they found that the underground structure tends to increase the head difference when intersecting the confined aquifers however pujades et al 2012 have assumed that the total flux through the aquifer remains unchanged after the construction font capo et al 2015 further developed a method to identify the barrier effect based on the response time of piezometers in pumping tests our study suggests that the head loss across the urban area can be either higher or smaller than that in the pre urban case depending on the spatial extent and depth of the urban area fig 5 this does not contradict the findings from pujades et al 2012 because their solutions are built on the assumptions of a confined aquifer and an unchanged total recharge by contrast our study aims to reveal the regional behavior of groundwater transit times affected by a large scale urban area wherein the modification of recharge by the impervious area cannot be neglected lerner 2002 voisin et al 2018 in a rapidly urbanizing world many agricultural catchments are influenced by the expansion of urban areas urbanization introduces additional organic contaminants into the regional groundwater system that threatens the surface water and groundwater quality jurado et al 2012 larsen et al 2016 through the derived analytical solutions our study further reveals the potentially prolonged mtt in both urban settings compared to pre urban conditions this prolonged mtt is mainly due to the prevention of recharge by the impervious zones in urban scenario ii in contrast it may also be induced from the rise in the upgradient water table as indicated by eq 23 meanwhile the increase in mtt may be partially compensated by the decrease in aquifer transmissivity beneath the constructed zone the increase in groundwater transit times may cause the lag in the response of stream water to the nonpoint source contamination e g nitrogen and phosphorus this lag could amplify the response time of the stream water to nonpoint source contamination which could further endanger the goal of maintaining good surface water quality chen et al 2014 jing et al 2021 van meter et al 2017 the increased σ 2 in the urban aquifer system indicates the potential divergence in the transit times of water parcels recharged upgradient and downgradient this implies the fates of nonpoint source contaminants are also influenced by the impervious urban zone parajulee et al 2019 soulsby et al 2015 while the contaminants recharged from the downgradient zone mainly flow in the shallow part of the aquifer and have short transit times those recharged upgradient may have deep flow paths and tailing behaviors 4 2 implications for urban planning a major goal of urban water resources management is to restore the flow regime and freshwater quality to the natural condition which has been widely accepted as a hydrological objective for urban water resources management bonneau et al 2017 fatahi nafchi et al 2021 jefferson et al 2017 poff et al 1997 as a key component of the water cycle the restoration of groundwater quantity and quality is critical for achieving this goal this study shows that urbanization shifts the groundwater system onto a new trajectory by altering the water table and transit times which may not be recovered to the pre development condition with the biased mean and variance of transit times from the natural ones it is only possible to minimize the urban disturbance to groundwater transit times this finding is in line with the results of jefferson et al 2017 wherein they suggested that the restoration of pre urban hydrology and water quality is rarely achieved in practice our in depth analysis of the parametric uncertainty with different sensitivity approaches has great implications for the planning of large scale urban construction projects it shows that 1 sps refid e1 the expansion of urban areas will inevitably exacerbate the deviation of groundwater ttds and 2 sps refid e2 the interplay between the urban area and the aquifer must be considered when assessing the environmental risk of urban construction when the urban area is large enough to fully penetrate the horizontal boundaries and deep enough to intersect with the water table there exists an optimal depth of construction whereby the disturbance of construction to the mtt is minimal fig 6d this depth of the urban construction has great implications for urban planning as it suggests the reference depth of construction that disturbs the groundwater transit times the least the sensitivity analysis further highlights that the spatial relationship between the urban area and the aquifer should be primarily accounted for when planning the urban construction project accordingly the suggested analytical model benefits urban planning by providing decision making support for the environmental risk assessment 4 3 advantages and limitations of the analytical model the proposed analytical model has all distinguishing attributes of close formed equations an obvious advantage lies in the fact that all parameters of our analytical model can be derived from hydrogeological and geographic information that being said ttds can be directly approximated employing the proposed analytical model without the use of environmental tracers another advantage of the analytical solution lies in its robustness in the characterization of the discontinuous ttds which is often the case in urban groundwater systems deriving ttds by direct sampling of particles suffer from numerical errors yang et al 2021 if the number of particles or the discretization of the time step is insufficient the probability distributions derived from numerical tracking may deviate from reality in this regard the analytical approach is more promising in characterizing the discontinuous ttds besides the high computational efficiency of the proposed analytical model permits the easy implementation of the computationally expensive gsa as a simplified model relying on certain prior assumptions the analytical model inevitably has some limitations the analytical solution is only valid for the homogeneous nature of a porous medium and does not apply to highly heterogeneous media wherein the preferential flow in fractures may dominate the groundwater circulation pattern the analytical model also implicitly assumes that the free surface of the unconfined aquifer can be represented by the water table however cheng et al 2021 found that the water table equation is not self consistent nevertheless the discrepancy between the free surface and water table is small relative to the total saturated thickness and therefore has a marginal influence on the regional groundwater ttds another limitation is that the groundwater mounding has to be small to moderate otherwise the derived groundwater ttds would significantly deviate from the reality abrams and haitjema 2018 haitjema 1995 this implies that the groundwater head difference between the upgradient and downgradient boundaries should be primarily evaluated before applying the proposed analytical model besides the analytical model does not account for any leakages from water mains or sewage pipes which may underestimate the total recharge and overestimate the mtt 5 conclusions we have developed an analytical model for groundwater ttds in urban unconfined aquifers intersected by an impervious urban area the solution has been derived for a purely advective flow system in a homogeneous aquifer under steady state conditions following the dupuit forchheimer assumption and assuming a small to moderate groundwater mounding we have derived the explicit expressions for the water tables the pdfs of ttds and the mtts the analytical solution seems correct through the comparisons with numerical solutions using particle tracking a comprehensive analysis of parametric uncertainty shows that the local impervious urban area lowers down the water table while the regional impervious urban area can either increase or decrease the upgradient water table the urban area tends to increase the groundwater mtt despite the urban scenario groundwater ttds show varying degrees of sensitivities to model parameters in two urban scenarios while the groundwater mtt is only sensitive to the horizontal size of the urban area in urban scenario i it is sensitive to both the horizontal size and the vertical extension of the urban area in urban scenario ii furthermore there appears to be an optimal depth of the impervious urban structure that minimizes the disturbance of urbanization to the groundwater transit times in urban scenario ii accordingly the spatial relationship between the urban area and the aquifer especially how underground structures interact with the natural groundwater flow should be primarily considered when inferring the groundwater ttds as a first order approximation of the complex real world groundwater system the developed analytical model complements the existing analytical transit time models and provides additional information on influences from imperviousness and interference with natural groundwater flow

3771,with the ongoing rapid urbanization across the globe its interference with groundwater resources is critical to freshwater sustainability the groundwater transit time distribution ttd lumps the flow and transport processes of a regional groundwater system and therefore characterizes the aquifer s resilience to nonpoint source contamination however the influence of large scale urban areas on the regional groundwater ttd is not clear this study proposed a novel analytical model for groundwater ttds accounting for the effects of impervious urban structures after the verification against results from particle tracking we apply this analytical expression to investigate how the position and spatial extent of the urban area change the ttds from the pre urban ones the sensitivity analysis suggests that urban areas tend to increase both the mean and the variance of groundwater transit times moreover modeling results highlight the importance of the spatial relationship between the urban area and the aquifer in determining the urban groundwater ttds for aquifers intersected by a local urban area mean transit time mtt is dominated by the horizontal extent of the urban area i e the impervious area whereas for aquifers intersected by a regional urban area mtt is strongly controlled by the vertical extent of the urban area in addition to its horizontal size being computationally efficient the proposed analytical model can aid decision making in urban freshwater resources management and urban planning keywords transit time distribution analytical solution urbanization aquifer 1 introduction rapid urbanization threatens the safety and sustainability of freshwater resources especially in developing countries in 2014 around 3 9 billion people lived in cities and this number is expected to rise to two thirds of the global population in 2050 connor 2015 urbanization and the improvement of living standards lead to an increasing demand for water in cities connor 2015 besides rapid urbanization modifies the water cycle in several ways cities extract substantial amounts of water from streams and groundwater and challenge the sustainability of regional water resources larsen et al 2016 ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021 besides urbanization also extends the area of impervious surface and prevents groundwater recharge therefore causing higher flood risks golian et al 2020 vázquez suñé et al 2005 finally urbanization may threaten the downstream surface water body by discharging pollutants from cities in this context urban aquifers play a critical part in sustaining the urban water supply and must be integrated into the strategies of water resources management on one hand the expansion of impervious areas may reduce groundwater recharge and further reduce baseflows although the actual baseflow in urban watersheds can be increased by anthropogenic influences bonneau et al 2018 lerner 2002 ostad ali askari et al 2019 vázquez suñé et al 2010 on the other hand modern construction technologies tend to extend not only the area but also the depth of the urban impact region which typically cuts the aquifer and alters the local and regional groundwater flow field attard et al 2017 font capo et al 2015 ostad ali askari et al 2020 pujades et al 2012 previous works have investigated the influence of urbanization on groundwater quantity and flux related aspects attard et al 2016b underground structures intersecting the confined aquifer may exert a barrier effect on groundwater heads which can be expressed as the increase in head difference across the underground structure after the construction pujades et al 2012 pujades et al 2016 this barrier effect may cause many environmental problems such as ground settlements xu et al 2019 and contaminants mobilization font capo et al 2015 jurado et al 2012 in addition some studies have focused on the modification in water budget partitioning and baseflow generation bhaskar et al 2016 bonneau et al 2017 hamel and fletcher 2014 janke et al 2014 schwartz and smith 2014 despite these works few have focused on the modification in water transit times in urban aquifers for a local regional groundwater system the transit travel time is defined as the time spent by a water parcel from its entrance as recharge till its discharge into the surface water body i e streams lakes or seas the transit travel time distribution ttd is the distribution of transit times and it provides a lumped description of the transport and mixing processes in a regional aquifer system groundwater ttds have important implications for the interpretation of tracer data benettin et al 2015 kuppel et al 2020 małoszewski and zuber 1982 stewart et al 2010 zuber 1986 biogeochemical processes van der velde et al 2010 groundwater vulnerability to nonpoint source contamination basu et al 2012 jing et al 2019 kumar et al 2020 ostad ali askar et al 2018 and groundwater response to external changes including climate change engdahl and maxwell 2015 havril et al 2018 jing et al 2020 the mean transit time mtt of groundwater in an aquifer system ranges typically from years to decades which is highly relevant to the lag in streamwater response to nonpoint source pollutants the climate forcing topography geometry and hydraulic properties of aquifers cause ttds to present unique shapes that reflect the transport and mixing processes within the aquifer abrams and haitjema 2018 jing et al 2019 leray et al 2016 talebmorad et al 2021 many analytical solutions have been reported for catchments or aquifers among which the exponential model is one of the most popular models eriksson 1958 haitjema 1995 luo and cirpka 2008 małoszewski and zuber 1982 analytical models bridge the gap between observations and the systems intrinsic properties which helps to understand why the real world aquifer systems deviate from the reference ones leray et al 2016 unfortunately most analytical models about groundwater ttds assume natural conditions with few considering the disturbance of urbanization on their shape and breadth despite some previous studies that have employed the tracer data to infer the transit times in urban catchments and aquifers these tracer based studies often apply presumed lumped parameter models that typically fit the natural aquifers rather than urban aquifers hrachowitz and clark 2017 kuhlemann et al 2020 mccance et al 2018 soulsby et al 2015 moreover presuming simple travel time models without considering the impact of impervious urban zones may bias the interpretation of tracer data and cause unrealistic results jing et al 2019 mccallum et al 2015 with the development of modern construction techniques such as the cut and cover method the urban structure often intersects with the water table and obstructs the natural groundwater flow which could also strongly regulate the transport process and the transit times attard et al 2016a font capo et al 2015 consequently it is useful to derive explicit expressions for groundwater ttds in urban aquifers accounting for the influence of such impervious urban structures in this paper we aim to quantify the influence of impervious urban construction on the shape and breadth of groundwater ttds by deriving novel analytical solutions to the best of our knowledge this paper is the first ever attempt to explicitly account for the composite effect of imperviousness and deep underground structures on groundwater ttds specifically we expect to answer the following scientific questions 1 sps refid e1 how does the impervious urban area affect the regional scale groundwater ttds 2 sps refid e2 what is the most important factor that causes the deviation of groundwater transit times from the pre urban ones 3 sps refid e3 how can we take adaptive strategies to reduce environmental risks caused by the modification in groundwater transit times to answer these questions we start by deriving novel analytical solutions for an idealized aquifer intersected by an urban sealing area we then verify the analytical solutions by comparing them with numerical simulations and conduct a comprehensive parametric study under different scenarios considering a range of parameters of analytical expressions finally we discuss the results and their implications for urban water resources management and urban planning 2 model and methods 2 1 problem description this study focuses on the saturated groundwater system in an unconfined aquifer intersected by an impervious urban area compared to deep confined aquifers shallow unconfined aquifers are more vulnerable to urban constructions and typically interact more actively with surface water which is of great concern from an environmental perspective the geometry and boundary conditions bcs of real world watersheds are typically very complex which hinders the derivation of analytical solutions fig 1 a for the sake of simplification we consider an idealized rectangular aquifer bounded by an upgradient natural groundwater divide and a downgradient water body fig 1b and c the upgradient and downgradient boundaries are assigned with a no flux bc and a fixed head bc respectively this aquifer is embedded in an aquitard and therefore the lateral boundaries are also impervious the discharge zone is at the downstream limit which is normally a body of impounded surface water such as a river a lake or a sea the groundwater flow is at steady state meaning that the outflow equals the total amount of recharge we only consider the groundwater flow in the saturated zone which is assumed to be purely advective the groundwater flow is horizontal based on the dupuit forchheimer assumption dupuit 1863 forchheimer 1886 this can be justified since the thickness of the saturated aquifer is typically small relative to its horizontal length and the vertical component of flow velocity is neglectable relative to the horizontal one therefore the groundwater head and velocity do not change with depth the upper surface of the unconfined aquifer receives a uniform diffuse recharge r lt 1 except for the impervious urban area fig 1b and c an impervious urban area seals the ground and prevents infiltration and therefore no recharge occurs in this area this is an idealized case because in reality leakages from water mains or sewage systems often significantly recharge groundwater vázquez suñé et al 2005 horizontally the urban area is rectangular with a length of 2 w a at the flow direction a a in fig 1 and a length of 2 w b perpendicular to the flow direction b b in fig 1 the bottom of the urban structure can be either higher or lower than the water table under natural conditions depending on the spatial extent of urban areas interacting with groundwater flows we categorize them into local urban areas and regional urban areas in cases that the urban structure is above the natural water table it is defined as a local urban area fig 1b the local urban area does not confine the aquifer section since the phreatic surface exists alongside the local urban area this urban scenario is named urban scenario i if the urban structure is deep enough to intersect with the water table and large enough to fully penetrate the horizontal boundaries of the aquifer it is defined as a regional urban area fig 1c and this scenario is named urban scenario ii in this scenario the urban structure partially confines the aquifer fig 1c because this study aims to unveil the alteration of urban construction on regional groundwater ttds we first introduce the analytical solution for the pre urban scenario and then derive the analytical solutions for the urban scenarios 2 2 solutions in the pre urban scenario we consider a 2 d cross sectional model for the derivation of analytical solutions in the pre urban scenario fig 2 a the water table h against distance x at this cross section can be expressed using the dupuit forchheimer ellipse dupuit 1863 1 h x r k l 2 x 2 h l 2 where l is the length of the aquifer l r is the recharge rate lt 1 k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 and h l is the fixed head at the downstream boundary given that the groundwater mounding is small to moderate the groundwater ttds can be modeled as an exponential function haitjema 1995 leray et al 2016 raats 1977 2 ρ a 1 τ p exp 1 τ p where τ p is the mtt which is controlled by the system s properties 3 τ p θ h r where θ is the effective porosity of aquifer h is the mean saturated thickness l and r is the recharge rate lt 1 the mean saturated thickness for the unconfined aquifer h is expressed by eq a1 in appendix a 2 3 solutions in the urban scenarios in the urban scenario the urban area divides the a a cross section of the unconfined aquifer into three compartments the upgradient zone the urban area and the downgradient zone fig 2 the upgradient and downgradient zones have a recharge rate of r whereas the urban area has a reduced recharge rate r c fig 2b which is calculated by 4 r c 1 2 w b r where w b w b w w b is half of the length of the urban area perpendicular to the flow direction l and w is the aquifer length perpendicular to the flow direction l fig 1b given that the groundwater flow is purely advective the groundwater ttd can be expressed by the flux weighted average of three sub systems leray et al 2016 5 ρ t a i 0 2 λ i ρ i a where λ i is the weight of the recharge in the i th sub system and ρ i a is the ttd in the i th sub system in the following subsections we derive the explicit expressions of groundwater ttds in unconfined aquifers intersected by a local urban area urban scenario i and by a regional urban area urban scenario ii respectively 2 3 1 urban scenario i aquifer intersected by a local urban area this subsection provides the explicit expressions of groundwater ttds for three sub systems in urban scenario i in the downgradient zone the aquifer is recharged by the diffuse recharge on the upper boundary besides it is also recharged by the upgradient section of the aquifer the total inflow for the downgradient zone q in can be expressed as 6 q in ζ r l l w a 4 w a w b ζ where ζ is the distance to the downgradient end of the urban area l and l is the distance from the center of the urban area to the downgradient boundary l fig 2b the fluid velocity v ζ is only dependent on the horizontal position ζ and it can be expressed as 7 v ζ r l l w a 4 w a w b ζ θ h ζ because the mounding of the water table is small compared to the length of the aquifer the mean thickness of the downgradient saturated aquifer h d can be used to approximate h ζ h ζ h d and h d can be calculated using eq a2 in appendix a the transit time of water parcel recharged at the position ζ can be determined through integrating the inverse of v ζ 8 a ζ ζ l w a r l l w a 4 w a w b ζ θ h d 1 d ζ τ d ln l 4 w a w b l l w a 4 w a w b ζ where τ d is expressed as 9 τ d θ h d r then the inverse function of a ζ ζ a is expressed as 10 ζ a l 4 w a w b exp a τ d l l w a 4 w a w b a a 0 where 11 a 0 τ d ln l 4 w a w b l l w a 4 w a w b eq 10 describes the relationship between the recharge position and its corresponding transit time hence the outflux with an age inferior or equal to a q out a can be expressed as 12 q out a r l w a ζ a the cumulative ttd for water parcels recharged from the downgradient zone p d a equals to the mass fraction of outflux with a transit time inferior or equal to a etcheverry and perrochet 2000 13 p d a q out a q out where q out is the total outflux l2t 1 the probability density function pdf of ttd for downgradient recharge ρ 0 a is then expressed as 14 ρ 0 a d p d a da 1 q out d q out a da combining eqs 10 12 and 14 the ttd of

for water parcels recharged in this zone is similar to that in the downgradient zone except for the fact that it experiences a lag to reach the discharge area małoszewski and zuber 1982 the ttd for water recharged from the urban area ρ 1 a is expressed as 17 ρ 1 a l l w a 4 w a w b 2 w a τ c 1 2 w b exp a a 0 τ c a 0 a a 1 where a 0 is determined using eq 11 and 18 τ c θ 0 h c r 1 2 w b 19 a 1 a

appendix a similarly the mtt for water parcels recharged from the upgradient zone τ 2 is expressed as 24 τ 2 τ u a 1 having derived individual ttds for three independent sub systems we can now assemble them to estimate the overall ttd the groundwater ttds for the whole aquifer ρ t a can be simply expressed as a mass weighted average of three individual ttds 25 ρ t a 1 τ d exp a τ d a a 0 l

τ 1 and τ 2 can be determined using eq 16 eq 21 and eq 24 respectively 2 3 2 urban scenario ii aquifer intersected by a regional urban area unlike the above scenario of a local urban area the scenario of a regional urban area is defined such that it fully penetrates the horizontal boundaries of the aquifer hence w b is a constant of 0 5 rather than a variable since the bottom of the urban area is beneath the water table the aquifer section beneath the regional urban area is essentially confined the derivation of the analytical solution for urban scenario ii is similar to that for urban scenario i except for the fact that 1 sps refid e1 the groundwater recharge in the urban area is completely suppressed by the impervious urban area and 2 sps refid e2 no phreatic surface of groundwater exists in the urban area accordingly the dimensionless form of groundwater ttds for urban scenario ii is expressed as 29 ρ t a 1 τ d exp τ p a τ d a a 0 0 a 0 a a 1 1 l w a τ u 1 2 w a exp

numerical simulation we set up numerical models to test the reliability and accuracy of analytical solutions the numerical codes used in this study are modflow 2005 for the simulation of groundwater flow and modpath version 6 for particle tracking harbaugh 2005 pollock 2012 numerical simulations are established in 2 d cross sections as depicted by fig 2 all geometric and hydrogeologic configurations of the numerical model are consistent with the analytical model specifically the test aquifer has a length of 500 m l 500 with a no flux base and upstream boundary and a fixed head of 10 m h l 10 at the downstream boundary the aquifer is discretized into a 500 50 mesh in the horizontal and vertical directions a large number 2000 5000 depending on the scale of the urban area of particles are released from the phreatic surface of groundwater the transit time pdfs are estimated using the histogram of transit times of the whole set of particles 2 5 sensitivity analysis to quantify the relative change in ttds before and after urbanization we use the normalized form of the mean transit time τ and the normalized form of variance of transit times σ 2 as two summary statistics σ 2 is expressed by 35 τ τ τ p σ 2 σ 2 τ p 2 where σ 2 is the variance of transit times in the urban scenario and τ p 2 is the expected variance in the pre urban scenario where the variance is equal to the square of the mean these two summary statistics serve as performance metrics for the parametric and sensitivity study we applied two approaches to analyze the parametric sensitivity first we conducted a local sensitivity analysis focusing on every single parameter and evaluated their perspective effects on water tables and ttds this helps to better understand how the spatial extent and location of the urban area alter the groundwater transit times second we conducted a global sensitivity analysis gsa in the full parameter space and considered their interactions using sobol variance based method gsa can quantify the interactive contributions among parameters to the total variance in ttds as a variance based approach the sobol method has become one of the most popular gsa methods in environmental modeling rosolem et al 2012 saltelli et al 1999 sobol 2001 sobol method relates the fraction of the variability in the entity i e the performance metrics to the variance in the values of various parameters it typically produces two indices the first order sensitivity indices s i and the total order sensitivity indices s ti the s i index specifies the individual contribution of factor i to the total variance in performance metrics whereas the s ti index quantifies the contribution from both individual parameters and the interactions among them to the total variability in performance metrics rosolem et al 2012 the adjustable ranges of parameters are shown in table 1 parameter ranges are set broadly to incorporate potential urban conditions based on the problem conceptualization in figs 1 and 2 since transit times are independent of d there are five parameters to be evaluated for urban scenario i l w a w b r and k with w b being fixed the total number of adjustable parameters for urban scenario ii is also five l w a d r and k 3 results in this section we first display the detailed comparison between the ttds derived from analytical and numerical solutions we also show the results of the sensitivity analysis including the sensitivity analysis for individual parameters and the gsa using sobol method 3 1 verification of the analytical solution we first set up six scenarios ranging from val1 to val6 for the verification of analytical solutions the parameter values for these scenarios are shown in table 2 note that val1 represents the pre urban scenario whereas val2 to val4 represent urban scenario 1 and val5 to val6 belong to urban scenario 2 as shown in table 1 the parameter settings in val5 and val6 are identical to val3 and val 4 respectively except for the fixed value of w b the verification results of analytical solutions for six verification scenarios are shown in fig 3 as can be seen from fig 3 the derived ttds using analytical solutions correspond well with those using numerical methods for all six verification scenarios some minor discrepancies between analytical and numerical results can be found in val1 wherein the analytical method seems to slightly underestimate the frequency of early breakthrough and overestimate the frequency of the late breakthrough of water parcels this minor discrepancy could be due to the simplification of using the average value to represent the sloping water table this discrepancy is less pronounced for urban scenarios since the water table mounding in subsystems is smaller than that in the entire aquifer system which can be further evidenced by the good correspondence between analytical and numerical results from fig 3b to f for both urban scenario i and ii the results from analytical solutions fit well with those estimated from numerical models the urban areas significantly modify the shapes of ttds leading to abrupt changes in ttds across the urban area fig 3 the simulated flow pathlines marked by their transit times in six verification scenarios are shown in fig 4 from this figure we can see different organizations of flow pathlines in urban scenario i val2 to val4 and urban scenario ii val5 and val6 phreatic surfaces can be observed in urban areas in urban scenario i whereas in urban scenario ii the corresponding aquifer section is confined by the impervious urban area fig 4 besides a small portion of flow pathlines with extremely old ages can be observed at the bottom of the aquifer denoted by the red color which corresponds with the long tails of ttds fig 3 overall through the comparisons with the numerical simulations the analytical solution seems accurate in characterizing groundwater ttds 3 2 influence on the water table groundwater ttds are closely related to the water table as higher water tables lead to longer transit times as long as the recharge rate does not change indicated by eq 3 it is therefore necessary to evaluate the influence of the impervious urban area on the water table before evaluating the influence on ttds fig 5 reveals the influence of urbanization on water tables in two urban scenarios in urban scenario i the impervious urban area tends to drop the water table compared to the pre urban scenario specifically the drop of the water table in the upgradient zone is greater than that in the downgradient zone the position of the urban area l has a marginal impact on the water table whereas the lengths in the horizontal directions w a and w b strongly control the drop in the water table these above mentioned correlations also hold for urban scenario ii except for the depth of the urban area d fig 5 in urban scenario i d does not impact the water table because the transmissivity in the urban area depends on the height of the phreatic surface however in urban scenario ii the upgradient water table increases with d which is because the urban structure diminishes the transmissivity by confining the aquifer and reducing the saturated aquifer thickness overall in urban scenario i the urbanization decreases the water table on both the upgradient and the downgradient zones whereas in urban scenario ii the upgradient water table can be either higher or lower than the pre urban one depending on the horizontal extent and depth of the urban area the distance from the urban area to the downstream boundary appears to have a minor influence on the water table 3 3 influence on groundwater ttds this subsection presents a sensitivity analysis to investigate the sensitivity of the groundwater ttds to individual parameters here we present results on the sensitivity for two summary statistics to model parameters see appendix b for the sensitivity of the entire pdfs of ttds sensitivities of the normalized mtt τ to six model parameters in two scenarios are shown in fig 6 those six model parameters can be classified into construction related parameters l w a w b and d and aquifer related parameters r and k our results indicate that l has only a minor influence on τ in urban scenario i which is consistent with its marginal influence on the water table in urban scenario ii τ is more sensitive to l than in urban scenario i there is also a positive correlation between τ and w a for both two scenarios which is not surprising since the sealing of urban areas reduces the recharge and slows down the movement of groundwater what stands out from fig 6c is the abrupt drop when the urban area transits from local to regional i e when the urban structure interferes with the natural groundwater flow this is because the confinement of the aquifer section reduces the water transit times across the urban area due to the reduction in aquifer transmissivity τ has a non monotonous correlation with d in urban scenario ii fig 6c this is because the regional urban area impacts τ in two ways first external disturbance of the aquifer section through the introduction of urban areas reduces the total pore space and increases the fluid velocity accordingly transit times across the urban area are reduced second the urban structure reduces the aquifer transmissivity and lifts the water table in the upgradient zone therefore increasing the transit times of water recharged upgradient depending on the interplay between these two cases τ experiences an early drop followed by a rise with d and the minimum τ occurs when d equals 0 71 fig 6d except for those construction related parameters ttds are not independent of the aquifer related parameters r and k specifically τ and σ 2 correlate negatively with r whereas they correlate positively with k this can be attributed to the different degrees of changes in water tables with varying r and k as indicated in fig 5g and i in addition to τ we also investigated the sensitivities of the normalized variance of transit times σ 2 to model parameters in two scenarios fig 7 as shown in fig 7 σ 2 is positively correlated with l and w a in both scenarios σ 2 also increases with w b in urban scenario i fig 7c similar to the correlation between τ and d σ 2 has a non monotonous correlation with d which is also attributed to the interplay between the increase in transit times across the upgradient zone and the decrease in transit times across the urban area two aquifer related parameters r and k however appear to have minor effects on the total variance in σ 2 as indicated by the small fluctuations in τ fig 7e and f 3 4 sobol sensitivity indices for model parameters the above local sensitivity analysis reveals the relationship between summary statistics and individual parameters the gsa in this subsection focuses more on disentangling the influences of individual parameters and interactions among them on the summary statistics fig 8 displays sobol sensitivity indices for τ and σ 2 in two urban scenarios in urban scenario i the variance in τ is strongly controlled by the horizontal lengths of the urban area and it is not sensitive to r and k in contrast σ 2 is not only sensitive to horizontal lengths but also the position of the urban area in urban scenario ii τ is most sensitive to w a and d with s ti of 0 67 and 0 38 and σ 2 is dominantly controlled by w a l and d the contributions from aquifer related parameters i e r and k to the variances in τ and σ 2 are quite limited compared to those construction related parameters in both scenarios the variances in τ are mainly controlled by the direct influence of parameters by contrast the indirect influence i e the interaction among parameters significantly contributes to the variance in σ 2 this indicates that the urban area has a potentially greater disturbance on the variance of transit times than the mtt overall sobol sensitivity analysis reveals that the parameter sensitivity depends on the chosen summary metrics despite the urban scenario τ and σ 2 appear to be most sensitive to the horizontal size of the urban area they are also strongly controlled by d in urban scenario ii 4 discussion 4 1 implications for urban water resources management pujades et al 2012 have defined the barrier effect of underground construction as the increase in head loss across the construction area relative to the natural head loss before construction they found that the underground structure tends to increase the head difference when intersecting the confined aquifers however pujades et al 2012 have assumed that the total flux through the aquifer remains unchanged after the construction font capo et al 2015 further developed a method to identify the barrier effect based on the response time of piezometers in pumping tests our study suggests that the head loss across the urban area can be either higher or smaller than that in the pre urban case depending on the spatial extent and depth of the urban area fig 5 this does not contradict the findings from pujades et al 2012 because their solutions are built on the assumptions of a confined aquifer and an unchanged total recharge by contrast our study aims to reveal the regional behavior of groundwater transit times affected by a large scale urban area wherein the modification of recharge by the impervious area cannot be neglected lerner 2002 voisin et al 2018 in a rapidly urbanizing world many agricultural catchments are influenced by the expansion of urban areas urbanization introduces additional organic contaminants into the regional groundwater system that threatens the surface water and groundwater quality jurado et al 2012 larsen et al 2016 through the derived analytical solutions our study further reveals the potentially prolonged mtt in both urban settings compared to pre urban conditions this prolonged mtt is mainly due to the prevention of recharge by the impervious zones in urban scenario ii in contrast it may also be induced from the rise in the upgradient water table as indicated by eq 23 meanwhile the increase in mtt may be partially compensated by the decrease in aquifer transmissivity beneath the constructed zone the increase in groundwater transit times may cause the lag in the response of stream water to the nonpoint source contamination e g nitrogen and phosphorus this lag could amplify the response time of the stream water to nonpoint source contamination which could further endanger the goal of maintaining good surface water quality chen et al 2014 jing et al 2021 van meter et al 2017 the increased σ 2 in the urban aquifer system indicates the potential divergence in the transit times of water parcels recharged upgradient and downgradient this implies the fates of nonpoint source contaminants are also influenced by the impervious urban zone parajulee et al 2019 soulsby et al 2015 while the contaminants recharged from the downgradient zone mainly flow in the shallow part of the aquifer and have short transit times those recharged upgradient may have deep flow paths and tailing behaviors 4 2 implications for urban planning a major goal of urban water resources management is to restore the flow regime and freshwater quality to the natural condition which has been widely accepted as a hydrological objective for urban water resources management bonneau et al 2017 fatahi nafchi et al 2021 jefferson et al 2017 poff et al 1997 as a key component of the water cycle the restoration of groundwater quantity and quality is critical for achieving this goal this study shows that urbanization shifts the groundwater system onto a new trajectory by altering the water table and transit times which may not be recovered to the pre development condition with the biased mean and variance of transit times from the natural ones it is only possible to minimize the urban disturbance to groundwater transit times this finding is in line with the results of jefferson et al 2017 wherein they suggested that the restoration of pre urban hydrology and water quality is rarely achieved in practice our in depth analysis of the parametric uncertainty with different sensitivity approaches has great implications for the planning of large scale urban construction projects it shows that 1 sps refid e1 the expansion of urban areas will inevitably exacerbate the deviation of groundwater ttds and 2 sps refid e2 the interplay between the urban area and the aquifer must be considered when assessing the environmental risk of urban construction when the urban area is large enough to fully penetrate the horizontal boundaries and deep enough to intersect with the water table there exists an optimal depth of construction whereby the disturbance of construction to the mtt is minimal fig 6d this depth of the urban construction has great implications for urban planning as it suggests the reference depth of construction that disturbs the groundwater transit times the least the sensitivity analysis further highlights that the spatial relationship between the urban area and the aquifer should be primarily accounted for when planning the urban construction project accordingly the suggested analytical model benefits urban planning by providing decision making support for the environmental risk assessment 4 3 advantages and limitations of the analytical model the proposed analytical model has all distinguishing attributes of close formed equations an obvious advantage lies in the fact that all parameters of our analytical model can be derived from hydrogeological and geographic information that being said ttds can be directly approximated employing the proposed analytical model without the use of environmental tracers another advantage of the analytical solution lies in its robustness in the characterization of the discontinuous ttds which is often the case in urban groundwater systems deriving ttds by direct sampling of particles suffer from numerical errors yang et al 2021 if the number of particles or the discretization of the time step is insufficient the probability distributions derived from numerical tracking may deviate from reality in this regard the analytical approach is more promising in characterizing the discontinuous ttds besides the high computational efficiency of the proposed analytical model permits the easy implementation of the computationally expensive gsa as a simplified model relying on certain prior assumptions the analytical model inevitably has some limitations the analytical solution is only valid for the homogeneous nature of a porous medium and does not apply to highly heterogeneous media wherein the preferential flow in fractures may dominate the groundwater circulation pattern the analytical model also implicitly assumes that the free surface of the unconfined aquifer can be represented by the water table however cheng et al 2021 found that the water table equation is not self consistent nevertheless the discrepancy between the free surface and water table is small relative to the total saturated thickness and therefore has a marginal influence on the regional groundwater ttds another limitation is that the groundwater mounding has to be small to moderate otherwise the derived groundwater ttds would significantly deviate from the reality abrams and haitjema 2018 haitjema 1995 this implies that the groundwater head difference between the upgradient and downgradient boundaries should be primarily evaluated before applying the proposed analytical model besides the analytical model does not account for any leakages from water mains or sewage pipes which may underestimate the total recharge and overestimate the mtt 5 conclusions we have developed an analytical model for groundwater ttds in urban unconfined aquifers intersected by an impervious urban area the solution has been derived for a purely advective flow system in a homogeneous aquifer under steady state conditions following the dupuit forchheimer assumption and assuming a small to moderate groundwater mounding we have derived the explicit expressions for the water tables the pdfs of ttds and the mtts the analytical solution seems correct through the comparisons with numerical solutions using particle tracking a comprehensive analysis of parametric uncertainty shows that the local impervious urban area lowers down the water table while the regional impervious urban area can either increase or decrease the upgradient water table the urban area tends to increase the groundwater mtt despite the urban scenario groundwater ttds show varying degrees of sensitivities to model parameters in two urban scenarios while the groundwater mtt is only sensitive to the horizontal size of the urban area in urban scenario i it is sensitive to both the horizontal size and the vertical extension of the urban area in urban scenario ii furthermore there appears to be an optimal depth of the impervious urban structure that minimizes the disturbance of urbanization to the groundwater transit times in urban scenario ii accordingly the spatial relationship between the urban area and the aquifer especially how underground structures interact with the natural groundwater flow should be primarily considered when inferring the groundwater ttds as a first order approximation of the complex real world groundwater system the developed analytical model complements the existing analytical transit time models and provides additional information on influences from imperviousness and interference with natural groundwater flow

3772,quantifying the impact of the streamflow forecast uncertainty on the short term referring to the next day power generation operation of a cascade hydropower system is more complex than a single reservoir but important due to the compensation effect between upstream and downstream reservoirs within a cascade in this paper we propose a short term cascade hydropower stations optimal operation model based on conditional value at risk called the cvar schom model to guide the actual power generation using uncertain streamflow forecast we first analyze the uncertainty of short term streamflow forecasts and establish the conditional probability function to describe the uncertainty of the forecasted streamflow sequence we next propose the short term operation target of the cascade hydropower station at the greatest expected benefit we then introduce the conditional value at risk theory to analyze the risk of power shortage in different operating schemes under a certain level of confidence finally based on the risk attitude of the decision makers we balance the benefit and risk of cascade hydropower stations operation and establish the cvar schom model we verify the model using the jinguan cascade hydropower stations in the yalung river basin the main contributions are as follows 1 by using k means clustering to classify the forecasted streamflow sequence into different magnitudes and then using the joint probability function of the relative errors an accurate description of the uncertainty of the short term streamflow forecast can be achieved 2 the internal characteristics of each cascade power station and the interrelationships between the cascade hydropower stations are complicated and the power deviation and forecast error can show positive or negative correlations 3 compared with the traditional deterministic optimization model the cvar schom proposed in this paper performs well in real world applications the proposed model yields different degrees of improvement of the benefits and risks for various forecast magnitudes the decision makers can choose different schemes according to their risk attitudes keywords cascade reservoirs optimal hydropower generation streamflow forecast uncertainty conditional value at risk 1 introduction the development of clean hydropower energy alleviates the shortage of traditional fossil energy relieves the serious environmental problems caused by fuel consumption and helps achieve carbon neutrality yüksel 2010 ji et al 2017 moser et al 2021 in particular hydropower generators with flexible turn on and shutdown capabilities play an important role in increasing local hydropower and power quality and stabilizing the electric power system operation zhang et al 2020 arsenault and côté 2019 cassagnole et al 2021 however the operation schemes formulation of hydropower stations using uncertain streamflow forecast hinders the efficient utility of hydropower resources even causes operation risk i e water abandoning or output shortage jiang et al 2019a yang et al 2020 huang et al 2021 therefore the object of this study is to consider the forecast uncertainty in the hydropower station management so that the hydropower stations are fully effective and ensure the safe and stable operation of the electric power system with continuously advancing forecasting abilities the accuracy of streamflow forecasting has been effectively improved and used in water resource management carpenter and georgakakos 2001 schepen et al 2012 alizadeh et al 2017 but uncertainty still exists forecast uncertainty which is usually described by a family of conditional density functions of actual streamflow conditioned on the forecasted streamflow characterizes the forecast accuracy of the forecast system datta and houck 1984 stedinger et al 1984 karamouz and vasiliadis 1992 compared with mid term and long term streamflow forecasts the uncertainty of short term streamflow forecasts is smaller but still has a non negligible impact on the short term operation of hydropower stations wang et al 2017 jiang et al 2019b yang et al 2020 the short term referring to the next day power generation operation planning is usually made by a decision maker based on the forecasted streamflow sequence for a period of time in the future and is the basis for guiding the actual operation of the hydropower station to allow us to benefit fully from hydropower resources lu et al 2015 jiang et al 2018 however the compensation effect which reflects in the electricity generation compensation regulation and reverse regulation between reservoirs brings benefits to society economy ecology and the environmental system and simultaneously increases the complexity of the impact of forecast uncertainties on the actual operation of cascade hydropower stations su et al 2020 wang et al 2021 therefore finding a suitable method to quantify the impact of forecast uncertainty on the short term cascade hydropower stations operation plan and then reduce the negative effect of forecast uncertainty is difficult but important usually the forecast uncertainty is quantified before operation scheme formulation and many related achievements have been obtained in this field for instance maranzano and krzysztofowicz 2003 krzysztofowicz and maranzano 2004 established a hydrological uncertainty processor to analyze the historical measured and forecasted streamflow data and combine them with bayes theorem to obtain the posterior joint density function of the measured streamflow stedinger et al 2008 assumed that the relative forecast errors are normal and independently distributed which was used in the analysis of parameter uncertainty in rainfall runoff watershed models zhao et al 2015 proposed a bayesian joint probability model to analyze the uncertainty of streamflow forecasts through post processing deterministic streamflow forecasting and founded the forecast uncertainty depending on the value of the forecasted streamflow value jiang et al 2018 adopt fuzzy mathematic theory to research the fuzziness of forecasting error and analyze the fuzzy risk of hydropower station operation near the boundary but these studies mainly focus on the forecast uncertainty in a single lead time for the forecasted streamflow sequence the forecasted streamflow values at continuous time steps were simultaneously predicted at the forecast time thus there is a relationship of the forecast uncertainty between the adjacent time steps in the forecasted streamflow sequence due to the same available hydrological used in the forecast released time krzysztofowicz and maranzano 2004 that is the forecast uncertainty in a certain forecast period may affect the forecast uncertainty for other lead times to analyze this relationship zhao et al 2011 introduced a generalized martingale model for the simulation of biased and non gaussian forecast uncertainties and further used this model to illustrate the effect of forecast uncertainty on reservoir operation chen et al 2016 proposed a copula based uncertainty evolution model to describe the evolution of uncertainties in streamflow forecast and applied this model to determine the effect of forecast uncertainty on real time reservoir operation of the three gorges reservoir therefore in operation scheme planning it is necessary to comprehensively consider the impact of forecast uncertainties under multiple different lead times on the operation plan based on the analysis result of forecast uncertainty characteristics many previous methods have been proposed to reduce the negative impact of forecast uncertainty on reservoir management for example the stochastic dynamic programming sdp and its improvement which considers forecast and its uncertainty by bayesian decision theory have been widely used to develop reservoir operation schemes tejada guibert et al 1995 xu et al 2014 tan et al 2020 however the sdp approach is a closed loop control which means the decision state of each period is a function of the state of the system and therefore is not applicable in the development of operation schemes that simultaneously specify the decision state of multiperiod bras et al 1983 karamouz and vasiliadis 1992 recently wang et al 2017 introduced value at risk var into the short term optimal operation model of cascade hydropower stations to measure the risk of the output error caused by the forecast uncertainty jiang et al 2018 introduced fuzzy risk theory based on credibility theory to study the risk of hydropower curtailment and insufficient output during the operation of a hydropower station and they provided the recommended water level range for the actual operation of the hydropower station the above methods analyzed the impact of forecast uncertainty on the short term optimal operation of hydropower stations and provided reasonable recommendations to guide actual operation however these studies only focused on the analysis of the short term streamflow forecast uncertainty in a single period ignoring some of the characteristics of the forecast uncertainty in different periods within the short term streamflow forecast sequence besides previous studies rarely indicated the possible loss i e output shortage power curtailment and spilled water of deterministic operation schemes which is important for decision makers conditional value at risk cvar is a risk assessment technique for studying investment portfolio risk which is often used to reduce the probability of a huge loss in an investment portfolio andersson et al 2001 it can evaluate a specific loss that exceeds the value at risk var under a certain probability confidence level β compared with the traditional var which is only a quantile cvar is the mean loss when var is exceeded that is it is the expected value of the tail loss which can more effectively measure the excess risk loss and reflect the degree of risk that the decision maker perceives it has been widely used in many research scenarios involving resource allocation and risk management hosseini and verma 2018 tavakoli et al 2018 tayebikhorami et al 2020 therefore this study introduces cvar into the short term optimal operation planning for cascade hydropower stations to analyze the risk of reducing the target effectiveness of different operation plans at a certain level of confidence considering the above issues in this study we propose a short term cascade hydropower stations optimal operation model based on conditional value at risk cvar schom that takes into account the impact of the short term streamflow forecast uncertainty on the benefits and risks of cascade hydropower stations operation the model is applied to the short term operation planning of cascade hydropower stations to improve the benefits of the actual operation of hydropower stations and reduce the operational risks specifically in this model we first use historical data to analyze the magnitude of the uncertainty of streamflow forecasts under different forecast periods and the relationship of the uncertainties of streamflow forecasts between different periods then the analysis results of forecast uncertainty are used to establish an optimization target of maximizing the expected benefit of a planning horizon finally we construct the cvar schom model by applying conditional value at risk theory and optimize the model using a genetic algorithm in a real world application three indicators power consumption power shortage and power curtailment are used to compare and analyze the differences between the traditional deterministic model and the proposed model the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the analysis of the impact of forecast uncertainty on the target benefits and operational risks section 3 describes the application of the model to the jinguan cascade hydropower station in the yalung river basin section 4 presents the main results and analysis section 5 presents the conclusions 2 methodology in this section we analyze the benefits and risks of the streamflow forecast uncertainty for the short term optimal operation of cascade hydropower stations apply the analysis results in the development of conditional value at risk theory establish a coordinated operation model of the short term optimal operation of cascade hydropower stations based on benefits and risks and propose three indicators to evaluate the actual operation effectiveness of the model the details are given as follows 2 1 analysis of forecast uncertainty within short term hydropower generation 2 1 1 impact of forecast uncertainty on operation benefit of hydropower stations in the process of planning an operation scheme the decision maker mainly faces two types of uncertainties in the streamflow forecast karamouz and vasiliadis 1992 xu et al 2014 the first type is natural uncertainty which exists prior to receive forecasts this uncertainty is described by conditional density functions p t q t q t 1 which are named as prior transition probabilities and reflect the randomness of the streamflow where qt is the measured streamflow value during period t t 1 2 t and t is the number of periods in the planning horizon the second type is forecast uncertainty the forecast uncertainty represents the accuracy of forecasts this uncertainty is characterized by conditional density functions p t q t f t or p t f t q t which are named likelihood probability where ft is the forecasted streamflow value during period t based on the likelihood probability p t f t q t the posterior probability p t q t q t 1 f t and measurable probability p t f t 1 q t can be obtained with p t q t q t 1 and a given ft kelman et al 1990 tan et al 2020 with the posterior probability p t q t q t 1 f t and the measurable probability p t f t 1 q t the optimal policy and return function at period t can be solved with the objective function described in eq 1 1 b t s t q t 1 f t max q t p t q t q t 1 f t i 1 n n i t s i t r i t s i t 1 δ t q t p t f t 1 q t b t 1 s t 1 q t f t 1 where b t s t q t 1 f t is the maximum expected future benefit from the period t to the end of the planning horizon given that the system begins in the state s t q t 1 f t n i t s i t r i t s i t 1 is the output function of the hydropower station i during period t n is the number of the cascade hydropower stations s i t is the water storage capacity of reservoir i at the beginning of period t s t s 1 t s 2 t s n t is the vector of storage capacities of the n hydropower stations at the beginning of period t r i t is the inflow of reservoir i in period t δ t is the time duration of period t eq 1 is the functional equation used in the classical bayesian stochastic dynamic programming bsdp and it s clear that the state s t q t 1 f t needs to be known before the determination of the optimal policy for the current period t however for short term operation optimization the optimal policy of each period before the end of the planning horizon needs to be simultaneously specified and therefore the traditional bsdp model represented by eq 1 is not applicable in addition for the forecasted streamflow sequence f f 1 f 2 f t in the short term streamflow forecast because f uses the same available hydrological information in the forecast released time the uncertainties between different forecast periods are related that is the forecast uncertainty at one time during the planning horizon may affect the forecast uncertainty at another time when the streamflow forecast error et is used to reflect the forecast uncertainty at time t the posterior probability p t q t q t 1 f t only reflects the forecast uncertainty at different periods t while ignoring the difference between the forecast errors em and en in periods m and n m n during the planning horizon therefore in this study conditional probability p t e t e t 1 is used to characterize the relationship between the forecast error e t and the streamflow forecast error sequence e t 1 e 1 e 2 e t 1 meanwhile since there is a transformation relationship in eq 2 the conditional probability p t f t q t can be converted into p t f t e t then using the bayes theorem the conditional probability p t e t f t e t 1 is obtained 2 e t f t q t 3 p t e t f t e t 1 p t f t e t p t e t e t 1 e t p t f t e t p t e t e t 1 p t e t f t e t 1 represents the conditional probability of the forecast error e t given e t 1 and f t and also reflects the relationship between the forecast uncertainty in the current period and the forecast uncertainty in previous periods the streamflow forecast error sequence during the planning horizon is denoted as e e 1 e 2 e t and the probability multiplication theorem yields 4 p e f t 1 t p t e t f t e t 1 where p e f represents the conditional probability e given the forecasted streamflow sequence f eq 4 not only considers the uncertainty of the streamflow forecasts in different periods but also takes into account the relationship between the uncertainties in different periods therefore combined with eq 4 the objective function of short term optimal operation can be written as follows 5 r f s max e p e f t 1 t i 1 n n i t s i t r i t e t s i t 1 δ t where r f s is the total generated power of the hydropower station during a planning horizon s s i t n t 1 is the storage capacity process of the cascade reservoirs in contrast to the traditional maximum expected power generation objective function of the bsdp model eq 1 the objective function given by eq 5 takes into account the correlations between the uncertainties of the streamflow forecasts under different forecast periods during a planning horizon considers the uncertainty of the forecasted streamflow sequence as a whole and pursues an optimal operation plan to maximize the expected power generation in the objective function moreover the forecasted streamflow sequence f is the only input condition so the objective function is suitable for the short term optimal operation of hydropower stations 2 1 2 impact of forecast uncertainty on operation risk of hydropower station when the output coefficient k i of the i th hydropower station the reservoir capacity water level relationship s l i s i t and the flow tailrace water level relationship q l i o i t are known the output n i t of the i th hydropower station during period t can be approximated as 6 n i t n i t s i t r i t s i t 1 k i q f i t h i t where h i t is the water head of the i th reservoir during period t q f i t is power generation flow of reservoir i in period t the calculation of these two variables can be approximated as 7 q f i t o i t o i t q f i max h i t q f i max h i t o i t q f i max h i t 8 h i t 1 2 s l i s i t s l s i t 1 q l i o i t 1 2 s l i s i t s l s i t 1 q l i o i t h i max h i max 1 2 s l i s i t s l s i t 1 q l i o i t h i max where h i max is the water head required to reach the installed capacity and q f i max h i t is the power generation flow corresponding to the expected output when the water head is reached h i t o i t is the outflow of reservoir i in period t by combining eqs 6 8 it can be seen that n i t depends on the available water s i t at the beginning of period t the available water s i t 1 remaining at the end of period t for the future period and the power generation flow q f i t in period t by adjusting s i t and s i t 1 to raise lower the water head h i t the potential energy under the same water volume is increased reduced and therefore the targeted benefit b i 1 n t 1 t n i t δ t and the power deviation be i 1 n t 1 t n e i t δ t are affected the output error of the i th hydropower station in period t n e i t can be approximated as follows 9 n e i t k i q f i t h i t k i q f i t h i t where q f i t is the measured power generation flow and h i t is the measured water head based on eq 6 it can be concluded that output n i t is simultaneously affected by power generation flow q f i t and water head h i t when s i t and s i t 1 are constant it can be deduced that if the forecast error e t is greater than 0 the actual outflow will decrease which further leads that the measured water head h i t is not less than the planned water head h i t and the measured power generation flow q f i t is no more than the planned power generation flow q f i t meanwhile the opposite conclusion can be deduced when the forecast error e t is less than 0 therefore no matter the forecast error e t is greater than or less than 0 the output error n e i t may be greater than or less than 0 due to the complementary effects reflected in eq 6 besides the hydraulic interrelationship showed in eqs 10 and 11 leads to the water allocation interaction among cascade hydropower stations and further results in the effects of n e i t on be very complex to avoid the difficulty caused by straightforward quantitative analysis using e t this paper introduces cvar to analyze power deviation be 10 o i t q f i t q c i t f t j 1 i s j 1 t s j 1 t 1 δ t j 1 i 1 q r j 1 t 11 r i t f t j 1 i 1 s j 1 t s j 1 t 1 δ t j 1 i 1 q r j 1 t where q c i t is the abandoned water of reservoir i in period t q r j 1 t is the inflow to reservoir j in period t from the interzone 2 1 3 conditional value at risk established by the conditional probability of measured streamflow sequence cvar theory has been widely used for power market bidding and risk management it is an improved theory based on the var var refers to the possible maximum loss of a certain plan in a specific period in the future which is expressed as the quantile of the loss distribution so it cannot measure the loss that exceeds the var in the cvar the loss of a certain plan of a specific period in the future that exceeds the var can be fully measured by the tail loss better reflect the potential value of the risk and reflect the degree of risk psychology of decision makers assuming that s is the set of feasible schemes s s is the m dimensional vector of feasible optimization schemes and the random variable y r n is the uncertainty factor with the probability density function φ y during the implementation of the schemes f s y is the loss function of an optimization scheme s with a random variable y and its cumulative distribution function when it does not exceed the specified loss l l 0 is ψ s l defined as follows 12 ψ s l f s y l φ y d y for a confidence level β the var corresponding to the optimization plan s is va r β s and the cvar is cva r β s these are defined as follows 13 va r β s max ψ s l 1 β 14 cva r β s e f s y f s y v a r β s where e is the expected value operator fig 1 shows the comparison of va r β s and cva r β s for any storage capacity process s when eq 5 is used as the objective function its planned power generation is r f s at the same time the conditional value at risk at a confidence level β cva r β s can be calculated to measure the possible loss that planned benefit cannot be completed 15 cva r β s e f s e f s e v a r β s where f s e is the distribution function of the power deviation be when the uncertainty of the streamflow forecast occurs for the scheme s 2 2 short term cascade hydropower station optimal operation model considering forecast uncertainty based on the conclusion of section 2 1 the goal of the short term optimal operation of cascade hydropower stations is to maximize the expected total generated power during the planning horizon further cvar is used to quantify the risk of the benefit loss in the different schemes therefore the objective function is established as follows 16 max 1 α α c v a r β s e p e f t 1 t i 1 n n i t s i t r i t e t s i t 1 δ t where α is the risk attitude of the decision maker 0 α 1 in eq 16 when α is between 0 and 1 the decision makers balance the risks and benefits of power generation according to their risk attitude the larger α is the more conservative the decision maker is the main constraints in the model are presented in the supplementary material s1 2 3 model solution this section divides the process of finding the model solution into two stages the first stage solves the conditional probability p e f based on p e f the second stage uses the genetic algorithm to formulate the optimal operation scheme when the forecasted streamflow sequence is f 2 3 1 multi dimensional conditional probability function because p e f has a high variable dimensionality of 2 t it is difficult to directly apply it to the solution of the objective function therefore we reduce the existing dimensionality while still being able to describe the two characteristics of the uncertainty of the short term streamflow forecast in recent studies zhao et al 2015 and wang et al 2017 found that the forecast uncertainty depends on the forecasted value of the streamflow therefore in this paper we first divide the forecasted streamflow sequences into different magnitudes to distinguish the differences in the magnitudes of the forecasted streamflow sequences in addition with the magnitudes of the streamflow the relative error r e t measures the forecast uncertainty better than the absolute error e t does chen et al 2016 yang et al 2020 in summary we simplify p e f to the joint probability function p v f r e of the relative error sequence re r e 1 r e 2 r e t under the magnitude v f of f vf and ret are expressed as follows 17 v f m f 18 r e t f t q t q t 100 where m f is a function for calculating the magnitude of the forecasted streamflow sequence f because the classification results need to reflect the difference in the forecasted streamflow values of different magnitudes we use a k means clustering method to classify the forecasted streamflow sequences the euclidean distance d f f v is used as the similarity measure of the samples 19 d f f v t 1 t f t f t v 2 1 2 where f v f 1 v f 2 v f t v represents the centroid of magnitude v using the centroids at all magnitudes obtained from the classification results the function m f is given as follows 20 m f min d f f v where f v f 1 v f 2 v f t v represents the centroid of magnitude v according to the results of the cluster analysis we use the student t copula function to establish the joint probability function p v f r e for different v values before establishing p v f r e it is necessary to determine the marginal distribution function of ret because the streamflow forecast errors are affected by many factors when using parameter estimation the marginal distribution needs to be selected from multiple distributions and sometimes the selection results are not ideal therefore we use the kernel density estimation method in a non parametric estimation to establish the marginal distribution function g t r e t the elaborate illustration of kernel density estimation and student t copula function is given in supplementary material s2 2 3 2 model optimization using genetic algorithm eq 16 aims to balance the benefit and risk under the risk aversion in a planning horizon however according to the definition of cvar the excess loss for a certain confidence level only can be evaluated on the basis that the operation scheme has been planned if we want to obtain the optimal policy we need to generate sufficient candidate schemes to choose the optimal policy from the feasible schemes set when traditional deterministic optimization methodology i e dynamic programming linear programming is used to obtain a collection of alternative schemes the time for finding several feasible schemes is certainly enormous such methods can only plan one scheme at a time however with heuristic algorithms a set of candidate schemes can be generated in the optimization process so the heuristic algorithms are more suitable for optimizing the proposed model among them genetic algorithms have been widely used for the optimal allocation of water resources due to their good convergence properties thus we use a genetic algorithm to optimize the model other details of the genetic algorithm can be found in the publication of wang et al 2017 in this study we mainly introduced the fitness function calculation approach the specific optimization process is as follows 1 according to eq 20 the magnitude v f of f is determined then based on p v f r e the collection r e 1 r e 2 r e h of relative forecast errors is simulated finally using eq 18 the set of possible measured streamflow sequences q 1 q 2 q h is calculated 2 according to the constraint conditions a set of l candidates s 1 s 2 s l is generated and selected as the individuals in the genetic algorithm at the same time the benefit of each plan r f s i i 1 2 l is calculated according to the simulation results q 1 q 2 q h 3 for a scheme s i based on the set of possible measured inflow sequences q 1 q 2 q h the corresponding set of possible actual benefits e i 1 e i 2 e i h is calculated using water level control zhang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 and the corresponding benefit deviation set is calculated as follows 21 b e i j r f s i e i j e i j 100 then the conditional value at risk cva r β s i of the scheme corresponding to the above set of benefit deviations at the confidence level β is calculated according to eq 15 4 according to r f s i and cva r β s i the objective function value corresponding to the risk attitude α of the decision maker is calculated which is the fitness function of the scheme s i 2 4 selection and determination of evaluation indicators in an actual operation process of cascade hydropower stations the decision maker seeks not only to pursue the maximum actual benefits but also to ensure the safe and stable operation of the power system therefore in this paper we use three indexes including power shortage power consumption and power curtailment to reflect the power generation benefit in a planning horizon hereafter referring to the next day of hydropower station when there is a deviation between the forecasted inflow and the measured inflow the actual power generation of the cascade hydropower stations deviates from the planned power generation the power deviation ed occurred in a planning horizon is defined as follows 22 e d i 1 n t 1 t n i t act n i t pre δ t where n i t act and n i t pre are the planned and actual output of the hydropower station i during period t when the power deviation is less than 0 the actual power generation of a planning horizon is smaller than the planned power generation which leads to the benefit loss of hydropower station manager and may cause the operation risk of the electric system therefore the power shortage is used to reflect the risks in actual operation and the smaller the power shortage is the safer the planned scheme will be meanwhile the cvar is calculated in the scheme determination and used to quantify the power shortage of each alternative scheme in addition the occurrence of water abandonment indicates that the hydropower resources have not been fully utilized and the planned scheme can be better based on the available water volume the power curtailment is further used to reflect the wasted hydropower resources and the smaller the power curtailment is the larger the more power generation will be the power consumption is used to represent the actual benefit based on the planned scheme based on the deviation the power shortage es power curtailment ec and power consumption ea can be calculated as follow 1 if e d 0 there is a power shortage e s e d in the current period 2 if e d 0 there will be power curtailment e c e d in the current period 3 the amount of electricity absorbed by the power system of the cascade power station is ea where 23 e a i 1 n n i t act d t e d 0 i 1 n n i t pre d t e d 0 3 case study the yalung river located in the eastern part of the qinghai tibet plateau in china is the largest tributary of the jinsha river which originated from the bayankala mountains and the corresponding area of the yalung river basin is 13 6 104 km2 the jinguan cascade hydropower stations including the jinxi hydropower station jindong hydropower station and guandi hydropower station are downstream of the yalung river basin and were selected in this case study these stations are a key component of china s yalung river cascade hydropower station system which plays an important role in guaranteeing the power supply of the sichuan chongqing power grid and affects the overall power generation of the cascade hydropower stations jiang et al 2018 tan et al 2020 the main characteristic parameters of these stations are shown in table 1 the jinxi reservoir is an annual regulation reservoir and the others are daily regulation reservoirs the main purpose of these cascade hydropower stations is to maximize the total hydropower generated at present a deterministic forecasting system is used to guide the operation of the cascade hydropower stations to develop an optimal scheme with a planning horizon of 24 h the forecasted streamflow sequences were produced using a time step of 6 h with lead times ranging from 6 to 24 h the streamflow sequence could be subdivided into more periods to obtain the optimal operation plan the location of jinxi reservoir is shown in fig 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis of forecast uncertainty and simulation of forecast error sequence to establish a joint probability function p v f r e we used k means cluster analysis to divide the historical streamflow data into three magnitudes magnitude 1 m1 magnitude 2 m2 and magnitude 3 m3 in which the cluster centroid of m3 is greater than that of m2 and the cluster centroid of m2 is greater than that of m1 the analysis of forecast uncertainty is the basic research for the formulation of scheme and therefore the elaborate processes of results of the joint probability function for each magnitude are given in supplementary material s3 after obtaining the p v f r e we simulated the relative forecast error sequences for different magnitudes generated a set of possible measured inflow sequences based on the simulation results using eq 18 and analyzed the set of possible measured inflow sequences fig 3 shows the expected values at 90 credible interval and the corresponding actual measured values of 300 possible measured inflow sequences for various magnitudes for the same magnitude as the forecast period increased the range of the 90 confidence interval gradually became larger that is the forecast uncertainty gradually increased with the forecast period meanwhile for the same forecast period as the magnitude of the forecast increased the 90 confidence interval gradually became larger that is the forecast uncertainty increased as the magnitude of the forecasted streamflow sequence increased in addition most of the measured values were close to the expected values and fell within the 90 confidence interval therefore using the method described above to establish p e f reflects the uncertainty of short term streamflow forecasting which can be used later for obtaining the optimal model 4 2 effect of forecast uncertainty under different magnitudes on the hydropower stations operation to prove the necessity of the above classification results and verify the theoretical analysis of the impact of forecast errors on the power deviation in section 2 1 2 we analyzed the impact of streamflow forecast errors of different magnitudes on the short term optimal operation of cascade hydropower stations first we took the forecasted streamflow sequences as inputs and used the traditional deterministic optimization model to formulate an optimal operation plan according to the measured streamflow sequence we then used the method of controlling the water level to implement the established optimal operation plan and analyzed the power deviation of the cascade hydropower stations we selected forecasted streamflow sequences from 100 scenarios and the corresponding measured streamflow sequences with three magnitudes the mean forecast error se 1 t t 1 t e t was used to reflect the forecast precision in each planning horizon fig 4 shows the results of the power deviation for a single power station and the total power deviation of three hydropower stations in each scenario with different magnitudes the following conclusions are drawn 1 although the mean forecast error se under m3 was more likely to deviate from 0 the power deviation for a single hydropower station or three hydropower stations under m1 and m2 was much larger than the corresponding power deviation under m3 2 under m1 or m2 e d gradually decreased with increasing se and the result of se multiply e d is greater than or equal to 0 3 the relationship between se and e d in m3 was very complicated depending on whether se is greater than or less than 0 ed can be greater than or less than 0 to analyze the reasons for the conclusions described above 50 optimal operation schemes for each magnitude were selected for comparison and the water level results are shown in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 noticeable differences existed in the planned water level process of three reservoirs for the different forecast magnitudes the jinxi hydropower station lowered the water level and increased the discharge at different magnitudes there was little difference in the water level process of the jindong hydropower station for the different magnitudes while the water level process of guandi hydropower station gradually increased with increasing magnitude table 2 shows the average planned power generation of each hydropower station for three magnitudes noticeably the full power generation capacities of the jinxi hydropower station jindong hydropower station and guandi hydropower station in a planning horizon are 86 40 115 20 and 57 60 gw h therefore comparing the planned power generation in table 2 we know that as the forecast magnitude increased the total available water volume in the cascade increased so the planned power generation of each power station in the cascade showed an increasing trend and the planned power generation was far less than the full power generation when the magnitudes of the forecasted streamflow sequences were m1 and m2 this showed that the hydropower in the cascade for m1 and m2 had neither reached the upper limit of the power generation flow nor the expected output value most of the time at this time if the inflow were too large too small increasing decreasing the inflow would increase decrease in the power generation flow which in turn would lead to an increase decrease in the power output in this period which is the reason for conclusion 2 above the planned power generation of each power station in the cascade for m3 was close to the full power generation indicating that the outflow during most periods at this time was close to or greater than the upper limit of the power generation flow at this time if the inflow were too large increasing the outflow might reduce the power water head and then reduce the expected output and it could eventually lead to a decrease in the actual electricity production if the inflow were too small reducing the outflow would not necessarily affect the power generation and it might increase the water head and thereby increase the expected output this eventually would lead to an increase in the actual electricity this is the reason for conclusion 3 above when the increased flow did not affect the power generation water head or the decreased flow did not affect the power generation flow the increase decrease of the inflow did not affect the actual power generation result for m3 therefore compared with m1 and m2 the error of the streamflow forecast at m3 had little effect on the power generation which is the reason for conclusion 1 above summarily for different forecasted streamflow sequence magnitudes the characteristics of the power deviation caused by the forecast errors were markedly different due to the effect of the output characteristics of the cascade hydropower stations therefore either overestimation or underestimation of actual streamflow may result in the reduction or increase of power generation and it is necessary to discuss the effects of the proposed model at various streamflow sequence magnitudes cassagnole et al 2021 next we select a scenario in each of the streamflow forecast sequences at the three magnitudes and analyze the differences in the cvar schom calculation process of the proposed model at the different magnitudes 4 3 formulation of optimal operation schemes considering different confidence levels and risk attitudes in this study we selected one scenario for the forecasted streamflow sequence at each magnitude and set the confidence level β to 0 9 and the risk attitude α to 0 0 4 0 8 0 9 and 1 the optimal operation schemes for the different α values were obtained and shown in fig 6 there were noticeable differences in the water level process at the different magnitudes furthermore fig 7 shows the loss function ψ s l of each scheme for the different magnitudes there were noticeable differences in the loss function corresponding to the optimal schemes at different α values and forecast magnitudes compared with the forecasted streamflow sequences with magnitudes m2 and m3 the tails of the loss functions corresponding to different α values under m1 were not much different in addition as the magnitude of the forecast increased the loss function corresponding to the optimal solution at different α values became steeper that is the tail risk loss decreased as the magnitude increased the loss function for m3 was the steepest this indicated that the loss for m3 was more concentrated namely the percentage of actual power generation deviating from the planned power generation was closer to zero this was the same result as that obtained from the above analysis of conclusion 3 furthermore we analyzed the target benefits and mean excess losses of the optimal scheme for different α and β values under different magnitudes the results are shown in fig 8 fig 8 shows that as the risk attitude α increased the target benefits of the scheme gradually decreased and the absolute value of the corresponding mean excess loss also gradually decreased this showed that when the risk and benefit were balanced by adjusting the risk attitude of the decision makers the two conflicted with each other that is the risk must be reduced increased by reducing increasing the benefit at the same time higher confidence levels also mean greater risk summarily decision makers can reduce the possible risk of the optimal solution of the model by reducing the confidence level and increasing the risk attitude 4 4 comparative analysis of different schemes considering three indicators the above analysis showed that the short term optimal operational risk of the cascade hydropower stations was affected by the magnitudes of the forecasted streamflow sequences and the complex water allocation between the cascades it is difficult to verify the model through the results of single scenario analysis therefore we randomly selected 100 streamflow forecasting sequences of different magnitudes and we statistically analyzed the actual application performance of the model the confidence level β was set to 0 9 and 0 95 and the risk attitude α was set to 0 0 4 0 8 0 9 and 1 the power shortage es power curtailment ec and power consumption ea of cascade hydropower stations for the different magnitudes are shown in figs 9 11 fig 9 shows the value of ea in each scenario for different magnitudes compared with m2 the points of m1 and m3 were more concentrated this indicated that compared to m2 α had little effect on ea at m1 and m3 but in general under each magnitude as α increased the set of corresponding points showed a downward trend indicating that when α increased ea decreased in addition compared with ea from the traditional deterministic optimization model dom the results at different magnitudes were also different under m1 or m2 the ea for the dom was located in the middle of the point group which showed that the benefits of cvar schom at m1 and m2 included both those higher and lower than the actual benefits of the dom under m3 the dom corresponding points were mostly located above the point group which shows that the cvar schom model under m3 had lower actual benefits than the dom in most scenarios the comparison of the effects of the confidence level β on cvar schom at the different magnitudes shows that unlike the positions at m2 the positions of the points corresponding to the two β values at m1 and m3 were not far from each other this shows that the confidence level had little effect on the actual benefits at m1 and m3 fig 10 shows that under m1 or m2 the electricity shortage es and the mean forecast se were generally positively correlated that is es gradually increased with se in addition when se 0 only the results with the risk attitude equal to zero were more than 0 the cascade power stations were not operating at full power generation at this time and the power shortage is greater than zero due to the decrease in the water head under m3 the schemes under different risk attitudes all had e s 0 moreover by analyzing the degree of aggregation of the point sets we found that as the magnitude increased the point set at m1 was most concentrated the point set at m2 was the most dispersed and the degree of aggregation of point set at m3 was between those at m1 and m2 this reflected the effect of the risk attitudes on the tail loss of the optimal scheme at the different forecasted streamflow sequence magnitudes at the same time similar to the analysis of the power consumption compared to the impact of the confidence level on the tail loss at m1 the risk attitude had a greater impact on the tail loss of the optimal schemes at m2 and m3 fig 11 shows that under m1 or m2 the power curtailment es and the mean forecast error se were generally negatively correlated that is as se increased es gradually decreased in addition when se 0 only the results with the risk attitude equal to 1 were greater than 0 the cascade power stations were not operating at full power generation under this circumstance and power curtailment is greater than zero due to the increase in the water head under m3 the schemes under different risk attitudes all had e s 0 and the points of dom were all located below those of the cvar schom this indicated that compared with the dom the cvar schom at m3 increased the wasted water resources the points of the dom at m2 were located in the center of the point set at m1 the points of the dom were located completely above that of the cvar schom indicating that the cvar schom at m1 increased the water utilization furthermore the mean value for the improvement was evaluated by subtracting the calculation result of the dom from the calculation result of the cvar schom the result is shown in fig 12 fig 12 shows that at different magnitudes the three indicators corresponding to the improvement at different confidence levels β and risk attitudes α were noticeably different when the magnitude of the forecasted streamflow sequence was m1 all the es values were less than 0 and all the ec values were greater than 0 as the risk attitude increased ea changed from greater than 0 to less than 0 compared with the traditional dom the cvar schom decreased ec by at least 159 9 mw h increased es by at most 130 1 mw h and increased ea by at most 369 3 mw h at m2 all the ec values were greater than 0 as the risk attitude increased ea changed from greater than 0 to less than 0 and es changed from less than 0 to greater than 0 the cvar schom decreased ec by at least 305 7 mw h increased es by at most 346 1 mw h and increased ea by at most 1503 8 mw h in addition when the confidence level was between 0 8 and 0 9 there were situations where all three were greater than 0 at m3 all the es values were greater than 0 all the ec values were less than 0 and all the ea values were also less than 0 the proposed model yielded a minimum increase in ec of 223 9 mw h a minimum increase in es of 454 8 mw h and a minimum decrease in ea of 386 7 mw h summarily compared with the dom the cvar schom could more effectively increase the benefits and reduce the water resource waste at m1 it could simultaneously increase the benefits reduce the risks and reduce the water resource waste at m2 and it could effectively reduce the operational risks at m3 5 conclusions the uncertainty of the streamflow forecast has an important effect on the actual performance of the short term optimal operation of cascade hydropower stations this study proved that considering the effect of the uncertainty of the streamflow forecast on the actual benefits and actual risks in the process of establishing the optimal model is of great significance for improving the benefits of the short term operation of cascade hydropower stations and for risk reduction beginning with the two characteristics of short term streamflow forecast uncertainty the conditional value at risk theory was introduced to analyze the possible losses during operation planning and a short term optimal operation model of cascade hydropower stations was established that balanced the benefits and risks using the jinguan cascade hydropower stations in the yalung river basin as an example we analyzed the computing principle and actual utility of the model in detail the main conclusions were as follows 1 the results of the analysis of the historical forecast and measured streamflow sequences showed that as the forecast magnitude increased the forecast uncertainty increased and the relative error alone was not sufficient to measure the characteristics of the forecast uncertainty changes with forecasted streamflow magnitude at different magnitudes the forecast uncertainty increased with the increase in the forecast period and there was a significant magnitude correlation between the relative forecast errors in the different periods the kernel function and student t copula function were used to analyze the uncertainty of the short term streamflow forecasts at different magnitudes the simulation results showed that as the magnitude of the forecast increased the range of the 90 confidence interval gradually increased and most of the measured values were close to the expected value within the 90 confidence interval indicating that the established conditional distribution function could reflect the uncertainty of the forecasts at different magnitudes 2 from the analysis of the power deviation at the different forecast magnitudes we found that the characteristics of the power deviation were related not only to the forecast uncertainty but also to the forecasted streamflow magnitude although the forecast uncertainty was the greatest for the forecasted streamflow sequence magnitude of m3 the power deviation was generally small the power deviation was greater at m2 which had a medium forecast uncertainty m1 was between m2 and m3 in addition at m1 and m2 the power deviation and the forecast error showed a negative correlation overall as the forecast error decreased the power deviation increased and had the same sign as the forecast error there was no significant positive or negative correlation between the forecast error and the power deviation at m3 therefore it is crucial to discuss the applicability of the proposed model at different magnitudes 3 in the model proposed in this study the target benefit and the risk attitude can be balanced by adjusting the confidence level and risk attitude in the objective function however for different magnitudes the effects of the confidence levels and risk attitudes on the optimal plan were different by analyzing the distribution function of the conditional value at risk of the optimal scheme under different magnitudes we found that as the magnitude increased the distribution function gradually became steeper indicating that the risk corresponding to the optimal scheme became more concentrated that is under the same confidence level the percentage of possible losses gradually decreased moreover as the confidence level and risk attitude increased the target benefit and mean excess loss of the optimal plan both showed decreasing trends 4 by comparing and analyzing the actual application performance of the proposed model and a traditional model we found that the proposed model was able to achieve good results in real world applications and this was not only limited to special cases in addition the proposed model performed differently at different magnitudes the model was able to effectively increase the benefits and reduce the water source waste at m1 which was associated with lower risks and various benefits this model was able to simultaneously increase the benefits and reduce water resource waste at m2 which was associated with a higher risk the model was able to effectively reduce the operational risks at m3 which was associated with higher operational benefits therefore different decision makers can decide whether to use the proposed model based on their balanced considerations of different goals they can also balance each goal by adjusting the confidence level and risk attitude while this study has looked at the analysis of the uncertainty in the short term optimal operation of cascade hydropower stations to maximize power generation more factors including the medium streamflow forecast climate change and power market can be considered to make the final optimal more suitable and flexible besides a dynamic conditional value at risk theory could also be implemented and tested to compare their behavior in the cascade hydropower stations management credit authorship contribution statement yuan liu conceptualization investigation writing original draft changming ji methodology

3772,quantifying the impact of the streamflow forecast uncertainty on the short term referring to the next day power generation operation of a cascade hydropower system is more complex than a single reservoir but important due to the compensation effect between upstream and downstream reservoirs within a cascade in this paper we propose a short term cascade hydropower stations optimal operation model based on conditional value at risk called the cvar schom model to guide the actual power generation using uncertain streamflow forecast we first analyze the uncertainty of short term streamflow forecasts and establish the conditional probability function to describe the uncertainty of the forecasted streamflow sequence we next propose the short term operation target of the cascade hydropower station at the greatest expected benefit we then introduce the conditional value at risk theory to analyze the risk of power shortage in different operating schemes under a certain level of confidence finally based on the risk attitude of the decision makers we balance the benefit and risk of cascade hydropower stations operation and establish the cvar schom model we verify the model using the jinguan cascade hydropower stations in the yalung river basin the main contributions are as follows 1 by using k means clustering to classify the forecasted streamflow sequence into different magnitudes and then using the joint probability function of the relative errors an accurate description of the uncertainty of the short term streamflow forecast can be achieved 2 the internal characteristics of each cascade power station and the interrelationships between the cascade hydropower stations are complicated and the power deviation and forecast error can show positive or negative correlations 3 compared with the traditional deterministic optimization model the cvar schom proposed in this paper performs well in real world applications the proposed model yields different degrees of improvement of the benefits and risks for various forecast magnitudes the decision makers can choose different schemes according to their risk attitudes keywords cascade reservoirs optimal hydropower generation streamflow forecast uncertainty conditional value at risk 1 introduction the development of clean hydropower energy alleviates the shortage of traditional fossil energy relieves the serious environmental problems caused by fuel consumption and helps achieve carbon neutrality yüksel 2010 ji et al 2017 moser et al 2021 in particular hydropower generators with flexible turn on and shutdown capabilities play an important role in increasing local hydropower and power quality and stabilizing the electric power system operation zhang et al 2020 arsenault and côté 2019 cassagnole et al 2021 however the operation schemes formulation of hydropower stations using uncertain streamflow forecast hinders the efficient utility of hydropower resources even causes operation risk i e water abandoning or output shortage jiang et al 2019a yang et al 2020 huang et al 2021 therefore the object of this study is to consider the forecast uncertainty in the hydropower station management so that the hydropower stations are fully effective and ensure the safe and stable operation of the electric power system with continuously advancing forecasting abilities the accuracy of streamflow forecasting has been effectively improved and used in water resource management carpenter and georgakakos 2001 schepen et al 2012 alizadeh et al 2017 but uncertainty still exists forecast uncertainty which is usually described by a family of conditional density functions of actual streamflow conditioned on the forecasted streamflow characterizes the forecast accuracy of the forecast system datta and houck 1984 stedinger et al 1984 karamouz and vasiliadis 1992 compared with mid term and long term streamflow forecasts the uncertainty of short term streamflow forecasts is smaller but still has a non negligible impact on the short term operation of hydropower stations wang et al 2017 jiang et al 2019b yang et al 2020 the short term referring to the next day power generation operation planning is usually made by a decision maker based on the forecasted streamflow sequence for a period of time in the future and is the basis for guiding the actual operation of the hydropower station to allow us to benefit fully from hydropower resources lu et al 2015 jiang et al 2018 however the compensation effect which reflects in the electricity generation compensation regulation and reverse regulation between reservoirs brings benefits to society economy ecology and the environmental system and simultaneously increases the complexity of the impact of forecast uncertainties on the actual operation of cascade hydropower stations su et al 2020 wang et al 2021 therefore finding a suitable method to quantify the impact of forecast uncertainty on the short term cascade hydropower stations operation plan and then reduce the negative effect of forecast uncertainty is difficult but important usually the forecast uncertainty is quantified before operation scheme formulation and many related achievements have been obtained in this field for instance maranzano and krzysztofowicz 2003 krzysztofowicz and maranzano 2004 established a hydrological uncertainty processor to analyze the historical measured and forecasted streamflow data and combine them with bayes theorem to obtain the posterior joint density function of the measured streamflow stedinger et al 2008 assumed that the relative forecast errors are normal and independently distributed which was used in the analysis of parameter uncertainty in rainfall runoff watershed models zhao et al 2015 proposed a bayesian joint probability model to analyze the uncertainty of streamflow forecasts through post processing deterministic streamflow forecasting and founded the forecast uncertainty depending on the value of the forecasted streamflow value jiang et al 2018 adopt fuzzy mathematic theory to research the fuzziness of forecasting error and analyze the fuzzy risk of hydropower station operation near the boundary but these studies mainly focus on the forecast uncertainty in a single lead time for the forecasted streamflow sequence the forecasted streamflow values at continuous time steps were simultaneously predicted at the forecast time thus there is a relationship of the forecast uncertainty between the adjacent time steps in the forecasted streamflow sequence due to the same available hydrological used in the forecast released time krzysztofowicz and maranzano 2004 that is the forecast uncertainty in a certain forecast period may affect the forecast uncertainty for other lead times to analyze this relationship zhao et al 2011 introduced a generalized martingale model for the simulation of biased and non gaussian forecast uncertainties and further used this model to illustrate the effect of forecast uncertainty on reservoir operation chen et al 2016 proposed a copula based uncertainty evolution model to describe the evolution of uncertainties in streamflow forecast and applied this model to determine the effect of forecast uncertainty on real time reservoir operation of the three gorges reservoir therefore in operation scheme planning it is necessary to comprehensively consider the impact of forecast uncertainties under multiple different lead times on the operation plan based on the analysis result of forecast uncertainty characteristics many previous methods have been proposed to reduce the negative impact of forecast uncertainty on reservoir management for example the stochastic dynamic programming sdp and its improvement which considers forecast and its uncertainty by bayesian decision theory have been widely used to develop reservoir operation schemes tejada guibert et al 1995 xu et al 2014 tan et al 2020 however the sdp approach is a closed loop control which means the decision state of each period is a function of the state of the system and therefore is not applicable in the development of operation schemes that simultaneously specify the decision state of multiperiod bras et al 1983 karamouz and vasiliadis 1992 recently wang et al 2017 introduced value at risk var into the short term optimal operation model of cascade hydropower stations to measure the risk of the output error caused by the forecast uncertainty jiang et al 2018 introduced fuzzy risk theory based on credibility theory to study the risk of hydropower curtailment and insufficient output during the operation of a hydropower station and they provided the recommended water level range for the actual operation of the hydropower station the above methods analyzed the impact of forecast uncertainty on the short term optimal operation of hydropower stations and provided reasonable recommendations to guide actual operation however these studies only focused on the analysis of the short term streamflow forecast uncertainty in a single period ignoring some of the characteristics of the forecast uncertainty in different periods within the short term streamflow forecast sequence besides previous studies rarely indicated the possible loss i e output shortage power curtailment and spilled water of deterministic operation schemes which is important for decision makers conditional value at risk cvar is a risk assessment technique for studying investment portfolio risk which is often used to reduce the probability of a huge loss in an investment portfolio andersson et al 2001 it can evaluate a specific loss that exceeds the value at risk var under a certain probability confidence level β compared with the traditional var which is only a quantile cvar is the mean loss when var is exceeded that is it is the expected value of the tail loss which can more effectively measure the excess risk loss and reflect the degree of risk that the decision maker perceives it has been widely used in many research scenarios involving resource allocation and risk management hosseini and verma 2018 tavakoli et al 2018 tayebikhorami et al 2020 therefore this study introduces cvar into the short term optimal operation planning for cascade hydropower stations to analyze the risk of reducing the target effectiveness of different operation plans at a certain level of confidence considering the above issues in this study we propose a short term cascade hydropower stations optimal operation model based on conditional value at risk cvar schom that takes into account the impact of the short term streamflow forecast uncertainty on the benefits and risks of cascade hydropower stations operation the model is applied to the short term operation planning of cascade hydropower stations to improve the benefits of the actual operation of hydropower stations and reduce the operational risks specifically in this model we first use historical data to analyze the magnitude of the uncertainty of streamflow forecasts under different forecast periods and the relationship of the uncertainties of streamflow forecasts between different periods then the analysis results of forecast uncertainty are used to establish an optimization target of maximizing the expected benefit of a planning horizon finally we construct the cvar schom model by applying conditional value at risk theory and optimize the model using a genetic algorithm in a real world application three indicators power consumption power shortage and power curtailment are used to compare and analyze the differences between the traditional deterministic model and the proposed model the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the analysis of the impact of forecast uncertainty on the target benefits and operational risks section 3 describes the application of the model to the jinguan cascade hydropower station in the yalung river basin section 4 presents the main results and analysis section 5 presents the conclusions 2 methodology in this section we analyze the benefits and risks of the streamflow forecast uncertainty for the short term optimal operation of cascade hydropower stations apply the analysis results in the development of conditional value at risk theory establish a coordinated operation model of the short term optimal operation of cascade hydropower stations based on benefits and risks and propose three indicators to evaluate the actual operation effectiveness of the model the details are given as follows 2 1 analysis of forecast uncertainty within short term hydropower generation 2 1 1 impact of forecast uncertainty on operation benefit of hydropower stations in the process of planning an operation scheme the decision maker mainly faces two types of uncertainties in the streamflow forecast karamouz and vasiliadis 1992 xu et al 2014 the first type is natural uncertainty which exists prior to receive forecasts this uncertainty is described by conditional density functions p t q t q t 1 which are named as prior transition probabilities and reflect the randomness of the streamflow where qt is the measured streamflow value during period t t 1 2 t and t is the number of periods in the planning horizon the second type is forecast uncertainty the forecast uncertainty represents the accuracy of forecasts this uncertainty is characterized by conditional density functions p t q t f t or p t f t q t which are named likelihood probability where ft is the forecasted streamflow value during period t based on the likelihood probability p t f t q t the posterior probability p t q t q t 1 f t and measurable probability p t f t 1 q t can be obtained with p t q t q t 1 and a given ft kelman et al 1990 tan et al 2020 with the posterior probability p t q t q t 1 f t and the measurable probability p t f t 1 q t the optimal policy and return function at period t can be solved with the objective function described in eq 1 1 b t s t q t 1 f t max q t p t q t q t 1 f t i 1 n n i t s i t r i t s i t 1 δ t q t p t f t 1 q t b t 1 s t 1 q t f t 1 where b t s t q t 1 f t is the maximum expected future benefit from the period t to the end of the planning horizon given that the system begins in the state s t q t 1 f t n i t s i t r i t s i t 1 is the output function of the hydropower station i during period t n is the number of the cascade hydropower stations s i t is the water storage capacity of reservoir i at the beginning of period t s t s 1 t s 2 t s n t is the vector of storage capacities of the n hydropower stations at the beginning of period t r i t is the inflow of reservoir i in period t δ t is the time duration of period t eq 1 is the functional equation used in the classical bayesian stochastic dynamic programming bsdp and it s clear that the state s t q t 1 f t needs to be known before the determination of the optimal policy for the current period t however for short term operation optimization the optimal policy of each period before the end of the planning horizon needs to be simultaneously specified and therefore the traditional bsdp model represented by eq 1 is not applicable in addition for the forecasted streamflow sequence f f 1 f 2 f t in the short term streamflow forecast because f uses the same available hydrological information in the forecast released time the uncertainties between different forecast periods are related that is the forecast uncertainty at one time during the planning horizon may affect the forecast uncertainty at another time when the streamflow forecast error et is used to reflect the forecast uncertainty at time t the posterior probability p t q t q t 1 f t only reflects the forecast uncertainty at different periods t while ignoring the difference between the forecast errors em and en in periods m and n m n during the planning horizon therefore in this study conditional probability p t e t e t 1 is used to characterize the relationship between the forecast error e t and the streamflow forecast error sequence e t 1 e 1 e 2 e t 1 meanwhile since there is a transformation relationship in eq 2 the conditional probability p t f t q t can be converted into p t f t e t then using the bayes theorem the conditional probability p t e t f t e t 1 is obtained 2 e t f t q t 3 p t e t f t e t 1 p t f t e t p t e t e t 1 e t p t f t e t p t e t e t 1 p t e t f t e t 1 represents the conditional probability of the forecast error e t given e t 1 and f t and also reflects the relationship between the forecast uncertainty in the current period and the forecast uncertainty in previous periods the streamflow forecast error sequence during the planning horizon is denoted as e e 1 e 2 e t and the probability multiplication theorem yields 4 p e f t 1 t p t e t f t e t 1 where p e f represents the conditional probability e given the forecasted streamflow sequence f eq 4 not only considers the uncertainty of the streamflow forecasts in different periods but also takes into account the relationship between the uncertainties in different periods therefore combined with eq 4 the objective function of short term optimal operation can be written as follows 5 r f s max e p e f t 1 t i 1 n n i t s i t r i t e t s i t 1 δ t where r f s is the total generated power of the hydropower station during a planning horizon s s i t n t 1 is the storage capacity process of the cascade reservoirs in contrast to the traditional maximum expected power generation objective function of the bsdp model eq 1 the objective function given by eq 5 takes into account the correlations between the uncertainties of the streamflow forecasts under different forecast periods during a planning horizon considers the uncertainty of the forecasted streamflow sequence as a whole and pursues an optimal operation plan to maximize the expected power generation in the objective function moreover the forecasted streamflow sequence f is the only input condition so the objective function is suitable for the short term optimal operation of hydropower stations 2 1 2 impact of forecast uncertainty on operation risk of hydropower station when the output coefficient k i of the i th hydropower station the reservoir capacity water level relationship s l i s i t and the flow tailrace water level relationship q l i o i t are known the output n i t of the i th hydropower station during period t can be approximated as 6 n i t n i t s i t r i t s i t 1 k i q f i t h i t where h i t is the water head of the i th reservoir during period t q f i t is power generation flow of reservoir i in period t the calculation of these two variables can be approximated as 7 q f i t o i t o i t q f i max h i t q f i max h i t o i t q f i max h i t 8 h i t 1 2 s l i s i t s l s i t 1 q l i o i t 1 2 s l i s i t s l s i t 1 q l i o i t h i max h i max 1 2 s l i s i t s l s i t 1 q l i o i t h i max where h i max is the water head required to reach the installed capacity and q f i max h i t is the power generation flow corresponding to the expected output when the water head is reached h i t o i t is the outflow of reservoir i in period t by combining eqs 6 8 it can be seen that n i t depends on the available water s i t at the beginning of period t the available water s i t 1 remaining at the end of period t for the future period and the power generation flow q f i t in period t by adjusting s i t and s i t 1 to raise lower the water head h i t the potential energy under the same water volume is increased reduced and therefore the targeted benefit b i 1 n t 1 t n i t δ t and the power deviation be i 1 n t 1 t n e i t δ t are affected the output error of the i th hydropower station in period t n e i t can be approximated as follows 9 n e i t k i q f i t h i t k i q f i t h i t where q f i t is the measured power generation flow and h i t is the measured water head based on eq 6 it can be concluded that output n i t is simultaneously affected by power generation flow q f i t and water head h i t when s i t and s i t 1 are constant it can be deduced that if the forecast error e t is greater than 0 the actual outflow will decrease which further leads that the measured water head h i t is not less than the planned water head h i t and the measured power generation flow q f i t is no more than the planned power generation flow q f i t meanwhile the opposite conclusion can be deduced when the forecast error e t is less than 0 therefore no matter the forecast error e t is greater than or less than 0 the output error n e i t may be greater than or less than 0 due to the complementary effects reflected in eq 6 besides the hydraulic interrelationship showed in eqs 10 and 11 leads to the water allocation interaction among cascade hydropower stations and further results in the effects of n e i t on be very complex to avoid the difficulty caused by straightforward quantitative analysis using e t this paper introduces cvar to analyze power deviation be 10 o i t q f i t q c i t f t j 1 i s j 1 t s j 1 t 1 δ t j 1 i 1 q r j 1 t 11 r i t f t j 1 i 1 s j 1 t s j 1 t 1 δ t j 1 i 1 q r j 1 t where q c i t is the abandoned water of reservoir i in period t q r j 1 t is the inflow to reservoir j in period t from the interzone 2 1 3 conditional value at risk established by the conditional probability of measured streamflow sequence cvar theory has been widely used for power market bidding and risk management it is an improved theory based on the var var refers to the possible maximum loss of a certain plan in a specific period in the future which is expressed as the quantile of the loss distribution so it cannot measure the loss that exceeds the var in the cvar the loss of a certain plan of a specific period in the future that exceeds the var can be fully measured by the tail loss better reflect the potential value of the risk and reflect the degree of risk psychology of decision makers assuming that s is the set of feasible schemes s s is the m dimensional vector of feasible optimization schemes and the random variable y r n is the uncertainty factor with the probability density function φ y during the implementation of the schemes f s y is the loss function of an optimization scheme s with a random variable y and its cumulative distribution function when it does not exceed the specified loss l l 0 is ψ s l defined as follows 12 ψ s l f s y l φ y d y for a confidence level β the var corresponding to the optimization plan s is va r β s and the cvar is cva r β s these are defined as follows 13 va r β s max ψ s l 1 β 14 cva r β s e f s y f s y v a r β s where e is the expected value operator fig 1 shows the comparison of va r β s and cva r β s for any storage capacity process s when eq 5 is used as the objective function its planned power generation is r f s at the same time the conditional value at risk at a confidence level β cva r β s can be calculated to measure the possible loss that planned benefit cannot be completed 15 cva r β s e f s e f s e v a r β s where f s e is the distribution function of the power deviation be when the uncertainty of the streamflow forecast occurs for the scheme s 2 2 short term cascade hydropower station optimal operation model considering forecast uncertainty based on the conclusion of section 2 1 the goal of the short term optimal operation of cascade hydropower stations is to maximize the expected total generated power during the planning horizon further cvar is used to quantify the risk of the benefit loss in the different schemes therefore the objective function is established as follows 16 max 1 α α c v a r β s e p e f t 1 t i 1 n n i t s i t r i t e t s i t 1 δ t where α is the risk attitude of the decision maker 0 α 1 in eq 16 when α is between 0 and 1 the decision makers balance the risks and benefits of power generation according to their risk attitude the larger α is the more conservative the decision maker is the main constraints in the model are presented in the supplementary material s1 2 3 model solution this section divides the process of finding the model solution into two stages the first stage solves the conditional probability p e f based on p e f the second stage uses the genetic algorithm to formulate the optimal operation scheme when the forecasted streamflow sequence is f 2 3 1 multi dimensional conditional probability function because p e f has a high variable dimensionality of 2 t it is difficult to directly apply it to the solution of the objective function therefore we reduce the existing dimensionality while still being able to describe the two characteristics of the uncertainty of the short term streamflow forecast in recent studies zhao et al 2015 and wang et al 2017 found that the forecast uncertainty depends on the forecasted value of the streamflow therefore in this paper we first divide the forecasted streamflow sequences into different magnitudes to distinguish the differences in the magnitudes of the forecasted streamflow sequences in addition with the magnitudes of the streamflow the relative error r e t measures the forecast uncertainty better than the absolute error e t does chen et al 2016 yang et al 2020 in summary we simplify p e f to the joint probability function p v f r e of the relative error sequence re r e 1 r e 2 r e t under the magnitude v f of f vf and ret are expressed as follows 17 v f m f 18 r e t f t q t q t 100 where m f is a function for calculating the magnitude of the forecasted streamflow sequence f because the classification results need to reflect the difference in the forecasted streamflow values of different magnitudes we use a k means clustering method to classify the forecasted streamflow sequences the euclidean distance d f f v is used as the similarity measure of the samples 19 d f f v t 1 t f t f t v 2 1 2 where f v f 1 v f 2 v f t v represents the centroid of magnitude v using the centroids at all magnitudes obtained from the classification results the function m f is given as follows 20 m f min d f f v where f v f 1 v f 2 v f t v represents the centroid of magnitude v according to the results of the cluster analysis we use the student t copula function to establish the joint probability function p v f r e for different v values before establishing p v f r e it is necessary to determine the marginal distribution function of ret because the streamflow forecast errors are affected by many factors when using parameter estimation the marginal distribution needs to be selected from multiple distributions and sometimes the selection results are not ideal therefore we use the kernel density estimation method in a non parametric estimation to establish the marginal distribution function g t r e t the elaborate illustration of kernel density estimation and student t copula function is given in supplementary material s2 2 3 2 model optimization using genetic algorithm eq 16 aims to balance the benefit and risk under the risk aversion in a planning horizon however according to the definition of cvar the excess loss for a certain confidence level only can be evaluated on the basis that the operation scheme has been planned if we want to obtain the optimal policy we need to generate sufficient candidate schemes to choose the optimal policy from the feasible schemes set when traditional deterministic optimization methodology i e dynamic programming linear programming is used to obtain a collection of alternative schemes the time for finding several feasible schemes is certainly enormous such methods can only plan one scheme at a time however with heuristic algorithms a set of candidate schemes can be generated in the optimization process so the heuristic algorithms are more suitable for optimizing the proposed model among them genetic algorithms have been widely used for the optimal allocation of water resources due to their good convergence properties thus we use a genetic algorithm to optimize the model other details of the genetic algorithm can be found in the publication of wang et al 2017 in this study we mainly introduced the fitness function calculation approach the specific optimization process is as follows 1 according to eq 20 the magnitude v f of f is determined then based on p v f r e the collection r e 1 r e 2 r e h of relative forecast errors is simulated finally using eq 18 the set of possible measured streamflow sequences q 1 q 2 q h is calculated 2 according to the constraint conditions a set of l candidates s 1 s 2 s l is generated and selected as the individuals in the genetic algorithm at the same time the benefit of each plan r f s i i 1 2 l is calculated according to the simulation results q 1 q 2 q h 3 for a scheme s i based on the set of possible measured inflow sequences q 1 q 2 q h the corresponding set of possible actual benefits e i 1 e i 2 e i h is calculated using water level control zhang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 and the corresponding benefit deviation set is calculated as follows 21 b e i j r f s i e i j e i j 100 then the conditional value at risk cva r β s i of the scheme corresponding to the above set of benefit deviations at the confidence level β is calculated according to eq 15 4 according to r f s i and cva r β s i the objective function value corresponding to the risk attitude α of the decision maker is calculated which is the fitness function of the scheme s i 2 4 selection and determination of evaluation indicators in an actual operation process of cascade hydropower stations the decision maker seeks not only to pursue the maximum actual benefits but also to ensure the safe and stable operation of the power system therefore in this paper we use three indexes including power shortage power consumption and power curtailment to reflect the power generation benefit in a planning horizon hereafter referring to the next day of hydropower station when there is a deviation between the forecasted inflow and the measured inflow the actual power generation of the cascade hydropower stations deviates from the planned power generation the power deviation ed occurred in a planning horizon is defined as follows 22 e d i 1 n t 1 t n i t act n i t pre δ t where n i t act and n i t pre are the planned and actual output of the hydropower station i during period t when the power deviation is less than 0 the actual power generation of a planning horizon is smaller than the planned power generation which leads to the benefit loss of hydropower station manager and may cause the operation risk of the electric system therefore the power shortage is used to reflect the risks in actual operation and the smaller the power shortage is the safer the planned scheme will be meanwhile the cvar is calculated in the scheme determination and used to quantify the power shortage of each alternative scheme in addition the occurrence of water abandonment indicates that the hydropower resources have not been fully utilized and the planned scheme can be better based on the available water volume the power curtailment is further used to reflect the wasted hydropower resources and the smaller the power curtailment is the larger the more power generation will be the power consumption is used to represent the actual benefit based on the planned scheme based on the deviation the power shortage es power curtailment ec and power consumption ea can be calculated as follow 1 if e d 0 there is a power

jinsha river which originated from the bayankala mountains and the corresponding area of the yalung river basin is 13 6 104 km2 the jinguan cascade hydropower stations including the jinxi hydropower station jindong hydropower station and guandi hydropower station are downstream of the yalung river basin and were selected in this case study these stations are a key component of china s yalung river cascade hydropower station system which plays an important role in guaranteeing the power supply of the sichuan chongqing power grid and affects the overall power generation of the cascade hydropower stations jiang et al 2018 tan et al 2020 the main characteristic parameters of these stations are shown in table 1 the jinxi reservoir is an annual regulation reservoir and the others are daily regulation reservoirs the main purpose of these cascade hydropower stations is to maximize the total hydropower generated at present a deterministic forecasting system is used to guide the operation of the cascade hydropower stations to develop an optimal scheme with a planning horizon of 24 h the forecasted streamflow sequences were produced using a time step of 6 h with lead times ranging from 6 to 24 h the streamflow sequence could be subdivided into more periods to obtain the optimal operation plan the location of jinxi reservoir is shown in fig 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis of forecast uncertainty and simulation of forecast error sequence to establish a joint probability function p v f r e we used k means cluster analysis to divide the historical streamflow data into three magnitudes magnitude 1 m1 magnitude 2 m2 and magnitude 3 m3 in which the cluster centroid of m3 is greater than that of m2 and the cluster centroid of m2 is greater than that of m1 the analysis of forecast uncertainty is the basic research for the formulation of scheme and therefore the elaborate processes of results of the joint probability function for each magnitude are given in supplementary material s3 after obtaining the p v f r e we simulated the relative forecast error sequences for different magnitudes generated a set of possible measured inflow sequences based on the simulation results using eq 18 and analyzed the set of possible measured inflow sequences fig 3 shows the expected values at 90 credible interval and the corresponding actual measured values of 300 possible measured inflow sequences for various magnitudes for the same magnitude as the forecast period increased the range of the 90 confidence interval gradually became larger that is the forecast uncertainty gradually increased with the forecast period meanwhile for the same forecast period as the magnitude of the forecast increased the 90 confidence interval gradually became larger that is the forecast uncertainty increased as the magnitude of the forecasted streamflow sequence increased in addition most of the measured values were close to the expected values and fell within the 90 confidence interval therefore using the method described above to establish p e f reflects the uncertainty of short term streamflow forecasting which can be used later for obtaining the optimal model 4 2 effect of forecast uncertainty under different magnitudes on the hydropower stations operation to prove the necessity of the above classification results and verify the theoretical analysis of the impact of forecast errors on the power deviation in section 2 1 2 we analyzed the impact of streamflow forecast errors of different magnitudes on the short term optimal operation of cascade hydropower stations first we took the forecasted streamflow sequences as inputs and used the traditional deterministic optimization model to formulate an optimal operation plan according to the measured streamflow sequence we then used the method of controlling the water level to implement the established optimal operation plan and analyzed the power deviation of the cascade hydropower stations we selected forecasted streamflow sequences from 100 scenarios and the corresponding measured streamflow sequences with three magnitudes the mean forecast error se 1 t t 1 t e t was used to reflect the forecast precision in each planning horizon fig 4 shows the results of the power deviation for a single power station and the total power deviation of three hydropower stations in each scenario with different magnitudes the following conclusions are drawn 1 although the mean forecast error se under m3 was more likely to deviate from 0 the power deviation for a single hydropower station or three hydropower stations under m1 and m2 was much larger than the corresponding power deviation under m3 2 under m1 or m2 e d gradually decreased with increasing se and the result of se multiply e d is greater than or equal to 0 3 the relationship between se and e d in m3 was very complicated depending on whether se is greater than or less than 0 ed can be greater than or less than 0 to analyze the reasons for the conclusions described above 50 optimal operation schemes for each magnitude were selected for comparison and the water level results are shown in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 noticeable differences existed in the planned water level process of three reservoirs for the different forecast magnitudes the jinxi hydropower station lowered the water level and increased the discharge at different magnitudes there was little difference in the water level process of the jindong hydropower station for the different magnitudes while the water level process of guandi hydropower station gradually increased with increasing magnitude table 2 shows the average planned power generation of each hydropower station for three magnitudes noticeably the full power generation capacities of the jinxi hydropower station jindong hydropower station and guandi hydropower station in a planning horizon are 86 40 115 20 and 57 60 gw h therefore comparing the planned power generation in table 2 we know that as the forecast magnitude increased the total available water volume in the cascade increased so the planned power generation of each power station in the cascade showed an increasing trend and the planned power generation was far less than the full power generation when the magnitudes of the forecasted streamflow sequences were m1 and m2 this showed that the hydropower in the cascade for m1 and m2 had neither reached the upper limit of the power generation flow nor the expected output value most of the time at this time if the inflow were too large too small increasing decreasing the inflow would increase decrease in the power generation flow which in turn would lead to an increase decrease in the power output in this period which is the reason for conclusion 2 above the planned power generation of each power station in the cascade for m3 was close to the full power generation indicating that the outflow during most periods at this time was close to or greater than the upper limit of the power generation flow at this time if the inflow were too large increasing the outflow might reduce the power water head and then reduce the expected output and it could eventually lead to a decrease in the actual electricity production if the inflow were too small reducing the outflow would not necessarily affect the power generation and it might increase the water head and thereby increase the expected output this eventually would lead to an increase in the actual electricity this is the reason for conclusion 3 above when the increased flow did not affect the power generation water head or the decreased flow did not affect the power generation flow the increase decrease of the inflow did not affect the actual power generation result for m3 therefore compared with m1 and m2 the error of the streamflow forecast at m3 had little effect on the power generation which is the reason for conclusion 1 above summarily for different forecasted streamflow sequence magnitudes the characteristics of the power deviation caused by the forecast errors were markedly different due to the effect of the output characteristics of the cascade hydropower stations therefore either overestimation or underestimation of actual streamflow may result in the reduction or increase of power generation and it is necessary to discuss the effects of the proposed model at various streamflow sequence magnitudes cassagnole et al 2021 next we select a scenario in each of the streamflow forecast sequences at the three magnitudes and analyze the differences in the cvar schom calculation process of the proposed model at the different magnitudes 4 3 formulation of optimal operation schemes considering different confidence levels and risk attitudes in this study we selected one scenario for the forecasted streamflow sequence at each magnitude and set the confidence level β to 0 9 and the risk attitude α to 0 0 4 0 8 0 9 and 1 the optimal operation schemes for the different α values were obtained and shown in fig 6 there were noticeable differences in the water level process at the different magnitudes furthermore fig 7 shows the loss function ψ s l of each scheme for the different magnitudes there were noticeable differences in the loss function corresponding to the optimal schemes at different α values and forecast magnitudes compared with the forecasted streamflow sequences with magnitudes m2 and m3 the tails of the loss functions corresponding to different α values under m1 were not much different in addition as the magnitude of the forecast increased the loss function corresponding to the optimal solution at different α values became steeper that is the tail risk loss decreased as the magnitude increased the loss function for m3 was the steepest this indicated that the loss for m3 was more concentrated namely the percentage of actual power generation deviating from the planned power generation was closer to zero this was the same result as that obtained from the above analysis of conclusion 3 furthermore we analyzed the target benefits and mean excess losses of the optimal scheme for different α and β values under different magnitudes the results are shown in fig 8 fig 8 shows that as the risk attitude α increased the target benefits of the scheme gradually decreased and the absolute value of the corresponding mean excess loss also gradually decreased this showed that when the risk and benefit were balanced by adjusting the risk attitude of the decision makers the two conflicted with each other that is the risk must be reduced increased by reducing increasing the benefit at the same time higher confidence levels also mean greater risk summarily decision makers can reduce the possible risk of the optimal solution of the model by reducing the confidence level and increasing the risk attitude 4 4 comparative analysis of different schemes considering three indicators the above analysis showed that the short term optimal operational risk of the cascade hydropower stations was affected by the magnitudes of the forecasted streamflow sequences and the complex water allocation between the cascades it is difficult to verify the model through the results of single scenario analysis therefore we randomly selected 100 streamflow forecasting sequences of different magnitudes and we statistically analyzed the actual application performance of the model the confidence level β was set to 0 9 and 0 95 and the risk attitude α was set to 0 0 4 0 8 0 9 and 1 the power shortage es power curtailment ec and power consumption ea of cascade hydropower stations for the different magnitudes are shown in figs 9 11 fig 9 shows the value of ea in each scenario for different magnitudes compared with m2 the points of m1 and m3 were more concentrated this indicated that compared to m2 α had little effect on ea at m1 and m3 but in general under each magnitude as α increased the set of corresponding points showed a downward trend indicating that when α increased ea decreased in addition compared with ea from the traditional deterministic optimization model dom the results at different magnitudes were also different under m1 or m2 the ea for the dom was located in the middle of the point group which showed that the benefits of cvar schom at m1 and m2 included both those higher and lower than the actual benefits of the dom under m3 the dom corresponding points were mostly located above the point group which shows that the cvar schom model under m3 had lower actual benefits than the dom in most scenarios the comparison of the effects of the confidence level β on cvar schom at the different magnitudes shows that unlike the positions at m2 the positions of the points corresponding to the two β values at m1 and m3 were not far from each other this shows that the confidence level had little effect on the actual benefits at m1 and m3 fig 10 shows that under m1 or m2 the electricity shortage es and the mean forecast se were generally positively correlated that is es gradually increased with se in addition when se 0 only the results with the risk attitude equal to zero were more than 0 the cascade power stations were not operating at full power generation at this time and the power shortage is greater than zero due to the decrease in the water head under m3 the schemes under different risk attitudes all had e s 0 moreover by analyzing the degree of aggregation of the point sets we found that as the magnitude increased the point set at m1 was most concentrated the point set at m2 was the most dispersed and the degree of aggregation of point set at m3 was between those at m1 and m2 this reflected the effect of the risk attitudes on the tail loss of the optimal scheme at the different forecasted streamflow sequence magnitudes at the same time similar to the analysis of the power consumption compared to the impact of the confidence level on the tail loss at m1 the risk attitude had a greater impact on the tail loss of the optimal schemes at m2 and m3 fig 11 shows that under m1 or m2 the power curtailment es and the mean forecast error se were generally negatively correlated that is as se increased es gradually decreased in addition when se 0 only the results with the risk attitude equal to 1 were greater than 0 the cascade power stations were not operating at full power generation under this circumstance and power curtailment is greater than zero due to the increase in the water head under m3 the schemes under different risk attitudes all had e s 0 and the points of dom were all located below those of the cvar schom this indicated that compared with the dom the cvar schom at m3 increased the wasted water resources the points of the dom at m2 were located in the center of the point set at m1 the points of the dom were located completely above that of the cvar schom indicating that the cvar schom at m1 increased the water utilization furthermore the mean value for the improvement was evaluated by subtracting the calculation result of the dom from the calculation result of the cvar schom the result is shown in fig 12 fig 12 shows that at different magnitudes the three indicators corresponding to the improvement at different confidence levels β and risk attitudes α were noticeably different when the magnitude of the forecasted streamflow sequence was m1 all the es values were less than 0 and all the ec values were greater than 0 as the risk attitude increased ea changed from greater than 0 to less than 0 compared with the traditional dom the cvar schom decreased ec by at least 159 9 mw h increased es by at most 130 1 mw h and increased ea by at most 369 3 mw h at m2 all the ec values were greater than 0 as the risk attitude increased ea changed from greater than 0 to less than 0 and es changed from less than 0 to greater than 0 the cvar schom decreased ec by at least 305 7 mw h increased es by at most 346 1 mw h and increased ea by at most 1503 8 mw h in addition when the confidence level was between 0 8 and 0 9 there were situations where all three were greater than 0 at m3 all the es values were greater than 0 all the ec values were less than 0 and all the ea values were also less than 0 the proposed model yielded a minimum increase in ec of 223 9 mw h a minimum increase in es of 454 8 mw h and a minimum decrease in ea of 386 7 mw h summarily compared with the dom the cvar schom could more effectively increase the benefits and reduce the water resource waste at m1 it could simultaneously increase the benefits reduce the risks and reduce the water resource waste at m2 and it could effectively reduce the operational risks at m3 5 conclusions the uncertainty of the streamflow forecast has an important effect on the actual performance of the short term optimal operation of cascade hydropower stations this study proved that considering the effect of the uncertainty of the streamflow forecast on the actual benefits and actual risks in the process of establishing the optimal model is of great significance for improving the benefits of the short term operation of cascade hydropower stations and for risk reduction beginning with the two characteristics of short term streamflow forecast uncertainty the conditional value at risk theory was introduced to analyze the possible losses during operation planning and a short term optimal operation model of cascade hydropower stations was established that balanced the benefits and risks using the jinguan cascade hydropower stations in the yalung river basin as an example we analyzed the computing principle and actual utility of the model in detail the main conclusions were as follows 1 the results of the analysis of the historical forecast and measured streamflow sequences showed that as the forecast magnitude increased the forecast uncertainty increased and the relative error alone was not sufficient to measure the characteristics of the forecast uncertainty changes with forecasted streamflow magnitude at different magnitudes the forecast uncertainty increased with the increase in the forecast period and there was a significant magnitude correlation between the relative forecast errors in the different periods the kernel function and student t copula function were used to analyze the uncertainty of the short term streamflow forecasts at different magnitudes the simulation results showed that as the magnitude of the forecast increased the range of the 90 confidence interval gradually increased and most of the measured values were close to the expected value within the 90 confidence interval indicating that the established conditional distribution function could reflect the uncertainty of the forecasts at different magnitudes 2 from the analysis of the power deviation at the different forecast magnitudes we found that the characteristics of the power deviation were related not only to the forecast uncertainty but also to the forecasted streamflow magnitude although the forecast uncertainty was the greatest for the forecasted streamflow sequence magnitude of m3 the power deviation was generally small the power deviation was greater at m2 which had a medium forecast uncertainty m1 was between m2 and m3 in addition at m1 and m2 the power deviation and the forecast error showed a negative correlation overall as the forecast error decreased the power deviation increased and had the same sign as the forecast error there was no significant positive or negative correlation between the forecast error and the power deviation at m3 therefore it is crucial to discuss the applicability of the proposed model at different magnitudes 3 in the model proposed in this study the target benefit and the risk attitude can be balanced by adjusting the confidence level and risk attitude in the objective function however for different magnitudes the effects of the confidence levels and risk attitudes on the optimal plan were different by analyzing the distribution function of the conditional value at risk of the optimal scheme under different magnitudes we found that as the magnitude increased the distribution function gradually became steeper indicating that the risk corresponding to the optimal scheme became more concentrated that is under the same confidence level the percentage of possible losses gradually decreased moreover as the confidence level and risk attitude increased the target benefit and mean excess loss of the optimal plan both showed decreasing trends 4 by comparing and analyzing the actual application performance of the proposed model and a traditional model we found that the proposed model was able to achieve good results in real world applications and this was not only limited to special cases in addition the proposed model performed differently at different magnitudes the model was able to effectively increase the benefits and reduce the water source waste at m1 which was associated with lower risks and various benefits this model was able to simultaneously increase the benefits and reduce water resource waste at m2 which was associated with a higher risk the model was able to effectively reduce the operational risks at m3 which was associated with higher operational benefits therefore different decision makers can decide whether to use the proposed model based on their balanced considerations of different goals they can also balance each goal by adjusting the confidence level and risk attitude while this study has looked at the analysis of the uncertainty in the short term optimal operation of cascade hydropower stations to maximize power generation more factors including the medium streamflow forecast climate change and power market can be considered to make the final optimal more suitable and flexible besides a dynamic conditional value at risk theory could also be implemented and tested to compare their behavior in the cascade hydropower stations management credit authorship contribution statement yuan liu conceptualization investigation writing original draft changming ji methodology

3773,large scale afforestation can combat desertification provide ecosystem services and mitigate climate change however it can also have negative effects on the hydrological cycle and water budget and thus on water security in dryland regions depending on the afforestation strategy used currently the effects of different afforestation strategies on soil moisture dynamics evapotranspiration et and water budget at the stand scale are unclear in this study we investigated the water budget in two poplar stands one planted using a low coverage mode shelterbelt lcms strategy and the other planted using a conventional strategy control deep drainage dp as an indicator of water budget was estimated using a hydrus 1d model calibrated with the observed soil moisture at different soil depths across 0 200 cm during the growing seasons in 2016 2017 and 2019 the average dp in the lcms stand was 107 0 149 6 mm accounting for 36 5 42 4 of the rainfall occurring during the growing seasons which was slightly higher than that in the control stand containing younger trees at a higher density however dp was more spatially heterogenous in the lcms stand compared with in the control stand specifically in the lcms stand the inter canopy dp was 195 3 237 5 mm accounting for 66 6 69 7 of the rainfall whereas the under canopy dp was only 18 7 65 0 mm accounting for 6 4 18 4 of the rainfall during the corresponding period structural equation modeling indicated that on a daily scale soil moisture had the greatest effect on dp followed by precipitation and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity other climate factors global radiation air temperature vapor pressure deficit and wind speed and vegetation structure parameters leaf area index and rooting depth affected et which had a significantly negative relationship with dp these results help explain the effects of plantation strategy on the water budget with important implications for artificial forest management ecological

over past decades large scale afforestation in china has greatly contributed to global greening efforts and provided multiple forest ecosystem services such as desertification control carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation bala et al 2007 liu et al 2008 bryan et al 2018 lu et al 2018 however previous studies have indicated that compared to natural forests plantations may consume more water for evapotranspiration et due to their fast growth and short rotation yu et al 2019 and can even cause soil desiccation in many regions such as the loess plateau in china chen et al 2008 additionally large scale ecological restoration involving afforestation and reforestation may negatively affect the balance between land restoration and water resource conservation at regional scale feng et al 2016 for example zhao et al 2020 reported that large scale ecological restoration was the primary cause for water depletion consuming stored terrestrial water at an average rate of 16 6 5 0 mm yr 1 in the mu us sandyland in china therefore it is important for researchers and policymakers to evaluate the ecohydrological impacts of afforestation and its effect on local water resources in drylands particularly under climate change ostad ali askar et al 2018 schwärzel et al 2020 soil moisture is an essential component of the hydrological cycle and plays an important role in the formation transformation and depletion of local water resources particularly in drylands feng et al 2018 ren et al 2018 under similar climate topographic and soil conditions vegetation type and structure are regarded as key factors influencing spatiotemporal changes in soil moisture plants can spatially redistribute precipitation through interception and infiltration and can affect soil evaporation by canopy shading and water uptake by roots feng et al 2018 nan et al 2019 although the effects of the vegetation type and structure on soil moisture have been widely reported e g fan et

2019 šípek et al 2020 it is possible to adopt dp as an indicator reflecting the influence of vegetation on the water budget especially in ecosystems with highly conductive soil horizons such as deserts dp has been successfully estimated in many ecosystems via a series of methods including lysimeters gunawardena et al 2011 yang et al 2014 schwärzel et al 2020 isotope tracers girard et al 1997

šípek et al 2020 and regional scale ecosystems hu et al 2019 most previous studies have analyzed the effects of climate vegetation type and soil properties on dp independently however to better understand the effects of afforestation on dp the integrated effects of this factors need to be determined lai et al 2016 poplar is a common tree species in afforestation efforts worldwide poplar plantations are thought to have a high water demand due to their fast growth and high transpiration levels compared with natural forests yu et al 2019 however this species has played an important role in combating desertification in china for example song et al 2021 reported that 18 year old poplar plantations in a semiarid sandy region of northeast china with a density of 433 trees ha 1 were vulnerable to dieback in extreme drought years this was due to high groundwater uptake to sustain a higher canopy transpiration rate in recent years an innovative shelterbelt planting strategy that is the low coverage mode shelterbelt lcms has been developed in many desert ecosystems in china in this strategy trees are planted using an alternating wide and narrow row spacing scheme to ensure a low coverage 10 30 or density at a given site yang et al 2017 wang et al 2020 this strategy has been proven to be robust because it not only provides multiple services such as protecting crops and the soil surface within the belt from wind erosion but also facilitates plant survival and growth by improving microclimate conditions such as reducing wind speed and decreasing daytime air temperatures liu et al 2020 most importantly lcms stands may consume less soil water to meet the demand of tree survival and growth due to lower tree density compared to the plantations using a traditional afforestation strategy thus maintaining the stability of forested ecosystems and producing greater dp for the sustainable protection of local water resources in drylands yang et al 2017 yang et al 2021 however the underlying mechanisms by which different afforestation strategies affect hydrological processes are not fully understood the objectives of this study were to i explore and compare the spatiotemporal patterns of soil volumetric water content θ and dp between an lcms poplar plot and a control plot using the calibrated and validated hydrus 1d model during the growing seasons across different hydrological years and ii quantify integrated effects and the relative contribution of different bio physical parameters including microclimate vegetation structures and soil hydraulic

properties therebefore we used the lai r d and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity k s to reflect the effects of the time interval or tree age on hydrological processes thus we can only determine the effects of afforestation strategy to soil moisture and dp 2 2 field experimental measurements to compare the impacts of the spatiotemporal variation in vegetation structure on dp measurements were

and t p is the potential evaporation rate mm d 1 the experimental site was flat most fine roots were distributed in soil layers from 10 to 120 cm and most of the main roots were 200 cm the modeled soil profile was set up to 200 cm and divided into eight layers 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 100 100 120 120 160 and 160 200 cm similar to the θ measurements as shown in fig 2 the upper boundary condition was defined as an atmospheric boundary precipitation and evaporation and free drainage was defined at the bottom boundary at a depth of 200 cm fig 2 the groundwater levels were approximately 7 5 m in 2019 therebefore we ignored the effects of changes in groundwater level on dp in the study value specified initial and boundary conditions were considered at each location which were defined in the model according to the measured θ at the beginning of the simulation period in this study soil hydraulic parameters were initially estimated with the rosetta pedotransfer function from the soil texture and bulk density schaap et al 2001 the function was defined with the van genuchten mualem constitutive relationships mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 4 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n 1 1 n h 0 θ s h 0

deep soil profile was excavated in both the lcms plot and control plot for each of eight layers mentioned above three undisturbed soil cores were collected to obtain bulk density using the oven drying method 105 for 24 h and approximately 1 kg disturbed soil were used to measure particle size distribution using the hydrometer method then the observed θ in each soil layer was adopted to calibrate the parameters of the richards equation via the inverse option over a 200 d period april 15 october 31 2016 using the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm implemented in the hydrus 1d model another 400 days april 15 october 31 2017 and april 15 october 31 2019 of the observed θ data were applied to validate the model then we applied the validated hydrus 1d model to evaluate the spatial patterns of θ et and dp interpolations of daily lai values of the poplar trees at the under canopy locations lpuc and cpuc during the growing season april 15 october 31 were achieved using the method employed by di et al 2019 in contrast at the inter canopy locations lpic and cpic interpolations of daily lai values of the grass were obtained using the calculation method given in adane et al 2018 the r d of plants was calculated on each day using a two stage method analogous to the method employed by camargo and kemanian 2016 which assumed that r d increase sharply with temperature to the maximum value in the early growing season and subsequently remained constant analogously we assumed that the r d increased by 1 mm each day from april 15 to august 31 and thereafter remained constant from september to october according to seasonal patterns in soil temperature across the 0 100 cm soil profile data not listed and vertical distribution of roots and poplar tree age in the site the initial r d at the lpuc lpic cpuc and cpic locations were 1 0 0 3 0 8 and 0 5 m respectively the daily et mm in non rainfall periods was calculated using eq 7 7 et t r e s where t r is transpiration mm and e s is soil evaporation mm here t r and e s are equal to the root water uptake and evaporative fluxes from soil respectively which were simulated by the calibrated hydrus 1d rainfall interception i was estimated from lai m2 m 2 and p values with the following equation as described in watt et al 2007 and xi et al 2016 8 i 0 05 l a i p the performance of the hydrus 1d model was assessed based on two criteria the mean absolute error mae cm3 cm 3 or mm and the root mean square error rmse cm3 cm 3 or mm as follows mae 1 n i 1 n p i o i and 9 10 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 1 2 where p i is the predicted value o i is the observed value and n is the number of observed values 2 4 analysis of the integrated impacts of the bio physical parameters on dp structural equation modeling sem was performed to distinguish and quantify the direct and indirect effects of bio physical factors on dp the coefficients of direct paths represent the standardized partial regression while indirect paths indicate the product of possible path coefficients being summed over all indirect paths and the sum of direct and indirect path coefficients yields the total path coefficient hayat et al 2020 the initial model included all potential paths involving the factors that have been widely reported to influence dp and et such as climate factors vegetation structure lai r d k s and soil moisture the final adopted model met the following conditions the normed chi square value was 1 3 the root mean square residual was 0 05 and the goodness of fit index value was greater than 0 9 chen et al 2020 sem was applied within amos software version 24 0 ibm spss chicago il usa considering the hysteresis of the impacts of rainfall on θ and dp due to the process of infiltration a cross correlation analysis between daily θ and dp was used to determine the optimal time of the hysteresis the determining coefficient changed parabolically within a 10 day period and the greatest r 2 value was observed on the fifth day r 2 0 046 p 0 001 therefore the fifth day was chosen to represent the optimal time of the hysteresis because the sample size was notably larger than 200 the mardia coefficient of each model in regard to multivariate kurtosis exceeded three indicating significant multivariate data nonnormality therefore the bollen stine bootstrap p procedure was implemented to adjust the model fit and parameter estimates to accommodate the lack of multivariate normality bollen and stine 1992 johnston and faulkner 2021 to overcome the observed problem of strong collinearity between r g t a and d and between lai and r d we assumed that these related paths yielded equal effects on et in the sem as suggested by marsh et al 2004 3 results 3 1 micrometeorological variables lai and et although there were similar seasonal parabolic patterns among r g t a and d the difference in the maximum and mean values and the degree of fluctuation in d reflected distinct combinations of t a and rh over time fig 3 a d a relatively low d may be partly attributed to a low u during the late period in 2019 fig 3e the total measured p was 345 4 357 2 and 314 2 mm in 2016 2017 and 2019 respectively this indicates that 2016 and 2017 experienced normal rainfall while less rainfall occurred in 2019 fig 3f the occurrence of p was dominated by light rain 5 mm with a frequency of 56 9 76 1 followed by moderate rainfall 5 20 mm with a frequency of 17 9 37 3 heavy rainfall 20 40 mm with a frequency of 3 9 16 7 and rainstorms greater than 40 mm with a frequency of 2 in the three years the percentage of cumulative p were relatively similar across rainfall types with the range of 12 9 34 2 for each rainfall type in 2016 and 2019 however in 2017 heavy rain contributed to 50 3 of cumulative p the dynamics of the interpolated lai of poplar trees at the under canopy locations lpuc and cpuc were well approximated by bimodal trends assuming negligible variation in lai across the growing seasons comparatively at the inter canopy locations lpic and cpic the interpolated lai of the grass were obtained with a parabola the peak lai values at the lpuc lpic cpuc and cpic locations were 2 02 0 38 1 77 and 0 88 on august 8 in 2019 respectively fig 3g seasonal variation of the simulated et for the lcms plot and the control plot reflected the integrated impacts of r g t a d u and p from april to october while the spatial variation of et within each plot was mainly attributed to the difference in lai and r d between the locations of under canopy and inter canopy the total et across the lpuc lpic cpuc and cpic locations ranged from 319 9 to 338 7 143 0 153 9 264 1 284 5 and 182 1 186 2 mm respectively during the growing season fig 3h 3 2 observed soil moisture the θ values were grouped into three soil layers shallow 0 40 cm middle 40 100 cm and deep 100 200 cm layers to compare the vertical patterns along the 200 cm soil profile between the under and inter canopy locations in each plot and at the same locations between the two plots in 2016 2017 and 2019 fig 4 in general the amplitude of the variation in θ decreased with depth in the two plots during the growing seasons indicating that θ was more variable in the shallow and middle layers than in the deep layer this may be the result of stronger integrated impacts of p i t r and e s on θ in the shallow and middle soil layers than in the deep soil layer in the lcms plot the θ in the shallow layer at lpuc ranged from 0 040 to 0 197 cm3 cm 3 with an average value of 0 085 cm3 cm 3 throughout the whole study period which was significantly lower than that at lpic p 0 05 in 2016 but higher p 0 05 than that in 2017 and 2019 reflecting the difference in the integrated impacts of these processes across the growing seasons however the θ values in the middle and deep soil layers at lpuc ranging from 0 069 to 0 193 cm3 cm 3 and 0 063 0 090 cm3 cm 3 respectively with average values of 0 089 cm3 cm 3 and 0 074 cm3 cm 3 respectively were significantly lower than those at lpic p 0 05 in 2017 and 2019 except for the middle soil layer in 2016 suggesting that the roots of trees consumed less soil water thus resulting in more meteoric water infiltrating and reaching the deep layer at lpic in the lcms plot in the control plot the average θ values in the shallow middle and deep soil layers at cpuc were 0 076 cm3 cm 3 0 088 cm3 cm 3 and 0 092 cm3 cm 3 in 2016 2017 and 2019 respectively which were significantly higher than those at cpic p 0 05 where the average θ values were 0 063 cm3 cm 3 0 066 cm3 cm 3 and 0 092 cm3 cm 3 respectively although cpic was located in the inter canopy the lower θ value indicated different impacts of the hydrological processes on the soil water regime in this narrow row spacing plot compared to those in the lcms plot the presence of a pinus tabulaeformis tree near the measuring point may have contributed to the much lower θ value at cpuc moreover the variation in θ in the two plots in 2019 seemed to be lower which agreed with the smaller total rainfall amount than that in 2016 and 2017 3 3 calibration and validation of the hydrus 1d model the estimated van genuchten mualem hydraulic parameters of the hydrus 1d model for the different soil layers in each plot based on the measured θ data from april 15 to october 31 2016 are listed in table 1 the table reflects the difference in soil hydraulic properties between the various soil layers and between the two locations in these two plots the simulated and measured θ values in the different layers along the 200 cm profile at the lpuc location in the lcms plot are shown in fig 5 although the modeling deviation in the shallow layer was relatively higher than that in the deep soil layer there was a generally good agreement between the simulated and measured θ values during both the calibration and validation periods as shown in table 2 the performance of the hydrus 1d model was satisfactory as indicated by the mae and rmse values in general the deviations between the measured and simulated θ values were low among the four locations the average mae values at the lpuc lpic cpuc and cpic locations were 0 010 0 014 0 016 and 0 012 cm3 cm 3 respectively while the rmse values were 0 013 0 017 0 020 and 0 017 cm3 cm 3 respectively during the calibration period the mae values at lpuc lpic cpuc and cpic were 0 013 0 013 0 020 and 0 010 cm3 cm 3 respectively and the rmse values were 0 015 0 016 0 023 and 0 013 cm3 cm 3 respectively during the validation period 2019 3 4 deep drainage modeling in general the seasonal dp varied across the years locations and plots during the whole study period fig 6 most dp peaks occurred in the middle of the growing season which seemed to coincide with rainfall events particularly heavy rain the average dp across the four locations was 127 5 mm 142 0 mm and 103 4 mm during the growing season in 2016 2017 and 2019 respectively which was consistent with the order of total rainfall amount however dp in 2017 was 10 2 higher than that in 2016 despite these years having a similar total rainfall this may be partly attributed to the higher proportion of heavy rain and storms in 2017 50 3 in 2017 vs 36 9 in 2016 the average total dp in the lcms plot ranged from 107 0 to 149 6 mm with 36 5 42 4 of the rainfall occurring during the growing seasons which was slightly higher than that in the control plot however compared to the control plot the observed dp exhibited a higher spatial heterogeneity in the lcms plot specifically the total dp at the lpuc lpic cpuc and cpic locations ranged from 18 7 to 65 0 195 3 237 5 74 1 117 1 and 125 4 151 9 mm respectively which accounted for 6 4 18 4 66 6 69 7 23 1 33 2 and 42 8 43 8 of the rainfall during the same period respectively 3 5 response of dp to the biophysical factors sem indicated that the θ p and k s had significantly positive direct effects on dp while et had a significantly negative effect on a daily scale p 0 001 fig 7 moreover p had an indirect effect on dp by increasing the θ while k s had an indirect effect by decreasing soil moisture p 0 001 in terms of et r d was the most important predictor of daily et over the lai p 0 001 climate factors including r g t a rh d and u were significantly related to et p 0 001 however their path coefficients were lower than 0 1 except for r g in this study et was positively related to θ p 0 001 indicating that et involving t r and e s was significantly influenced by soil water availability in this water limited ecosystem likewise p was positively related to θ p 0 001 due to the effect of rainwater infiltration 4 discussion 4 1 reliability of using hydrus 1d to model soil moisture and dp the hydrus 1d model has been successfully applied to simulate soil moisture dynamics and subsurface water flux such as dp or groundwater recharge across various forest stands including evergreen broad leafed forests lai et al 2016 broad leafed deciduous forests xi et al 2016 coniferous forests šípek et al 2020 fan et al 2015 qi et al 2018 and apple orchards li et al 2019 moreover this model has been employed to quantify the impacts of climate vegetation structure and soil properties on hydrological processes šimůnek et al 2016 in this study θ dynamics in the two plots were simulated using the calibrated hydrus 1d model during three growing seasons the average mae and rmse values at each location ranged from 0 011 to 0 016 cm3 cm 3 and 0 015 0 020 cm3 cm 3 respectively across the seasons and plots in general the values were similar to those in previous studies lai et al 2016 xi et al 2016 fan et al 2015 this suggests that model calibration was successfully achieved with relative mae values of 14 2 and 20 6 on average in the lcms and control plots respectively however a relatively high deviation of the simulated θ was found in the 40 60 cm soil layer at the cpuc location in 2019 this deviation could be the result of two factors first the active exchange of the water flux such as infiltration transpiration and evaporation may produce large simulation errors in the main root distribution layer galleguillos et al 2017 second this deviation may partly be the result of our simplified assumption that the values and patterns of lai and r d are the same across the three growing seasons which may cause potential errors in t r and i estimation and thus in θ simulation we collected relevant references to compare the results of dp estimation to those for other poplar stands worldwide in table 3 annual drainage in the various poplar stands ranged from 11 to 958 mm accounting for 1 9 89 0 of the annual rainfall with very high fluctuations due to differences in climate rainfall vegetation structure and soil properties across the sites in this study the total simulated dp during the growing seasons at the lpuc and lpic locations ranged from 18 7 to 65 0 and 195 3 237 5 mm respectively accounting for 6 4 18 4 and 66 6 69 7 of the rainfall in the growing seasons respectively these results reasonably agree with the dp estimates reported in other studies preston and mcbride 2004 fan et al 2015 parish et al 2019 manevski et al 2019 brédoire et al 2020 therefore these results indicate that the calibrated hydrus 1d model can be employed to simulate the spatiotemporal patterns of soil moisture and dp of poplar stands in the semi arid region 4 2 integrated effects of the meteorological factors vegetation structure soil moisture and hydraulic properties on dp precipitation is usually a primary water source for dp in rainfed plantation ecosystems previous studies have reported that dp is significantly influenced by the total amount and intensity of rainfall at the stand scale such as in mobile sandy land yang et al 2014 liu et al 2015 and evergreen broad leaf forest lai et al 2016 areas and at the regional scale such as on the loess plateau hu et al 2019 in this study the average dp value across the two plots was 127 5 142 0 and 103 4 mm during the growing seasons of 2016 2017 and 2019 respectively following a similar pattern as the annual precipitation which was 345 4 357 2 and 314 2 mm in 2016 2017 and 2019 respectively the higher frequency 50 3 of heavy rainfall in 2017 may have resulted in greater dp through downward rainwater infiltration compared with in 2016 which had a similar amount of total rainfall but lower frequency of heavy rainfall this suggests that both the amount and pattern of rainfall have significant influences on the variation in dp during the growing season in addition to the direct effects sem indicated that p could indirectly influence dp through its impacts on θ fig 7 on the one hand p may have a positive indirect effect on dp by increasing θ through rainwater infiltration on the other hand p may have a negative effect on dp by enhancing the water supply to sustain et and its components including i and t r soil moisture has been widely considered the most important factor influencing dp across various sites for example lai et al 2016 found that compared to the effects of rain characteristics antecedent moisture had the greatest relative contribution to dp 85 7 in an evergreen broad leaf forest in the taihu lake basin china in this study our results indicate that compared to the other factors such as p et and k s dp was dominated by θ across the locations plots and seasons moreover θ played a very important role in the indirect effects of p et and k s on dp fig 7 in summary our results suggest that the recharge mechanism at our site is direct recharge that is water is added to the groundwater reservoir in excess of the soil water deficit and et via direct vertical percolation through the vadose zone rather than indirect or localized recharge as reported by de vries and simmers 2002 in forested ecosystems water fluxes including dp in the subsurface can vary spatially between under and inter canopy areas due to the spatial heterogeneity in the redistribution of rainfall via canopy and water uptake by roots within a stand fan et al 2015 at this site our results indicated that the amount and pattern of dp varied significantly due to the difference in the spatial patterns of the lai and r d across the locations within the plots fig 6 compared to the lpuc location the lower lai and r d values at the lpic location could translate into a lower t r and i while the low e s may be attributed to microclimate effects such as wind speed and air temperature reduction and relative humidity enhancement in the shelterbelt liu et al 2020 thus the sum of i t r and e s led to a lower total et level at lpic thus resulting in more rainwater infiltrating downward to produce dp at the inter canopy location in the lcms plot the situation in the control plot was similar although the difference between the two locations was not as large as that in the lcms plot due to the narrower row spacing schlegel et al 2004 reported that r d played a significant role in water uptake evaporation and drainage within an amazonian agroforestry ecosystem therefore our study elucidates that the impact of the vegetation structure on dp can be naturally revealed through its effects on et due to their negative relationship fig 7 in other words if the location with higher lai and r d values consumes more water et this suggests reduced dp at a given site the opposite is also true k s is a crucial soil physical property that influences soil moisture dynamics and hydrological processes and facilitates planning of vegetation recovery irrigation practice and drainage design zhao et al 2016 valdes abellan et al 2018 generally k s is influenced by the combined effects of parent materials vegetation topography and time by impacting the porosity and pore size distribution zhao et al 2016 in this study k s had a weak positive direct effect on dp and a significant negative effect on the θ this result indicates that a high k s at the lpuc location is beneficial to vertical water flow such as infiltration uptake by roots evaporation and drainage rather than retention in soil table 1 thus resulting in a lower θ fig 4 than that at the lpic location similar to previous studies valdes abellan et al 2018 li et al 2002 in this study despite neglecting the variation in lai and r d across the growing seasons as well as the drawback of the assumption of linear relationships between the bio physical parameters and hydrological processes in the sem equation which may produce uncertainties and potential errors the results still elucidate the underlying mechanism of the combined effects of the spatial heterogeneity in bio physical parameters caused by the different afforestation strategies on hydrological processes at the stand scale our results revealed that antecedent soil moisture p and k s had significantly positive direct effects on dp while et had a significant negative effect at the daily scale the impacts of vegetation structure and microclimate factors on dp could be reflected by their effects on et and its components 4 3 implications of the lcms approach for the management of artificial forest ecosystems and sustainability of water resources the lcms strategy has been demonstrated to prevent soil erosion land desertification and degradation in desert ecosystems in china yang et al 2017 however the effects and underlying mechanisms of lcms on hydrological processes such as et and dp and on the water budget remains unclear generally afforestation with a uniform arrangement and high density can increase et due to the formation of multilayer stands with a high lai and deep root systems thus decreasing dp when compared to grassland in drylands schwärzel et al 2020 on the contrary our results indicated that afforestation with a non uniform arrangement and low density lcms resulted in a larger proportion of dp to the annual rainfall compared with the control plot meanwhile et and dp varied between the different locations due to a high spatial heterogeneity in lai and r d within the plots the inter canopy locations may have had a greater dp due to their lower t r and e s than the under canopy locations therefore rainfall redistribution within the stand could allow the water requirements of the trees to be met additionally the greater dp in the lcms plot could be beneficial to groundwater recharge resulting in a tradeoff between blue water groundwater recharge and green water evaporation therefore local water resources at the regional scale could be ensured schwärzel et al 2020 however as an innovative afforestation strategy more research is still required regarding lcms for example we noted that the et at lpuc was 115 5 of p and the dp was 6 4 in 2019 which was a drier year however the trees in our lcsm plot grew well with minimal dieback or dead individuals despite a negative water budget at lpuc in 2019 the first possible reason was that these poplar trees at lpuc could take up water from deeper soil layer more than 2 m depth and or groundwater when the upper soil water became insufficient because the maximum depth of the taproot of poplar trees can reach the groundwater level although their most roots are distributed within 1 m soil depth in the horqin sandy land song et al 2021 the second possible reason was that the soil water deficit at lpuc was replenished by horizontal exchange of infiltrated water from lpic due to soil water potential gradient between the two locations however further research is needed to determine the amount timing and location of the horizontal water movement or exchange between different locations within the plot and the contribution to tree growth and the water budget especially in dry years furthermore research is still needed to determine the optimal parameters of lcms stands such as the spacing between rows and trees under different climate species and site conditions despite these limitations our results provide evidence that the lcms approach to afforestation and reforestation in drylands can save water compared with traditional afforestation these results not only provide an insight into the impacts of large scale afforestation on ecohydrological cycles and local water resources but also provide a theoretical basis for the sustainable management of planted forests in water limited environments 5 conclusions our results indicate that poplar trees do not act as a water pump if they are planted at a low density in dryland regions in the mature poplar lcms stand studied a positive water budget was maintained and a certain amount of underground water recharge was retained across the growing seasons this indicates that the lcms strategy is sustainable and can save water in dryland regions which is particularly within the context of increasing human activities and climate change our results further indicate that the hydrus 1d model can be applied to simulate the θ in the different soil layers in the two plots studied in summary our major findings were 1 there was more variability in dp between the under and inter canopy locations within the lcms plot than in the control plot 2 dp was controlled by the integrated effects of the spatial heterogeneity of the bio physical parameters on the hydrological processes 3 soil water was the dominant factor influencing dp followed by precipitation and k s and 4 the influences of both microclimate factors and vegetation structure lai and r d reflected the impacts on et which had a significantly negative relationship with dp these findings are beneficial to afforestation and reforestation efforts ecological restoration measures and management of local water resources in water limited

3773,large scale afforestation can combat desertification provide ecosystem services and mitigate climate change however it can also have negative effects on the hydrological cycle and water budget and thus on water security in dryland regions depending on the afforestation strategy used currently the effects of different afforestation strategies on soil moisture dynamics evapotranspiration et and water budget at the stand scale are unclear in this study we investigated the water budget in two poplar stands one planted using a low coverage mode shelterbelt lcms strategy and the other planted using a conventional strategy control deep drainage dp as an indicator of water budget was estimated using a hydrus 1d model calibrated with the observed soil moisture at different soil depths across 0 200 cm during the growing seasons in 2016 2017 and 2019 the average dp in the lcms stand was 107 0 149 6 mm accounting for 36 5 42 4 of the rainfall occurring during the growing seasons which was slightly higher than that in the control stand containing younger trees at a higher density however dp was more spatially heterogenous in the lcms stand compared with in the control stand specifically in the lcms stand the inter canopy dp was 195 3 237 5 mm accounting for 66 6 69 7 of the rainfall whereas the under canopy dp was only 18 7 65 0 mm accounting for 6 4 18 4 of the rainfall during the corresponding period structural equation modeling indicated that on a daily scale soil moisture had the greatest effect on dp followed by precipitation and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity other climate factors global radiation air temperature vapor pressure deficit and wind speed and vegetation structure parameters leaf area index and rooting depth affected et which had a significantly negative relationship with dp these results help explain the effects of plantation strategy on the water budget with important implications for artificial forest management ecological restoration and protection of local water resources in water limited environments keywords poplar species low coverage mode shelterbelt deep drainage bio physical parameters hydrus 1d 1 introduction over past decades large scale afforestation in china has greatly contributed to global greening efforts and provided multiple forest ecosystem services such as desertification control carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation bala et al 2007 liu et al 2008 bryan et al 2018 lu et al 2018 however previous studies have indicated that compared to natural forests plantations may consume more water for evapotranspiration et due to their fast growth and short rotation yu et al 2019 and can even cause soil desiccation in many regions such as the loess plateau in china chen et al 2008 additionally large scale ecological restoration involving afforestation and reforestation may negatively affect the balance between land restoration and water resource conservation at regional scale feng et al 2016 for example zhao et al 2020 reported that large scale ecological restoration was the primary cause for water depletion consuming stored terrestrial water at an average rate of 16 6 5 0 mm yr 1 in the mu us sandyland in china therefore it is important for researchers and policymakers to evaluate the ecohydrological impacts of afforestation and its effect on local water resources in drylands particularly under climate change ostad ali askar et al 2018 schwärzel et al 2020 soil moisture is an essential component of the hydrological cycle and plays an important role in the formation transformation and depletion of local water resources particularly in drylands feng et al 2018 ren et al 2018 under similar climate topographic and soil conditions vegetation type and structure are regarded as key factors influencing spatiotemporal changes in soil moisture plants can spatially redistribute precipitation through interception and infiltration and can affect soil evaporation by canopy shading and water uptake by roots feng et al 2018 nan et al 2019 although the effects of the vegetation type and structure on soil moisture have been widely reported e g fan et

parameters on soil moisture dynamics are rare in particular the effects of different afforestation strategies with different row spacings and configurations of shelterbelts need to be examined deep drainage dp comprises all downward water fluxes in the vadose zone that reach the groundwater table hohenbrink and lischeid 2014 as a primary pathway to recharge groundwater dp links soil moisture dynamics below the rooting zone with the terrestrial hydrological cycle and provides important hydrological and ecosystem benefits in different regions lai et al 2016 dp has traditionally been considered a residual term in the water balance equation in forest ecosystems 1 ds d t p e t r d p where ds dt is the change of soil water content p is the precipitation et is the evapotranspiration r is the surface runoff however because different types and structures of forests can lead to various degrees of decline in dp or groundwater recharge through water use e g adane et al 2018 li et al 2019 šípek et al 2020 it is possible to adopt dp as an indicator reflecting the influence of vegetation on the water budget especially in ecosystems with highly conductive soil horizons such as deserts dp has been successfully estimated in many ecosystems via a series of methods including lysimeters gunawardena et al 2011 yang et al 2014 schwärzel et al 2020 isotope tracers girard et al 1997 electromagnetic techniques cook et al 1992 and modeling miller and aarstad 1972 šimůnek et al 2016 ostad ali askari and shayan 2021 recently numeric modeling combined with appropriate soil and climate data have been regarded as a rigorous method to estimate dp modeling allows detailed investigation into the hydrological processes and inner mechanisms of the system has a low cost and is flexible lai et al 2016 the hydrus 1d model is a popular numeric model to simulate soil water dynamics and drainage across a variety of ecosystems including forests lai et al 2016 orchards li et al 2019 vineyards galleguillos et al 2017 shrublands steppes kulmatiski et al 2019 grasslands zhao et al 2010 croplands karandish et al 2017 deserts du et al 2018 ecosystems containing multiple types of vegetation šípek et al 2020 and regional scale ecosystems hu et al 2019 most previous studies have analyzed the effects of climate vegetation type and soil properties on dp independently however to better understand the effects of afforestation on dp the integrated effects of this factors need to be determined lai et al 2016 poplar is a common tree species in afforestation efforts worldwide poplar plantations are thought to have a high water demand due to their fast growth and high transpiration levels compared with natural forests yu et al 2019 however this species has played an important role in combating desertification in china for example song et al 2021 reported that 18 year old poplar plantations in a semiarid sandy region of northeast china with a density of 433 trees ha 1 were vulnerable to dieback in extreme drought years this was due to high groundwater uptake to sustain a higher canopy transpiration rate in recent years an innovative shelterbelt planting strategy that is the low coverage mode shelterbelt lcms has been developed in many desert ecosystems in china in this strategy trees are planted using an alternating wide and narrow row spacing scheme to ensure a low coverage 10 30 or density at a given site yang et al 2017 wang et al 2020 this strategy has been proven to be robust because it not only provides multiple services such as protecting crops and the soil surface within the belt from wind erosion but also facilitates plant survival and growth by improving microclimate conditions such as reducing wind speed and decreasing daytime air temperatures liu et al 2020 most importantly lcms stands may consume less soil water to meet the demand of tree survival and growth due to lower tree density compared to the plantations using a traditional afforestation strategy thus maintaining the stability of forested ecosystems and producing greater dp for the sustainable protection of local water resources in drylands yang et al 2017 yang et al 2021 however the underlying mechanisms by which different afforestation strategies affect hydrological processes are not fully understood the objectives of this study were to i explore and compare the spatiotemporal patterns of soil volumetric water content θ and dp between an lcms poplar plot and a control plot using the calibrated and validated hydrus 1d model during the growing seasons across different hydrological years and ii quantify integrated effects and the relative contribution of different bio physical parameters including microclimate vegetation structures and soil hydraulic properties on dp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was carried out at a populus xiaozhuanica cv chifengensis shelterbelt site 119 44 21 73 e 42 30 7 25 n at an elevation of 503 m located at the southern edge of the horqin sandy land in the aohan banner of the inner mongolia autonomous region china fig 1 the site experiences a semiarid continental climate characterized by cool dry winters and warm wet summers the mean air temperature t a is approximately 6 c and the annual rainfall is approximately 350 mm half of which normally occurs from june to september the soil is a haplic luvisol with a sandy loam texture two adjacent plots with the same area 30 m 30 m but different afforestation strategies were selected to determine the impacts of the spatiotemporal variation in vegetation structure on soil moisture and dp the distance between the two plots was 350 m to ensure that the sampling points had similar climate soil and topography the two afforestation strategies were 1 lcms which had a lower tree density and variable row spacing and 2 control which had a higher tree density and uniform row spacing the trees in the lcms plot were planted in 1988 using an alternating wide 25 m and narrow 5 m row spacing scheme with an inter tree spacing of 3 m equivalent to 333 trees ha 1 fig 2 trees in the control plot were planted in 2010 using a 5 m width row spacing scheme equivalent to 667 trees ha 1 the grass species were similar in each plot astragalus adsurgens setaria viridis artemisia desertorum taraxacum mongolicum and melilotus suaveolens the lai tree height diameter at breast height dbh and crown diameter were determined for each plot lai was measured with an accupar lp 80 plant canopy analyzer decagon devices lnc pullman wa usa by first taking measurements from a nearby unshaded open field three measurements then 15 measurements were taken below the canopy to determine the mean lai of the plot to determine the summer maximum lai for the two plot lai were measured once every month from june to august in 2019 each measurement was taken on a clear day since the light levels won t change much over the span of 20 to 30 min https www metergroup com environment articles lp80 pain free leaf area index lai the tree height were measured with a vertex iv 360 instrument haglof inc madison mississippi usa and dbh and crown diameter were measured with tape measures the lcms plot had a summer maximum lai value of 2 02 and a mean tree height dbh and crown diameter of 11 2 1 7 m 0 23 0 05 m and 4 7 1 2 m respectively the inter canopy understory cover cover between the rows was 40 with an lai of 0 38 the summer maximum lai value of the control plot was 1 77 and the mean tree height dbh and canopy diameter were 5 1 1 m 0 07 0 02 m and 2 6 0 7 m respectively there were 22 years between when the trees were planted in the two plots which may have resulted in significant differences in canopy structure root distribution and soil properties therebefore we used the lai r d and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity k s to reflect the effects of the time interval or tree age on hydrological processes thus we can only determine the effects of afforestation strategy to soil moisture and dp 2 2 field experimental measurements to compare the impacts of the spatiotemporal variation in vegetation structure on dp measurements were taken from two locations in each plot under canopy and inter canopy the locations were chosen based on a previous investigation of crown diameter and the horizontal distribution of roots along a canopy inter canopy transect at the experimental site wu et al 2015 thus θ was measured at four locations that is under canopy lpuc and inter canopy lpic in the lcms plot the under canopy cpuc and inter canopy location cpic in the control plot at each location ech2o ec 5 sensors and em 50 dataloggers meter group inc pullman wa usa were used to monitor and record θ at depths of 10 20 40 60 100 120 160 and 200 cm with 10 min intervals as shown in fig 2 the observed θ values were calibrated following wu et al 2014 global radiation r g w m 2 air temperature t a c relative humidity rh rainfall p mm wind speed u m s 1 and wind direction wd were measured using a rr 9170 weather station rainroot scientific limited inc beijing china located in an open area in the control plot the sensors were installed 2 m aboveground data were averaged or totaled over 10 minute intervals and stored on a cr200x data logger campbell scientific logan ut usa the vapor pressure deficit d kpa was computed from the ambient vapor pressure and saturation vapor pressure which were determined based on t a and rh 2 3 soil water and dp modeling in this study the richards equation based hydrus 1d model version 4 17 šimůnek et al 2016 was employed to simulate variably saturated water flow in soil expressed as 2 θ t z k h h z 1 s h where θ is volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 h is soil water potential also known as pressure head cm t is time d z is the vertical ascending coordinate cm k is unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 and s h is water uptake by roots cm3 cm 3 d 1 s h was calculated according to the feddes model via the water stress response function and potential transpiration as follows feddes et al 1974 vrugt et al 2001 3 s h a h b x z l t t p where a h is the water stress response function dimensionless b x z denotes the two dimensional spatial distribution of potential root water uptake cm 2 l t is the width of the soil surface associated with the transpiration process mm d 1 and t p is the potential evaporation rate mm d 1 the experimental site was flat most fine roots were distributed in soil layers from 10 to 120 cm and most of the main roots were 200 cm the modeled soil profile was set up to 200 cm and divided into eight layers 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 100 100 120 120 160 and 160 200 cm similar to the θ measurements as shown in fig 2 the upper boundary condition was defined as an atmospheric boundary precipitation and evaporation and free drainage was defined at the bottom boundary at a depth of 200 cm fig 2 the groundwater levels were approximately 7 5 m in 2019 therebefore we ignored the effects of changes in groundwater level on dp in the study value specified initial and boundary conditions were considered at each location which were defined in the model according to the measured θ at the beginning of the simulation period in this study soil hydraulic parameters were initially estimated with the rosetta pedotransfer function from the soil texture and bulk density schaap et al 2001 the function was defined with the van genuchten mualem constitutive relationships mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 4 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n 1 1 n h 0 θ s h 0

the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 and α cm 1 n and l are empirical coefficients that determine the shape of the hydraulic functions to determine the soil texture and bulk density a 200 cm deep soil profile was excavated in both the lcms plot and control plot for each of eight layers mentioned above three undisturbed soil cores were collected to obtain bulk density using the oven drying method 105 for 24 h and approximately 1 kg disturbed soil were used to measure particle size distribution using the hydrometer method then the observed θ in each soil layer was adopted to calibrate the parameters of the richards equation via the inverse option over a 200 d period april 15 october 31 2016 using the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm implemented in the hydrus 1d model another 400 days april 15 october 31 2017 and april 15 october 31 2019 of the observed θ data were applied to validate the model then we applied the validated hydrus 1d model to evaluate the spatial patterns of θ et and dp interpolations of daily lai values of the poplar trees at the under canopy locations lpuc and cpuc during the growing season april 15 october 31 were achieved using the method employed by di et al 2019 in contrast at the inter canopy locations lpic and cpic interpolations of daily lai values of the grass were obtained using the calculation method given in adane et al 2018 the r d of plants was calculated on each day using a two stage method analogous to the method employed by camargo and kemanian 2016 which assumed that r d increase sharply with temperature to the maximum value in the early growing season and subsequently remained constant analogously we assumed that the r d increased by 1 mm each day from april 15 to august 31 and thereafter remained constant from september to october according to seasonal patterns in soil temperature across the 0 100 cm soil profile data not listed and vertical distribution of roots and poplar tree age in the site the initial r d at the lpuc lpic cpuc and cpic locations were 1 0 0 3 0 8 and 0 5 m respectively the daily et mm in non rainfall periods was calculated using eq 7 7 et t r e s where t r is transpiration mm and e s is soil evaporation mm here t r and e s are equal to the root water uptake and evaporative fluxes from soil respectively which were simulated by the calibrated hydrus 1d rainfall interception i was estimated from lai m2 m 2 and p values with the following equation as described in watt et al 2007 and xi et al 2016 8 i 0 05 l a i p the performance of the hydrus 1d model was assessed based on two criteria the mean absolute error mae cm3 cm 3 or mm and the root mean square error rmse cm3 cm 3 or mm as follows mae 1 n i 1 n p i o i and 9 10 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 1 2 where p i is the predicted value o i is the observed value and n is the number of observed values 2 4 analysis of the integrated impacts of the bio physical parameters on dp structural equation modeling sem was performed to distinguish and quantify the direct and indirect effects of bio physical factors on dp the coefficients of direct paths represent the standardized partial regression while indirect paths indicate the product of possible path coefficients being summed over all indirect paths and the sum of direct and indirect path coefficients yields the total path coefficient hayat et al 2020 the initial model included all potential paths involving the factors that have been widely reported to influence dp and et such as climate factors vegetation structure lai r d k s and soil moisture the final adopted model met the following conditions the normed chi square value was 1 3 the root mean square residual was 0 05 and the goodness of fit index value was greater than 0 9 chen et al 2020 sem was applied within amos software version 24 0 ibm spss chicago il usa considering the hysteresis of the impacts of rainfall on θ and dp due to the process of infiltration a cross correlation analysis between daily θ and dp was used to determine the optimal time of the hysteresis the determining coefficient changed parabolically within a 10 day period and the greatest r 2 value was observed on the fifth day r 2 0 046 p 0 001 therefore the fifth day was chosen to represent the optimal time of the hysteresis because the sample size was notably larger than 200 the mardia coefficient of each model in regard to multivariate kurtosis exceeded three indicating significant multivariate data nonnormality therefore the bollen stine bootstrap p procedure was implemented to adjust the model fit and parameter estimates to accommodate the lack of multivariate normality bollen and stine 1992 johnston and faulkner 2021 to overcome the observed problem of strong collinearity between r g t a and d and between lai and r d we assumed that these related paths yielded equal effects on et in the sem as suggested by marsh et al 2004 3 results 3 1 micrometeorological variables lai and et although there were similar seasonal parabolic patterns among r g t a and d the difference in the maximum and mean values and the degree of fluctuation in d reflected distinct combinations of t a and rh over time fig 3 a d a relatively low d may be partly attributed to a low u during the late period in 2019 fig 3e the total measured p was 345 4 357 2 and 314 2 mm in 2016 2017 and 2019 respectively this indicates that 2016 and 2017 experienced normal rainfall while less rainfall occurred in 2019 fig 3f the occurrence of p was dominated by light rain 5 mm with a frequency of 56 9 76 1 followed by moderate rainfall 5 20 mm with a frequency of 17 9 37 3 heavy rainfall 20 40 mm with a frequency of 3 9 16 7 and rainstorms greater than 40 mm with a frequency of 2 in the three years the percentage of cumulative p were relatively similar across rainfall types with the range of 12 9 34 2 for each rainfall type in 2016 and 2019 however in 2017 heavy rain contributed to 50 3 of cumulative p the dynamics of the interpolated lai of poplar trees at the under canopy locations lpuc and cpuc were well approximated by bimodal trends assuming negligible variation in lai across the growing seasons comparatively at the inter canopy locations lpic and cpic the interpolated lai of the grass were obtained with a parabola the peak lai values at the lpuc lpic cpuc and cpic locations were 2 02 0 38 1 77 and 0 88 on august 8 in 2019 respectively fig 3g seasonal variation of the simulated et for the lcms plot and the control plot reflected the integrated impacts of r g t a d u and p from april to october while the spatial variation of et within each plot was mainly attributed to the difference in lai and r d between the locations of under canopy and inter canopy the total et across the lpuc lpic cpuc and cpic locations ranged from 319 9 to 338 7 143 0 153 9 264 1 284 5 and 182 1 186 2 mm respectively during the growing season fig 3h 3 2 observed soil moisture the θ values were grouped into three soil layers shallow 0 40 cm middle 40 100 cm and deep 100 200 cm layers to compare the vertical patterns along the 200 cm soil profile between the under and inter canopy locations in each plot and at the same locations between the two plots in 2016 2017 and 2019 fig 4 in general the amplitude of the variation in θ decreased with depth in the two plots during the growing seasons indicating that θ was more variable in the shallow and middle layers than in the deep layer this may be the result of stronger integrated impacts of p i t r and e s on θ in the shallow and middle soil layers than in the deep soil layer in the lcms plot the θ in the shallow layer at lpuc ranged from 0 040 to 0 197 cm3 cm 3 with an average value of 0 085 cm3 cm 3 throughout the whole study period which was significantly lower than that at lpic p 0 05 in 2016 but higher p 0 05 than that in 2017 and 2019 reflecting the difference in the integrated impacts of these processes across the growing seasons however the θ values in the middle and deep soil layers at lpuc ranging from 0 069 to 0 193 cm3 cm 3 and 0 063 0 090 cm3 cm 3 respectively with average values of 0 089 cm3 cm 3 and 0 074 cm3 cm 3 respectively were significantly lower than those at lpic p 0 05 in 2017 and 2019 except for the middle soil layer in 2016 suggesting that the roots of trees consumed less soil water thus resulting in more meteoric water infiltrating and reaching the deep layer at lpic in the lcms plot in the control plot the average θ values in the shallow middle and deep soil layers at cpuc were 0 076 cm3 cm 3 0 088 cm3 cm 3 and 0 092 cm3 cm 3 in 2016 2017 and 2019 respectively which were significantly higher than those at cpic p 0 05 where the average θ values were 0 063 cm3 cm 3 0 066 cm3 cm 3 and 0 092 cm3 cm 3 respectively although cpic was located in the inter canopy the lower θ value indicated different impacts of the hydrological processes on the soil water regime in this narrow row spacing plot compared to those in the lcms plot the presence of a pinus tabulaeformis tree near the measuring point may have contributed to the much lower θ value at cpuc moreover the variation in θ in the two plots in 2019 seemed to be lower which agreed with the smaller total rainfall amount than that in 2016 and 2017 3 3 calibration and validation of the hydrus 1d model the estimated van genuchten mualem hydraulic parameters of the hydrus 1d model for the different soil layers in each plot based on the measured θ data from april 15 to october 31 2016 are listed in table 1 the table reflects the difference in soil hydraulic properties between the various soil layers and between the two locations in these two plots the simulated and measured θ values in the different layers along the 200 cm profile at the lpuc location in the lcms plot are shown in fig 5 although the modeling deviation in the shallow layer was relatively higher than that in the deep soil layer there was a generally good agreement between the simulated and measured θ values during both the calibration and validation periods as shown in table 2 the performance of the hydrus 1d model was satisfactory as indicated by the mae and rmse values in general the deviations between the measured and simulated θ values were low among the four locations the average mae values at the lpuc lpic cpuc and cpic locations were 0 010 0 014 0 016 and 0 012 cm3 cm 3 respectively while the rmse values were 0 013 0 017 0 020 and 0 017 cm3 cm 3 respectively during the calibration period the mae values at lpuc lpic cpuc and cpic were 0 013 0 013 0 020 and 0 010 cm3 cm 3 respectively and the rmse values were 0 015 0 016 0 023 and 0 013 cm3 cm 3 respectively during the validation period 2019 3 4 deep drainage modeling in general the seasonal dp varied across the years locations and plots during the whole study period fig 6 most dp peaks occurred in the middle of the growing season which seemed to coincide with rainfall events particularly heavy rain the average dp across the four locations was 127 5 mm 142 0 mm and 103 4 mm during the growing season in 2016 2017 and 2019 respectively which was consistent with the order of total rainfall amount however dp in 2017 was 10 2 higher than that in 2016 despite these years having a similar total rainfall this may be partly attributed to the higher proportion of heavy rain and storms in 2017 50 3 in 2017 vs 36 9 in 2016 the average total dp in the lcms plot ranged from 107 0 to 149 6 mm with 36 5 42 4 of the rainfall occurring during the growing seasons which was slightly higher than that in the control plot however compared to the control plot the observed dp exhibited a higher spatial heterogeneity in the lcms plot specifically the total dp at the lpuc lpic cpuc and cpic locations ranged from 18 7 to 65 0 195 3 237 5 74 1 117 1 and 125 4 151 9 mm respectively which accounted for 6 4 18 4 66 6 69 7 23 1 33 2 and 42 8 43 8 of the rainfall during the same period respectively 3 5 response of dp to the biophysical factors sem indicated that the θ p and k s had significantly positive direct effects on dp while et had a significantly negative effect on a daily scale p 0 001 fig 7 moreover p had an indirect effect on dp by increasing the θ while k s had an indirect effect by decreasing soil moisture p 0 001 in terms of et r d was the most important predictor of daily et over the lai p 0 001 climate factors including r g t a rh d and u were significantly related to et p 0 001 however their path coefficients were lower than 0 1 except for r g in this study et was positively related to θ p 0 001 indicating that et involving t r and e s was significantly influenced by soil water availability in this water limited ecosystem likewise p was positively related to θ p 0 001 due to the effect of rainwater infiltration 4 discussion 4 1 reliability of using hydrus 1d to model soil moisture and dp the hydrus 1d model has been successfully applied to simulate soil moisture dynamics and subsurface water flux such as dp or groundwater recharge across various forest stands including evergreen broad leafed forests lai et al 2016 broad leafed deciduous forests xi et al 2016 coniferous forests šípek et al 2020 fan et al 2015 qi et al 2018 and apple orchards li et al 2019 moreover this model has been employed to quantify the impacts of climate vegetation structure and soil properties on hydrological processes šimůnek et al 2016 in this study θ dynamics in the two plots were simulated using the calibrated hydrus 1d model during three growing seasons the average mae and rmse values at each location ranged from 0 011 to 0 016 cm3 cm 3 and 0 015 0 020 cm3 cm 3 respectively across the seasons and plots in general the values were similar to those in previous studies lai et al 2016 xi et al 2016 fan et al 2015 this suggests that model calibration was successfully achieved with relative mae values of 14 2 and 20 6 on average in the lcms and control plots respectively however a relatively high deviation of the simulated θ was found in the 40 60 cm soil layer at the cpuc location in 2019 this deviation could be the result of two factors first the active exchange of the water flux such as infiltration transpiration and evaporation may produce large simulation errors in the main root distribution layer galleguillos et al 2017 second this deviation may partly be the result of our simplified assumption that the values and patterns of lai and r d are the same across the three growing seasons which may cause potential errors in t r and i estimation and thus in θ simulation we collected relevant references to compare the results of dp estimation to those for other poplar stands worldwide in table 3 annual drainage in the various poplar stands ranged from 11 to 958 mm accounting for 1 9 89 0 of the annual rainfall with very high fluctuations due to differences in climate rainfall vegetation structure and soil properties across the sites in this study the total simulated dp during the growing seasons at the lpuc and lpic locations ranged from 18 7 to 65 0 and 195 3 237 5 mm respectively accounting for 6 4 18 4 and 66 6 69 7 of the rainfall in the growing seasons respectively these results reasonably agree with the dp estimates reported in other studies preston and mcbride 2004 fan et al 2015 parish et al 2019 manevski et al 2019 brédoire et al 2020 therefore these results indicate that the calibrated hydrus 1d model can be employed to simulate the spatiotemporal patterns of soil moisture and dp of poplar stands in the semi arid region 4 2 integrated effects of the meteorological factors vegetation structure soil moisture and hydraulic properties on dp precipitation is usually a primary water source for dp in rainfed plantation ecosystems previous studies have reported that dp is significantly influenced by the total amount and intensity of rainfall at the stand scale such as in mobile sandy land yang et al 2014 liu et al 2015 and evergreen broad leaf forest lai et al 2016 areas and at the regional scale such as on the loess plateau hu et al 2019 in this study the average dp value across the two plots was 127 5 142 0 and 103 4 mm during the growing seasons of 2016 2017 and 2019 respectively following a similar pattern as the annual precipitation which was 345 4 357 2 and 314 2 mm in 2016 2017 and 2019 respectively the higher frequency 50 3 of heavy rainfall in 2017 may have resulted in greater dp through downward rainwater infiltration compared with in 2016 which had a similar amount of total rainfall but lower frequency of heavy rainfall this suggests that both the amount and pattern of rainfall have significant influences on the variation in dp during the growing season in addition to the direct effects sem indicated that p could indirectly influence dp through its impacts on θ fig 7 on the one hand p may have a positive indirect effect on dp by increasing θ through rainwater infiltration on the other hand p may have a negative effect on dp by enhancing the water supply to sustain et and its components including i and t r soil moisture has been widely considered the most important factor influencing dp across various sites for example lai et al 2016 found that compared to the effects of rain characteristics antecedent moisture had the greatest relative contribution to dp 85 7 in an evergreen broad leaf forest in the taihu lake basin china in this study our results indicate that compared to the other factors such as p et and k s dp was dominated by θ across the locations plots and seasons moreover θ played a very important role in the indirect effects of p et and k s on dp fig 7 in summary our results suggest that the recharge mechanism at our site is direct recharge that is water is added to the groundwater reservoir in excess of the soil water deficit and et via direct vertical percolation through the vadose zone rather than indirect or localized recharge as reported by de vries and simmers 2002 in forested ecosystems water fluxes including dp in the subsurface can vary spatially between under and inter canopy areas due to the spatial heterogeneity in the redistribution of rainfall via canopy and water uptake by roots within a stand fan et al 2015 at this site our results indicated that the amount and pattern of dp varied significantly due to the difference in the spatial patterns of the lai and r d across the locations within the plots fig 6 compared to the lpuc location the lower lai and r d values at the lpic location could translate into a lower t r and i while the low e s may be attributed to microclimate effects such as wind speed and air temperature reduction and relative humidity enhancement in the shelterbelt liu et al 2020 thus the sum of i t r and e s led to a lower total et level at lpic thus resulting in more rainwater infiltrating downward to produce dp at the inter canopy location in the lcms plot the situation in the control plot was similar although the difference between the two locations was not as large as that in the lcms plot due to the narrower row spacing schlegel et al 2004 reported that r d played a significant role in water uptake evaporation and drainage within an amazonian agroforestry ecosystem therefore our study elucidates that the impact of the vegetation structure on dp can be naturally revealed through its effects on et due to their negative relationship fig 7 in other words if the location with higher lai and r d values consumes more water et this suggests reduced dp at a given site the opposite is also true k s is a crucial soil physical property that influences soil moisture dynamics and hydrological processes and facilitates planning of vegetation recovery irrigation practice and drainage design zhao et al 2016 valdes abellan et al 2018 generally k s is influenced by the combined effects of parent materials vegetation topography and time by impacting the porosity and pore size distribution zhao et al 2016 in this study k s had a weak positive direct effect on dp and a significant negative effect on the θ this result indicates that a high k s at the lpuc location is beneficial to vertical water flow such as infiltration uptake by roots evaporation and drainage rather than retention in soil table 1 thus resulting in a lower θ fig 4 than that at the lpic location similar to previous studies valdes abellan et al 2018 li et al 2002 in this study despite neglecting the variation in lai and r d across the growing seasons as well as the drawback of the assumption of linear relationships between the bio physical parameters and hydrological processes in the sem equation which may produce uncertainties and potential errors the results still elucidate the underlying mechanism of the combined effects of the spatial heterogeneity in bio physical parameters caused by the different afforestation strategies on hydrological processes at the stand scale our results revealed that antecedent soil moisture p and k s had significantly positive direct effects on dp while et had a significant negative effect at the daily scale the impacts of vegetation structure and microclimate factors on dp could be reflected by their effects on et and its components 4 3 implications of the lcms approach for the management of artificial forest ecosystems and sustainability of water resources the lcms strategy has been demonstrated to prevent soil erosion land desertification and degradation in desert ecosystems in china yang et al 2017 however the effects and underlying mechanisms of lcms on hydrological processes such as et and dp and on the water budget remains unclear generally afforestation with a uniform arrangement and high density can increase et due to the formation of multilayer stands with a high lai and deep root systems thus decreasing dp when compared to grassland in drylands schwärzel et al 2020 on the contrary our results indicated that afforestation with a non uniform arrangement and low density lcms resulted in a larger proportion of dp to the annual rainfall compared with the control plot meanwhile et and dp varied between the different locations due to a high spatial heterogeneity in lai and r d within the plots the inter canopy locations may have had a greater dp due to their lower t r and e s than the under canopy locations therefore rainfall redistribution within the stand could allow the water requirements of the trees to be met additionally the greater dp in the lcms plot could be beneficial to groundwater recharge resulting in a tradeoff between blue water groundwater recharge and green water evaporation therefore local water resources at the regional scale could be ensured schwärzel et al 2020 however as an innovative afforestation strategy more research is still required regarding lcms for example we noted that the et at lpuc was 115 5 of p and the dp was 6 4 in 2019 which was a drier year however the trees in our lcsm plot grew well with minimal dieback or dead individuals despite a negative water budget at lpuc in 2019 the first possible reason was that these poplar trees at lpuc could take up water from deeper soil layer more than 2 m depth and or groundwater when the upper soil water became insufficient because the maximum depth of the taproot of poplar trees can reach the groundwater level although their most roots are distributed within 1 m soil depth in the horqin sandy land song et al 2021 the second possible reason was that the soil water deficit at lpuc was replenished by horizontal exchange of infiltrated water from lpic due to soil water potential gradient between the two locations however further research is needed to determine the amount timing and location of the horizontal water movement or exchange between different locations within the plot and the contribution to tree growth and the water budget especially in dry years furthermore research is still needed to determine the optimal parameters of lcms stands such as the spacing between rows and trees under different climate species and site conditions despite these limitations our results provide evidence that the lcms approach to afforestation and reforestation in drylands can save water compared with traditional afforestation these results not only provide an insight into the impacts of large scale afforestation on ecohydrological cycles and local water resources but also provide a theoretical basis for the sustainable management of planted forests in water limited environments 5 conclusions our results indicate that poplar trees do not act as a water pump if they are planted at a low density in dryland regions in the mature poplar lcms stand studied a positive water budget was maintained and a certain amount of underground water recharge was retained across the growing seasons this indicates that the lcms strategy is sustainable and can save water in dryland regions which is particularly within the context of increasing human activities and climate change our results further indicate that the hydrus 1d model can be applied to simulate the θ in the different soil layers in the two plots studied in summary our major findings were 1 there was more variability in dp between the under and inter canopy locations within the lcms plot than in the control plot 2 dp was controlled by the integrated effects of the spatial heterogeneity of the bio physical parameters on the hydrological processes 3 soil water was the dominant factor influencing dp followed by precipitation and k s and 4 the influences of both microclimate factors and vegetation structure lai and r d reflected the impacts on et which had a significantly negative relationship with dp these findings are beneficial to afforestation and reforestation efforts ecological restoration measures and management of local water resources in water limited

3774,water balance characteristics and rainfall runoff relationships of karst slope are poorly understood worldwide even though karst landscapes occupy 10 15 the planet s land surface dynamic hydrological responses were monitored for 43 rainfall events on a karst slope in southwest china over two years 2018 2019 the responses included surface subsurface and epikarst seepage runoff abbreviated as sr ssr and esr respectively and soil water content at different depths 10 cm 30 cm and the soil epikarst interface in twelve plots 5 m 20 m total 1200 m 2 results showed that 1 the hillslope scale sr ssr and esr coefficients were 2 2 0 4 5 2 3 8 0 2 12 4 and 31 2 0 6 89 1 respectively sr and ssr were relatively rare and of short duration while esr was a crucial component of the karst hillslope water balance and its duration was longer demonstrating the critical role of epikarst zone in regulating flow functions such as water storage and release 2 soil depth exerted the greatest direct effect on sr which increased as soil deepened factors controlling the rainfall ssr response were difficult to identify they require other geophysical exploration methods 3 threshold like runoff responses to rainfall inputs were observed on karst slope and the rainfall depth p runoff initiation thresholds for sr and ssr were 36 2 mm and 43 7 mm respectively the strength of the threshold like input output relationships was slightly greater when the p asi antecedent soil water content index was used as the hydrological input variable rather than without consideration of asi the differing shapes of nonlinear hydrological behaviours such as the hockey stick heaviside function or the sigmoid function were detected in karst slope this suggests karst hydrological system complexity threshold values should be determined according to the shapes of nonlinear hydrological behaviours these results extend the understanding of karst hydrological processes keywords hillslope hydrology soil epikarst systems karst ecosystems subsurface runoff water balance threshold 1 introduction the central concerns of catchment hydrology can be summarized in a few basic questions 1 where does water go and where does stream originate when it rains 2 what flow path does it take to the stream 3 how long does it stay and 4 how can observations scale or transfer to other catchments mcdonnell 2003 based on a proliferation of complex site specific studies progress in answering the first 3 questions has been made the overwhelming spatio temporal heterogeneity of climatic and landscape properties of experimental catchments extrapolation of knowledge from gauged to ungauged hillslopes and catchments leaves this field of study land mined with numerous difficulties and uncertainties and thus the fourth last question is a major challenge zehe and sivapalan 2009 mcglynn et al 2013 although a number of sophisticated process based hydrology models which integrate surface subsurface and ecosystem processes have been developed to predict catchment runoff over the past decades these bottom up models continue to be limited by landscape heterogeneity and the variety of types of returns of parameters calibrated in ungauged catchments scaife and band 2017 sivapalan 2018 hillslopes and catchments are complex systems having threshold behaviors hysteresis feedback and other characteristic forms of nonlinearity ameli et al 2015 using a top down approach complex runoff generation processes can be simplified into emergent behaviors such as the threshold behaviors scaife and band 2017 the intent of threshold behavior models is to simplify spatially and temporally complex hydrologic behavior by relating hydrologic flux patterns to observable state variables exploring macroscale and similarities properties may be a useful means of supporting runoff process research and may improve process measurement understanding and prediction and to assist in developing a general theory scaife and band 2017 mcdonnell et al 2021 numerous threshold detection studies have been conducted at hillslope watershed and catchment scales based on observations of the temporal and spatial patterns of the transient saturation at the soil bedrock interface sbi and its relation to ssr the fill and spill theory was used to explain the threshold behavior of a trenched hillslope located in the panola mountain research watershed tromp van and mcdonnell 2006 irrigation and excavation experiments measuring maimai hillslope behavior revealed that ssr at the sbi has transmits large amounts of water with high lateral velocities up to 9000 mm h 1 these were several orders of magnitude greater than predicted by darcy s law using measured hydraulic conductivities at the site graham et al 2010 this situation reflects the importance of macropores and preferential flows in facilitating rapid subsurface runoff responses at hillslope scale beven and germann 2013 graham et al 2010 also pointed out the easily measured parameters such as surface topography soil depth and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity were not the first order controlling factors they were the difficult to measure subsurface parameters such as microscale bedrock topography bedrock permeability and lateral subsurface velocities on a steep forested hillslope with a thin soil layer about 50 cm near okayama city in japan tani 1997 found that antecedent soil water content controlled runoff generation for the hillslope and the catchment which include the hillslope runoff was less than 10 of rainfall if antecedent conditions were dry and rainfall did not exceed 100 mm runoff increase almost equaled rainfall increase when total rainfall exceeded 100 mm this suggests that almost all rainfall contributed to storm runoff when the soil was the wettest detty and mcguire 2010 believed that threshold behaviors were due to effective saturated hydraulic conductivity increases when water tables rose into highly transmissive near surface soil during runoff events with these threshold conditions this relates to a transmissivity feedback mechanism measurements for a small italian alp headwater catchment having steep hillslopes and a distinct riparian zone disclosed a sharp threshold existed in the relationship between soil water content and streamflow and the hillslope s mean water table penna et al 2011 high runoff coefficients occurred during wet antecedent conditions ssr was activated on the hillslope and became a major contributor to streamflow penna et al 2011 threshold runoff responses to precipitation inputs and the relationship between different responses to the catchments characteristics such as air temperature precipitation percentage of snow potential evaporation topography wetness index and other factors were also analyzed across nine mid latitude to high latitude cold catchments in northern canada results were that eight of nine catchments had runoff threshold responses catchment hydroclimatic and geophysical characteristics such as mean annual air temperature median flow path distance to the stream median sub catchment area were the primary impact factors for rainfall driven events ali et al 2015 precipitation streamflow and soil moisture data for a fifteen year period for three north carolina us catchments were analyzed at event season interannual and decadal levels in order to determine any threshold behavior stationarity for geophysical properties scaife and band 2017 thresholds were more variable between growing seasons than between dormant seasons this implied that runoff controlling factors are not the only static characteristics of catchment such soil topography and other nor was climate but the dynamic ecosystem feedbacks such as ecosystem transpiration rates driven by changing vegetation dynamics were previous studies reported four nonlinear hydrological behavioral shapes hockey stick heaviside function dirac function and sigmoid function fig 1 ali et al 2013 many of these studies found that the nonlinear rainfall runoff relationships followed the hockey stick shape for a range of different hillslopes tani 1997 graham et al 2010 detty and mcguire 2010 penna et al 2011 ali et al 2015 and watersheds scaife and band 2017 wei et al 2020 there were differences among the sites for the x intercept or threshold value and the slope of the relationship after the threshold was reached the slope reflects differences in the bedrock leakage coefficient and subsurface storage volume slope decrease as those values increase x intercept increased as those values increased the bedrock leakage coefficient had greater impact on the slope values subsurface storage volume had greater impact on threshold values graham and mcdonnell 2010 field hydrology experiments in karst regions are much more complicated and expensive to conduct burt and mcdonnell 2015 which has resulted in threshold hydrologic response on karst hillslopes not being explored vertical percolation of water into the bedrock has a large influence on water balance graham et al 2010 the permeability of the soil epikarst interface sei where ssr generation on karst slopes is high evough about 40 mm h 1 and have a significant impact on runoff processes fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 however no prior threshold studies we have looked closely at the relatively high permeability of the lower boundary relatively high sei permeability influence on runoff generation thresholds should be addressed event rainfall threshold values for specific sites had been detected examples include 20 mm for both a slope and a catchment in the tatsunokuchi yama experimental forest near okayama city in japan tani 1997 23 mm in an alpine headwater catchment located in the italian dolomites penna et al 2011 and 55 mm for the panola hillslope tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 differences in runoff generation may be controlled by hillslope or catchment characteristics it has been shown that soil epikarst structures have a significant impact on flow processes fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 the combined impacts of soil epikarst structures such as soil depth bedrock outcrops bedrock fragments the number of roots on sr and ssr generation is poorly understand for karst regions field studies need to be conducted to quantify how hillslope characteristics might explain differing hydrological behaviors finally approaches for threshold identification differ in the different studies tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 graham et al 2010 wei et al 2020 methods for determining threshold values should be explored to present a uniform metric e g for catchments comparison research karst regions cover 12 of the earth s surface and about a quarter of global population is dependent on karst aquifers drinking water ford 2007 china s southwestern karst region is one of the world s largest continuous karst terrain areas exposed to a subtropical climate it covers a 4 52 10 5 km2 cockpit karst terrain is common yuan et al 2016 these consist of conical hills and star shaped valleys and account for about 73 of the karst area karst hillslopes occupy a large part of the cockpit karst landscape they are a fundamental landscape unit for runoff generation and groundwater recharge it has suffered severe environmental degradation including vegetation cover loss soil erosion and biodiversity loss disastrous droughts and floods are frequent wang et al 2020 a better understanding of karst hillslope hydrological processes is important to both theory and practice karst hillslope hydrology research based on experimental hydrology methods is still relatively uncommon in this region the conceptual scheme of the soil epikarst system and its dominant processes were first put forward by williams 1983 the highly heterogeneous structure of the soil epikarst system results in various infiltration pathways which exert key roles in groundwater recharge processes and rainfall runoff relationships according to perrin et al 2003 the soil cover plays a critical role in the infiltration velocity and in mixing despite the importance of the soil epikarst systems for karst water resources previous research mostly and narrowly focused only on karst groundwater few studies which directly characterized karst systems shallow subsurface processes have been conducted only recently some papers have dealt with this topic included soil water content and its stable isotope spatial variability jing et al 2016 ssr characteristics wilcox et al 2008 fu et al 2015 sr donton overland flow a hybrid mechanism which incorporating aspects of both horton and dunne overland flow and ssr fill and spill generation mechanisms loague et al 2010 wang et al 2020 previous studies showed that ssr predominates in runoff wilcox et al 2008 fu et al 2015 fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 and limited saturation excess sr peng and wang 2012 zhu et al 2017 for karst slopes these studies provided a foundation for comprehending the mechanisms of runoff generation most of the studies used short term situ rainfall simulation experiments wilcox et al 2008 fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 the characteristics were inconsistent with natural rainfall features such as rainfall depth intensity and duration they were implemented at a relatively small scale either point or plot scale they did not consider differing antecedent soil water content conditions such as dryness and wetness water budget characteristics under natural conditions on karst slopes remain unclear runoff coefficients such as sr and ssr to precipitation ratios remain unknown at present epikarst seepage flow esr generate at epikarst bedrock interface ebi persisted on after rainfall ceased from several days to weeks sr and ssr stopped simultaneously with rainfall ceasing these observations raise questions as to why esr was retained and why for so long water balance closure at the plot scale should be examined in this study two years 2018 2019 of natural rainfall runoff data for 12 runoff plots on a karst hillslope of southwest china with a total area of 1200 m 2 was collected in order to answer the following questions does water unbalance under some conditions what are the dominant flow pathways such as sr ssr and esr for karst slopes which if any soil epikarst system characteristics such as soil depth rock fragments outcrops or the number of roots numbers best explain runoff generation differences between the runoff plots do karst hillslopes exhibit threshold responses to rainfall inputs and antecedent soil water content and if so what sr and ssr characteristics initiate thresholds and how are these thresholds best determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description this study was conducted in a typical karst catchment located at 24 43 58 9 24 44 48 8 n 108 18 56 9 10819 48 4 e in huanjiang county southwest china fig 2 a it s a typical cockpit karst landscape surrounded by hills on three sides with an outlet to the northeast fig 2 a and b about 60 of the hill land has a greater slope than 25 the superficial catchment area is 1 46 km2 elevation ranges from 272 to 647 m above sea level fig 2 b the region has a subtropical mountainous monsoon climate and an average annual temperature of 19 9 c and rainfall of 1 455 6 mm 1980 2013 annually about three fourths of precipitation falls during the wet season between may and september the study catchment is in the western wing of the mulian anticline fault structures are well developed there are six faults in and around the catchment its aquifer is primarily constituted of middle and late carboniferous dolomite with a strata orientation of 278 10 it is underlain by an early carboniferous sandstone aquifer which is relatively impermeable fig 2 e the underlying dolomite rocks are very pure with an averaging cao and mgo content of 31 0 and 21 5 respectively which correspond closely to the formula camg co3 2 borehole analysis suggests that karstification degree decreases as depth increases both the soil layer and the epikarst zone show a trend of gradually thickening along the downhill direction study area karstification is characterized by penetrating dissolution pores micro tensile dissolution fractures and local dissolution fractures its highly weathered dolomite is mostly deconstructed into its original rock structure and even dolomite sand the middle weathered dolomite has a fine crystal structure and coarse crystal structure locally the massive compact rock is hard and contains silica locally there is no obvious bubble reaction obtained after dropping dilute hydrochloric acid on it epikarst zone permeability coefficient k shows great variability with a general value of 10 1 1 mm h 1 and a local value of 18 000 mm h 1 except for the escarpments around the hill crests most of hillslopes in the study catchment was covered with a continuously distributed shallow soil layer the soil thickness is range from 0 m in the upslope to 2 m in the depression while the epikarst zone thickness is range from 0 5 m in the upslope to 27 m in the depression the epikarst zone is mainly composed of moderately to strongly weathered dolomite rocks with karren grike and fissure the main karst features the soil type is rendzina with a texture between that of clay and clay loam 25 50 silt and 30 60 clay soils are well drained gravelly and calcareous it has stable infiltration rates ranging from 40 to 130 mm h 1 chen et al 2012 epikarst surfaces have a near steady infiltration rate of approximately 40 mm h 1 subsurface runoff occurs along the sei and is dominated by preferential flow fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 2 2 runoff plots and data collection runoff plots were located on the western side of the watershed figs 2 a and b similar to many previous studies conducted by other hillslope hydrology researchers the general approach to studying the water balance runoff mechanisms and movement in response to rainfall and snowmelt involved excavation to the sbi at the lower boundary of the experimental hillslope to expose the subsurface runoff tromp van and mcdonnell 2006 fu et al 2015 twelve 5 m 20 m hillslope runoff plots were established on the lower slope fig 2b and c each plot had a 5 m wide trench the total trench width was about 80 m where material was removed completely down to the massive compact bedrock an average vertical depth of 4 m using a backhoe fig 2 c and d epikarst at the site was moderately weathered with a shallow soil mantle mean soil thickness for the plots was 50 cm based on a survey of the trenches among the 12 runoff plots fig 2 c concrete walls were poured deep into the epikarst surface on the left right and upper edges to prevent sr and ssr exchange between adjacent plots fig 2 d and fig 3 the plots were divided into four groups corn forage walnut and natural grassland with three types of each of the four vegetation types in order to quantify the effect of vegetation types on water sediments and nutrient loss the runoff plots were constructed in 2016 and 2017 and the plants immature root count canopy transpiration and other aspect of the plants were minimal and it had been reported that vegetation and land use types had relatively small effects on runoff chen et al 2012 eight observation points monitored volumetric soil water content swc at 10 cm 30 cm and the sei based on the soil depth distribution swc was measured every 5 min using frequency domain decomposition stevens hydra probe soil sensor stevens usa www stevenswater com a previous study wang et al 2020 provides detailed descriptions of the swc observation points inside each trench three concrete troughs and runoff collecting facilities were constructed to collect runoff from the surface as sr soil epikarst interface ssr and epikarst bedrock interface esr separately fig 3 sr and esr troughs were straight with a slight gradient send water to one side of the trench the trough for collecting the ssr undulated due to intense karstification processes near the surface which led to highly irregular soil epikarst interfaces the ssr trough was divided into five equal sections in order to accurately and time recorded subsurface runoff 1 ssf1 5 ssf5 from left to right fig 3 each section was a 1 m wide trench width having its own drainage provided by 65 mm diameter pvc pipe fig 2 d sr ssr and esr were measured by routing runoff through tipping bucket flow gauges at 100 ml ssr and 1 l sr and esr resolutions tb1l hydrological services usa the lower edges of the experiment plot were covered with a plastic film to prevent rainfall entering the sr gutter fig 2d trenches were roofed and direct rainfall was not included as runoff the roof was a waterproof cement plaster coated brick wall there was a 5 cm gap between it and the trench face during the wall construction process only ssf and esr troughs were filled with clean silica sand into the gap to form a thin packing layer between the trench face and the roof this sand packing layer smoothed out sharp hydraulic gradient changes between trench face and air during runoff events packing sand may prevent a collapse of the exposed soil epikarst profile caused by weathering this ensures a long term stable operation for these runoff collecting facilities magnitudes of all runoff components sr ssr and esr were expressed as depth per unit plot area except when noted no soil water content responses or runoff occurred after small rainfall events 5 mm rainfall was completely intercepted by ground vegetation and moss a total of 43 rainfall events of more than 5 mm within a standard of 6 h interval were recorded during the monitoring period with rainfalls lasting between 15 min and 24 h according to the standard 6 h interval if rainfall value is not measured for more than 6 h it was regarded as two rainfall events liang and chan 2017 2 3 measurement of soil and epikarst characteristics soil samples were collected upslope middle slope and down slope to replicate three soil property measurements soil particle size distributions were measured with a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern england soil bulk density of undisturbed soil samples g cm 3 were measured using steel columns that were 5 cm in diameter and 100 cm 3 in volume this was done via the excavation method rock fragment content rfc was the ratio of rock and dry soil weight soil saturated hydraulic conductivity mm h 1 was measured with the constant head method soil organic carbon g kg 1 was determined using the dichromate oxidation method fu et al 2015 soil depths for plots were measured using a chain pin length 100 cm diameter 1 2 cm which were forced vertically through the soil to the epikarst using a grid scheme 1 m 1 m for each of the plots a soil auger length 250 cm diameter 5 0 cm was used for soil depths deeper than 100 cm the root count was taken at the plot left and right sides prior to concrete walls were installation bedrock outcrops were also counted in each of the plots table 1 lists the soil and epikarst characteristics 2 4 calculations and statistical analysis 2 4 1 structural equation model direct and indirect relationships among sr and ssr soil depth rock fragments root numbers and bedrock outcrops were evaluated using structural equation modeling sem sem fit was evaluated using p values chi squared values goodness of fit index and root mean square error of approximation sem was conducted using the amos 18 0 software package amos development corporation chicago il usa unless otherwise specified the results were considered to be significant when p 0 05 2 4 2 antecedent soil water content index determination soil water content data immediately preceding an event were used to determine the total soil water storage for a profile using the total water content for each soil horizon where water content integrates volumetric water content over the depth interval represented by each soil water content sensor antecedent soil water content index asi from soil profiles in plot 4 wang et al 2020 was determined using the method provided by haga et al 2005 1 asi i 1 n vwc i d i where i is the index representing the different soil layers n is the number of instrumented soil layers vwc i is the volumetric water content values d i is the soil layer thicknesses 2 4 3 approaches for threshold identification two methods were used to determine the rainfall runoff thresholds output sr and ssr threshold behaviors compared to input asi precipitation p and combined p asi were measured using a piecewise regression analysis pra pra is a brokenstick model where two or more lines meet at unknown points called breakpoints these breakpoints are threshold values the segmented package in the r software was used to execute the pra it estimates that breakpoints based on a 381 maximum likelihood approach that constrains regression segments are nearly continuous wei et al 2020 another method was proposed by tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 the pairs of inputs asi p and the combined p asi and outputs sr ssr and esr were divided in two groups which are defined by a possible threshold of rainfall depth for each group below and above the possible threshold the sum of squared deviations of subsurface flow from the average of each group was calculated and totaled this procedure was repeated for all possible rainfall thresholds having a step size of 0 1 mm an identified threshold was then defined as the rainfall value when squared deviations r p t sums were minimal 2 r p t s p p t s p p t 2 s p p t s p p t 2 where p t is the possible rainfall threshold p is the total rainfall depth s is the observed runoff for a storm of size p and r p t is the sum of the squared deviations for a threshold at p t 3 results 3 1 plot runoff characteristics and controlling factors table 2 presents rainfall asi sr ssr and esr measurements for the forty three of rainfall runoff events occurring in 2018 and 2019 fig 4 presents daily rainfall swc and runoff sr ssr and esr for the period 1 january 2018 to 31 december 2019 table 3 and fig 5 provide measurements of soil depth bedrock outcrops bedrock fragments plant types sr and ssr including means and coefficient of variation for the plots during 2018 and 2019 great variations were detected for soil depth ranging from 24 5 cm to 326 1 cm bedrock outcrops range from 5 to 23 and rock fragments ranging from 1 1 to 37 7 for the plots mean sr values ranged from 0 14 plot 10 to 1 65 mm plot 1 and sr of plot 1 is significantly larger than that observed for most other plots p 0 05 fig 5 a plots 7 8 9 and 10 sr values were tiny table 3 and fig 5 a the mean values were 0 15 0 19 0 33 and 0 14 mm respectively and can be ignored and considered as they have has no sr generation although the trenches were covered with a roof and direct rainfall was not included in the runoff records it is supposed that local lateral runoff in the thin organic soil layer generally occurred on the mineral soil surface and might have directly entered the trench and produced the minimal sr ssr ranged from 0 08 plot 3 to 3 32 mm plot 6 ssr values for plots 4 and 6 were significantly larger than that observed in many of the other plots p 0 05 fig 5 b table 3 and plot 3 generated the lowest ssr direct and indirect relationships among sr and ssr soil depth rock fragments root count and bedrock outcrops were evaluated using structural equation modeling sem fig 6 sem show that soil depth exerted the greatest direct effect on sr sr increases as soil depth increases outcrops had the largest indirect effect on sr through via their association with soil depth no obvious relationships were found between architectures of soil epikarst systems and ssr if sem is considered 3 2 karst slope water balance analysis water budget components sr ssr esr and others viz deep percolation evapotranspiration water storage in the soil epikarst system and canopy interception on the karst slope were quantified based on the two years of observations from 43 rainfall runoff events it can be concluded that lateral runoff which is comprised of sr ssr and esr accounted for 2 2 0 4 5 2 3 8 0 2 12 4 and 31 2 0 6 89 1 of rainfall respectively fig 7 the remaining 62 7 8 6 97 0 of rainfall was distributed among evapotranspiration vertical deep percolation contributions to ground water recharge and unsaturated soil or epikarst storage changes runoff proportion variations were great among the different plots sr ranged from 0 4 plot 10 to 5 2 plot 1 ssr ranged from 0 2 plot 3 to 12 4 plot 6 esr ranged from 0 6 plots 7 and 11 to 89 1 plot 3 fig 8 esr was relatively large sr and ssr were less than 5 fig 4 c suggests that sr and ssr were relatively rare and short esr discharge recessions were longer than sr and ssr the magnification area esr was a crucial component of the karst slope water budget having longer duration than other runoff components moreover we observed very large amounts of esr that induced non closure of the water balance at the plot scale for some rainfall events during rainy seasons table 2 events highlighted in yellow 3 3 sr and ssr threshold of the plots the rainfall events that were studied generated gross rainfall amounts ranging from 4 8 to 105 6 mm with 1 h maximum rainfall intensities ranging from 1 0 to 42 6 mmh 1 table 2 scatter plots for the total sr ssr and esr versus asi p and p asi for the 43 rainfall events are presented in fig 9 sr and ssr showed no threshold response to asi fig 9 a and b and pearson correlation coefficients r were weak between asi and sr and ssr r 0 6 scatter plots clearly show threshold responses to p and p asi fig 9 d e g and h relationships between sr ssr and p p asi above the threshold values were significantly stronger r 0 6 p 0 05 than asi and sr and ssr relationships a pra model identified input p and p asi thresholds for initiating sr and ssr the specific thresholds of p required to initiate sr and ssr were 45 0 and 32 6 mm respectively fig 9 d and e below these thresholds total sr and ssr were small 1 mm total sr and ssr increased linearly with p increasing from small approximately 0 mm to large values approximately 9 mm piecewise regression analysis revealed significant thresholds separating low sr ssr sensitivity from high sr ssr sensitivity with respect to p asi when taking asi into consideration p asi thresholds for generating sr and ssr were 159 4 and 157 1 mm respectively fig 9 g and h below these threshold values of 159 4 and 157 1 mm total sr and ssr were minimal above these values total sr and ssr increased by almost two orders of magnitude approximately 9 mm compared with p asi values that were smaller than the thresholds the hockey stick shape of nonlinear input output relationships is more clearly defined when p asi was the input value than when p was the only input this can also be seen from pearson correlation coefficients r and statistical significance the p values fig 9 d e g and h indicated an increased strength of the relationships between input and output hydrological variables there were no threshold responses between esr and asi p and p asi and the associated pearson correlation coefficient values were below 0 6 fig 9 c f and i pearson correlation coefficient values were larger between esr and p asi 0 476 than between esr and p 0 462 fig 9 f and i two methods were used to determine the rainfall runoff threshold according to the shapes of the rainfall runoff scatter diagrams table 3 and fig 10 and fig 11 show the rainfall runoff relationships for the plots the average rainfall depth thresholds for sr and ssr generation were 35 7 1 8 mm and 43 4 7 4 mm respectively sr generation thresholds were generally smaller than for ssr p 0 017 plots 7 10 had minimal sr and thus no rainfall depth thresholds total sr and ssr values appearing in in fig 10 and fig 11 were minimal when total rainfall was smaller than sr and ssr runoff thresholds once rainfall met threshold values storm runoff increased rapidly in step with rainfall amounts table 3 and fig 9 11 show that runoff response to rainfall amounts near threshold values vary substantially for instance rainfall amount and sr were 43 0 mm and 0 068 mm respectively on may 28 2019 but were 41 2 mm and 1 055 mm on july 7 2019 moreover nonlinear input output relationships between rainfall intensity and sr ssr and esr were evaluated karst slope storm event runoff did not significantly depend on rainfall intensity no clear threshold relationships between them were found it can be seen from table 2 that even in the highest intensity storm 42 6 mmh 1 event 28 when p asi 145 9 mm was smaller than the threshold values for initiation of sr 159 4 mm and ssr 157 1 mm sr and ssr were not produced 1 mm suggesting that runoff generation was driven primarily by rainfall depth or p asi but not solely by rainfall intensity 4 discussion 4 1 soil epikarst system architecture influence on slope runoff hydrological system architecture which is the spatial arrangement of hydrologically significant units or elements such as vegetation soil epikarst bedrock fissures conduits and caves creates intricate runoff and sediment yield responses sivapalan 2018 the plots studied had various architectures which resulted in large sr ssr and esr variations table 3 and fig 5 and 8 soil depth was determined as a first order control of sr using the sem this can be attributed to the relatively high ks in karst region 40 130 mm h 1 that lead to infiltration excess surface runoff that is unlikely to happen fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 many studies have found that ks declined with depth barontini et al 2015 han et al 2020 and this result is the same in the karst region fu et al 2015 thus ks may be low when the soil is deep enough and can then generate sr when rainfall intensity is larger than the ks at particular depths based on the sr generation mechanism infiltration excess and saturation excess operating in a karst slope fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 drainable porosity decreases with depth which allows relatively small rainfall inputs to result a rapid water table rise at the relatively impermeable layer this increases the potential for shallow lateral subsurface flow when soil water content nears capacity any soil water content increase will reach field capacity and trigger mobile soil water drainage and transport in shallow saturated lateral flow pathways such as sr and ssr penna et al 2011 no obvious relationships were found between soil epikarst system architecture and ssr and esr based on sem this suggests that the soil epikarst system structures that determine underground flow generation have not been completely discovered these flows may be controlled by more complicated subsurface structure components such as soil pipes fissures and conduits but all of which are extremely difficult to detect and measure other studies also suggest that the primary factors controlling hillslope flow paths are not the standard measured parameters such as surface topography and soil depth permeability or texture the more difficult to measure parameters such as microscale bedrock topography bedrock permeability and hillslope scale anisotropy are likely to be significant influencers of hillslope flow paths graham et al 2010 4 2 karst slope water balance components the mean runoff coefficients for sr ssr and esr were 2 2 3 8 and 30 4 respectively this karst slope s relatively small sr is attributed to a infiltration excess and saturation excess generation mechanism which is also called dunton overland flow loague et al 2010 infiltration excess reflects that rainfall intensity is greater than sei infiltration capacity saturation excess is when rainfall depth exceeds the soil water deficit water capacity of the epikarst surface depression and deep percolation from the interface wang et al 2020 this mechanism corresponds to two thresholds for sr generation rainfall amount and intensity this corresponds to the two sr generation thresholds rainfall amount and intensity the sei s relatively high infiltration capacity of about 40 mm h 1 decreases the likelihood that infiltrated water perches at the sei depression point to fill subsurface saturation areas it would generate ssr and sr after subsurface saturation areas connect and spill downslope over the epikarst surface towards the trench face which is the fill and spill theory chen et al 2012 fu et al 2015 zhu et al 2017 some plots generated no or nominal sr fig 10 g h i and j this results from relatively shallow soil depths and significant soil hydraulic conductivity resulting from many cracks fissures and conduits under extreme rainfall intensity when water infiltrates into the soil matrix input rates exceeded soil matrix permeability as localized matrix infiltration rates are exceeded or when low portions of the soil columns saturate then vertical bypass flow through visible sub vertical cracks deliver excess water vertically to the epikarst sr did not occur or was minimal graham et al 2010 on the other hand sr may not reach the hillslope toe and thus the stream because it may re infiltrate along its flow path detty and mcguire 2010 many studies conclude that ssr is an important runoff component in humid steep terrain environments weiler et al 2005 fu et al 2015 fu et al 2015 karst slope ssr values were greater as generation requirements were less demanding than that for sr ssr generation agrees with the fill and spill theory proposed by tromp van and mcdonnell 2006 infiltration water perches on the sei depression area the water table then reaches an edge of the depression completing the filling process and then the spilling process takes the water downslope towards the trench face ssr continues until previously not linked subsurface saturation areas expand and unite into one wang et al 2020 mcdonnell et al 2021 this study suggests that esr was the primary karst slope runoff component runoff amounts characteristics and its generation mechanism were difficult to detect as it occurs at the epikarst bedrock interface at this interface epikarst zones the transition zone between soil layer and bedrock are commonly quite thick 2 10 m wang et al 2019 a prior study proposed the esr generation mechanism to wit when rainfall amounts are great enough regardless of the rainfall intensity value and percolates into epikarst fissures or conduits the esr may be generated at the ebi wang et al 2020 additionally we observed that esr occurred earlier and discharge recession retained for longer periods than sr and ssr fig 4 c and the water balance did not close at the plot scale during some rainy seasons table 2 we deduced that the hydrological connectivity in the epikarst zone containing a large number of fissures and conduits was established during high antecedent moisture conditions containing soil and epikarst moisture and induced percolation water from outside of the plots from fissures and conduits in the soil epikarst systems that entered the plots and discharged as esr thereby resulting in non closure of the water balance model the importance of epikarst zone hydrological regulation and storage functions had been reported by previous studies fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 many previous studies suggest that plants use the water in weathered bedrock klos et al 2018 rempe and dietrich 2018 reported that as much as 27 of annual rainfall is seasonally stored as rock moisture which is the exchangeable water stored in unsaturated zones of weathered bedrock karst region field hydrology experiments are challenging and expensive to conduct burt and mcdonnell 2015 the challenge and expense increases for subsurface and irregular epikarst slope study to date virtually no research has been conducted to quantify weathered rock moisture epikarst moisture or epikarst slope storage discharge relationships epikarst zones are categorized as chemical weathering they are more porous and more have more fissures than the bedrock that was in the physical weathering category studied by rempe and dietrich 2018 karst areas should have a larger water storage capacities than non karst areas but this supposition needs to be quantified and studied a large percentage of esr may be the main driving force of karst region underground soil loss feng et al 2020 and this should also be studied in the future moreover the high permeability of sei 30 50 mmh 1 and the presence of a large number of fissures and conduits have a large influence on the water balance of karst hillslopes the mean sr coefficient for southwest china s karst regions 95 watersheds is 49 16 with a coefficient of variation of 32 17 liu et al 2020 this is much larger than karst slope sr and ssr coefficients even though these areas experience similar evaporation conditions the difference in runoff coefficients is likely due to water percolating into conduits and fissures of the hillslope epikarst zone that is likely to be a sink at the hillslope scale and a source for stream channels it can be concluded that the hydrological processes on karst slopes mainly occur at the subsurface and water traveling through the epikarst and reemerging at the stream would have longer and complex flow paths more contact with carbonate rocks different chemical compositions and longer mean residence times 4 3 karst slope nonlinear hydrological behavior 4 3 1 karst slope sr and ssr thresholds our two year analysis of rainfall soil water content and runoff data demonstrated threshold behavior and linear stormflow response as a function of asi and gross rainfall on a karst slope fig 9 these findings are supported by other studies graham et al 2010 detty and mcguire 2010 penna et al 2011 scaife and band 2017 scaife et al 2020 that have found a linearly increasing stormflow response with greater p or p asi after a well defined threshold reflecting soil water content storage characteristics hillslope drainage efficiency saturated area connectivity and runoff generating processes however contrary to our expectations our results indicated no threshold responses between asi and sr ssr and esr even though there were trends towards positive relationships between them fig 9 a and b our studies also indicated that relatively high asi is not a prerequisite for runoff generation thus our results did not support the results reported by penna et al 2011 who found that soil water content exerted a strong control on runoff in a catchment they also reported the existence of a sharp threshold value in soil water content and runoff coefficient relationship above which approximately 45 runoff significantly increased these disparate findings may be due to the high conductivity of karst soils the existence of enhanced porosity and permeability of the epikarst zone clear threshold relationships exist between p and total sr and ssr fig 9 d and e while threshold responses between p asi and total sr and ssr were more obvious fig 9 d and e these results are in line with existing research tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 detty and mcguire 2010 ali et al 2015 nonlinear runoff response likely reflected a soil water content storage threshold below which inputs replenished storage deficits and above which inputs were increasingly transferred to lateral runoff such as sr and ssr soil water dominant direction was vertical under dry antecedent conditions and lateral under wet antecedent conditions kegan et al 2014 plot rainfall amount thresholds for generating sr and ssr were 35 7 1 8 mm and 43 4 7 4 mm respectively table 3 and fig 10 and 11 threshold values reported elsewhere at the hillslope scale were generally less than 55 mm tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 ali et al 2015 and rainfall depth thresholds triggering runoff initiation determined in the instant study fall previously published data ranges tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 reported a ssr threshold generation value of 55 mm on a steep forested hillslope with a thin soil layer tani 1997 identified a threshold value of 20 mm and total runoff was quite small when total rainfall was less than 20 mm when rainfall exceeded this value storm runoff increased linearly with rainfall sr threshold values were generally smaller than those of ssr p 0 017 table 3 fig 10 and 11 this may be attributed to their different runoff generation mechanisms sr was generated by a dunton overland flow mechanism thus sr was generated at a location where vertical and lateral drainage rates were smaller than rainfall intensity loague et al 2010 wang et al 2020 thus the saturation excess zone is part of the entire soil zone many previous studies have shown that in many catchments surface saturation is spatially limited while ssr is generated at sei and its threshold value contains soil water deficit subsurface storage at sei and leakage to epikarst graham and mcdonnell 2010 for both sr and ssr the networked pattern and connectivity of the saturated patches but not the saturation at any one point determine the runoff threshold and connected flow path at the hillslope scale ameli et al 2015 sr threshold values were thus lesser than those for ssr runoff responses to near threshold value rainfall amounts varied substantially fig 9 11 this finding agrees with previous observations that hydrological predictability lessens with the approach of a nonlinear threshold and strengthens as the system retreats from that threshold stewart et al 2015 because of the non linearity of hydrological systems the predictability depends on the accuracy to which initial conditions and boundary conditions can be measured bloeschl and zehe 2005 however it is impossible to make measurements of the initial conditions such as antecedent soil water content at different depths and boundary conditions examples include rainfall intensity and water flux at lower layers at fine enough temporal and spatial scale sivapalan 2018 mcdonnell et al 2021 resulting in runoff prediction uncertainty predictability improved when the p asi was used as the hydrological input variable rather than not considering asi and uncertainties were reduced fig 9 d e g and h in three relationships esr and asi esr and p and esr and p asi no threshold responses were detected fig 9 c f and i this suggests that the threshold like input output relationship predicts sr and ssr well but not esr the lack of clear esr input output relationships likely reflects different runoff generation mechanisms sr and ssr generation are fill and spill which assumes all runoff processes are the same ameli et al 2015 another assumption is the infiltration of excess subsurface stormflow at the soil bedrock interface resembles the infiltration of excess overland flow at the soil surface it accepts that both surface runoff and subsurface runoff are activated by networked patterns and connectivity of the saturated patches and not by the saturation at any one point sr and ssr generation mechanisms are related to the water storage retention needed to saturate soil water content deficit for sr this would include the ssr bedrock depression zone loss is along the lower boundary during establishment of networked pattern and connectivity of the saturated patches sr and ssr presented threshold responses to inputs ameli et al 2015 mcdonnell et al 2021 esr generation was not determined by plot rainfall its contribution area was generally from up slope hydrological connectivity was established by fissures and conduits on the epikarst slope this gives rise to water balance non closure and no threshold like responses to rainfall finally no threshold linear two phase nonlinear hydrological behaviors were found between rainfall intensity and runoff on the karst slope this result is consistent with some previous findings in similarly humid temperate sites with very high soil hydraulic conductivity capacities where it was also found that rainfall intensity had little impact on runoff generation tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 graham et al 2010 ali et al 2015 scaife et al 2020 found maximum hourly rainfall did not significantly contribute to quickflow production in three forested headwater catchments they attributed this result to highly conductive forest soils in catchments where horton overland flow dominates a strong positive linear relationship r 2 0 9 p 0 0002 exists between stormflow and rainfall intensity kegan et al 2014 the weak rainfall intensity runoff relationship observed here indicates that stormflow was generated by underground lateral and vertical hydrological processes it may be that high intensity events can not generate runoff on a karst slope because of the high conductivity of karst soils 40 130 mm h 1 that is the result of fissures and conduits existing on karst slopes or because rainfall events of high intensity are relatively rare in this region and we can not completely detect the relationship between runoff and rainfall intensity 4 3 2 nonlinear hydrological behavior shapes on a karst slope the shapes of a storage discharge relationship reflect the underlying mechanisms of retention and release of event water in a hydrological system hillslope and catchment fig 1 when rainfall exceeds the threshold value there is a linear relationship between rainfall and runoff after the threshold mcdonnell 2013 ali et al 2013 most of the shapes present in this study of the nonlinear input output relationships were hockey stick shape especially the r sr hydrological behaviors fig 10 and some of the r ssr relationships fig 11 a b c k and l step functions and sigmoid function shapes also appeared fig 1 e f g h i and j and indicate how complex karst hydrological systems are step and sigmoid function shapes for the rainfall runoff relationships may result from large conduits fissures and caves in the soil epikarst zone when instantaneous water levels rise at the soil epikarst interface and ssr is generated subsurface saturation area may connect with large conduits fissures and caves and infiltration water will percolate into them while ssr maintains its flow rate this explanation resembles transmissivity feedback or preferential flows through the macropore network mechanism that allows for rapid transformation of infiltration water many studies have found that above an inflection point small changes in groundwater levels were associated with a large change in streamflow while below the inflection point large changes in groundwater level were associated with small changes in streamflow the reason for these observations is that when instantaneous water levels at sbi or sei rose above a critical level in the soil layer they entered soils or epikarst with significantly higher hydraulic conductivity via macropores fissures conduits and caves which increased subsurface runoff or deep percolation detty and mcguire 2010 based on this theory as instantaneous water levels rise through the soil and epikarst on the karst slopes wang et al 2020 profile transmissivity increases significantly and the increasingly transmissive flow paths increase deep percolation drainage rates and reducing ssr rise rates 4 3 3 methods to determine rainfall runoff thresholds output versus input threshold behaviors were determined using the piecewise regression analysis pra method for threshold identification in most of the previous studies detty and mcguire 2010 penna et al 2011 scaife and band 2017 wei et al 2020 while the nonlinear hydrological behaviors of these studies were the hockey stick shape however in principle the implicit assumption of the pra model is that the relationships between the response and the explanatory variable is piecewise linear kegan et al 2014 wei et al 2020 but this assumption is unsuitable for threshold identification when the nonlinear hydrological behaviors are not hockey stick shaped for instance pra is unusable for step function and sigmoid function shapes fig 1 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 and ali et al 2011 also found step function types of threshold relationships between rainfall and ssr and between storage and discharge for these situations pra is unsuitable for threshold identification and the method proposed by tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 should be used thus methods to determine threshold values should be based on the shape of the nonlinear input output relationship 5 conclusions water balance characteristics and rainfall runoff relationships are poorly understood for the karst areas of southwest china even though the region is one of the world s largest continuous karst terrains rainfall runoff threshold behaviors have been observed in many sites with different climate lithologic soil types and at various scales which can be an effective method for up scaling catchments comparison classifications and runoff predicting in ungauged basins mcglynn et al 2013 mcdonnell et al 2021 the responses to 43 rainfall events and the dynamics of runoff including sr ssr and esr and soil water content for twelve 5 m 20 m plots on a karst slope in southwest china over two years 2018 2019 were recorded in order to better evaluate rainfall properties soil water content and soil epikarst system structures on rainfall runoff characteristics and reveal threshold behaviors the results showed that the hillslope scale sr ssr and esr coefficients are 2 2 cv 76 3 3 8 cv 112 9 and 31 2 cv 113 5 respectively sr and ssr events were relatively rare and short while esr was a crucial component of karst slope water budgets and duration was longer which indicates the critical epikarst roles in water regulation functions suach as storage and release soil depth had the largest direct effect on sr and higher soil depth increased sr there are factors controlling rainfall ssr response buried beneath the soil profile and difficult to identify thus calling for additional geophysical exploration methods threshold like runoff responses to rainfall inputs have been observed on karst slopes the rainfall depth runoff initiation thresholds for sr and ssr generation were 36 2 mm and 43 7 mm respectively the strength of the threshold like input output relationships were slightly greater when p asi was used as the hydrological input variable rather than without consideration asi different shapes of nonlinear hydrological behaviors such as the hockey stick heaviside or step function and the sigmoid function had been detected for karst slope runoff thresholds vary with vegetation water use scaife and band 2017 and hydro climatic conditions wei et al 2020 because of the runoff plots were constructed in recent years 2016 and plants belong to immaturity stage the differences roots canopy transpiration and etc of the plants were minimal the influence of land use types and hydrological effect of vegetation on hydrological behaviors have not been evaluated in this study the stability and the hydrological

3774,water balance characteristics and rainfall runoff relationships of karst slope are poorly understood worldwide even though karst landscapes occupy 10 15 the planet s land surface dynamic hydrological responses were monitored for 43 rainfall events on a karst slope in southwest china over two years 2018 2019 the responses included surface subsurface and epikarst seepage runoff abbreviated as sr ssr and esr respectively and soil water content at different depths 10 cm 30 cm and the soil epikarst interface in twelve plots 5 m 20 m total 1200 m 2 results showed that 1 the hillslope scale sr ssr and esr coefficients were 2 2 0 4 5 2 3 8 0 2 12 4 and 31 2 0 6 89 1 respectively sr and ssr were relatively rare and of short duration while esr was a crucial component of the karst hillslope water balance and its duration was longer demonstrating the critical role of epikarst zone in regulating flow functions such as water storage and release 2 soil depth exerted the greatest direct effect on sr which increased as soil deepened factors controlling the rainfall ssr response were difficult to identify they require other geophysical exploration methods 3 threshold like runoff responses to rainfall inputs were observed on karst slope and the rainfall depth p runoff initiation thresholds for sr and ssr were 36 2 mm and 43 7 mm respectively the strength of the threshold like input output relationships was slightly greater when the p asi antecedent soil water content index was used as the hydrological input variable rather than without consideration of asi the differing shapes of nonlinear hydrological behaviours such as the hockey stick heaviside function or the sigmoid function were detected in karst slope this suggests karst hydrological system complexity threshold values should be determined according to the shapes of nonlinear hydrological behaviours these results extend the understanding of karst hydrological processes keywords hillslope hydrology soil epikarst systems karst ecosystems subsurface runoff water balance threshold 1 introduction the central concerns of catchment hydrology can be summarized in a few basic questions 1 where does water go and where does stream originate when it rains 2 what flow path does it take to the stream 3 how long does it stay and 4 how can observations scale or transfer to other catchments mcdonnell 2003 based on a proliferation of complex site specific studies progress in answering the first 3 questions has been made the overwhelming spatio temporal heterogeneity of climatic and landscape properties of experimental catchments extrapolation of knowledge from gauged to ungauged hillslopes and catchments leaves this field of study land mined with numerous difficulties and uncertainties and thus the fourth last question is a major challenge zehe and sivapalan 2009 mcglynn et al 2013 although a number of sophisticated process based hydrology models which integrate surface subsurface and ecosystem processes have been developed to predict catchment runoff over the past decades these bottom up models continue to be limited by landscape heterogeneity and the variety of types of returns of parameters calibrated in ungauged catchments scaife and band 2017 sivapalan 2018 hillslopes and catchments are complex systems having threshold behaviors hysteresis feedback and other characteristic forms of nonlinearity ameli et al 2015 using a top down approach complex runoff generation processes can be simplified into emergent behaviors such as the threshold behaviors scaife and band 2017 the intent of threshold behavior models is to simplify spatially and temporally complex hydrologic behavior by relating hydrologic flux patterns to observable state variables exploring macroscale and similarities properties may be a useful means of supporting runoff process research and may improve process measurement understanding and prediction and to assist in developing a general theory scaife and band 2017 mcdonnell et al 2021 numerous threshold detection studies have been conducted at hillslope watershed and catchment scales based on observations of the temporal and spatial patterns of the transient saturation at the soil bedrock interface sbi and its relation to ssr the fill and spill theory was used to explain the threshold behavior of a trenched hillslope located in the panola mountain research watershed tromp van and mcdonnell 2006 irrigation and excavation experiments measuring maimai hillslope behavior revealed that ssr at the sbi has transmits large amounts of water with high lateral velocities up to 9000 mm h 1 these were several orders of magnitude greater than predicted by darcy s law using measured hydraulic conductivities at the site graham et al 2010 this situation reflects the importance of macropores and preferential flows in facilitating rapid subsurface runoff responses at hillslope scale beven and germann 2013 graham et al 2010 also pointed out the easily measured parameters such as surface topography soil depth and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity were not the first order controlling factors they were the difficult to measure subsurface parameters such as microscale bedrock topography bedrock permeability and lateral subsurface velocities on a steep forested hillslope with a thin soil layer about 50 cm near okayama city in japan tani 1997 found that antecedent soil water content controlled runoff generation for the hillslope and the catchment which include the hillslope runoff was less than 10 of rainfall if antecedent conditions were dry and rainfall did not exceed 100 mm runoff increase almost equaled rainfall increase when total rainfall exceeded 100 mm this suggests that almost all rainfall contributed to storm runoff when the soil was the wettest detty and mcguire 2010 believed that threshold behaviors were due to effective saturated hydraulic conductivity increases when water tables rose into highly transmissive near surface soil during runoff events with these threshold conditions this relates to a transmissivity feedback mechanism measurements for a small italian alp headwater catchment having steep hillslopes and a distinct riparian zone disclosed a sharp threshold existed in the relationship between soil water content and streamflow and the hillslope s mean water table penna et al 2011 high runoff coefficients occurred during wet antecedent conditions ssr was activated on the hillslope and became a major contributor to streamflow penna et al 2011 threshold runoff responses to precipitation inputs and the relationship between different responses to the catchments characteristics such as air temperature precipitation percentage of snow potential evaporation topography wetness index and other factors were also analyzed across nine mid latitude to high latitude cold catchments in northern canada results were that eight of nine catchments had runoff threshold responses catchment hydroclimatic and geophysical characteristics such as mean annual air temperature median flow path distance to the stream median sub catchment area were the primary impact factors for rainfall driven events ali et al 2015 precipitation streamflow and soil moisture data for a fifteen year period for three north carolina us catchments were analyzed at event season interannual and decadal levels in order to determine any threshold behavior stationarity for geophysical properties scaife and band 2017 thresholds were more variable between growing seasons than between dormant seasons this implied that runoff controlling factors are not the only static characteristics of catchment such soil topography and other nor was climate but the dynamic ecosystem feedbacks such as ecosystem transpiration rates driven by changing vegetation dynamics were previous studies reported four nonlinear hydrological behavioral shapes hockey stick heaviside function dirac function and sigmoid function fig 1 ali et al 2013 many of these studies found that the nonlinear rainfall runoff relationships followed the hockey stick shape for a range of different hillslopes tani 1997 graham et al 2010 detty and mcguire 2010 penna et al 2011 ali et al 2015 and watersheds scaife and band 2017 wei et al 2020 there were differences among the sites for the x intercept or threshold value and the slope of the relationship after the threshold was reached the slope reflects differences in the bedrock leakage coefficient and subsurface storage volume slope decrease as those values increase x intercept increased as those values increased the bedrock leakage coefficient had greater impact on the slope values subsurface storage volume had greater impact on threshold values graham and mcdonnell 2010 field hydrology experiments in karst regions are much more complicated and expensive to conduct burt and mcdonnell 2015 which has resulted in threshold hydrologic response on karst hillslopes not being explored vertical percolation of water into the bedrock has a large influence on water balance graham et al 2010 the permeability of the soil epikarst interface sei where ssr generation on karst slopes is high evough about 40 mm h 1 and have a significant impact on runoff processes fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 however no prior threshold studies we have looked closely at the relatively high permeability of the lower boundary relatively high sei permeability influence on runoff generation thresholds should be addressed event rainfall threshold values for specific sites had been detected examples include 20 mm for both a slope and a catchment in the tatsunokuchi yama experimental forest near okayama city in japan tani 1997 23 mm in an alpine headwater catchment located in the italian dolomites penna et al 2011 and 55 mm for the panola hillslope tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 differences in runoff generation may be controlled by hillslope or catchment characteristics it has been shown that soil epikarst structures have a significant impact on flow processes fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 the combined impacts of soil epikarst structures such as soil depth bedrock outcrops bedrock fragments the number of roots on sr and ssr generation is poorly understand for karst regions field studies need to be conducted to quantify how hillslope characteristics might explain differing hydrological behaviors finally approaches for threshold identification differ in the different studies tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 graham et al 2010 wei et al 2020 methods for determining threshold values should be explored to present a uniform metric e g for catchments comparison research karst regions cover 12 of the earth s surface and about a quarter of global population is dependent on karst aquifers drinking water ford 2007 china s southwestern karst region is one of the world s largest continuous karst terrain areas exposed to a subtropical climate it covers a 4 52 10 5 km2 cockpit karst terrain is common yuan et al 2016 these consist of conical hills and star shaped valleys and account for about 73 of the karst area karst hillslopes occupy a large part of the cockpit karst landscape they are a fundamental landscape unit for runoff generation and groundwater recharge it has suffered severe environmental degradation including vegetation cover loss soil erosion and biodiversity loss disastrous droughts and floods are frequent wang et al 2020 a better understanding of karst hillslope hydrological processes is important to both theory and practice karst hillslope hydrology research based on experimental hydrology methods is still relatively uncommon in this region the conceptual scheme of the soil epikarst system and its dominant processes were first put forward by williams 1983 the highly heterogeneous structure of the soil epikarst system results in various infiltration pathways which exert key roles in groundwater recharge processes and rainfall runoff relationships according to perrin et al 2003 the soil cover plays a critical role in the infiltration velocity and in mixing despite the importance of the soil epikarst systems for karst water resources previous research mostly and narrowly focused only on karst groundwater few studies which directly characterized karst systems shallow subsurface processes have been conducted only recently some papers have dealt with this topic included soil water content and its stable isotope spatial variability jing et al 2016 ssr characteristics wilcox et al 2008 fu et al 2015 sr donton overland flow a hybrid mechanism which incorporating aspects of both horton and dunne overland flow and ssr fill and spill generation mechanisms loague et al 2010 wang et al 2020 previous studies showed that ssr predominates in runoff wilcox et al 2008 fu et al 2015 fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 and limited saturation excess sr peng and wang 2012 zhu et al 2017 for karst slopes these studies provided a foundation for comprehending the mechanisms of runoff generation most of the studies used short term situ rainfall simulation experiments wilcox et al 2008 fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 the characteristics were inconsistent with natural rainfall features such as rainfall depth intensity and duration they were implemented at a relatively small scale either point or plot scale they did not consider differing antecedent soil water content conditions such as dryness and wetness water budget characteristics under natural conditions on karst slopes remain unclear runoff coefficients such as sr and ssr to precipitation ratios remain unknown at present epikarst seepage flow esr generate at epikarst bedrock interface ebi persisted on after rainfall ceased from several days to weeks sr and ssr stopped simultaneously with rainfall ceasing these observations raise questions as to why esr was retained and why for so long water balance closure at the plot scale should be examined in this study two years 2018 2019 of natural rainfall runoff data for 12 runoff plots on a karst hillslope of southwest china with a total area of 1200 m 2 was collected in order to answer the following questions does water unbalance under some conditions what are the dominant flow pathways such as sr ssr and esr for karst slopes which if any soil epikarst system characteristics such as soil depth rock fragments outcrops or the number of roots numbers best explain runoff generation differences between the runoff plots do karst hillslopes exhibit threshold responses to rainfall inputs and antecedent soil water content and if so what sr and ssr characteristics initiate thresholds and how are these thresholds best determined 2 materials and methods 2 1

correspond closely to the formula camg co3 2 borehole analysis suggests that karstification degree decreases as depth increases both the soil layer and the epikarst zone show a trend of gradually thickening along the downhill direction study area karstification is characterized by penetrating dissolution pores micro tensile dissolution fractures and local dissolution fractures its highly weathered dolomite is mostly deconstructed into its original rock structure and even dolomite sand the middle weathered dolomite has a fine crystal structure and coarse crystal structure locally the massive compact rock is hard and contains silica locally there is no obvious bubble reaction obtained after dropping dilute hydrochloric acid on it epikarst zone permeability coefficient k shows great variability with a general value of 10 1 1 mm h 1 and a local value of 18 000 mm h 1 except for the escarpments around the hill crests most of hillslopes in the study catchment was covered with a continuously distributed shallow soil layer the soil thickness is range from 0 m in the upslope to 2 m in the depression while the epikarst zone thickness is range from 0 5 m in the upslope to 27 m in the depression the epikarst zone is mainly composed of moderately to strongly weathered dolomite rocks with karren grike and fissure the main karst features the soil type is rendzina with a texture between that of clay and clay loam 25 50 silt and 30 60 clay soils are well drained gravelly and calcareous it has stable infiltration rates ranging from 40 to 130 mm h 1 chen et al 2012 epikarst surfaces have a near steady infiltration rate of approximately 40 mm h 1 subsurface runoff occurs along the sei and is dominated by preferential flow fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 2 2 runoff plots and data collection runoff plots were located on the western side of the watershed figs 2 a and b similar to many previous studies conducted by other hillslope hydrology researchers the general approach to studying the water balance runoff mechanisms and movement in response to rainfall and snowmelt involved excavation to the sbi at the lower boundary of the experimental hillslope to expose the subsurface runoff tromp van and mcdonnell 2006 fu et al 2015 twelve 5 m 20 m hillslope runoff plots were established on the lower slope fig 2b and c each plot had a 5 m wide trench the total trench width was about 80 m where material was removed completely down to the massive compact bedrock an average vertical depth of 4 m using a backhoe fig 2 c and d epikarst at the site was moderately weathered with a shallow soil mantle mean soil thickness for the plots was 50 cm based on a survey of the trenches among the 12 runoff plots fig 2 c concrete walls were poured deep into the epikarst surface on the left right and upper edges to prevent sr and ssr exchange between adjacent plots fig 2 d and fig 3 the plots were divided into four groups corn forage walnut and natural grassland with three types of each of the four vegetation types in order to quantify the effect of vegetation types on water sediments and nutrient loss the runoff plots were constructed in 2016 and 2017 and the plants immature root count canopy transpiration and other aspect of the plants were minimal and it had been reported that vegetation and land use types had relatively small effects on runoff chen et al 2012 eight observation points monitored volumetric soil water content swc at 10 cm 30 cm and the sei based on the soil depth distribution swc was measured every 5 min using frequency domain decomposition stevens hydra probe soil sensor stevens usa www stevenswater com a previous study wang et al 2020 provides detailed descriptions of the swc observation points inside each trench three concrete troughs and runoff collecting facilities were constructed to collect runoff from the surface as sr soil epikarst interface ssr and epikarst bedrock interface esr separately fig 3 sr and esr troughs were straight with a slight gradient send water to one side of the trench the trough for collecting the ssr undulated due to intense karstification processes near the surface which led to highly irregular soil epikarst interfaces the ssr trough was divided into five equal sections in order to accurately and time recorded subsurface runoff 1 ssf1 5 ssf5 from left to right fig 3 each section was a 1 m wide trench width having its own drainage provided by 65 mm diameter pvc pipe fig 2 d sr ssr and esr were measured by routing runoff through tipping bucket flow gauges at 100 ml ssr and 1 l sr and esr resolutions tb1l hydrological services usa the lower edges of the experiment plot were covered with a plastic film to prevent rainfall entering the sr gutter fig 2d trenches were roofed and direct rainfall was not included as runoff the roof was a waterproof cement plaster coated brick wall there was a 5 cm gap between it and the trench face during the wall construction process only ssf and esr troughs were filled with clean silica sand into the gap to form a thin packing layer between the trench face and the roof this sand packing layer smoothed out sharp hydraulic gradient changes between trench face and air during runoff events packing sand may prevent a collapse of the exposed soil epikarst profile caused by weathering this ensures a long term stable operation for these runoff collecting facilities magnitudes of all runoff components sr ssr and esr were expressed as depth per unit plot area except when noted no soil water content responses or runoff occurred after small rainfall events 5 mm rainfall was completely intercepted by ground vegetation and moss a total of 43 rainfall events of more than 5 mm within a standard of 6 h interval were recorded during the monitoring period with rainfalls lasting between 15 min and 24 h according to the standard 6 h interval if rainfall value is not measured for more than 6 h it was regarded as two rainfall events liang and chan 2017 2 3 measurement of soil and epikarst characteristics soil samples were collected upslope middle slope and down slope to replicate three soil property measurements soil particle size distributions were measured with a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern england soil bulk density of undisturbed soil samples g cm 3 were measured using steel columns that were 5 cm in diameter and 100 cm 3 in volume this was done via the excavation method rock fragment content rfc was the ratio of rock and dry soil weight soil saturated hydraulic conductivity mm h 1 was measured with the constant head method soil organic carbon g kg 1 was determined using the dichromate oxidation method fu et al 2015 soil depths for plots were measured using a chain pin length 100 cm diameter 1 2 cm which were forced vertically through the soil to the epikarst using a grid scheme 1 m 1 m for each of the plots a soil auger length 250 cm diameter 5 0 cm was used for soil depths deeper than 100 cm the root count was taken at the plot left and right sides prior to concrete walls were installation bedrock outcrops were also counted in each of the plots table 1 lists the soil and epikarst characteristics 2 4 calculations and statistical analysis 2 4 1 structural equation model direct and indirect relationships among sr and ssr soil depth rock fragments root numbers and bedrock outcrops were evaluated using structural equation modeling sem sem fit was evaluated using p values chi squared values goodness of fit index and root mean square error of approximation sem was conducted using the amos 18 0 software package amos development corporation chicago il usa unless otherwise specified the results were considered to be significant when p 0 05 2 4 2 antecedent soil water content index determination soil water content data immediately preceding an event were used to determine the total soil water storage for a profile using the total water content for each soil horizon where water content integrates volumetric water content over the depth interval represented by each soil water content sensor antecedent soil water content index asi from soil profiles in plot 4 wang et al 2020 was determined using the method provided by haga et al 2005 1 asi i 1 n vwc i d i where i is the index representing the different soil layers n is the number of instrumented soil layers vwc i is the volumetric water content values d i is the soil layer thicknesses 2 4 3 approaches for threshold identification two methods were used to determine the rainfall runoff thresholds output sr and ssr threshold behaviors compared to input asi precipitation p and combined p asi were measured using a piecewise regression analysis pra pra is a brokenstick model where two or more lines meet at unknown points called breakpoints these breakpoints are threshold values the segmented package in the r software was used to execute the pra it estimates that breakpoints based on a 381 maximum likelihood approach that constrains regression segments are nearly continuous wei et al 2020 another method was proposed by tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 the pairs of inputs asi p and the combined p asi and outputs sr ssr and esr were divided in two groups which are defined by a possible threshold of rainfall depth for each group below and above the possible threshold the sum of squared deviations of subsurface flow from the average of each group was calculated and totaled this procedure was repeated for all possible rainfall thresholds having a step size of 0 1 mm an identified threshold was then defined as the rainfall value when squared deviations r p t sums were minimal 2 r p t s p p t s p p t 2 s p p t s p p t 2 where p t is the possible rainfall threshold p is the total rainfall depth s is the observed runoff for a storm of size p and r p t is the sum of the squared deviations for a threshold at p t 3 results 3 1 plot runoff

swc and runoff sr ssr and esr for the period 1 january 2018 to 31 december 2019 table 3 and fig 5 provide measurements of soil depth bedrock outcrops bedrock fragments plant types sr and ssr including means and coefficient of variation for the plots during 2018 and 2019 great variations were detected for soil depth ranging from 24 5 cm to 326 1 cm bedrock outcrops range from 5 to 23 and rock fragments ranging from 1 1 to 37 7 for the plots mean sr values ranged from 0 14 plot 10 to 1 65 mm plot 1 and sr of plot 1 is significantly larger than that observed for most other plots p 0 05 fig 5 a plots 7 8 9 and 10 sr values were tiny table 3 and fig 5 a the mean values were 0 15 0 19 0 33 and 0 14 mm respectively and can be ignored and considered as they have has no sr generation although the trenches were covered with a roof and direct rainfall was not included in the runoff records it is supposed that local lateral runoff in the thin organic soil layer generally occurred on the mineral soil surface and might have directly entered the trench and produced the minimal sr ssr ranged from 0 08 plot 3 to 3 32 mm plot 6 ssr values for plots 4 and 6 were significantly larger than that observed in many of the other plots p 0 05 fig 5 b table 3 and plot 3 generated the lowest ssr direct and indirect relationships among sr and ssr soil depth rock fragments root count and bedrock outcrops were evaluated using structural equation modeling sem fig 6 sem show that soil depth exerted the greatest direct effect on sr sr increases as soil depth increases outcrops had the largest indirect effect on sr through via their association with soil depth no obvious relationships were found between architectures of soil epikarst systems and ssr if sem is considered 3 2 karst slope water balance analysis water budget components sr ssr esr and others viz deep percolation evapotranspiration water storage in the soil epikarst system and canopy interception on the karst slope were quantified based on the two years of observations from 43 rainfall runoff events it can be concluded that lateral runoff which is comprised of sr ssr and esr accounted for 2 2 0 4 5 2 3 8 0 2 12 4 and 31 2 0 6 89 1 of rainfall respectively fig 7 the remaining 62 7 8 6 97 0 of rainfall was distributed among evapotranspiration vertical deep percolation contributions to ground water recharge and unsaturated soil or epikarst storage changes runoff proportion variations were great among the different plots sr ranged from 0 4 plot 10 to 5 2 plot 1 ssr ranged from 0 2 plot 3 to 12 4 plot 6 esr ranged from 0 6 plots 7 and 11 to 89 1 plot 3 fig 8 esr was relatively large sr and ssr were less than 5 fig 4 c suggests that sr and ssr were relatively rare and short esr discharge recessions were longer than sr and ssr the magnification area esr was a crucial component of the karst slope water budget having longer duration than other runoff components moreover we observed very large amounts of esr that induced non closure of the water balance at the plot scale for some rainfall events during rainy seasons table 2 events highlighted in yellow 3 3 sr and ssr threshold of the plots the rainfall events that were studied generated gross rainfall amounts ranging from 4 8 to 105 6 mm with 1 h maximum rainfall intensities ranging from 1 0 to 42 6 mmh 1 table 2 scatter plots for the total sr ssr and esr versus asi p and p asi for the 43 rainfall events are presented in fig 9 sr and ssr showed no threshold response to asi fig 9 a and b and pearson correlation coefficients r were weak between asi and sr and ssr r 0 6 scatter plots clearly show threshold responses to p and p asi fig 9 d e g and h relationships between sr ssr and p p asi above the threshold values were significantly stronger r 0 6 p 0 05 than asi and sr and ssr relationships a pra model identified input p and p asi thresholds for initiating sr and ssr the specific thresholds of p required to initiate sr and ssr were 45 0 and 32 6 mm respectively fig 9 d and e below these thresholds total sr and ssr were small 1 mm total sr and ssr increased linearly with p increasing from small approximately 0 mm to large values approximately 9 mm piecewise regression analysis revealed significant thresholds separating low sr ssr sensitivity from high sr ssr sensitivity with respect to p asi when taking asi into consideration p asi thresholds for generating sr and ssr were 159 4 and 157 1 mm respectively fig 9 g and h below these threshold values of 159 4 and 157 1 mm total sr and ssr were minimal above these values total sr and ssr increased by almost two orders of magnitude approximately 9 mm compared with p asi values that were smaller than the thresholds the hockey stick shape of nonlinear input output relationships is more clearly defined when p asi was the input value than when p was the only input this can also be seen from pearson correlation coefficients r and statistical significance the p values fig 9 d e g and h indicated an increased strength of the relationships between input and output hydrological variables there were no threshold responses between esr and asi p and p asi and the associated pearson correlation coefficient values were below 0 6 fig 9 c f and i pearson correlation coefficient values were larger between esr and p asi 0 476 than between esr and p 0 462 fig 9 f and i two methods were used to determine the rainfall runoff threshold according to the shapes of the rainfall runoff scatter diagrams table 3 and fig 10 and fig 11 show the rainfall runoff relationships for the plots the average rainfall depth thresholds for sr and ssr generation were 35 7 1 8 mm and 43 4 7 4 mm respectively sr generation thresholds were generally smaller than for ssr p 0 017 plots 7 10 had minimal sr and thus no rainfall depth thresholds total sr and ssr values appearing in in fig 10 and fig 11 were minimal when total rainfall was smaller than sr and ssr runoff thresholds once rainfall met threshold values storm runoff increased rapidly in step with rainfall amounts table 3 and fig 9 11 show that runoff response to rainfall amounts near threshold values vary substantially for instance rainfall amount and sr were 43 0 mm and 0 068 mm respectively on may 28 2019 but were 41 2 mm and 1 055 mm on july 7 2019 moreover nonlinear input output relationships between rainfall intensity and sr ssr and esr were evaluated karst slope storm event runoff did not significantly depend on rainfall intensity no clear threshold relationships between them were found it can be seen from table 2 that even in the highest intensity storm 42 6 mmh 1 event 28 when p asi 145 9 mm was smaller than the threshold values for initiation of sr 159 4 mm and ssr 157 1 mm sr and ssr were not produced 1 mm suggesting that runoff generation was driven primarily by rainfall depth or p asi but not solely by rainfall intensity 4 discussion 4 1 soil epikarst system architecture influence on slope runoff hydrological system architecture which is the spatial arrangement of hydrologically significant units or elements such as vegetation soil epikarst bedrock fissures conduits and caves creates intricate runoff and sediment yield responses sivapalan 2018 the plots studied had various architectures which resulted in large sr ssr and esr variations table 3 and fig 5 and 8 soil depth was determined as a first order control of sr using the sem this can be attributed to the relatively high ks in karst region 40 130 mm h 1 that lead to infiltration excess surface runoff that is unlikely to happen fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 many studies have found that ks declined with depth barontini et al 2015 han et al 2020 and this result is the same in the karst region fu et al 2015 thus ks may be low when the soil is deep enough and can then generate sr when rainfall intensity is larger than the ks at particular depths based on the sr generation mechanism infiltration excess and saturation excess operating in a karst slope fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 drainable porosity decreases with depth which allows relatively small rainfall inputs to result a rapid water table rise at the relatively impermeable layer this increases the potential for shallow lateral subsurface flow when soil water content nears capacity any soil water content increase will reach field capacity and trigger mobile soil water drainage and transport in shallow saturated lateral flow pathways such as sr and ssr penna et al 2011 no obvious relationships were found between soil epikarst system architecture and ssr and esr based on sem this suggests that the soil epikarst system structures that determine underground flow generation have not been completely discovered these flows may be controlled by more complicated subsurface structure components such as soil pipes fissures and conduits but all of which are extremely difficult to detect and measure other studies also suggest that the primary factors controlling hillslope flow paths are not the standard measured parameters such as surface topography and soil depth permeability or texture the more difficult to measure parameters such as microscale bedrock topography bedrock permeability and hillslope scale anisotropy are likely to be significant influencers of hillslope flow paths graham et al 2010 4 2 karst slope water balance components the mean runoff coefficients for sr ssr and esr were 2 2 3 8 and 30 4 respectively this karst slope s relatively small sr is attributed to a infiltration excess and saturation excess generation mechanism which is also called dunton overland flow loague et al 2010 infiltration excess reflects that rainfall intensity is greater than sei infiltration capacity saturation excess is when rainfall depth exceeds the soil water deficit water capacity of the epikarst surface depression and deep percolation from the interface wang et al 2020 this mechanism corresponds to two thresholds for sr generation rainfall amount and intensity this corresponds to the two sr generation thresholds rainfall amount and intensity the sei s relatively high infiltration capacity of about 40 mm h 1 decreases the likelihood that infiltrated water perches at the sei depression point to fill subsurface saturation areas it would generate ssr and sr after subsurface saturation areas connect and spill downslope over the epikarst surface towards the trench face which is the fill and spill theory chen et al 2012 fu et al 2015 zhu et al 2017 some plots generated no or nominal sr fig 10 g h i and j this results from relatively shallow soil depths and significant soil hydraulic conductivity resulting from many cracks fissures and conduits under extreme rainfall intensity when water infiltrates into the soil matrix input rates exceeded soil matrix permeability as localized matrix infiltration rates are exceeded or when low portions of the soil columns saturate then vertical bypass flow through visible sub vertical cracks deliver excess water vertically to the epikarst sr did not occur or was minimal graham et al 2010 on the other hand sr may not reach the hillslope toe and thus the stream because it may re infiltrate along its flow path detty and mcguire 2010 many studies conclude that ssr is an important runoff component in humid steep terrain environments weiler et al 2005 fu et al 2015 fu et al 2015 karst slope ssr values were greater as generation requirements were less demanding than that for sr ssr generation agrees with the fill and spill theory proposed by tromp van and mcdonnell 2006 infiltration water perches on the sei depression area the water table then reaches an edge of the depression completing the filling process and then the spilling process takes the water downslope towards the trench face ssr continues until previously not linked subsurface saturation areas expand and unite into one wang et al 2020 mcdonnell et al 2021 this study suggests that esr was the primary karst slope runoff component runoff amounts characteristics and its generation mechanism were difficult to detect as it occurs at the epikarst bedrock interface at this interface epikarst zones the transition zone between soil layer and bedrock are commonly quite thick 2 10 m wang et al 2019 a prior study proposed the esr generation mechanism to wit when rainfall amounts are great enough regardless of the rainfall intensity value and percolates into epikarst fissures or conduits the esr may be generated at the ebi wang et al 2020 additionally we observed that esr occurred earlier and discharge recession retained for longer periods than sr and ssr fig 4 c and the water balance did not close at the plot scale during some rainy seasons table 2 we deduced that the hydrological connectivity in the epikarst zone containing a large number of fissures and conduits was established during high antecedent moisture conditions containing soil and epikarst moisture and induced percolation water from outside of the plots from fissures and conduits in the soil epikarst systems that entered the plots and discharged as esr thereby resulting in non closure of the water balance model the importance of epikarst zone hydrological regulation and storage functions had been reported by previous studies fu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 many previous studies suggest that plants use the water in weathered bedrock klos et al 2018 rempe and dietrich 2018 reported that as much as 27 of annual rainfall is seasonally stored as rock moisture which is the exchangeable water stored in unsaturated zones of weathered bedrock karst region field hydrology experiments are challenging and expensive to conduct burt and mcdonnell 2015 the challenge and expense increases for subsurface and irregular epikarst slope study to date virtually no research has been conducted to quantify weathered rock moisture epikarst moisture or epikarst slope storage discharge relationships epikarst zones are categorized as chemical weathering they are more porous and more have more fissures than the bedrock that was in the physical weathering category studied by rempe and dietrich 2018 karst areas should have a larger water storage capacities than non karst areas but this supposition needs to be quantified and studied a large percentage of esr may be the main driving force of karst region underground soil loss feng et al 2020 and this should also be studied in the future moreover the high permeability of sei 30 50 mmh 1 and the presence of a large number of fissures and conduits have a large influence on the water balance of karst hillslopes the mean sr coefficient for southwest china s karst regions 95 watersheds is 49 16 with a coefficient of variation of 32 17 liu et al 2020 this is much larger than karst slope sr and ssr coefficients even though these areas experience similar evaporation conditions the difference in runoff coefficients is likely due to water percolating into conduits and fissures of the hillslope epikarst zone that is likely to be a sink at the hillslope scale and a source for stream channels it can be concluded that the hydrological processes on karst slopes mainly occur at the subsurface and water traveling through the epikarst and reemerging at the stream would have longer and complex flow paths more contact with carbonate rocks different chemical compositions and longer mean residence times 4 3 karst slope nonlinear hydrological behavior 4 3 1 karst slope sr and ssr thresholds our two year analysis of rainfall soil water content and runoff data demonstrated threshold behavior and linear stormflow response as a function of asi and gross rainfall on a karst slope fig 9 these findings are supported by other studies graham et al 2010 detty and mcguire 2010 penna et al 2011 scaife and band 2017 scaife et al 2020 that have found a linearly increasing stormflow response with greater p or p asi after a well defined threshold reflecting soil water content storage characteristics hillslope drainage efficiency saturated area connectivity and runoff generating processes however contrary to our expectations our results indicated no threshold responses between asi and sr ssr and esr even though there were trends towards positive relationships between them fig 9 a and b our studies also indicated that relatively high asi is not a prerequisite for runoff generation thus our results did not support the results reported by penna et al 2011 who found that soil water content exerted a strong control on runoff in a catchment they also reported the existence of a sharp threshold value in soil water content and runoff coefficient relationship above which approximately 45 runoff significantly increased these disparate findings may be due to the high conductivity of karst soils the existence of enhanced porosity and permeability of the epikarst zone clear threshold relationships exist between p and total sr and ssr fig 9 d and e while threshold responses between p asi and total sr and ssr were more obvious fig 9 d and e these results are in line with existing research tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 detty and mcguire 2010 ali et al 2015 nonlinear runoff response likely reflected a soil water content storage threshold below which inputs replenished storage deficits and above which inputs were increasingly transferred to lateral runoff such as sr and ssr soil water dominant direction was vertical under dry antecedent conditions and lateral under wet antecedent conditions kegan et al 2014 plot rainfall amount thresholds for generating sr and ssr were 35 7 1 8 mm and 43 4 7 4 mm respectively table 3 and fig 10 and 11 threshold values reported elsewhere at the hillslope scale were generally less than 55 mm tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 ali et al 2015 and rainfall depth thresholds triggering runoff initiation determined in the instant study fall previously published data ranges tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 reported a ssr threshold generation value of 55 mm on a steep forested hillslope with a thin soil layer tani 1997 identified a threshold value of 20 mm and total runoff was quite small when total rainfall was less than 20 mm when rainfall exceeded this value storm runoff increased linearly with rainfall sr threshold values were generally smaller than those of ssr p 0 017 table 3 fig 10 and 11 this may be attributed to their different runoff generation mechanisms sr was generated by a dunton overland flow mechanism thus sr was generated at a location where vertical and lateral drainage rates were smaller than rainfall intensity loague et al 2010 wang et al 2020 thus the saturation excess zone is part of the entire soil zone many previous studies have shown that in many catchments surface saturation is spatially limited while ssr is generated at sei and its threshold value contains soil water deficit subsurface storage at sei and leakage to epikarst graham and mcdonnell 2010 for both sr and ssr the networked pattern and connectivity of the saturated patches but not the saturation at any one point determine the runoff threshold and connected flow path at the hillslope scale ameli et al 2015 sr threshold values were thus lesser than those for ssr runoff responses to near threshold value rainfall amounts varied substantially fig 9 11 this finding agrees with previous observations that hydrological predictability lessens with the approach of a nonlinear threshold and strengthens as the system retreats from that threshold stewart et al 2015 because of the non linearity of hydrological systems the predictability depends on the accuracy to which initial conditions and boundary conditions can be measured bloeschl and zehe 2005 however it is impossible to make measurements of the initial conditions such as antecedent soil water content at different depths and boundary conditions examples include rainfall intensity and water flux at lower layers at fine enough temporal and spatial scale sivapalan 2018 mcdonnell et al 2021 resulting in runoff prediction uncertainty predictability improved when the p asi was used as the hydrological input variable rather than not considering asi and uncertainties were reduced fig 9 d e g and h in three relationships esr and asi esr and p and esr and p asi no threshold responses were detected fig 9 c f and i this suggests that the threshold like input output relationship predicts sr and ssr well but not esr the lack of clear esr input output relationships likely reflects different runoff generation mechanisms sr and ssr generation are fill and spill which assumes all runoff processes are the same ameli et al 2015 another assumption is the infiltration of excess subsurface stormflow at the soil bedrock interface resembles the infiltration of excess overland flow at the soil surface it accepts that both surface runoff and subsurface runoff are activated by networked patterns and connectivity of the saturated patches and not by the saturation at any one point sr and ssr generation mechanisms are related to the water storage retention needed to saturate soil water content deficit for sr this would include the ssr bedrock depression zone loss is along the lower boundary during establishment of networked pattern and connectivity of the saturated patches sr and ssr presented threshold responses to inputs ameli et al 2015 mcdonnell et al 2021 esr generation was not determined by plot rainfall its contribution area was generally from up slope hydrological connectivity was established by fissures and conduits on the epikarst slope this gives rise to water balance non closure and no threshold like responses to rainfall finally no threshold linear two phase nonlinear hydrological behaviors were found between rainfall intensity and runoff on the karst slope this result is consistent with some previous findings in similarly humid temperate sites with very high soil hydraulic conductivity capacities where it was also found that rainfall intensity had little impact on runoff generation tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 graham et al 2010 ali et al 2015 scaife et al 2020 found maximum hourly rainfall did not significantly contribute to quickflow production in three forested headwater catchments they attributed this result to highly conductive forest soils in catchments where horton overland flow dominates a strong positive linear relationship r 2 0 9 p 0 0002 exists between stormflow and rainfall intensity kegan et al 2014 the weak rainfall intensity runoff relationship observed here indicates that stormflow was generated by underground lateral and vertical hydrological processes it may be that high intensity events can not generate runoff on a karst slope because of the high conductivity of karst soils 40 130 mm h 1 that is the result of fissures and conduits existing on karst slopes or because rainfall events of high intensity are relatively rare in this region and we can not completely detect the relationship between runoff and rainfall intensity 4 3 2 nonlinear hydrological behavior shapes on a karst slope the shapes of a storage discharge relationship reflect the underlying mechanisms of retention and release of event water in a hydrological system hillslope and catchment fig 1 when rainfall exceeds the threshold value there is a linear relationship between rainfall and runoff after the threshold mcdonnell 2013 ali et al 2013 most of the shapes present in this study of the nonlinear input output relationships were hockey stick shape especially the r sr hydrological behaviors fig 10 and some of the r ssr relationships fig 11 a b c k and l step functions and sigmoid function shapes also appeared fig 1 e f g h i and j and indicate how complex karst hydrological systems are step and sigmoid function shapes for the rainfall runoff relationships may result from large conduits fissures and caves in the soil epikarst zone when instantaneous water levels rise at the soil epikarst interface and ssr is generated subsurface saturation area may connect with large conduits fissures and caves and infiltration water will percolate into them while ssr maintains its flow rate this explanation resembles transmissivity feedback or preferential flows through the macropore network mechanism that allows for rapid transformation of infiltration water many studies have found that above an inflection point small changes in groundwater levels were associated with a large change in streamflow while below the inflection point large changes in groundwater level were associated with small changes in streamflow the reason for these observations is that when instantaneous water levels at sbi or sei rose above a critical level in the soil layer they entered soils or epikarst with significantly higher hydraulic conductivity via macropores fissures conduits and caves which increased subsurface runoff or deep percolation detty and mcguire 2010 based on this theory as instantaneous water levels rise through the soil and epikarst on the karst slopes wang et al 2020 profile transmissivity increases significantly and the increasingly transmissive flow paths increase deep percolation drainage rates and reducing ssr rise rates 4 3 3 methods to determine rainfall runoff thresholds output versus input threshold behaviors were determined using the piecewise regression analysis pra method for threshold identification in most of the previous studies detty and mcguire 2010 penna et al 2011 scaife and band 2017 wei et al 2020 while the nonlinear hydrological behaviors of these studies were the hockey stick shape however in principle the implicit assumption of the pra model is that the relationships between the response and the explanatory variable is piecewise linear kegan et al 2014 wei et al 2020 but this assumption is unsuitable for threshold identification when the nonlinear hydrological behaviors are not hockey stick shaped for instance pra is unusable for step function and sigmoid function shapes fig 1 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 and ali et al 2011 also found step function types of threshold relationships between rainfall and ssr and between storage and discharge for these situations pra is unsuitable for threshold identification and the method proposed by tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 should be used thus methods to determine threshold values should be based on the shape of the nonlinear input output relationship 5 conclusions water balance characteristics and rainfall runoff relationships are poorly understood for the karst areas of southwest china even though the region is one of the world s largest continuous karst terrains rainfall runoff threshold behaviors have been observed in many sites with different climate lithologic soil types and at various scales which can be an effective method for up scaling catchments comparison classifications and runoff predicting in ungauged basins mcglynn et al 2013 mcdonnell et al 2021 the responses to 43 rainfall events and the dynamics of runoff including sr ssr and esr and soil water content for twelve 5 m 20 m plots on a karst slope in southwest china over two years 2018 2019 were recorded in order to better evaluate rainfall properties soil water content and soil epikarst system structures on rainfall runoff characteristics and reveal threshold behaviors the results showed that the hillslope scale sr ssr and esr coefficients are 2 2 cv 76 3 3 8 cv 112 9 and 31 2 cv 113 5 respectively sr and ssr events were relatively rare and short while esr was a crucial component of karst slope water budgets and duration was longer which indicates the critical epikarst roles in water regulation functions suach as storage and release soil depth had the largest direct effect on sr and higher soil depth increased sr there are factors controlling rainfall ssr response buried beneath the soil profile and difficult to identify thus calling for additional geophysical exploration methods threshold like runoff responses to rainfall inputs have been observed on karst slopes the rainfall depth runoff initiation thresholds for sr and ssr generation were 36 2 mm and 43 7 mm respectively the strength of the threshold like input output relationships were slightly greater when p asi was used as the hydrological input variable rather than without consideration asi different shapes of nonlinear hydrological behaviors such as the hockey stick heaviside or step function and the sigmoid function had been detected for karst slope runoff thresholds vary with vegetation water use scaife and band 2017 and hydro climatic conditions wei et al 2020 because of the runoff plots were constructed in recent years 2016 and plants belong to immaturity stage the differences roots canopy transpiration and etc of the plants were minimal the influence of land use types and hydrological effect of vegetation on hydrological behaviors have not been evaluated in this study the stability and the hydrological effects of vegetation should be detected in future studies credit authorship contribution statement sheng wang writing original draft investigation formal analysis yan yan conceptualization writing
