2190,fluvial runoff and sediment play vital roles in channel evolution material cycling water resource utilization and ecological environment in the context of global climate change the assessment of runoff and sediment in response to climate change is of great significance for water and soil conservation especially in alpine regions such as the tibetan plateau with limited availability of long term observed data in this study based on the available records for the period 1980 2018 the spatiotemporal variations in rainfall related parameters rainfall and rainfall erosivity re and their impacts on the runoff sediment load sl process were investigated in the lhasa river basin lrb by cross coherence analysis in addition the individual and combined effects of other regional environmental factors e g temperature snow water equivalent swe and vegetation on runoff and sl were quantitatively identified using partial least squares structural equation modeling pls sem the results showed that the changes in rainfall related parameters experienced an upward trend at a rate of 3 59 mm decade rainfall amount and 46 05 mj mm ha 1 h 1 decade re respectively the regions with the most obvious increase occurred in downstream of lrb however runoff displayed an insignificant decreasing trend together with increasing water inputs from the wetter climate in the middle and lower reaches the contrasting sl trends were found in the middle significantly descending 5 5 104 t decade and downstream reaches slightly increasing 19 27 104 t decade rainfall related parameters generally played a positive role in runoff and sl at all hydrological stations and their action gradually weakened after 2005 despite still being the dominant factor other environmental variables such as vegetation did not limit runoff but did reduce the sl with an increase in vegetation coverage in the lrb where large area vegetation restoration projects were implemented and mainly distributed on the sandy land and floodplain of the lower reach of the basin snow however had slightly positive promoting effects on runoff and sl under the scenario of swe reduction with increasing temperature all above mentioned variables jointly explained 73 9 76 7 and 39 2 52 4 of the total variability in runoff and sl respectively these findings provide valuable insights into future studies on water and

headwaters to downstream places schumm 1977 the two intricate dynamic processes in the earth s surface system runoff generation and sediment transport are regarded as crucial measures of land degradation and water and soil loss in river basins borrelli et al 2020 thomasson 1992 changes in runoff and sediment represent critical aspects of global change wang et al 2015 in the past few decades global climate change and anthropogenic activities have accelerated hydrological processes leading to the degradation of ecological systems and substantial losses in agricultural production ipcc 2013 climatic characteristic such as rainfall is the primary driving force johannsen et al 2022 since its amount intensity and frequency directly dominate the transformation of rainfall to runoff milliman and farnsworth 2013 zhang et al 2008 as well as soil erosion anders et al 2008 and thus influence the sediment load sl at different temporal and spatial scales therefore evaluation of the response of fluvial runoff and sl to climate change particularly to rainfall related parameters has significant ramifications for ecosystem protection and water and soil conservation the relation between rainfall and sl is given by rainfall erosivity re which reflects factors such as rainfall intensity and quantifies the kinetic energy of raindrop impact and the rate of associated surface runoff li and fang 2017 against the background of global warming and intensified human activities the increase in the intensity and frequency of rainstorms may lead to the increase of re and river runoff further accelerating the occurrence of soil erosion and posing a serious threat to the ecosystem sustainability of regions lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 timely monitoring and analysis of the spatiotemporal variations in regional rainfall and re have received greater attention in the field of soil erosion numerous studies have been conducted on the calculation method of re with multiple scale rainfall data including daily monthly seasonal and yearly data jiang et al 2021 xie et al 2016 zhang et al 2002 among those methods the most extensively used method is based on daily rainfall data in the scientific literature due to its high estimation accuracy and data availability for most locations angulo martínez and beguería 2009 for instance the method developed by zhang et al 2002 has been widely applied and tested throughout china with dense rainfall observation networks such as in the loess plateau yunnan guizhou plateau and three gorges reservoir gu et al 2016 liu et al 2018 shi et al 2021 limited investigations on the sparsely distributed area of meteorological stations have been carried out especially in complex high altitude and cold areas such as the tibetan plateau tp chen et al 2022 studies on riverine runoff and sediment processes related to rainfall and re have been of wide interest to geomorphologists and hydrologists since the 1950s zhang et al 2022b an increasing number of studies have been performed on the relationship among conventional rainfall characteristics sediment and runoff e g chu et al 2019 han et al 2019 and lu et al 2022 in an analysis of the spatiotemporal response of runoff and sediment to rainfall in the yellow river basin xu et al 2021 reported that the impacts of extreme rainfall events on the linkages between water and sediment are disparate in different regions zhang et al 2019 also quantitively analyzed the linkages among rainfall runoff and sediment yield variations and found that 10 change in annual rainfall would result in 10 14 and 17 24 variation in runoff and sediment yield respectively however in high altitude and cold regions the response of fluvial runoff and sediment to rainfall and re on the monthly scale is still limited partly because of the lack of long term on site monitoring data although zhang et al 2022b studied the impact of rainfall on annual runoff and sediment yield in eight headwater catchments of tp and found an inverted parabolic relationship between sediment yield and rainfall the variations in runoff and sl are also controlled by other regional environmental factors such as temperature snow and anthropogenic activities e g reservoir construction and vegetation change including afforestation and deforestation the rising temperature would result in permafrost degradation and increase the meltwater of ice and snow which would have an indirect effect on the dynamics of fluvial water and sl wang et al 2017 additionally vegetation significantly affects intra annual runoff variability mostly by blocking the formation of surface runoff extending the infiltration time and influencing the redistribution of runoff volume gao et al 2019 hou et al 2022 more importantly there is a growing consensus that the hydrological characteristics process is a complicated one determined by the interactions among many factors huang et al 2019 changes in rainfall including its amount and intensity directly affect river hydrological characteristics furthermore it plays an indirect role in runoff and sl through its ability to improve plant growth which in turn impacts hydrological characteristics ran et al 2013 thorough knowledge of hydrological features in response to climatic variability and vegetation dynamics may be hampered by the complicated interactions among these variables therefore deeper insights into the influencing mechanism among factors and quantitative evaluation of the combined effect are urgently needed to develop specific strategies for future soil conservation measures currently most of the existing studies have primarily focused on the individual direct effects of each factor on watershed hydrological characteristics on an annual scale feng et al 2016 shi et al 2022 by using some common methods such as simple linear regression budyko and double mass curve methods luo et al 2020 ye et al 2020 however research on the indirect and comprehensive interactive effects of these factors remains much less investigated the joint application of partial least squares structural equation modeling pls sem and cross coherence analysis has the ability not only to distinguish between the influence of individual factors but also to determine the combined effect of multiple factors including direct and indirect effects shen et al 2022 tian et al 2022b thus it is promising to use these methods for the attribution analysis of watershed hydrological characteristics in cold and high altitude regions the tp named the world s third pole and asia water towers is the largest global reservoir of snow and ice after the polar regions and headwaters of major rivers of asia providing water for more than 1 4 billion people immerzeel et al 2010 it is also an essential ecological barrier area where the ecosystem is extremely vulnerable and highly sensitive to global climate change immerzeel et al 2020 the tp experienced considerable warming beginning in the mid 1950s and wetting from 1980 to 2018 chylek et al 2009 in response to such rapid warming the snow water equivalent swe overall presented a decreasing trend and glaciers retreat has accelerated smith and bookhagen 2018 marked climate change and the cryosphere could lead to shifts in the timing and magnitude of the hydrological process of tp rivers and threaten ecological security in downstream countries as a major anthropogenic activity zone in the southwestern part of the tp the lhasa river basin lrb is a representative alpine basin and a typical arid region in the tp the lrb has experienced dramatic environmental changes such as climate warming and humidification these features are related to high intensity rainfall li et al 2020b climate warming and wetting accelerated the hydrological process tian et al 2020 in addition many ecological projects have been implemented in this area including afforestation grass planting and closure against grazing to prevent wind erosion fix sand and control water and soil loss li et al 2020b these measures have contributed to an increase in vegetation coverage in the past few decades and accelerated the water cycle process which profoundly affected the drastic change in water and sediment in the area therefore it is essential to evaluate to what extent climate change temperature rainfall swe vegetation restoration and their interactions affect the variations in runoff and sl recently the variation in runoff and its responses to such climate change have been widely noted chen et al 2019 chen et al 2021 but changes in sediment and the impact of vegetation coverage still lack attention within this context the objectives of this study were 1 to systematically detect and quantify the spatiotemporal changes in rainfall related parameters including rainfall and re runoff and sl in the lrb over the period 1980 2018 2 to evaluate the impact of rainfall related parameters on runoff and sl variation at the monthly scale and 3 to quantitatively assess the individual and comprehensive effects of other regional environmental factors e g temperature swe and vegetation using pls sem on the variability of runoff and sl the results will be helpful in water and soil conservation planning water resource management and ecological restoration in cold and high altitude regions 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area the lhasa river fig 1 a located in the southeastern part of the tibetan plateau tp is the largest tributary of the yarlung zangbo river with a total length of 568 km it originates from the nyainqentangla mountains and discharges into the yarlung zangbo river in tibet its basin lrb covers an area of approximately 32 894 km2 29 20 to 31 15 n 90 05 to 93 20 e the altitude varies from 3538 to 7114 m above sea level a s l with an average of about 4885 04 m a s l its landforms are mainly high mountains and deep gorges the study area belongs to the plateau temperate semiarid continental climate with distinct dry and wet seasons the river is primarily recharged by rainfall meltwater and groundwater the annual mean temperature and rainfall are 5 3 c and 602 51 mm respectively affected by the warm and humid air from the indian ocean the rainfall is exceptionally uneven throughout the year with more than 70 of the total annual rainfall falling in summer the main land uses are grassland barren land and sparse vegetation cover 90 human activities including afforestation are mainly concentrated in the lower reaches of the lhasa river valley below 4200 m a s l li et al 2020b to shed light on the variability in runoff and sediment this study focused on the approximately 26 244 54 km2 of the lrb with two hydrological stations namely the lhasa and tangjia as shown in fig 1a the study area did not take the region below the lhasa station into account due to lack of in situ observed data in the watershed outlet according to observation data from downstream lhasa station the annual mean runoff and sl during 1980 2018 were approximately 91 65 m3 s and 147 06 104 t respectively severe soil erosion contributes to the high sediment concentration in the yarlung zangbo river over a long period however since the 1990s large scale soil and water conservation measures have been taken including afforestation and grass planting as a result of conservation measures and climate change both runoff and sl have changed substantially in recent decades a record showed that the runoff and sl in the lrb decreased from 144 42 108 m3 and 196 14 104 t in 1962 to 83 1 108 m3 and 70 85 104 t in 2018 respectively 2 2 data collection and processing the data used in this study were as follows 1 daily meteorological data comprising rainfall and temperature maximum minimum and mean temperature from eight stations covering the period 1980 to 2018 were collected from the chinese meteorological data center https www data cma cn for all meteorological stations the percentages of the missing values of rainfall data are 15 hence we used the linear interpolation method to fill in the missing values of daily rainfall data based on the rainfall amount of the corresponding day of each month in multiple years besides the inverse distance weighting method was applied to interpolate the spatial pattern of the mean rainfall and rainfall erosivity re in the whole lrb 2 monthly measured runoff and sl data during 1980 2018 were acquired from the bureau of hydrology and water resources survey of tibet autonomous region the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is the best indicator to reflect regional vegetation growth and coverage levels under changes in climate and anthropogenic activities in this study gimms ndvi3g data during 1982 2015 were derived from the nasa goddard space flight center with a spatial resolution of 8 km https ecocast arc nasa gov data pub gimms it is worth noting that this dataset for vegetation remote sensing had the longest available time series spot vgt ndvi beginning in 1998 at a 1 km resolution was provided by the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc https www resdc cn there was a strong linear correlation between the two data groups at the monthly scale r2 0 92 fig s1 thereby the avhrr ndvi could be adjusted and integrated with spot vgt data spanning 1998 to 2018 the afforestation area was obtained from the statistical yearbook of lhasa city for the snow factor snow water equivalent swe with 25 km resolution as one of the most essential parameters for accurate prediction of snowmelt runoff fig 1c was available from the national cryosphere desert data center swe refers to the amount of water mm that would be obtained if the entire snowpack completely melted all factors data were converted into raster format with a 1 km spatial resolution by using the nearest neighbor interpolation method 2 3 methodology fig 2 depicts the study s framework for investigating the change characteristics of the rainfall related parameters exploring the response of runoff and sl and discussing how they are affected in the lrb we first examined the variations in the rainfall related parameters rainfall and re runoff and sl including the trends periodicities and change points at different time scales during 1980 2018 according to the evolution characteristics the annual runoff and sl time series were divided into several periods including a baseline period and multiple changing periods then the result was further systematically assessed the potential impact of the rainfall related parameters on runoff and sl by using pearson correlation and cross coherence analysis finally we explored the contributions and combined effects of multiple regional environmental factors on runoff and sl change based on pls sem 2 3 1 rainfall erosivity calculation richardson s daily rainfall erosive agent model which can more accurately estimate rainfall erosivity re using daily rainfall data on the national and regional scales in china was used to support the daily rainfall data of 8 meteorological stations from 1980 to 2018 in the lrb zhang et al 2002 the calculation formula is as follows 1 re i α j 1 k p j β where re i is the re in the ith half month period mj mm hm 2 h 1 p j is the amount of the daily erosive rainfall mm on the jth day during the half month period and k is the number of days in the half month time in the model a half month is represented by the days from the first to the fifteenth of every month and another half month is represented by the remaining days the monthly and annual res of each meteorological station can be obtained by summing the half month re the daily amount of rainfall exceeding 12 0 mm is regarded as erosive rainfall and applied to eq 1 otherwise the calculations should make use of a value of 0 the model s α and β parameters can be calculated using eqs 2 and 3 according to earlier research zhang et al 2002 2 β 0 8363 18 144 p day 24 455 p year 3 α 21 586 β 7 1987 where p day represents the amount of mean daily rainfall mm if the amount of daily erosive rainfall is higher than 12 0 mm and p year is the amount of mean annual erosive rainfall mm if the amount of daily rainfall is greater than 12 0 mm finally the spatial distribution of the monthly and annual re was interpolated using the inverse distance weighting method with a spatial resolution of 1 km in arcgis 10 4 software 2 3 1 1 trend analysis and abrupt detection in this study sen s slope test was applied to analyze the change trends and slope magnitudes of two rainfall related parameters the nonparametric pettitt and moving t test which could be applied to refs pettitt 1979 sen 1968 zhao et al 2022 for more details have been employed to identify abrupt changes in rainfall related parameters runoff and sl series 2 3 1 2 wavelet analysis methods wavelet analysis is extensively used to analyze the periodicity and correlations of climatic and hydrological time series data lorenzo lacruz et al 2022 wang et al 2022b to understand the correlation of time series data continuous wavelet transform cwt was first introduced to identify spatiotemporal variations in the oscillation periodicity in monthly rainfall related parameters and runoff or sl time series with cwt both quasi state and nonstationary periodicities of time series at a monthly scale can be captured torrence and compo 1998 the morlet wavelet function has been applied in this study due to its advantages in the analysis of complicated environmental signals grinsted et al 2004 which is defined as follows 4 ψ 0 η π 1 4 e i w 0 η e η 2 2 where w 0 represents the nondimensional frequency variable for w 0 6 it offers a good balance between frequency and time localization the cwt of the time series given that x n represents the time series with a constant time space of δ t is defined as 5 w n s n 0 n 1 x n ψ n n δ t s where ψ represents the complicated conjugate of ψ n and n are the localized time index and variable respectively s denotes the wavelet scale and n represents the length of the time series the oscillation energy of various periods and how those periods alter over time can be depicted by changing the wavelet scale s and translating along the localized time index n torrence and compo 1998 among wavelet analysis tools cross coherence analysis cross wavelet transform xwt and wavelet transform coherence wtc are applied to measure and identify the coherence and phase shift between rainfall related parameters and runoff or sl time series xwt was proposed to reveal the potential causal relationship between two time series by detecting the time frequency areas with common high power and relative phase angle grinsted et al 2004 wtc can not only pinpoint the scales and situations at which two time series exhibit comparable cyclic patterns but also determine the phase difference between the two time frequency series he et al 2021 wang et al 2022b the definition of wtc between the x and y time series is as follows grinsted et al 2004 6 r t 2 f b a f 1 w t xy f b 2 a f 1 w t x f 2 a f 1 w t y f b 2 where w t xy f represents the cross wavelet spectrum and reveals the cross covariance of two series x t and y t w t x f denotes the wavelet transform of the time series of x t at frequency scales w t y f represents the complex conjugate of the wavelet transform for the time series of head y t and a is a smoothing operator f is a scale or frequency parameter b is the time or shift parameter and f 1 is used to convert energy density detailed introductions of the wtc and the smoothing operator a are given in torrence and compo 1998 the significance level of wtc was assessed using the monte carlo method at a 95 confidence level grinsted et al 2004 in this study significance testing for the global coherence of r t 2 f against a red noise background was carried out using the method developed by schulte 2016 the time averaged wtc coefficients are used to define the coefficient of global coherence at a certain scale f 7 r t 2 f 1 n t 1 n r 2 f b to examine the characteristic periodicities the global coherence estimates the correlation with the time averaged wtc coefficients torrence and compo 1998 a matlab toolbox developed by grinsted et al 2004 was used to do the cross coherence analysis xwt wtc and global coherence it is available at http noc ac uk using science crosswavelet wavelet coherence in addition pearson correlation analysis between annual rainfall related parameters and runoff or sl was performed before wavelet analysis 2 3 1 3 pls sem in this study we hypothesized that other regional environmental factors still have a strong influence on runoff and sl to test the hypothetical pathways partial least squares structural equation modeling pls sem was used to reveal the complex causal relationships between other regional environmental factors runoff or sl to test the direct and combined effects in the parameter estimation process pls sem relaxes the assumption of a multivariate normal distribution compared with traditional sem pls sem is fitter for exploratory research with small samples and simulations that do not require normally distributed data in addition pls sem can produce iterative estimates for maximizing the explanation of the variance of an independent latent variable and effectively assess the interaction among factors tenenhaus et al 2005 tian et al 2022a wang et al 2022a the pls sem generally includes two submodules measurement outer model and structural inner model among them the structural model is applied to assess the linkage among endogenous latent variables huang et al 2019 8 γ j i 1 i β ji γ i ζ where γ j represents a vector of all latent variables and β represents the path coefficient that can test the relationship between adjacent and non adjacent variables grace 2006 the results of this test showed how strong and in what direction the explanatory and response variables were correlated the measurement model as an explanatory model consists of manifest variables and latent variables monecke and leisch 2012 this may be expressed using the following formulas 9 x λ x η δ 10 y λ y η ε eqs 9 and 10 represent exogenous and endogenous indicators respectively δ and ε are the measurement errors λ is the relationship between the manifest variables and latent variables the latent variables included two exogenous latent variables rainfall related parameter and temperature and four endogenous latent variables vegetation snow runoff and sediment nine observational indicators were regarded as manifest variables for latent variables temperature variables including mean temperature maximum temperature and minimum temperature are regarded to have indirect effects on runoff and sl through snow and vegetation rainfall related parameters were reflected by re and rainfall rainfall related parameters vegetation snow and runoff have a direct effect on sl corresponding to the measured indicators ndvi swe runoff and sl respectively in pls sem direct pathways are specified entirely by the corresponding path coefficients of independent and dependent variables indirect pathways between independent and dependent variables are those involving intermediary variables whereas the total effects are the sum of the indirect and direct effects the prediction accuracy and credibility of the pls sem were ascertained by the goodness of fit li et al 2021c pls sem was carried out using smartpls version 3 software https www smartpls com 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal pattern of rainfall and rainfall erosivity in this study the long term trends of rainfall and re from 1980 to 2018 are investigated fig 3 the overall multi year average annual re in the lrb is 665 73 mj mm ha 1 h 1 over the past four decades with the lowest value 342 87 mj mm ha 1 h 1 and the highest value 1029 77 mj mm ha 1 h 1 being recorded in 1992 and 1990 respectively this is inconsistent with the years when the maximum and minimum values of rainfall appeared the highest and lowest values of rainfall were detected in 2003 and 1983 respectively the linear trend indicated that the annual rainfall experienced an upward but insignificant 3 59 mm decade p 0 05 trend in contrast the annual re presented a significantly increasing trend 46 05 mj mm ha 1 h 1 decade p 0 5 suggesting that there are more frequent events of heavy rainfall and erosive rainfall in the lrb meanwhile the intensification of erosive rainfall events may promote the sediment transport capacity of flow and have a significant impact on the sl in addition an apparent temporal pattern was observed in which rainfall related parameters first increased and then declined with the abrupt change in 1998 by the pettitt test fig s2 seasonal variations in re were uneven similar to the temporal distribution pattern of rainfall fig 4 during the past four decades the upward trend of rainfall and re was found in spring and summer while a decreasing trend in autumn in total the interannual fluctuation in re was higher than in rainfall in winter the re and rainfall only accounted for approximately 3 mainly due to very little or almost no rainfall in this season the values of rainfall and re for summer were significantly higher than those for other seasons the rainfall and re from may and september contributed to more than 86 of total annual rainfall and re for the whole year and more attention need to be paid to better soil erosion prevention during this period fig 5 a and 5c show the spatial distribution characteristics of the multiyear mean annual rainfall and re in the lrb based on daily rainfall data from 1980 to 2018 spatially the multiyear mean re gradually increased from southwest to northeast with a range of 451 46 990 15 mj mm ha 1 h 1 the regions with the lowest annual re were mainly located in the western and southwest parts of the basin while the regions with the highest annual re were primarily observed in the eastern and southward drift parts of the basin furthermore the slopes of changing trend of re showed a slight upward trend by sen s slope test during 1980 2018 the most significant upward trend was primarily distributed in the lower reach of the lrb which is generally consistent with those of rainfall fig 5b and 5d nonetheless the small difference is that a downward trend of rainfall was detected in the northeast and western basin besides the low and high value centers of annual re are distinct from those of the rainfall this suggests that the regions with high rainfall do not necessarily have high erosive rainfall on the contrary the ones with low rainfall probably have high erosive rainfall in general the re in the lower reach of the lrb showed a relatively significant upward trend indicating that the risk of soil erosion caused by rainfall in this region is increasing pronouncedly and should be a more continuous concern 3 2 variations in runoff and sediment load at different time scales fig 6 displays the temporal variations in annual runoff and sl at the middle and lower reaches of the lrb from 1980 to 2018 it is evident that the annual runoff in the lrb generally exhibited slight decreasing but non significant trends 0 82 108 m3 yr p 0 05 in tangjia station and 0 49 108 m3 yr p 0 05 in lhasa station respectively over the past four decades which has almost kept a slight balance with the same rainfall conversely the annual sls exhibited prominent spatial heterogeneity with a significant decrease p 0 05 trend at the tangjia station at a rate of 19 27 104 t decade and a sudden increasing trend at the lhasa station at a rate of 5 5 104 t decade besides it is worth noting that the total sl of lhasa station was an order of magnitude greater than that of tangjia station the difference in the region between the middle and lower reaches of lrb was mainly caused by the significant increase of erosive rainfall and partly owing to the more significant human disturbance in downstream and sediment storage in the middle stream fig s2 shows the change year of both runoff and sl at both stations we found that the abrupt changing years varied from runoff and sl series at the different stations and methods for the runoff at both stations the pettitt method identified the change year in 2006 whereas the moving t test identified the change years as 1998 and 2006 for sl at both stations the pettitt method recognized the change year as 2005 for tangjia station and 1995 for lhasa station whereas the moving t test identified the change years as 2006 2008 for tangjia station and 2006 for lhasa station overall the abrupt change years for both runoff and sl in the lrb basin were consistently close to 1998 and 2006 thus we selected 1998 and 2006 as the abrupt change points for the investigation of runoff and sl at both stations and further divided the past approximately 40 years into three periods covering p1 baseline period 1980 1997 p2 change period 1 1998 2005 and p3 change period 2 2006 2018 table s1 showed that the average annual runoff and sl pronouncedly increased by 43 54 and 45 03 in tangjia station and 38 93 and 173 48 in lhasa station from p1 to p2 respectively and further decreased dramatically by 35 73 and 80 95 in tangjia station 36 98 and 69 32 in lhasa station during p3 in general both runoff and sl experienced significant increases first and then decreases in the lrb hence the in depth analysis of this study was given more to lhasa station but the situations of tangjia station were also given for comparison fig 7 shows that the monthly and seasonal runoff and sl at both stations have pronounced seasonal differences the runoff and sl in summer july august and autumn september october were higher than those in other seasons at both stations over the entire study period more than 80 and 50 of the annual total runoff and sl were transported in summer at the middle and lower reaches of the lrb respectively at the monthly time scale higher variabilities in runoff and sl occur in july and august 3 3 periodicity characteristics at the monthly scale to further comprehend the finer spatiotemporal patterns of rainfall related parameters runoff and sl at various time frequency domains we used the cwt to investigate their multiscale characteristics the cwts of the rainfall related parameters runoff and sl are presented at two stations in the lrb the wavelet power value could characterize the energy of periodic intensity the periodicity was more significant at higher energies torrence and compo 1998 fig s3 displays the results of the cwt of rainfall related parameters it is observed that rainfall occurred coincidently within the re at specific frequencies and periods re and rainfall showed a quasi nonintermittent annual process except for re at tangjia station the significant wavelet power for annual periodicity variations at approximately 12 months was detected from the wavelet spectrum during the entire study period on a scale of 8 months oscillations occurred intermittently over the entire period the global wavelet power spectrum detected that the persistence of the 6 and 12 month cycles are shown by 95 level significant oscillation periods fig s3 a2 b2 c2 and d2 fig 8 displays that the time series of runoff and sl is characterized by amplitude modulation and periodicity the cwt results of the runoff time series revealed that both stations were affected by nearly continuous annual periodicity over the whole study period the wavelet power spectrum of significant yearly periodicity fluctuations at approximately 12 months at lhasa station exhibited higher power from 1998 to 2006 similar to the wavelet power spectra of runoff at tangjia station however an overall decline at tangjia station was observed in the wavelet spectral power of sl since 2006 this decrease in runoff is of the peak flow being slowed down both directly and indirectly by reservoir construction and erosive rainfall regarding the cwt results of sl at time scales of approximately 3 to 12 months the significant and strong wavelet power for the interannual periodicity variations was detected at tangjia station from the wavelet power spectrum before 2005 which however started to weaken thereafter in addition to the half and 1 year cycles the sporadic occurrence of 3 and 48 month oscillations can be discerned most noticeably in 1995 2015 but the global wavelet power spectrum shows that these cycles were not found to be statistically significant at the 95 level for the lhasa station there were only 3 to 12 month significant periodicity variations with relatively high energy from 1995 to 2006 in sl this is owing to the significantly higher rainfall in this period than in others similarly only 6 and 12 month cycles are globally significant in general the global wavelet analyses show similarities between rainfall related parameters and runoff time series for both stations 3 4 influence of rainfall related parameters on runoff and sl 3 4 1 simple linear associations for rainfall related parameters runoff and sl understanding the responses of changes in runoff and sl to the rainfall related parameters was made possible by correlation analysis due to the consistent trend of runoff and sl at both stations through the analysis of abrupt points we only performed a pearson correlation analysis at lhasa station between runoff sl and rainfall related parameters for three different periods p1 p2 and p3 fig 9 shows that the coefficients of determination r2 between rainfall related parameters and runoff were well above 0 7 in which the r2 ranged from 0 91 to 0 78 in rainfall runoff regressions and from 0 84 to 0 74 in re runoff regressions for another there also presented a similar effect from p1 to p2 yet the r2 during p3 was not significant with an r2 value of 0 55 for rainfall sl and 0 53 for re sl thus rainfall related parameters had stronger explanatory power for the variability in runoff generation than sl additionally we found that the overall correlations between rainfall related parameters and runoff sl have an insignificant increasing trend from p1 to p2 and decreased thereafter in the lrb which indicated that the effect of climate change on runoff and sl gradually decreased 3 4 1 1 nonstationary responses of runoff and sl to rainfall related parameters at varying scales over time cross coherence analysis was further used to explore the inherent response relationship of rainfall related parameters rainfall and re on runoff and sl in the time frequency domain the ability of different rainfall related parameters to explain runoff and sl variations was evaluated by the indicators of the average power of wavelet coherence apwc and the percentage of the numbers of power that were significant at the 95 significance level papc produced by wtc a higher apwc with a larger pasc shows that more changes in the runoff and sl can be explained by a rainfall factor table 1 presents the apwc and papc among rainfall related parameters runoff and sl overall the contributions of rainfall related parameters to runoff were greater than those to sl variation in the middle and lower reaches of the lrb however there was a slight difference in apwc among runoff sl and rainfall related parameters for different stations besides among the two rainfall related parameters we studied the value papc between rainfall and runoff was higher than that of re and runoff at lhasa station whereas it is quite contrary to sl in the whole study period this indicated that rainfall could explain the runoff variation better than re and re could explain the sl better than rainfall for different periods similar to the pearson correlation coefficients the influence of rainfall related parameters on runoff and sl presented first increasing and then decreasing trend except for sl and rainfall related parameters at tangjia station suggesting the role of rainfall related parameters on runoff and sediment fluxes was weakening over the past decade fig 10 reveals the xwt and wtc between rainfall related parameters and runoff or sl through the power spectrum of xwt and wtc it was observed that the variability of rainfall related parameters and runoff or sl showed a statistically significant positive correlation with high oscillation energy at a 12 months resonant period during nearly the entire 40 years period this coincides with the spectrum of cwts indicating that they have the stability and overall characteristics of interannual variation in addition significantly higher wavelet power was observed at the 4 to 6 month time scales especially re has the highest variation with runoff in 1998 what s more the significantly positive correlation between rainfall related parameters and sl gradually decreased compared with the xwt power spectrum the wtc spectrum presented a broad and strong resonant period for tangjia station the wtc between rainfall and runoff showed significant local coherence at 6 to 64 month between 1980 1995 and 2006 2018 and shifts to 8 to 32 month from 1995 to 2005 the wtc for re demonstrated that two bands of 4 16 months had the highest coherence in 1980 1995 and 1998 2015 strong and widespread coherence patterns occur at a time scale of 32 to 64 month across the research period in contrast to tangjia station rainfall had the strongest and widest positive coherence with 4 to 128 month over a time span from 1980 to 2018 in lhasa station there was a lag time between rainfall and runoff over most parts of time seen by the down pointing arrows consistent with that of tangjia station furthermore the wtc generally revealed that the highest coherence between re and runoff mostly occurs at the bands of 4 to 16 month the 16 month band coherence was broader in the wtc from the monthly re series the wtcs between rainfall related parameters and sl showed that sl and two rainfall related parameters were almost correlated positively coincident with the result of the correlation coefficient at tangjia station the wtc between rainfall and sl showed that the continuous obvious coherence pattern at the 4 16 month band roughly exists for the whole study period whereas the 16 32 month coherence band is broader before 1998 the wtc between re and sl has a stronger coherence with sl in the 4 to 16 month bands and the main intermittent significant regions at the 32 64 month and 64 128 month time scales can be found in 1985 2000 and 2000 2010 respectively at lhasa station the wtc for rainfall confirmed that strong and broad coherence patterns with the 4 32 month band are in good agreement with re during 1980 2000 and their significant correlation changes into the 4 to the 16 month band especially after 2005 indicating that the correlation coefficient between rainfall re and sl was weakening which probably means that the role of human activities or other climate variables on runoff and sediment transport may be increasing since this period this could primarily be attributed to vegetation restoration in which large scale ecological engineering has been implemented since the 1990s resulting in changes in runoff and sediment transport in the whole region fig s4 represents the averaged coherence among the monthly rainfall related parameters runoff and sl it can be observed that the overall maximum peak of global coherence was recorded at a 12 month time scale due to the local dominance of coherence which is more than 0 6 this suggests that all the parameters had the most significant correlation in the yearly time cycle from the transformation of phase arrows the consistent arrow direction for the coherence plots in the 1 year cycle implies nearly in phase angles signifying the statistically positive correlation of rainfall related parameters on monthly runoff and sl changes these findings confirmed that at annual scales rainfall related parameters had a significant effect on monthly runoff and sl in the lrb which have gradually decreased since 2006 4 discussion 4 1 decoupling the contribution of other regional environmental factors on variability in runoff and sl this study confirmed that rainfall related parameters generally played a positive role in runoff and sl at all hydrological stations and their action gradually weakened after 2005 in the study area consequently this implies that apart from the role of rainfall related parameters the other regional environmental factors including air temperature snow and vegetation restoration may play an important role in the variations in runoff and sl meanwhile considering the contrasting sl trends between the middle tangjia station pronouncedly decreasing and downstream lhasa station slightly increasing reaches in the lrb we further decouple the combined effects of other regional environmental factors and rainfall related parameters to the variation in runoff and sl on a monthly scale at both hydrological stations by pls sem the pls sem results indicated that the values of the goodness of fit for different periods at both stations were all above 0 7 showing a substantial predictive accuracy for the entire model of each period concerning the path coefficients of pls sem the rainfall related parameters rainfall and re had a significant p 0 01 direct positive influence on runoff and sl except at tangjia station in p2 with the highest total effect including direct and indirect effect ranging from 0 586 to 0 725 and from 0 389 to 0 887 fig s5 meanwhile we also found that the action of rainfall related parameters increased first and then decreased during p1 p3 but was still the primary driving factor of the variations in runoff and sl fig 11 which is in agreement with zhang et al 2013 and their study showed that monsoon rainfall has a dominant role in sustaining seasonal streamflow over southeastern regions among six large rivers in the tp this result also further confirmed the analysis results of the abovementioned pearson correlation and wtc in summary rainfall and air temperature had a significant direct effect on vegetation explaining 72 0 79 3 of vegetation dynamics the drivers of vegetation snow dynamics and climate factors jointly accounted for 73 9 76 7 of the total variations of runoff runoff changes vegetation and snow dynamics were further affected by rainfall related parameters and temperature explaining 39 2 52 4 of the variations in sl fig 11 furthermore we found that the explanatory power of these factors for runoff and sl increased from p1 to p2 and then decreased at lhasa station which mainly attributed to the effects of the role of rainfall related parameters on runoff and sl 4 2 effects of vegetation on the variability in runoff and sl the response of runoff and sediment transport processes in basins to vegetation is complex sun et al 2022 xu et al 2018 it is a widely held perception worldwide that vegetation restoration could effectively reduce surface runoff and sediment yield wang et al 2015 on the one hand vegetation reduces surface runoff by weakening the raindrop kinetic energy altering the evaporation of canopy interception and enhancing soil infiltration capacity gu et al 2019 li et al 2020a on the other hand land coverage triggered by vegetation enhances surface roughness and root fixation decreased erosive flow power and ultimately reduced soil detachment and sediment transport capacity by overflow tian et al 2022b zhang et al 2022a however our current study showed that the vegetation always was positively related to runoff in both stations β 0 285 and 0 422 p 0 05 and negatively correlated with sl on a monthly scale of the whole study period β 0 267 and 0 453 p 0 05 indicating that vegetation did not decrease runoff but it did decrease sl fig 11 these findings are in line with the results of several previous studies gao et al 2019 xu et al 2018 zeng et al 2020 zhou et al 2010 conversely this differs from the results of shi et al 2022 in which the increases in fluvial sl were buffered by a reduction in water production capacity due to more dense vegetation coverage during 1972 2008 in the headwaters of the yarlung zangbo river this difference was probably produced by vegetation heterogeneity and data length on a spatial and temporal scale notably since the 1990s the study area has implemented ecological restoration projects including afforestation and planting grass to prevent wind erosion fix sand surfaces and control water and soil loss hong et al 2020 after the implementation of those projects for more than 30 years the vegetation coverage of lrb has been significantly improved with an increased rate of 0 012 decade the afforestation area increased from 148 53 in 1990 to 3161 76 ha in 2018 statistics showed that up to 2018 the cumulative afforestation area had reached approximately 175 733 73 ha fig 1b the vegetation restoration projects were mostly concentrated on the sandy land floodplain and terraces of the lower reaches of lrb in the sandy land the total discharge after afforestation may be greater than that before afforestation under the same rainfall intensity mainly because large scale afforestation would result in a dried layer in the soil of the sandy land thus hindering the vertical infiltration of soil water into the deeper layers thus affecting the regional water cycle wang et al 2010 wang et al 2011 as a result the earlier overland runoff occurs and soil erosion intensifies zeng et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 by contrast vegetation distributed in the floodplain and terraces of the basin may be further partially buffered by sediment production on steep slopes nevertheless these regional soil and water conservation practices did not offset the potential increase from positive factors therefore even though vegetation restoration significantly improved the regional environmental conditions it did not decrease runoff but did decrease the sediment our findings are helpful for planners to review their conservation plans to prevent water and soil erosion 4 3 effects of snow on the variability in runoff and sl the accumulation and melting of snow can also have a great influence on surface hydrological processes barabanov 2021 zhang and ma 2018 swe integrating the characteristics of snow depth and snow density is one of the critical important indicators of the runoff flow of rivers dong et al 2005 musselman et al 2021 in the results of pls sem the effects of snow on runoff and sl vary greatly in different periods with a relatively small positive effect at tangjia station except in p1 and an opposite direct impact at lhasa station fig s5 but the swe over the whole study period always had weak and positive effects on runoff and sl at both stations fig 11 which indicated that runoff enhancement by snowmelt was caused by the rising air temperature further promoting the sediment carrying capacity and soil erosion this finding is consistent with previous studies iida et al 2012 tanasienko et al 2011 by contrast our work also found that snow melt did not offset the declining runoff on the monthly scale during the whole study period in contrast a gradual reduction in water vapor was still the main cause of the declining runoff after 2005 this also supports by the similar results of wang et al 2021b on the relationship between glacier retreat and runoff from the upstream of the yarlung zangbo basin their study by comparing the different runoff components suggested that the snow melt dominates the supply of meltwater to runoff in the river upstream when separating the fractional meltwater contributions from glaciers and snow during 1981 2019 the contribution of snowmelt and glacier melt to the total runoff is 17 2 and 5 5 respectively whereas the contribution from glaciers to total runoff is relatively small wang et al 2021b that is the main reason that our study did not consider the impact of glacier meltwater on runoff and sediment transport however previous studies have demonstrated that the glacier melt water would be crucially important to future runoff although this basin is mainly affected by the monsoon precipitation su et al 2016 wang et al 2021b in the long run the increase in glacier melt accounts for more than 50 of the increase in total runoff su et al 2016 what s more glacier runoff for yarlung zangbo river in 2041 2060 is projected to reach 16 and in 2071 2090 reach 18 respectively of total runoff nury et al 2021 in a recent study for sediment fluxes li et al 2021a reported that increasing fluvial sediment fluxes in high mountain asia are mainly caused by accelerated glacier permafrost melt and increased precipitation and associated erosion processes hence it is undoubted that the influences of glaciers recession and permafrost thawing e g thaw slumps and thermal gullies on total runoff and sl cannot be ignored for this region or other similar basins in the tp li et al 2021b luo et al 2019 wang et al 2021a more studies are necessary to further explore the interaction between these cryosphere factors and rainfall on water and sediment processes on a seasonal scale this could pose additional challenges for the management of water resources hydropower generation and development as well as food and environmental security in the region wang et al 2021b 4 4 uncertainty and prospects the present study is not without limitations on the one hand the assessment accuracy of re directly affected the precision of their effect on runoff and sediment in this study we have applied the method of zhang et al 2002 to calculate the re and found that re in the lrb varied from 342 87 to 1029 77 mj mm ha 1 h 1 with an average of 665 73 mj mm ha 1 h 1 from 1980 to 2018 this agrees well with the range reported by chen et al 2022 for re of the lrb yet it is slightly greater than their average of 528 mj mm ha 1 h 1 over the whole tp based on 1 min rainfall data obtained from 1226 weather stations our results also showed that the re value of the naqu station is almost comparable to the study by gu et al 2020 but smaller re at other sites such as the lhasa and zedang stations of lrb table 2 compared with the estimated re factor by trmm in fan et al 2013 and cmorph and downscaled cmorph in yang et al 2018 the re in this work gives much smaller values at the lhasa and zedang stations but a larger value at the naqu station the difference in estimation between studies might be attributed to the calculation of the data precision and models in general the interpolation methods of discrete point data re models based on annual monthly and daily scales and the rainfall threshold of erosive events may produce a bias in the re estimation on the other hand the period division also could introduce some uncertainties in attribution analysis based on the abrupt change analysis in our study we found that the abrupt changing years varied for runoff and sl series for the different methods i e pettitt and moving t test due to the different mechanisms of the analysis methods without considering data autoregression this can have a certain effect on our results to some extent thereby more future work is needed to further discuss and compare the application of different data resources and thresholds in other calculation methods of re to enhance model performance for re and to further develop statistical attribution methods that do not require the division of a time series into baseline and changing periods to reduce errors 5 conclusion this study systematically evaluated the long term response of runoff and sediment load sl to spatiotemporally varied two rainfall related parameters in the lhasa river basin lrb of the tibetan plateau additionally the individual and combined effects of other regional environmental factors including temperature snow and vegetation on variations in runoff and sl were further discussed on a monthly scale the main conclusions are summarized as follows the change patterns of rainfall related parameters runoff and sl were well revealed by the integrated approach of trend periodicity and abrupt change point during the study period of 1980 2018 runoff reduced insignificantly at both hydrological stations in the lrb with increasing rainfall and rainfall erosivity however there were contrasting sl trends between the middle significantly decrease and downstream insignificantly increase reaches all variables exist a substantial periodicity of 1 year during the whole study period however the length of the primary periodicity of sl weakened gradually the relationships of rainfall related parameters and runoff or sl were also observed to change in varying degrees in general rainfall related parameters strongly influenced the changes in runoff and sl and their action gradually weakened after 2005 further attribution analysis demonstrated that rainfall related parameters dominated the variations of runoff and sl during the whole study period notably vegetation led to a reduction in sediment amounts but did not intercept runoff under vegetation restoration snow was slightly positively correlated with runoff and sl under an indirect effect on increasing temperature but snow melt has not offset the declining runoff on a monthly scale overall the above mentioned variables jointly explained 73 9 76 7 and 39 2 52 4 of the total variability in runoff and sl respectively our findings could strengthen the understanding of how climate change and vegetation restoration quantitatively caused hydrological changes in cold and high altitude regions and could provide valuable insights to develop and optimize soil and water conservation measures for maintaining water and soil resource availability at regional scales credit authorship contribution statement

2190,fluvial runoff and sediment play vital roles in channel evolution material cycling water resource utilization and ecological environment in the context of global climate change the assessment of runoff and sediment in response to climate change is of great significance for water and soil conservation especially in alpine regions such as the tibetan plateau with limited availability of long term observed data in this study based on the available records for the period 1980 2018 the spatiotemporal variations in rainfall related parameters rainfall and rainfall erosivity re and their impacts on the runoff sediment load sl process were investigated in the lhasa river basin lrb by cross coherence analysis in addition the individual and combined effects of other regional environmental factors e g temperature snow water equivalent swe and vegetation on runoff and sl were quantitatively identified using partial least squares structural equation modeling pls sem the results showed that the changes in rainfall related parameters experienced an upward trend at a rate of 3 59 mm decade rainfall amount and 46 05 mj mm ha 1 h 1 decade re respectively the regions with the most obvious increase occurred in downstream of lrb however runoff displayed an insignificant decreasing trend together with increasing water inputs from the wetter climate in the middle and lower reaches the contrasting sl trends were found in the middle significantly descending 5 5 104 t decade and downstream reaches slightly increasing 19 27 104 t decade rainfall related parameters generally played a positive role in runoff and sl at all hydrological stations and their action gradually weakened after 2005 despite still being the dominant factor other environmental variables such as vegetation did not limit runoff but did reduce the sl with an increase in vegetation coverage in the lrb where large area vegetation restoration projects were implemented and mainly distributed on the sandy land and floodplain of the lower reach of the basin snow however had slightly positive promoting effects on runoff and sl under the scenario of swe reduction with increasing temperature all above mentioned variables jointly explained 73 9 76 7 and 39 2 52 4 of the total variability in runoff and sl respectively these findings provide valuable insights into future studies on water and

headwaters to downstream places schumm 1977 the two intricate dynamic processes in the earth s surface system runoff generation and sediment transport are regarded as crucial measures of land degradation and water and soil loss in river basins borrelli et al 2020 thomasson 1992 changes in runoff and sediment represent critical aspects of global change wang et al 2015 in the past few decades global climate change and anthropogenic activities have accelerated hydrological processes leading to the degradation of ecological systems and substantial losses in agricultural production ipcc 2013 climatic characteristic such as rainfall is the primary driving force johannsen et al 2022 since its amount intensity and frequency directly dominate the transformation of rainfall to runoff milliman and farnsworth 2013 zhang et al 2008 as well as soil erosion anders et al 2008 and thus influence the sediment load sl at different temporal and spatial scales therefore evaluation of the response of fluvial runoff and sl to climate change particularly to rainfall related parameters has significant ramifications for ecosystem protection and water and soil conservation the relation between rainfall and sl is given by rainfall erosivity re which reflects factors such as rainfall intensity and quantifies the kinetic energy of raindrop impact and the rate of associated surface runoff li and fang 2017 against the background of global warming and intensified human activities the increase in the intensity and frequency of rainstorms may lead to the increase of re and river runoff further accelerating the occurrence of soil erosion and posing a serious threat to the ecosystem sustainability of regions lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 timely monitoring and analysis of the spatiotemporal variations in regional rainfall and re have received greater attention in the field of soil erosion numerous studies have been conducted on the calculation method of re with multiple scale rainfall data including daily monthly seasonal and yearly data jiang et al 2021 xie et al 2016 zhang et al 2002 among those methods the most extensively used method is based on daily rainfall data in the scientific literature due to its high estimation accuracy and data availability for most locations angulo martínez and beguería 2009 for instance the method developed by zhang et al 2002 has been widely applied and tested throughout china with dense rainfall observation networks such as in the loess plateau yunnan guizhou plateau and three gorges reservoir gu et al 2016 liu et al 2018 shi et al 2021 limited investigations on the sparsely distributed area of meteorological stations have been carried out especially in complex high altitude and cold areas such as the tibetan plateau tp chen et al 2022 studies on riverine runoff and sediment processes related to rainfall and re have been of wide interest to geomorphologists and hydrologists since the 1950s zhang et al 2022b an increasing number of studies have been performed on the relationship among conventional rainfall characteristics sediment and runoff e g chu et al 2019 han et al 2019 and lu et al 2022 in an analysis of the spatiotemporal response of runoff and sediment to rainfall in the yellow river basin xu et al 2021 reported that the impacts of extreme rainfall events on the linkages between water and sediment are disparate in different regions zhang et al 2019 also quantitively analyzed the linkages among rainfall runoff and sediment yield variations and found that 10 change in annual rainfall would result in 10 14 and 17 24 variation in runoff and sediment yield respectively however in high altitude and cold regions the response of fluvial runoff and sediment to rainfall and re on the monthly scale is still limited partly because of the lack of long term on site monitoring data although zhang et al 2022b studied the impact of rainfall on annual runoff and sediment yield in eight headwater catchments of tp and found an inverted parabolic relationship between sediment yield and rainfall the variations in runoff and sl are also controlled by other regional environmental factors such as temperature snow and anthropogenic activities e g reservoir construction and vegetation change including afforestation and deforestation the rising temperature would result in permafrost degradation and increase the meltwater of ice and snow which would have an indirect effect on the dynamics of fluvial water and sl wang et al 2017 additionally vegetation significantly affects intra annual runoff variability mostly by blocking the formation of surface runoff extending the infiltration time and influencing the redistribution of runoff volume gao et al 2019 hou et al 2022 more importantly there is a growing consensus that the hydrological characteristics process is a complicated one determined by the interactions among many factors huang et al 2019 changes in rainfall including its amount and intensity directly affect river hydrological characteristics furthermore it plays an indirect role in runoff and sl through its ability to improve plant growth which in turn impacts hydrological characteristics ran et al 2013 thorough knowledge of hydrological features in response to climatic variability and vegetation dynamics may be hampered by the complicated interactions among these variables therefore deeper insights into the influencing mechanism among factors and quantitative evaluation of the combined effect are urgently needed to develop specific strategies for future soil conservation measures currently most of the existing studies have primarily focused on the individual direct effects of each factor on watershed hydrological characteristics on an annual scale feng et al 2016 shi et al 2022 by using some common methods such as simple linear regression budyko and double mass curve methods luo et al 2020 ye et al 2020 however research on the indirect and comprehensive interactive effects of these factors remains much less investigated the joint application of partial least squares structural equation modeling pls sem and cross coherence analysis has the ability not only to distinguish between the influence of individual factors but also to determine the combined effect of multiple factors including direct and indirect effects shen et al 2022 tian et al 2022b thus it is promising to use these methods for the attribution analysis of watershed hydrological characteristics in cold and high altitude regions the tp named the world s third pole and asia water towers is the largest global reservoir of snow and ice after the polar regions and headwaters of major rivers of asia providing water for more than 1 4 billion people immerzeel et al 2010 it is also an essential ecological barrier area where the ecosystem is extremely vulnerable and highly sensitive to global climate change immerzeel et al 2020 the tp experienced considerable warming beginning in the mid 1950s and wetting from 1980 to 2018 chylek et al 2009 in response to such rapid warming the snow water equivalent swe overall presented a decreasing trend and glaciers retreat has accelerated smith and bookhagen 2018 marked climate change and the cryosphere could lead to shifts in the timing and magnitude of the hydrological process of tp rivers and threaten ecological security in downstream countries as a major anthropogenic activity zone in the southwestern part of the tp the lhasa river basin lrb is a representative alpine basin and a typical arid region in the tp the lrb has experienced dramatic environmental changes such as climate warming and humidification these features are related to high intensity rainfall li et al 2020b climate warming and wetting accelerated the hydrological process tian et al 2020 in addition many ecological projects have been implemented in this area including afforestation grass planting and closure against grazing to prevent wind erosion fix sand and control water and soil loss li et al 2020b these measures have contributed to an increase in vegetation coverage in the past few decades and accelerated the water cycle process which profoundly affected the drastic change in water and sediment in the area therefore it is essential to evaluate to what extent climate change temperature rainfall swe vegetation restoration and their interactions affect the variations in runoff and sl recently the variation in runoff and its responses to such climate change have been widely noted chen et al 2019 chen et al 2021 but changes in sediment and the impact of vegetation coverage still lack attention within this context the objectives of this study were 1 to systematically detect and quantify the spatiotemporal changes in rainfall related parameters including rainfall and re runoff and sl in the lrb over the period 1980 2018 2 to evaluate the impact of rainfall related parameters on runoff and sl variation at the monthly scale and 3 to quantitatively assess the individual and comprehensive effects of other regional environmental factors e g temperature swe and vegetation using pls sem on the variability of runoff and sl the results will be helpful in water and soil conservation planning water resource management and ecological restoration in cold and high altitude regions 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area the lhasa river fig 1 a located in the southeastern part of the tibetan plateau tp is the largest tributary of the yarlung zangbo river with a total length of 568 km it originates from the nyainqentangla mountains and discharges into the yarlung zangbo river in tibet its basin lrb covers an area of approximately 32 894 km2 29 20 to 31 15 n 90 05 to 93 20 e the altitude varies from 3538 to 7114 m above sea level a s l with an average of about 4885 04 m a s l its landforms are mainly high mountains and deep gorges the study area belongs to the plateau temperate semiarid continental climate with distinct dry and wet seasons the river is primarily recharged by rainfall meltwater and groundwater the annual mean temperature and rainfall are 5 3 c and 602 51 mm respectively affected by the warm and humid air from the indian ocean the rainfall is exceptionally uneven throughout the year with more than 70 of the total annual rainfall falling in summer the main land uses are grassland barren land and sparse vegetation cover 90 human activities including afforestation are mainly concentrated in the lower reaches of the lhasa river valley below 4200 m a s l li et al 2020b to shed light on the variability in runoff and sediment this study focused on the approximately 26 244 54 km2 of the lrb with two hydrological stations namely the lhasa and tangjia as shown in fig 1a the study area did not take the region below the lhasa station into account due to lack of in situ observed data in the watershed outlet according to observation data from downstream lhasa station the annual mean runoff and sl during 1980 2018 were approximately 91 65 m3 s and 147 06 104 t respectively severe soil erosion contributes to the high sediment concentration in the yarlung zangbo river over a long period however since the 1990s large scale soil and water conservation measures have been taken including afforestation and grass planting as a result of conservation measures and climate change both runoff and sl have changed substantially in recent decades a record showed that the runoff and sl in the lrb decreased from 144 42 108 m3 and 196 14 104 t in 1962 to 83 1 108 m3 and 70 85 104 t in 2018 respectively 2 2 data collection and processing the data used in this study were as follows 1 daily meteorological data comprising rainfall and temperature maximum minimum and mean temperature from eight stations covering the period 1980 to 2018 were collected from the chinese meteorological data center https www data cma cn for all meteorological stations the percentages of the missing values of rainfall data are 15 hence we used the linear interpolation method to fill in the missing values of daily rainfall data based on the rainfall amount of the corresponding day of each month in multiple years besides the inverse distance weighting method was applied to interpolate the spatial pattern of the mean rainfall and rainfall erosivity re in the whole lrb 2 monthly measured runoff and sl data during 1980 2018 were acquired from the bureau of hydrology and water resources survey of tibet autonomous region the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is the best indicator to reflect regional vegetation growth and coverage levels under changes in climate and anthropogenic activities in this study gimms ndvi3g data during 1982 2015 were derived from the nasa goddard space flight center with a spatial resolution of 8 km https ecocast arc nasa gov data pub gimms it is worth noting that this dataset for vegetation remote sensing had the longest available time series spot vgt ndvi beginning in 1998 at a 1 km resolution was provided by the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc https www resdc cn there was a strong linear correlation between the two data groups at the monthly scale r2 0 92 fig s1 thereby the avhrr ndvi could be adjusted and integrated with spot vgt data spanning 1998 to 2018 the afforestation area was obtained from the statistical yearbook of lhasa city for the snow factor snow water equivalent swe with 25 km resolution as one of the most essential parameters for accurate prediction of snowmelt runoff fig 1c was available from the national cryosphere desert data center swe refers to the amount of water mm that would be obtained if the entire snowpack completely melted all factors data were converted into raster format with a 1 km spatial resolution by using the nearest neighbor interpolation method 2 3 methodology fig 2 depicts the study s framework for investigating the change characteristics of the rainfall related parameters exploring the response of runoff and sl and discussing how they are affected in the lrb we first examined the variations in the rainfall related parameters rainfall and re runoff and sl including the trends periodicities and change points at different time scales during 1980 2018 according to the evolution characteristics the annual runoff and sl time series were divided into several periods including a baseline period and multiple changing periods then the result was further systematically assessed the potential impact of the rainfall related parameters on runoff and sl by using pearson correlation and cross coherence analysis finally we explored the contributions and combined effects of multiple regional environmental factors on runoff and sl change based on pls sem 2 3 1 rainfall erosivity calculation richardson s daily rainfall erosive agent model which can more accurately estimate rainfall erosivity re using daily rainfall data on the national and regional scales in china was used to support the daily rainfall data of 8 meteorological stations from 1980 to 2018 in the lrb zhang et al 2002 the calculation formula is as follows 1 re i α j 1 k p j β where re i is the re in the ith half month period mj mm hm 2 h 1 p j is the amount of the daily erosive rainfall mm on the jth day during the half month period and k is the number of days in the half month time in the model a half month is represented by the days from the first to the fifteenth of every month and another half month is represented by the remaining days the monthly and annual res of each meteorological station can be obtained by summing the half month re the daily amount of rainfall exceeding 12 0 mm is regarded as erosive rainfall and applied to eq 1 otherwise the calculations should make use of a value of 0 the model s α and β parameters can be calculated

daily erosive rainfall is higher than 12 0 mm and p year is the amount of mean annual erosive rainfall mm if the amount of daily rainfall is greater than 12 0 mm finally the spatial distribution of the monthly and annual re was interpolated using the inverse distance weighting method with a spatial resolution of 1 km in arcgis 10 4 software 2 3 1 1 trend analysis and abrupt detection in this study sen s slope test was applied to analyze the change trends and slope magnitudes of two rainfall related parameters the nonparametric pettitt and moving t test which could be applied to refs pettitt 1979 sen 1968 zhao et al 2022 for more details have been employed to identify abrupt changes in rainfall related parameters runoff and sl series 2 3 1 2 wavelet analysis methods wavelet analysis is extensively used to analyze the periodicity and correlations of climatic and hydrological time series data lorenzo lacruz et al 2022 wang et al 2022b to understand the correlation of time series data continuous wavelet transform cwt was first introduced to identify spatiotemporal variations in the oscillation periodicity in monthly rainfall related parameters and runoff or sl time series with cwt both quasi state and nonstationary periodicities of time series at a monthly scale can be captured torrence and compo 1998 the morlet wavelet function has been applied in this study due to its advantages in the analysis of complicated environmental signals grinsted et al 2004 which is defined as follows 4 ψ 0 η π 1 4 e i w 0 η e η 2 2 where w 0 represents the nondimensional frequency variable for w 0 6 it offers a good balance between frequency and time localization the cwt of the time series given that x n represents the time series with a constant time space of δ t is defined as 5 w n s n 0 n 1 x n ψ n n δ t s where ψ represents the complicated conjugate of ψ n and n are the localized time index and variable respectively s denotes the wavelet scale and n represents the length of the time series the oscillation energy of various periods and how those periods alter over time can be depicted by changing the wavelet scale s and translating along the localized time index n torrence and compo 1998 among wavelet analysis tools cross coherence analysis cross wavelet transform xwt and wavelet transform coherence wtc are applied to measure and identify the coherence and phase shift between rainfall related parameters and runoff or sl time series xwt was proposed to reveal the potential causal relationship between two time series by detecting the time frequency areas with common high power and relative phase angle grinsted et al 2004 wtc can not only pinpoint the scales and situations at which two time series exhibit comparable cyclic patterns but also determine the phase difference between the two time frequency series he et al 2021 wang et al 2022b the definition of wtc between the x and y time series is as follows grinsted et al 2004 6 r t 2 f b

significance level of wtc was assessed using the monte carlo method at a 95 confidence level grinsted et al 2004 in this study significance testing for the global coherence of r t 2 f against a red noise background was carried out using the method developed by schulte 2016 the time averaged wtc coefficients are used to define the coefficient of global coherence at a certain scale f 7 r t 2 f 1 n

correlation analysis between annual rainfall related parameters and runoff or sl was performed before wavelet analysis 2 3 1 3 pls sem in this study we hypothesized that other regional environmental factors still have a strong influence on runoff and sl to test the hypothetical pathways partial least squares structural equation modeling pls sem was used to reveal the complex causal relationships between other regional environmental factors runoff or sl to test the direct and combined effects in the parameter estimation process pls sem relaxes the assumption of a multivariate normal distribution compared with traditional sem pls sem is fitter for exploratory research with small samples and simulations that do not require normally distributed data in addition pls sem can produce iterative estimates for maximizing the explanation of the variance of an independent latent variable and effectively assess the interaction among factors tenenhaus et al 2005 tian et al 2022a wang et al 2022a the pls sem generally includes two submodules measurement outer model and structural inner model among them the structural model is applied to assess the linkage among endogenous latent variables huang et al 2019 8 γ j i 1 i β ji γ i ζ where γ j represents a vector of all latent variables and β represents the path coefficient that can test the relationship between adjacent and non adjacent variables grace 2006 the results of this test showed how strong and in what direction the explanatory and response variables were correlated the measurement model as an explanatory model consists of manifest variables and latent variables monecke and leisch 2012 this may be expressed using the following formulas 9 x λ x η δ 10 y λ y η ε eqs 9 and 10 represent exogenous and endogenous indicators respectively δ and ε are the measurement errors λ is the relationship between the manifest variables and latent variables the latent variables included two exogenous latent variables rainfall related parameter and temperature and four endogenous latent variables vegetation snow runoff and sediment nine observational indicators were regarded as manifest variables for latent variables temperature variables including mean temperature maximum temperature and minimum temperature are regarded to have indirect effects on runoff and sl through snow and vegetation rainfall related parameters were reflected by re and rainfall rainfall related parameters vegetation snow and runoff have a direct effect on sl corresponding to the measured indicators ndvi swe runoff and sl respectively in pls sem direct pathways are specified entirely by the corresponding path coefficients of independent and dependent variables indirect pathways between independent and dependent variables are those involving intermediary variables whereas the total effects are the sum of the indirect and direct effects the prediction accuracy and credibility of the pls sem were ascertained by the goodness of fit li et al 2021c pls sem was carried out using smartpls version 3 software https www smartpls com 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal pattern of rainfall and rainfall erosivity in this study the long term trends of rainfall and re from 1980 to 2018 are investigated fig 3 the overall multi year average annual re in the lrb is 665 73 mj mm ha 1 h 1 over the past four decades with the lowest value 342 87 mj mm ha 1 h 1 and the highest value 1029 77 mj mm ha 1 h 1 being recorded in 1992 and 1990 respectively this is inconsistent with the years when the maximum and minimum values of rainfall appeared the highest and lowest values of rainfall were detected in 2003 and 1983 respectively the linear trend indicated that the annual rainfall experienced an upward but insignificant 3 59 mm decade p 0 05 trend in contrast the annual re presented a significantly increasing trend 46 05 mj mm ha 1 h 1 decade p 0 5 suggesting that there are more frequent events of heavy rainfall and erosive rainfall in the lrb meanwhile the intensification of erosive rainfall events may promote the sediment transport capacity of flow and have a significant impact on the sl in addition an apparent temporal pattern was observed in which rainfall related parameters first increased and then declined with the abrupt change in 1998 by the pettitt test fig s2 seasonal variations in re were uneven similar to the temporal distribution pattern of rainfall fig 4 during the past four decades the upward trend of rainfall and re was found in spring and summer while a decreasing trend in autumn in total the interannual fluctuation in re was higher than in rainfall in winter the re and rainfall only accounted for approximately 3 mainly due to very little or almost no rainfall in this season the values of rainfall and re for summer were significantly higher than those for other seasons the rainfall and re from may and september contributed to more than 86 of total annual rainfall and re for the whole year and more attention need to be paid to better soil erosion prevention during this period fig 5 a and 5c show the spatial distribution characteristics of the multiyear mean annual rainfall and re in the lrb based on daily rainfall data from 1980 to 2018 spatially the multiyear mean re gradually increased from southwest to northeast with a range of 451 46 990 15 mj mm ha 1 h 1 the regions with the lowest annual re were mainly located in the western and southwest parts of the basin while the regions with the highest annual re were primarily observed in the eastern and southward drift parts of the basin furthermore the slopes of changing trend of re showed a slight upward trend by sen s slope test during 1980 2018 the most significant upward trend was primarily distributed in the lower reach of the lrb which is generally consistent with those of rainfall fig 5b and 5d nonetheless the small difference is that a downward trend of rainfall was detected in the northeast and western basin besides the low and high value centers of annual re are distinct from those of the rainfall this suggests that the regions with high rainfall do not necessarily have high erosive rainfall on the contrary the ones with low rainfall probably have high erosive rainfall in general the re in the lower reach of the lrb showed a relatively significant upward trend indicating that the risk of soil erosion caused by rainfall in this region is increasing pronouncedly and should be a more continuous concern 3 2 variations in runoff and sediment load at different time scales fig 6 displays the temporal variations in annual runoff and sl at the middle and lower reaches of the lrb from 1980 to 2018 it is evident that the annual runoff in the lrb generally exhibited slight decreasing but non significant trends 0 82 108 m3 yr p 0 05 in tangjia station and 0 49 108 m3 yr p 0 05 in lhasa station respectively over the past four decades which has almost kept a slight balance with the same rainfall conversely the annual sls exhibited prominent spatial heterogeneity with a significant decrease p 0 05 trend at the tangjia station at a rate of 19 27 104 t decade and a sudden increasing trend at the lhasa station at a rate of 5 5 104 t decade besides it is worth noting that the total sl of lhasa station was an order of magnitude greater than that of tangjia station the difference in the region between the middle and lower reaches of lrb was mainly caused by the significant increase of erosive rainfall and partly owing to the more significant human disturbance in downstream and sediment storage in the middle stream fig s2 shows the change year of both runoff and sl at both stations we found that the abrupt changing years varied from runoff and sl series at the different stations and methods for the runoff at both stations the pettitt method identified the change year in 2006 whereas the moving t test identified the change years as 1998 and 2006 for sl at both stations the pettitt method recognized the change year as 2005 for tangjia station and 1995 for lhasa station whereas the moving t test identified the change years as 2006 2008 for tangjia station and 2006 for lhasa station overall the abrupt change years for both runoff and sl in the lrb basin were consistently close to 1998 and 2006 thus we selected 1998 and 2006 as the abrupt change points for the investigation of runoff and sl at both stations and further divided the past approximately 40 years into three periods covering p1 baseline period 1980 1997 p2 change period 1 1998 2005 and p3 change period 2 2006 2018 table s1 showed that the average annual runoff and sl pronouncedly increased by 43 54 and 45 03 in tangjia station and 38 93 and 173 48 in lhasa station from p1 to p2 respectively and further decreased dramatically by 35 73 and 80 95 in tangjia station 36 98 and 69 32 in lhasa station during p3 in general both runoff and sl experienced significant increases first and then decreases in the lrb hence the in depth analysis of this study was given more to lhasa station but the situations of tangjia station were also given for comparison fig 7 shows that the monthly and seasonal runoff and sl at both stations have pronounced seasonal differences the runoff and sl in summer july august and autumn september october were higher than those in other seasons at both stations over the entire study period more than 80 and 50 of the annual total runoff and sl were transported in summer at the middle and lower reaches of the lrb respectively at the monthly time scale higher variabilities in runoff and sl occur in july and august 3 3 periodicity characteristics at the monthly scale to further comprehend the finer spatiotemporal patterns of rainfall related parameters runoff and sl at various time frequency domains we used the cwt to investigate their multiscale characteristics the cwts of the rainfall related parameters runoff and sl are presented at two stations in the lrb the wavelet power value could characterize the energy of periodic intensity the periodicity was more significant at higher energies torrence and compo 1998 fig s3 displays the results of the cwt of rainfall related parameters it is observed that rainfall occurred coincidently within the re at specific frequencies and periods re and rainfall showed a quasi nonintermittent annual process except for re at tangjia station the significant wavelet power for annual periodicity variations at approximately 12 months was detected from the wavelet spectrum during the entire study period on a scale of 8 months oscillations occurred intermittently over the entire period the global wavelet power spectrum detected that the persistence of the 6 and 12 month cycles are shown by 95 level significant oscillation periods fig s3 a2 b2 c2 and d2 fig 8 displays that the time series of runoff and sl is characterized by amplitude modulation and periodicity the cwt results of the runoff time series revealed that both stations were affected by nearly continuous annual periodicity over the whole study period the wavelet power spectrum of significant yearly periodicity fluctuations at approximately 12 months at lhasa station exhibited higher power from 1998 to 2006 similar to the wavelet power spectra of runoff at tangjia station however an overall decline at tangjia station was observed in the wavelet spectral power of sl since 2006 this decrease in runoff is of the peak flow being slowed down both directly and indirectly by reservoir construction and erosive rainfall regarding the cwt results of sl at time scales of approximately 3 to 12 months the significant and strong wavelet power for the interannual periodicity variations was detected at tangjia station from the wavelet power spectrum before 2005 which however started to weaken thereafter in addition to the half and 1 year cycles the sporadic occurrence of 3 and 48 month oscillations can be discerned most noticeably in 1995 2015 but the global wavelet power spectrum shows that these cycles were not found to be statistically significant at the 95 level for the lhasa station there were only 3 to 12 month significant periodicity variations with relatively high energy from 1995 to 2006 in sl this is owing to the significantly higher rainfall in this period than in others similarly only 6 and 12 month cycles are globally significant in general the global wavelet analyses show similarities between rainfall related parameters and runoff time series for both stations 3 4 influence of rainfall related parameters on runoff and sl 3 4 1 simple linear associations for rainfall related parameters runoff and sl understanding the responses of changes in runoff and sl to the rainfall related parameters was made possible by correlation analysis due to the consistent trend of runoff and sl at both stations through the analysis of abrupt points we only performed a pearson correlation analysis at lhasa station between runoff sl and rainfall related parameters for three different periods p1 p2 and p3 fig 9 shows that the coefficients of determination r2 between rainfall related parameters and runoff were well above 0 7 in which the r2 ranged from 0 91 to 0 78 in rainfall runoff regressions and from 0 84 to 0 74 in re runoff regressions for another there also presented a similar effect from p1 to p2 yet the r2 during p3 was not significant with an r2 value of 0 55 for rainfall sl and 0 53 for re sl thus rainfall related parameters had stronger explanatory power for the variability in runoff generation than sl additionally we found that the overall correlations between rainfall related parameters and runoff sl have an insignificant increasing trend from p1 to p2 and decreased thereafter in the lrb which indicated that the effect of climate change on runoff and sl gradually decreased 3 4 1 1 nonstationary responses of runoff and sl to rainfall related parameters at varying scales over time cross coherence analysis was further used to explore the inherent response relationship of rainfall related parameters rainfall and re on runoff and sl in the time frequency domain the ability of different rainfall related parameters to explain runoff and sl variations was evaluated by the indicators of the average power of wavelet coherence apwc and the percentage of the numbers of power that were significant at the 95 significance level papc produced by wtc a higher apwc with a larger pasc shows that more changes in the runoff and sl can be explained by a rainfall factor table 1 presents the apwc and papc among rainfall related parameters runoff and sl overall the contributions of rainfall related parameters to runoff were greater than those to sl variation in the middle and lower reaches of the lrb however there was a slight difference in apwc among runoff sl and rainfall related parameters for different stations besides among the two rainfall related parameters we studied the value papc between rainfall and runoff was higher than that of re and runoff at lhasa station whereas it is quite contrary to sl in the whole study period this indicated that rainfall could explain the runoff variation better than re and re could explain the sl better than rainfall for different periods similar to the pearson correlation coefficients the influence of rainfall related parameters on runoff and sl presented first increasing and then decreasing trend except for sl and rainfall related parameters at tangjia station suggesting the role of rainfall related parameters on runoff and sediment fluxes was weakening over the past decade fig 10 reveals the xwt and wtc between rainfall related parameters and runoff or sl through the power spectrum of xwt and wtc it was observed that the variability of rainfall related parameters and runoff or sl showed a statistically significant positive correlation with high oscillation energy at a 12 months resonant period during nearly the entire 40 years period this coincides with the spectrum of cwts indicating that they have the stability and overall characteristics of interannual variation in addition significantly higher wavelet power was observed at the 4 to 6 month time scales especially re has the highest variation with runoff in 1998 what s more the significantly positive correlation between rainfall related parameters and sl gradually decreased compared with the xwt power spectrum the wtc spectrum presented a broad and strong resonant period for tangjia station the wtc between rainfall and runoff showed significant local coherence at 6 to 64 month between 1980 1995 and 2006 2018 and shifts to 8 to 32 month from 1995 to 2005 the wtc for re demonstrated that two bands of 4 16 months had the highest coherence in 1980 1995 and 1998 2015 strong and widespread coherence patterns occur at a time scale of 32 to 64 month across the research period in contrast to tangjia station rainfall had the strongest and widest positive coherence with 4 to 128 month over a time span from 1980 to 2018 in lhasa station there was a lag time between rainfall and runoff over most parts of time seen by the down pointing arrows consistent with that of tangjia station furthermore the wtc generally revealed that the highest coherence between re and runoff mostly occurs at the bands of 4 to 16 month the 16 month band coherence was broader in the wtc from the monthly re series the wtcs between rainfall related parameters and sl showed that sl and two rainfall related parameters were almost correlated positively coincident with the result of the correlation coefficient at tangjia station the wtc between rainfall and sl showed that the continuous obvious coherence pattern at the 4 16 month band roughly exists for the whole study period whereas the 16 32 month coherence band is broader before 1998 the wtc between re and sl has a stronger coherence with sl in the 4 to 16 month bands and the main intermittent significant regions at the 32 64 month and 64 128 month time scales can be found in 1985 2000 and 2000 2010 respectively at lhasa station the wtc for rainfall confirmed that strong and broad coherence patterns with the 4 32 month band are in good agreement with re during 1980 2000 and their significant correlation changes into the 4 to the 16 month band especially after 2005 indicating that the correlation coefficient between rainfall re and sl was weakening which probably means that the role of human activities or other climate variables on runoff and sediment transport may be increasing since this period this could primarily be attributed to vegetation restoration in which large scale ecological engineering has been implemented since the 1990s resulting in changes in runoff and sediment transport in the whole region fig s4 represents the averaged coherence among the monthly rainfall related parameters runoff and sl it can be observed that the overall maximum peak of global coherence was recorded at a 12 month time scale due to the local dominance of coherence which is more than 0 6 this suggests that all the parameters had the most significant correlation in the yearly time cycle from the transformation of phase arrows the consistent arrow direction for the coherence plots in the 1 year cycle implies nearly in phase angles signifying the statistically positive correlation of rainfall related parameters on monthly runoff and sl changes these findings confirmed that at annual scales rainfall related parameters had a significant effect on monthly runoff and sl in the lrb which have gradually decreased since 2006 4 discussion 4 1 decoupling the contribution of other regional environmental factors on variability in runoff and sl this study confirmed that rainfall related parameters generally played a positive role in runoff and sl at all hydrological stations and their action gradually weakened after 2005 in the study area consequently this implies that apart from the role of rainfall related parameters the other regional environmental factors including air temperature snow and vegetation restoration may play an important role in the variations in runoff and sl meanwhile considering the contrasting sl trends between the middle tangjia station pronouncedly decreasing and downstream lhasa station slightly increasing reaches in the lrb we further decouple the combined effects of other regional environmental factors and rainfall related parameters to the variation in runoff and sl on a monthly scale at both hydrological stations by pls sem the pls sem results indicated that the values of the goodness of fit for different periods at both stations were all above 0 7 showing a substantial predictive accuracy for the entire model of each period concerning the path coefficients of pls sem the rainfall related parameters rainfall and re had a significant p 0 01 direct positive influence on runoff and sl except at tangjia station in p2 with the highest total effect including direct and indirect effect ranging from 0 586 to 0 725 and from 0 389 to 0 887 fig s5 meanwhile we also found that the action of rainfall related parameters increased first and then decreased during p1 p3 but was still the primary driving factor of the variations in runoff and sl fig 11 which is in agreement with zhang et al 2013 and their study showed that monsoon rainfall has a dominant role in sustaining seasonal streamflow over southeastern regions among six large rivers in the tp this result also further confirmed the analysis results of the abovementioned pearson correlation and wtc in summary rainfall and air temperature had a significant direct effect on vegetation explaining 72 0 79 3 of vegetation dynamics the drivers of vegetation snow dynamics and climate factors jointly accounted for 73 9 76 7 of the total variations of runoff runoff changes vegetation and snow dynamics were further affected by rainfall related parameters and temperature explaining 39 2 52 4 of the variations in sl fig 11 furthermore we found that the explanatory power of these factors for runoff and sl increased from p1 to p2 and then decreased at lhasa station which mainly attributed to the effects of the role of rainfall related parameters on runoff and sl 4 2 effects of vegetation on the variability in runoff and sl the response of runoff and sediment transport processes in basins to vegetation is complex sun et al 2022 xu et al 2018 it is a widely held perception worldwide that vegetation restoration could effectively reduce surface runoff and sediment yield wang et al 2015 on the one hand vegetation reduces surface runoff by weakening the raindrop kinetic energy altering the evaporation of canopy interception and enhancing soil infiltration capacity gu et al 2019 li et al 2020a on the other hand land coverage triggered by vegetation enhances surface roughness and root fixation decreased erosive flow power and ultimately reduced soil detachment and sediment transport capacity by overflow tian et al 2022b zhang et al 2022a however our current study showed that the vegetation always was positively related to runoff in both stations β 0 285 and 0 422 p 0 05 and negatively correlated with sl on a monthly scale of the whole study period β 0 267 and 0 453 p 0 05 indicating that vegetation did not decrease runoff but it did decrease sl fig 11 these findings are in line with the results of several previous studies gao et al 2019 xu et al 2018 zeng et al 2020 zhou et al 2010 conversely this differs from the results of shi et al 2022 in which the increases in fluvial sl were buffered by a reduction in water production capacity due to more dense vegetation coverage during 1972 2008 in the headwaters of the yarlung zangbo river this difference was probably produced by vegetation heterogeneity and data length on a spatial and temporal scale notably since the 1990s the study area has implemented ecological restoration projects including afforestation and planting grass to prevent wind erosion fix sand surfaces and control water and soil loss hong et al 2020 after the implementation of those projects for more than 30 years the vegetation coverage of lrb has been significantly improved with an increased rate of 0 012 decade the afforestation area increased from 148 53 in 1990 to 3161 76 ha in 2018 statistics showed that up to 2018 the cumulative afforestation area had reached approximately 175 733 73 ha fig 1b the vegetation restoration projects were mostly concentrated on the sandy land floodplain and terraces of the lower reaches of lrb in the sandy land the total discharge after afforestation may be greater than that before afforestation under the same rainfall intensity mainly because large scale afforestation would result in a dried layer in the soil of the sandy land thus hindering the vertical infiltration of soil water into the deeper layers thus affecting the regional water cycle wang et al 2010 wang et al 2011 as a result the earlier overland runoff occurs and soil erosion intensifies zeng et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 by contrast vegetation distributed in the floodplain and terraces of the basin may be further partially buffered by sediment production on steep slopes nevertheless these regional soil and water conservation practices did not offset the potential increase from positive factors therefore even though vegetation restoration significantly improved the regional environmental conditions it did not decrease runoff but did decrease the sediment our findings are helpful for planners to review their conservation plans to prevent water and soil erosion 4 3 effects of snow on the variability in runoff and sl the accumulation and melting of snow can also have a great influence on surface hydrological processes barabanov 2021 zhang and ma 2018 swe integrating the characteristics of snow depth and snow density is one of the critical important indicators of the runoff flow of rivers dong et al 2005 musselman et al 2021 in the results of pls sem the effects of snow on runoff and sl vary greatly in different periods with a relatively small positive effect at tangjia station except in p1 and an opposite direct impact at lhasa station fig s5 but the swe over the whole study period always had weak and positive effects on runoff and sl at both stations fig 11 which indicated that runoff enhancement by snowmelt was caused by the rising air temperature further promoting the sediment carrying capacity and soil erosion this finding is consistent with previous studies iida et al 2012 tanasienko et al 2011 by contrast our work also found that snow melt did not offset the declining runoff on the monthly scale during the whole study period in contrast a gradual reduction in water vapor was still the main cause of the declining runoff after 2005 this also supports by the similar results of wang et al 2021b on the relationship between glacier retreat and runoff from the upstream of the yarlung zangbo basin their study by comparing the different runoff components suggested that the snow melt dominates the supply of meltwater to runoff in the river upstream when separating the fractional meltwater contributions from glaciers and snow during 1981 2019 the contribution of snowmelt and glacier melt to the total runoff is 17 2 and 5 5 respectively whereas the contribution from glaciers to total runoff is relatively small wang et al 2021b that is the main reason that our study did not consider the impact of glacier meltwater on runoff and sediment transport however previous studies have demonstrated that the glacier melt water would be crucially important to future runoff although this basin is mainly affected by the monsoon precipitation su et al 2016 wang et al 2021b in the long run the increase in glacier melt accounts for more than 50 of the increase in total runoff su et al 2016 what s more glacier runoff for yarlung zangbo river in 2041 2060 is projected to reach 16 and in 2071 2090 reach 18 respectively of total runoff nury et al 2021 in a recent study for sediment fluxes li et al 2021a reported that increasing fluvial sediment fluxes in high mountain asia are mainly caused by accelerated glacier permafrost melt and increased precipitation and associated erosion processes hence it is undoubted that the influences of glaciers recession and permafrost thawing e g thaw slumps and thermal gullies on total runoff and sl cannot be ignored for this region or other similar basins in the tp li et al 2021b luo et al 2019 wang et al 2021a more studies are necessary to further explore the interaction between these cryosphere factors and rainfall on water and sediment processes on a seasonal scale this could pose additional challenges for the management of water resources hydropower generation and development as well as food and environmental security in the region wang et al 2021b 4 4 uncertainty and prospects the present study is not without limitations on the one hand the assessment accuracy of re directly affected the precision of their effect on runoff and sediment in this study we have applied the method of zhang et al 2002 to calculate the re and found that re in the lrb varied from 342 87 to 1029 77 mj mm ha 1 h 1 with an average of 665 73 mj mm ha 1 h 1 from 1980 to 2018 this agrees well with the range reported by chen et al 2022 for re of the lrb yet it is slightly greater than their average of 528 mj mm ha 1 h 1 over the whole tp based on 1 min rainfall data obtained from 1226 weather stations our results also showed that the re value of the naqu station is almost comparable to the study by gu et al 2020 but smaller re at other sites such as the lhasa and zedang stations of lrb table 2 compared with the estimated re factor by trmm in fan et al 2013 and cmorph and downscaled cmorph in yang et al 2018 the re in this work gives much smaller values at the lhasa and zedang stations but a larger value at the naqu station the difference in estimation between studies might be attributed to the calculation of the data precision and models in general the interpolation methods of discrete point data re models based on annual monthly and daily scales and the rainfall threshold of erosive events may produce a bias in the re estimation on the other hand the period division also could introduce some uncertainties in attribution analysis based on the abrupt change analysis in our study we found that the abrupt changing years varied for runoff and sl series for the different methods i e pettitt and moving t test due to the different mechanisms of the analysis methods without considering data autoregression this can have a certain effect on our results to some extent thereby more future work is needed to further discuss and compare the application of different data resources and thresholds in other calculation methods of re to enhance model performance for re and to further develop statistical attribution methods that do not require the division of a time series into baseline and changing periods to reduce errors 5 conclusion this study systematically evaluated the long term response of runoff and sediment load sl to spatiotemporally varied two rainfall related parameters in the lhasa river basin lrb of the tibetan plateau additionally the individual and combined effects of other regional environmental factors including temperature snow and vegetation on variations in runoff and sl were further discussed on a monthly scale the main conclusions are summarized as follows the change patterns of rainfall related parameters runoff and sl were well revealed by the integrated approach of trend periodicity and abrupt change point during the study period of 1980 2018 runoff reduced insignificantly at both hydrological stations in the lrb with increasing rainfall and rainfall erosivity however there were contrasting sl trends between the middle significantly decrease and downstream insignificantly increase reaches all variables exist a substantial periodicity of 1 year during the whole study period however the length of the primary periodicity of sl weakened gradually the relationships of rainfall related parameters and runoff or sl were also observed to change in varying degrees in general rainfall related parameters strongly influenced the changes in runoff and sl and their action gradually weakened after 2005 further attribution analysis demonstrated that rainfall related parameters dominated the variations of runoff and sl during the whole study period notably vegetation led to a reduction in sediment amounts but did not intercept runoff under vegetation restoration snow was slightly positively correlated with runoff and sl under an indirect effect on increasing temperature but snow melt has not offset the declining runoff on a monthly scale overall the above mentioned variables jointly explained 73 9 76 7 and 39 2 52 4 of the total variability in runoff and sl respectively our findings could strengthen the understanding of how climate change and vegetation restoration quantitatively caused hydrological changes in cold and high altitude regions and could provide valuable insights to develop and optimize soil and water conservation measures for maintaining water and soil resource availability at regional scales credit authorship contribution statement

2191,spoil heaps resulting from excavation and backfilling activities at construction sites are one of the most important risk sources of soil erosion threatening local ecosystems and even leading to geological disasters however after revegetation spoil heaps can be transformed into available land resources such as cultivated land and forest land previous studies have reported the runoff and sediment reduction benefits of different vegetation measures on spoil heaps while little information has been documented about what differences in the taproot and fibrous root grasses were transferred into the differences in hydrological and erosion processes this study compared the effects of taproot artemisia gmelinii a gmelinii and fibrous root cynodon dactylon c dactylon grasses on soil erosion and runoff production processes and the reduction benefits of spoil heaps with silt loam soil a series of rainfall events at three intensities 0 8 1 2 and 1 8 mm min 1 were simulated on runoff plots length of 3 0 m and width of 1 0 m under treatments of a gmelinii c dactylon and bare soil bs as control each treatment was replicated and the initial runoff time irt saturated hydraulic conductivity runoff rate rr flow velocity and soil loss rate slr were measured the results showed that grasses delayed the irts on spoil heaps by 0 69 12 96 min compared bs and the delay effects were more significant for fibrous root grass than for taproot grass the soil loss reduction benefits 91 1 of the two kinds of grass were approximately 2 2 times greater than those of runoff volume reduction 42 1 and shear stress could be used to predict the soil loss rate following power functions r2 0 72 0 85 for the grass covered plots the taproot grass exhibited a higher erosion reduction than fibrous root grass and is thus preferred to control the soil erosion of spoil heaps taproot grass has a greater stem diameter and can insert deeper into spoil heaps to consolidate the soil particles which can improve roughness and hydraulic resistance thereby producing a lower effective hydraulic shear stress that is directly exerted on soil particles this study enhances the understanding of different grasses on the water erosion process and mechanism of spoil heaps and provides scientific guidance for selecting erosion control practices keywords spoil heaps soil erosion runoff generation vegetation benefits stem diameter effective hydraulic shear stress data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction spoil heaps are slopes formed by the pile up of excess soil rock mixtures resulting from excavation and backfilling activities at construction sites lv et al 2019 yang et al 2019 and spoil heaps often feature loose soil structures steep slopes low vegetation cover and rich rock fragment contents li et al 2021 the accumulation of spoil heaps shows a dramatic increasing trend especially in some developing and developed countries wherein production and construction activities have notoriously intensified in recent decades rydgren et al 2011 guo et al 2020 driven by the external agents of water gravity and wind these soil rock mixtures are easily detached and transported off site the soil loss rate or erodibility of spoil heaps can be 10 100 times greater than that of wastelands and forests riley 1995 ziegler et al 2000 the associated sediment generation has imposed far reaching effects on regional ecosystems such as land degradation pan et al 2017 water pollution fransen et al 2001 wang et al 2022 and landslide hazards conforti and ietto 2020 he et al 2021 however spoil heaps if reasonably preserved and processed could potentially be utilized as high level construction materials vo et al 2022 strongly motivated by the demands of the sustainable use of resources how to abate spoil heap erosion especially through land reclamation and vegetation restoration has received widespread attention jochimsen 2001 yang et al 2017 lv et al 2020 in particular land reclamation and vegetation restoration of spoil heaps caused by mining activities have become the focus of managers and researchers zhang et al 2015 vidal macua et al 2020 however due to the difference in recovery duration and underlying surface material composition the effect of vegetation restoration differs guo et al 2020 martins et al 2020 previous studies have concentrated more on the benefits of engineering and vegetation measures to control water erosion carroll et al 2000 wu et al 2010 zhao et al 2014 guo et al 2019b while fewer niu et al 2019 yang et al 2019 have been conducted to compare the erosion control efficiency of different vegetation measures which is important for decision making the unique physicochemical characteristics of spoil heaps are the major reasons for their hydrological and erosion processes being largely different and debated compared with other landscapes zhao et al 2012 conducted a field survey in different regions in china to analyse the characteristics of spoil heaps and reported that the typical characteristics of spoil heaps include loose structures without vegetation cover slopes with steeper gradients and shorter lengths and more complex material compositions similar results were also available in other studies e g riley 1995 ziegler et al 2000 peng et al 2014 lv et al 2020 the interactions between those factors in concert with other drivers e g heavy rainfall and overland flow further enhance the complexities of the erosion process of spoil heaps for example li et al 2020a showed that gravel significantly reduced spoil heap erosion while the effect of gravel on soil erosion was found to be dependent on soil texture the gravel characteristics e g size and shape and stacking forms were also found to alter the soil erosion process on spoil heaps in the study by luo et al 2019 and the effects of gravel content on soil erosion tended to be greater than those of gravel fragment size lv et al 2019 studies regarding the efficiency of vegetation measures are currently more concentrated on gentle gravel free slopes several consensuses have been reached that vegetation protects the soil surface from rainfall drop splashing and vegetation decreases detachment of overland flow by reducing flow velocity and by promoting infiltration traoré et al 2000 zhang et al 2012 zhao et al 2014 de almeida et al 2018 however less attention has been given to the protection efficiency of vegetation measures on steep gravel bearing spoil heaps yang et al 2017 2019 quantified the erosion controlling the efficiency of hedgerows on spoil heaps and found that hedgerows reduced the runoff and soil loss of spoil heaps by only 4 60 and 15 50 respectively those benefits were up to 4 times lower than those when hedgerows were deployed on gentle gravel free slopes this difference is perhaps because the slope of spoil heaps is steep and the gravel content is rich a question was raised on whether the sediment reduction effect would be improved if the full slope was covered by vegetation rather than by hedgerows however there has been no quantitative research addressing this question yet how extent and direction the unique characteristics of spoil heaps affect the erosion control efficiency of vegetation is still unclear as is the quantification and comparison of the efficiencies of different vegetation types moreover vannoppen et al 2015 2017 noted that fibrous root systems are more effective in controlling soil loss than are taproot systems and fibrous root systems are the most effective in noncohesive soils while taproot systems are the most effective in cohesive soils however there have been few studies on whether the role of the two root architecture vegetation types under the remodeled underlying surface of spoil heaps is also the same and related research is still weak furthermore the grass root system and canopy have distinct influences on different erosion forms for example grass roots are more effective in controlling rill and gully erosion while canopies are more efficient in preventing interrill and splash detachment gyssels and poesen 2003 the regulation of vegetation on erosion is related to its effects on hydrodynamics and hydraulic parameters e g shear stress stream power and unit stream power are often used to describe erosion dynamics and are key factors in developing erosion prediction models govers et al 1990 guo et al 2020 the correction relationships between soil loss and those parameters are also affected by surface cover such as grass li and pan 2018 zhao et al 2017 gravel bunte and poesen 1993 and other soil and water conservation measures e g dust screen cover blocking dam zhao et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 a previous field rainfall experiment showed that the erosion form of the disturbed underlying surface under vegetation restoration is mainly interrill erosion not gully erosion li et al 2021 however whether the influence of vegetation on hydrodynamic parameters is the key to regulating the runoff sediment relationship on spoil heaps further affecting the soil and water conservation benefits has been less studied the taproot species artemisia gmelinii a gmelinii and fibrous root species cynodon dactylon c dactylon are common grasses widely used in controlling soil erosion on gentle gravel free slopes zhang et al 2012 however their efficiencies and differences in reducing soil erosion on spoil heaps have not yet been thoroughly investigated to address these questions artificial rainfall simulations with different intensities were conducted in runoff plots with treatments of a gmelinii c dactylon and bare soil bs as control and runoff rate flow velocity and sediment yield rate were measured the questions to be answered here were as follows 1 how are hydrological and erosion occurrence and development processes on spoil heaps affected by vegetation measures 2 how do vegetation characteristics affect runoff and hydrodynamic processes and how are the differences in taproot and fibrous root grasses transferred into the differences in runoff and erosion reduction benefits on spoil heaps the results will enhance the understanding of water erosion processes on spoil heaps and provide scientific guidance for selecting erosion control practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the simulation experiments were conducted at the changwu agro ecological experimental station of the chinese academy of sciences on the loess plateau 35 14 23 97 n 107 41 20 27 e the runoff plots were established on valley flat land which was located 0 5 km southeast of the station fig 1 a the study area has a temperate continental monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 9 1 c and the annual rainfall amount is approximately 560 mm most rainfall events occur between may and september and are characterized by short duration and high intensity 2 2 experimental designs and materials three runoff plots with dimensions of 3 4 m 2 0 m 0 6 m length width depth were constructed in february 2019 each plot was divided into two subplots by inserting a steel plate to an underground depth of 60 cm and an aboveground height of 15 cm to minimize the lateral flow the subplots indicate two replicates and the averaged values from both subplots were used for further analysis fig 1b the slope of the constructed runoff plot was designated 30 which is a typical representative of spoil heaps in the field lv et al 2019 niu et al 2020 experimental soil samples were collected from spoil heaps on a highway construction site the collected soils were first air dried and passed through a 10 mm sieve to separate soil particles and gravels and to remove plant residues the obtained soil was classified as a silty loam based on the usda texture classification system us department of agriculture 2010 showing a particle size distribution of 23 4 in 0 002 mm 66 7 in 0 002 0 02 mm and 9 9 in 0 02 2 mm the organic matter of the test soil was 12 1 g kg 1 gravels with sizes ranging from 15 to 25 mm were used and uniformly mixed with soils in this experiment zhao et al 2012 li et al 2021 the designated gravel mass content was 10 according to field investigations and preliminary research results li et al 2020a the mixture of soil and gravel was referred to as the experimental material in this study before filling the experimental materials a 5 cm sand layer was packed onto the bottom of each plot to allow free water drainage experimental materials were filled into the plot to a depth of 55 cm in four layers the first three layers had depths of 15 cm and were manually compacted reaching a bulk density of 1 35 g cm 3 above the three layers a loose layer was packed with a depth of 10 cm to imitate the loose characteristics of natural spoil heaps each soil layer was raked lightly before the next layer was packed to diminish discontinuity between layers the initial bulk density and soil water content were 1 33 0 03 g cm 3 and 19 92 1 65 in bs 1 21 0 05 g cm 3 and 26 11 2 86 in a gmelinii and 1 25 0 04 g cm 3 and 26 92 2 32 in c dactylon the grass coverage for the above three surfaces was 0 80 and 72 respectively grasses with taproot a gmelinii and fibrous root c dactylon systems were used to perform the experiments fig 1d e based on the root architecture vannoppen et al 2017 the considerations here are as follows 1 according to the literature and field investigations a gmelinii and c dactylon are often used as typical vegetation measures for preventing soil erosion zhao et al 2014 guo et al 2019a 2 c dactylon can be used as forage and a gmelinii can be used as medicinal material these grass species have significant economic benefits and are widely distributed in other regions worldwide novák and tóth 2016 biswas et al 2017 3 there are relatively few studies comparing the erosion control efficiency of those two species on spoil heaps based on the existing research results and field surveys the common vegetation planting line spacing is generally between 10 cm and 20 cm and its coverage can exceed 70 li and pan 2018 guo et al 2019b therefore the seeds of these two grass species were planted with a spacing of 15 cm 15 cm then they were left to grow for 6 months the height of each grass species was approximately 20 30 cm and their coverages were approximately 70 80 vegetation coverage was measured by digital image analysis the details of which are presented in wen et al 2009 bare slopes bs gravel content of 10 fig 1f without sowing grass seeds were considered the controls 2 3 rainfall experiments and parameter calculation the rainfall device used to perform the experiment was designated by the institute of soil and water conservation chinese academy of sciences and ministry of water resources fig 1c the rainfall device is composed of a pump inlet pipes valves steel pipes φ 32 mm pressure gauges and two raindrop generators the raindrops falling height was 6 m and the effective rainfall can cover an area of 20 m2 5 m 4 m the raindrop distribution uniformity was 85 the rainfall instrument has been described in detail by wu et al 2014 the selected rainfall intensities of 0 8 1 2 and 1 8 mm min 1 are typical rainfall intensities on the loess plateau chen et al 2018 before each rainfall simulation the rainfall simulator was calibrated by measuring the pressures for different intensities the duration of each rainfall event was 30 min an 8 m high windbreak was set up around the plot to minimize wind disturbances fig 1b in this experiment we had three plot treatments bare plot and two vegetation species and three rainfall intensity treatments each simulation was conducted on one runoff plot containing two subplots therefore each treatment was replicated under each simulated rainfall in fact we analysed the data from the two subplots after each simulation if the data were significantly different between the subplots we conducted one more simulation on these two subplots rainfall simulations were conducted from july to august for each rainfall simulation the procedures were as follows a prerainfall was applied at low intensity 0 5 mm min 1 24 h before the actual rainfall application to ensure a constant initial moisture rainfall intensity was switched to the designated value and calibrated using rainfall gauges once rainfall was generated the initial runoff time irt was recorded by a stopwatch and it was the difference between the beginning of the rainfall event and the time when runoff flowed into the barrel the irt was further used to estimate the delay effect of grass on runoff wilson et al 2004 cerdà et al 2017 yang et al 2019 plastic buckets were used to collect runoff and sediment samples at 1 min intervals sediment samples were transferred to an oven for drying at 105 c over 48 h to determine the soil loss from the plots and then the soil loss amount was calculated the runoff rate rr l min 1 was represented by the runoff depth per unit area and per unit time the soil loss rate slr g m 2 min 1 was represented by the sediment weight per unit area and per unit time which were calculated by eqs 1 and 2 as follows besides the runoff volume reduction rrv and soil loss amount reduction rsla benefits of two grass covered were also calculated by eqs 3 and 4 compared to the bare slope 1 rr q dlt where q m3 is the runoff volume measured at the plot outlet during the given time interval d m is the plot width l m is the plot length and t s is the time at which runoff samples were collected 2 slr m s dlt where ms g is the amount of soil loss during a given time interval 3 r rv 100 r v bs r v grass r v bs 4 r sla 100 sl a bs s l a grass sl a bs where rrv is the reduction in runoff volume by grass and rsla is the reduction in soil loss amount by grass surface flow velocity was measured using a dye tracing method with a digital stopwatch every 1 min the mean flow velocity was calculated by multiplying the surface flow velocity with a correction factor of 0 75 due to the runoff of spoil heaps between laminar and turbulent flows luk and merz 1992 the runoff shear stress pa and darcy weisbach friction factor represented runoff erosion capacity on the slope surface and resistance of the underlying surface to runoff erosion respectively which were calculated by eq 5 and eq 6 nearing et al 1997 knapen et al 2007 as follow 5 τ ρ g h s 6 f 8 g d s v 2 where τ is the shear stress pa ρ is the water density kg m 3 g is the gravitational acceleration m s 2 s is the slope gradient m m and h is the flow depth m the flow depth was determined as follows 7 h q vd where q is the average flow discharge corresponding to the eroded part of the plot m3 s 1 v is the average flow velocity corresponding to q m s 1 and d is the plot width 1 0 m an equivalent weight of silty loam soil was used to refill the eroded surface and then the repaired plots stood for 3 days next rainfall simulation was conducted the difference analysis between the runoff rate soil loss rate saturated hydraulic conductivity mean velocity and stem diameter between different underlying surfaces was conducted by one way anova using spss 16 0 ibm corp armonk ny usa the significance level was set as p 0 05 figures were produced by origin 8 5 software originlab corp northampton ma usa and powerpoint 2016 software 3 results 3 1 characteristics of runoff generation the initial runoff time irts at the a gmelinii c dactylon and bs plots under different rainfall intensities are shown in fig 2 where t1 t2 and t3 represent the irts of bs a gmelinii and c dactylon respectively the irts in the a gmelinii and c dactylon plots were 1 81 3 94 min and 0 69 12 96 min longer than those in the bs plots under different rainfall intensities the irts of c dactylon were 1 5 2 9 times longer than those of bs which were greater than those of the a gmelinii treatment 1 6 2 4 times moreover c dactylon showed greater delay effects on runoff generation than did a gmelinii when rainfall intensities were 0 8 and 1 2 mm min 1 while the opposite trend was observed at 1 8 mm min 1 the irt delay benefits of fibrous root grass 114 5 were 1 4 times that of taproot grass 84 5 based on the results of multiple rainfall events the changes in runoff rate rr over time were significantly different in a gmelinii and c dactylon plots compared with the bs plots fig 2 the rrs of bs sharply increased within the first 10 min and then tended to stabilize in the last 5 min the rrs in the a gmelinii and c dactylon plots gradually increased over time under the three rainfall intensities in most cases the values of rrs in the a gmelinii and c dactylon plots were lower than those in the bs plots indicating that both taproot and fibrous root grasses imposed positive effects on runoff reduction the mean value of rrs in the last 5 min was calculated as the steady runoff rate table 1 shows the steady rrs under the three rainfall intensities the steady rrs significantly increased with increasing rainfall intensity for both grass plots nevertheless there were no significant differences in the steady rrs between the taproot and fibrous root grasses at the three rainfall intensities p 0 05 the steady rrs for a gmelinii decreased by 53 6 35 3 and 44 5 compared with bs while they were 51 7 34 4 and 44 5 for c dactylon under the rainfall intensities of 0 8 1 2 and 1 8 mm min 1 respectively moreover the steady rrs of the two grass plots were significantly different among the three rainfall intensities p 0 05 3 2 characteristics of soil loss the changes in the instantaneous soil loss rate slr over time at the bs a gmelinii and c dactylon plots are shown in fig 3 the variations in slr over time in the bs plots were significantly different from those in the vegetated plots p 0 05 which were also different under the three rainfall intensities in general the slrs in the bs plots increased within the first 10 min and then decreased to relatively constant values over the latter 20 min the slrs in the a gmelinii and c dactylon plots displayed a similar trend that first gradually increased and remained at a low level with some fluctuations over time in most cases the slrs showed an order of bs c dactylon a gmelinii indicating that both kinds of grass had significant effects on reducing the soil loss of spoil heaps p 0 05 and the reduction effect of a gmelinii was higher than that of c dactylon interestingly it was observed that severe soil erosion occurred at the early stage within 10 min in the bs plots while such occurrences of severe soil erosion were not found in the a gmelinii and c dactylon plots in other words grasses were beneficial for minimizing the occurrence of severe soil erosion of spoil heaps i e rill formation and development the mean value of slrs in the last 5 min was calculated as the steady soil loss rate steady slrs significantly increased with increasing rainfall intensity table 1 there were significant differences in the slr between taproot and fibrous root grasses at the three rainfall intensities p 0 05 the steady slr for a gmelinii decreased by 85 9 91 9 and 89 6 compared with bs while the values were 79 2 81 2 and 85 4 for c dactylon under the rainfall intensities of 0 8 1 2 and 1 8 mm min 1 respectively 3 3 benefits of grasses on soil and runoff loss reduction the values of cumulative runoff volume and soil loss amount and the benefits of taproots a gmelinii and fibrous roots c dactylon on soil and runoff reduction are shown in table 2 the runoff volume reduction benefits ranged from 38 3 to 47 9 and the soil loss amount reduction benefits ranged from 87 9 to 95 9 both taproot and fibrous root grasses had greater soil loss amount reduction benefits than runoff volume reduction the average benefits of soil loss amount reduction 91 1 were approximately 2 2 times the runoff volume reduction benefits 42 1 additionally the differences in runoff volume reduction benefits were slight between the a gmelinii and c dactylon plots with mean benefits of 42 3 and 41 9 respectively there was a greater difference between a gmelinii 93 7 and c dactylon 88 5 in terms of soil loss reduction benefits and taproot grass was more efficient in controlling soil loss meanwhile there was no consistent relationship between runoff volume reduction and soil loss amount reduction benefits with rainfall intensity 4 discussion 4 1 hydrological responses to different vegetation types on the spoil heaps our study showed that the taproot and fibrous root grass affected both the generation and the development processes of runoff the irt of grass covered plots was 1 5 2 9 times longer than that of bare plots similar results have been reported previously and the reasons were twofold wilson et al 2004 cerdà et al 2017 on the one hand vegetation stems enhance rainwater infiltration inside spoil heaps and increase the tortuosity of runoff thereby delaying runoff generation wang et al 2021 moreover the root systems of grass promote the development of pores inside spoil heaps which therefore increase storage space and infiltration in grass covered plots xia et al 2015 vannoppen et al 2017 fig 4 a shows that the saturated hydraulic conductivity measured by the constant head method zhu et al 2022 of the a gmelinii and c dactylon plots increased by 239 3 and 242 9 compared to that of the bare plots respectively and there were significant differences between the grass plots and the bs plots p 0 05 on the other hand the mechanical blocking effects of the grass stem and leaf layer can intercept and retain a portion of water as well as decrease runoff velocity zhao et al 2017 we also noted that the delay effects on the irt were greater under rainfall intensities of 0 8 and 1 2 mm min 1 than under the intensity of 1 8 mm min 1 for c dactylon while opposite trends were observed for a gmelinii the delay effects at grass covered plots in our study were less pronounced than those in some other studies at similar research sites for example yang et al 2019 conducted a scouring erosion experiment on the slopes of the loess plateau china and found that the irts of hedgerow plots were 3 times longer than those of bare slopes this difference is likely attributed to the difference in vegetation types and spatial patterns more importantly in the runoff generation methods i e rainfall simulation vs pipe generated runoff pan and ma 2020 both taproot and fibrous root grasses affected runoff processes though they showed no significant differences p 0 05 table 1 in fig 2 the instantaneous rrs in the bs a gmelinii and c dactylon plots were compared the most conspicuous was the greatest rr in the bs plots this result is expected since vegetation and surface litter and intercept and retain a portion of water and by slow runoff to promote runoff infiltration wang and zhang 2017 it was also observed that the rr in the bs plots displayed greater variations than that in the a gmelinii and c dactylon plots it has been documented that surface roughness affects runoff processes rahma et al 2019 for example roughness elements e g rock fragments increase hydraulic resistance to retard water travel at the plot level furthermore roughness elements such as surface depressions retain and store water and decrease runoff connectivity li et al 2020b in our study the experimental soil contained 10 gravel mass as rainfall was simulated gravel fragments accumulated in the soil profile and small depressions formed on the soil surface due to the removal of finer surface materials in the bs plots wherein vegetation protection was lacking instantaneously affecting the soil surface microtopography and runoff generation processes meanwhile as the depressions were filled by water and rock fragments and inundated by runoff runoff connectivity increased again therefore a loop where a depression was formed and then filled was expected hence the rr in the bs plots exhibited large variations it is worth nothing that the rrs at the taproot and fibrous root grasses in most cases were not significantly different p 0 05 this result is likely to be linked to the size and spatial pattern of the vegetation stems that changed the flow tortuosity and stem flow and the thickness of the surface little layer that stored water though this process requires further research the saturated hydraulic conductivities of a gmelinii 18 66 mm s 1 and c dactylon 18 86 mm s 1 were similar fig 4a which is also an important reason for the insignificant difference in their rrs in this paper the grasses decreased the cumulative runoff volume by 38 3 47 9 which not only decreased the values of runoff volume but also reduced their fluctuations making them more stable fig 2 this result is consistent with a previous study but the magnitude and extent of the reduction in cumulative runoff volume by grasses were different from those in other studies for example zhao et al 2014 showed that lolium perenne and medicago sativa decreased the rr by 61 6 69 5 in a rainfall simulation experiment wu et al 2010 found that the regulated vegetation measures reduced the runoff volume from 74 to 7 1 as the discharge flow decreased different vegetation patterns decreased the runoff volume of the spoil heaps by 12 23 49 62 lou et al 2019 those differences may be caused by the differences in experimental methods vegetation types xia et al 2015 and research objects yang et al 2017 peng et al 2018 chehlafi et al 2019 for example gan et al 2010 showed that lolium perenne l had a higher runoff reduction effect 65 than onobrychis viciaefolia scop 45 during the last stage through simulated rainfall experiments xia et al 2015 showed that the reduction benefit of runoff volume in a mixed plant plot of grasses and shrubs 68 was significantly higher than that of shrubs alone 5 and grasses alone 65 4 2 effects of grasses on the erosion process of spoil heaps the variation in the slr over time under the bs treatment was significantly different from that under the grass treatment at the three rainfall intensities specifically the slrs under grass treatments remained at low levels as rainfall was simulated while the slrs at the bs plots first increased and then decreased a lack of vegetation protection resulted in severe erosion at the bs plots at an early stage hence the slrs at the bs plots first increased at the same time rock fragments in the soil profile were excavated and accumulated on the soil surface during the erosion processes nearing et al 2017 the accumulated rock fragments on the one hand protected the soil from overland detachment and rainfall splashing while on the other hand restricted the supply of fine materials that could be transported and detached by the overland flow hence decreasing slrs were observed over time li et al 2020c in the grass plots rock fragment excavation and accumulation were much less pronounced due to vegetation protection in most cases the slrs showed the order of bs c dactylon a gmelinii suggesting that a gmelinii had a greater soil loss reduction than c dactylon for a better understanding of how the difference between taproot and fibrous root grasses was transferred into the soil reduction efficiency different hydraulic parameters were tested and linked with sediment yield it was also found that hydraulic shear stress could well predict the slr in the a gmelinii and c dactylon plots following a power function with coefficients of determination equal to 0 72 and 0 85 respectively fig 5 fig 5 indicates that for a given runoff hydraulic shear stress more soils were detached in the c dactylon plots than in the a gmelinii plots this is perhaps because the effective hydraulic shear stress that was directly exerted on soil particles in the c dactylon plots was greater the effective shear stress which is the portion of flow energy that is directly dissipated on the soil particles should be separated from the total shear stress for predicting soil loss which is calculated by the ratio of the friction factor for the bare soil fs to the total friction factor for the composite surface ftot according to li et al 2020b the effective shear stress can be calculated as follows 8 τ effective τ total f s f tot ρ g d s f s 8 g d s v 2 ρ f s v 2 8 therefore the effective hydraulic shear stress is a function of fs and the mean flow velocity because we did not measure the friction factor that directly affects bare soil it might be reasonable to assume fs is a constant value if following the routine in the study of gilley et al 1990 therefore the effective hydraulic shear stress was mainly affected by the flow velocity fig 4b shows the mean velocity of the a gmelinii c dactylon and bs plots the results showed that the average velocity showed the order of bs c dactylon and a gmelinii the average velocities of bs a gmelinii and c dactylon under the three rainfall intensities were 0 09 0 06 and 0 04 m s 1 respectively and c dactylon and a gmelinii reduced the average velocity benefits by 33 3 and 55 6 respectively the taproot grasses had a more positive effect on controlling the flow velocity than did the fibrous root grasses it was found that the flow velocity in the c dactylon plots was much greater than that in the a gmelinii plots hence resulting in greater effective hydraulic shear stress based on eq 8 another question raised was why the flow velocity in the c dactylon plots was greater than that in the a gmelinii plots this difference is attributed to different hydraulic resistances hydraulic resistance is a composite parameter describing the retarding effects of roughness elements on water flow and is affected by soil surface macrovariation skin roughness random roughness and form roughness li et al 2020c abrahams et al 1992 conducted a study in a semiarid environment and evaluated the overland flow hydraulic over stony plots the authors separated the flow hydraulic resistance into rainfall resistance form resistance and wave resistance the authors reported that form resistance was positively related to roughness size and cover given that the coverage of the a gmelinii and c dactylon plots was similar the differences in the hydraulic resistance in the a gmelinii and c dactylon plots were mainly attributed to the differences in the roughness size fig 6 shows the comparison of stem diameter between the a gmelinii and c dactylon plots p 0 05 and the a gmelinii grass exhibited a greater stem diameter than the c dactylon plots hence providing greater form resistance moreover for the special underlying surface of the spoil heaps due to the loose structure lack of organic matter and poor cohesion the root system of the taproot vegetation is thicker and can penetrate deeper into the soil structure which can strengthen the consolidation of the internal soil particles the fibrous root system as the root system is generally distributed in the shallow layer of the soil can play a protective role only on the surface soil this is also consistent with the actual situation of the project therefore due to the greater stem diameter the taproot grass showed greater hydraulic resistance and form resistance and hence it had lower flow velocity consequently resulting in a lower effective hydraulic shear stress directly exerted on soil particles and thus a lower slr 4 3 implications and limitations of this study vegetation can significantly change the hydrological and erosion processes on slopes and plays an important role in the runoff sediment relationship and the benefits of water storage and sediment reduction nevertheless little research has been conducted to investigate whether vegetation can still play a significant role in reducing sediment and runoff on reshaped spoil heaps with loose material compositions and steep slopes therefore this research focused on comparing the hydrological and erosion responses on steep spoil heaps to two typical vegetation species artemisia gmelinii a gmelinii and cynodon dactylon c dactylon through field simulated rainfall tests the results showed that the difference in taproot and fibrous root grasses could transfer into the difference in runoff and erosion reduction benefits on spoil heaps this result can provide an important theoretical and practical basis for decision makers when implementing vegetation restoration projects however some potential limitations still existed in this study first whether the planting density and row spacing of vegetation will have a significant impact on the regulation of runoff and sediment yield on spoil heaps is still unknown second this article selected two vegetation types for comparison and comparisons among other vegetation types should be investigated in a follow up study nevertheless taproot system grasses are recommended as the dominant grass for the vegetation restoration of spoil heaps because of their erosion control benefits 5 conclusions a series of field rainfall experiments were conducted to reveal the various effects of taproot and fibrous grasses on the hydrological and sediment yield processes and soil and water loss reduction on spoil heaps the major conclusions were as follows 1 both taproot and fibrous grasses significantly decreased the runoff rate and sediment yield on spoil heaps and the benefits of soil loss amount reduction by grasses 91 1 were approximately 2 2 times those of runoff 42 1 2 shear stress could well predict soil sediment yield following power functions with coefficients of determination equal to 0 72 and 0 85 for artemisia gmelinii and cynodon dactylon respectively 3 compared to fibrous grasses the taproot grass in the present study exhibited greater sediment yield reduction benefits which was attributed to its greater diameter and associated greater form and hydraulic roughness that consequently caused lower effective hydraulic shear stress for detaching soil particles therefore taproot grass is recommended for further control practices on spoil heaps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

2191,spoil heaps resulting from excavation and backfilling activities at construction sites are one of the most important risk sources of soil erosion threatening local ecosystems and even leading to geological disasters however after revegetation spoil heaps can be transformed into available land resources such as cultivated land and forest land previous studies have reported the runoff and sediment reduction benefits of different vegetation measures on spoil heaps while little information has been documented about what differences in the taproot and fibrous root grasses were transferred into the differences in hydrological and erosion processes this study compared the effects of taproot artemisia gmelinii a gmelinii and fibrous root cynodon dactylon c dactylon grasses on soil erosion and runoff production processes and the reduction benefits of spoil heaps with silt loam soil a series of rainfall events at three intensities 0 8 1 2 and 1 8 mm min 1 were simulated on runoff plots length of 3 0 m and width of 1 0 m under treatments of a gmelinii c dactylon and bare soil bs as control each treatment was replicated and the initial runoff time irt saturated hydraulic conductivity runoff rate rr flow velocity and soil loss rate slr were measured the results showed that grasses delayed the irts on spoil heaps by 0 69 12 96 min compared bs and the delay effects were more significant for fibrous root grass than for taproot grass the soil loss reduction benefits 91 1 of the two kinds of grass were approximately 2 2 times greater than those of runoff volume reduction 42 1 and shear stress could be used to predict the soil loss rate following power functions r2 0 72 0 85 for the grass covered plots the taproot grass exhibited a higher erosion reduction than fibrous root grass and is thus preferred to control the soil erosion of spoil heaps taproot grass has a greater stem diameter and can insert deeper into spoil heaps to consolidate the soil particles which can improve roughness and hydraulic resistance thereby producing a lower effective hydraulic shear stress that is directly exerted on soil particles this study enhances the understanding of different grasses on the water erosion process and mechanism of spoil heaps and provides scientific guidance for selecting erosion control practices keywords spoil heaps soil erosion runoff generation vegetation benefits stem diameter effective hydraulic shear stress data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction spoil heaps are slopes formed by the pile up of excess soil rock mixtures resulting from excavation and backfilling activities at construction sites lv et al 2019 yang et al 2019 and spoil heaps often feature loose soil structures steep slopes low vegetation cover and rich rock fragment contents li et al 2021 the accumulation of spoil heaps shows a dramatic increasing trend especially in some developing and developed countries wherein production and construction activities have notoriously intensified in recent decades rydgren et al 2011 guo et al 2020 driven by the external agents of water gravity and wind these soil rock mixtures are easily detached and transported off site the soil loss rate or erodibility of spoil heaps can be 10 100 times greater than that of wastelands and forests riley 1995 ziegler et al 2000 the associated sediment generation has imposed far reaching effects on regional ecosystems such as land degradation pan et al 2017 water pollution fransen et al 2001 wang et al 2022 and landslide hazards conforti and ietto 2020 he et al 2021 however spoil heaps if reasonably preserved and processed could potentially be utilized as high level construction materials vo et al 2022 strongly motivated by the demands of the sustainable use of resources how to abate spoil heap erosion especially through land reclamation and vegetation restoration has received widespread attention jochimsen 2001 yang et al 2017 lv et al 2020 in particular land reclamation and vegetation restoration of spoil heaps caused by mining activities have become the focus of managers and researchers zhang et al 2015 vidal macua et al 2020 however due to the difference in recovery duration and underlying surface material composition the effect of vegetation restoration differs guo et al 2020 martins et al 2020 previous studies have concentrated more on the benefits of engineering and vegetation measures to control water erosion carroll et al 2000 wu et al 2010 zhao et al 2014 guo et al 2019b while fewer niu et al 2019 yang et al 2019 have been conducted to compare the erosion control efficiency of different vegetation measures which is important for decision making the unique physicochemical characteristics of spoil heaps are the major reasons for their hydrological and erosion processes being largely different and debated compared with other landscapes zhao et al 2012 conducted a field survey in different regions in china to analyse the characteristics of spoil heaps and reported that the typical characteristics of spoil heaps include loose structures without vegetation cover slopes with steeper gradients and shorter lengths and more complex material compositions similar results were also available in other studies e g riley 1995 ziegler et al 2000 peng et al 2014 lv et al 2020 the interactions between those factors in concert with other drivers e g heavy rainfall and overland flow further enhance the complexities of the erosion process of spoil heaps for example li et al 2020a showed that gravel significantly reduced spoil heap erosion while the effect of gravel on soil erosion was found to be dependent on soil texture the gravel characteristics e g size and shape and stacking forms were also found to alter the soil erosion process on spoil heaps in the study by luo et al 2019 and the effects of gravel content on soil erosion tended to be greater than those of gravel fragment size lv et al 2019 studies regarding the efficiency of vegetation measures are currently more concentrated on gentle gravel free slopes several consensuses have been reached that vegetation protects the soil surface from rainfall drop splashing and vegetation decreases detachment of overland flow by reducing flow velocity and by promoting infiltration traoré et al 2000 zhang et al 2012 zhao et al 2014 de almeida et al 2018 however less attention has been given to the protection efficiency of vegetation measures on steep gravel bearing spoil heaps yang et al 2017 2019 quantified the erosion controlling the efficiency of hedgerows on spoil heaps and found that hedgerows reduced the runoff and soil loss of spoil heaps by only 4 60 and 15 50 respectively those benefits were up to 4 times lower than those when hedgerows were deployed on gentle gravel free slopes this difference is perhaps because the slope of spoil heaps is steep and the gravel content is rich a question was raised on whether the sediment reduction effect would be improved if the full slope was covered by vegetation rather than by hedgerows however there has been no quantitative research addressing this question yet how extent and direction the unique characteristics of spoil heaps affect the erosion control efficiency of vegetation is still unclear as is the quantification and comparison of the efficiencies of different vegetation types moreover vannoppen et al 2015 2017 noted that fibrous root systems are more effective in controlling soil loss than are taproot systems and fibrous root systems are the most effective in noncohesive soils while taproot systems are the most effective in cohesive soils however there have been few studies on whether the role of the two root architecture vegetation types under the remodeled underlying surface of spoil heaps is also the same and related research is still weak furthermore the grass root system and canopy have distinct influences on different erosion forms for example grass roots are more effective in controlling rill and gully erosion while canopies are more efficient in preventing interrill and splash detachment gyssels and poesen 2003 the regulation of vegetation on erosion is related to its effects on hydrodynamics and hydraulic parameters e g shear stress stream power and unit stream power are often used to describe erosion dynamics and are key factors in developing erosion prediction models govers et al 1990 guo et al 2020 the correction relationships between soil loss and those parameters are also affected by surface cover such as grass li and pan 2018 zhao et al 2017 gravel bunte and poesen 1993 and other soil and water conservation measures e g dust screen cover blocking dam zhao et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 a previous field rainfall experiment showed that the erosion form of the disturbed underlying surface under vegetation restoration is mainly interrill erosion not gully erosion li et al 2021 however whether the influence of vegetation on hydrodynamic parameters is the key to regulating the runoff sediment relationship on spoil heaps further affecting the soil and water conservation benefits has been less studied the taproot species artemisia gmelinii a gmelinii and fibrous root species cynodon dactylon c dactylon are common grasses widely used in controlling soil erosion on gentle gravel free slopes zhang et al 2012 however their efficiencies and differences in reducing soil erosion on spoil heaps have not yet been thoroughly investigated to address these questions artificial rainfall simulations with different intensities were conducted in runoff plots with treatments of a gmelinii c dactylon and bare soil bs as control and runoff rate flow velocity and sediment yield rate were measured the questions to be answered here were as follows 1 how are hydrological and erosion occurrence and development processes on spoil heaps affected by vegetation measures 2 how do vegetation characteristics affect runoff and hydrodynamic processes and how are the differences in taproot and fibrous root grasses transferred into the differences in runoff and erosion reduction benefits on spoil heaps the results will enhance the understanding of water erosion processes on spoil heaps and provide scientific guidance for selecting erosion control practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the simulation experiments were conducted at the changwu agro ecological experimental station of the chinese academy of sciences on the loess plateau 35 14 23 97 n 107 41 20 27 e the runoff plots were established on valley flat land which was located 0 5 km southeast of the station fig 1 a the study area has a temperate continental monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 9 1 c and the annual rainfall amount is approximately 560 mm most rainfall events occur between may and september and are characterized by short duration and high intensity 2 2 experimental designs and materials three runoff plots with dimensions of 3 4 m 2 0 m 0 6 m length width depth were constructed in february 2019 each plot was divided into two subplots by inserting a steel plate to an underground depth of 60 cm and an aboveground height of 15 cm to minimize the lateral flow the subplots indicate two replicates and the averaged values from both subplots were used for further analysis fig 1b the slope of the constructed runoff plot was designated 30 which is a typical representative of spoil heaps in the field lv et al 2019 niu et al 2020 experimental soil samples were collected from spoil heaps on a highway construction site the collected soils were first air dried and passed through a 10 mm sieve to separate soil particles and gravels and to remove plant residues the obtained soil was classified as a silty loam based on the usda texture classification system us department of agriculture 2010 showing a particle size distribution of 23 4 in 0 002 mm 66 7 in 0 002 0 02 mm and 9 9 in 0 02 2 mm the organic matter of the test soil was 12 1 g kg 1 gravels with sizes ranging from 15 to 25 mm were used and uniformly mixed with soils in this experiment zhao et al 2012 li et al 2021 the designated gravel mass content was 10 according to field investigations and preliminary research results li et al 2020a the mixture of soil and gravel was referred to as the experimental material in this study before filling the experimental materials a 5 cm sand layer was packed onto the bottom of each plot to allow free water drainage experimental materials were filled into the plot to a depth of 55 cm in four layers the first three layers had depths of 15 cm and were manually compacted reaching a bulk density of 1 35 g cm 3 above the three layers a loose layer was packed with a depth of 10 cm to imitate the loose characteristics of natural spoil heaps each soil layer was raked lightly before the next layer was packed to diminish discontinuity between layers the initial bulk density and soil water content were 1 33 0 03 g cm 3 and 19 92 1 65 in bs 1 21 0 05 g cm 3 and 26 11 2 86 in a gmelinii and 1 25 0 04 g cm 3 and 26 92 2 32 in c dactylon the grass coverage for the above three surfaces was 0 80 and 72 respectively grasses with taproot a gmelinii and fibrous root c dactylon systems were used to perform the experiments fig 1d e based on the root architecture vannoppen et al 2017 the considerations here are as follows 1 according to the literature and field investigations a gmelinii and c dactylon are often used as typical vegetation measures for preventing soil erosion zhao et al 2014 guo et al 2019a 2 c dactylon can be used as forage and a gmelinii can be used as medicinal material these grass species have significant economic benefits and are widely distributed in other regions worldwide novák and tóth 2016 biswas et al 2017 3 there are relatively few studies comparing the erosion control efficiency of those two species on spoil heaps based on the existing research results and field surveys the common vegetation planting line spacing is generally between 10 cm and 20 cm and its coverage can exceed 70 li and pan 2018 guo et al 2019b therefore the seeds of these two grass species were planted with a spacing of 15 cm 15 cm then they were left to grow for 6 months the height of each grass species was approximately 20 30 cm and their coverages were approximately 70 80 vegetation coverage was measured by digital image analysis the details of which are presented in wen et al 2009 bare slopes bs gravel content of 10 fig 1f without sowing grass seeds were considered the controls 2 3 rainfall experiments and parameter calculation the rainfall device used to perform the experiment was designated by the institute of soil and water conservation chinese academy of sciences and ministry of water resources fig 1c the rainfall device is composed of a pump inlet pipes valves steel pipes φ 32 mm pressure gauges and two raindrop generators the raindrops falling height was 6 m and the effective rainfall can cover an area of 20 m2 5 m 4 m the raindrop distribution uniformity was 85 the rainfall instrument has been described in detail by wu et al 2014 the selected rainfall intensities of 0 8 1 2 and 1 8 mm min 1 are typical rainfall intensities on the loess plateau chen et al 2018 before each rainfall simulation the rainfall simulator was calibrated by measuring the pressures for different intensities the duration of each rainfall event was 30 min an 8 m high windbreak was set up around the plot to minimize wind disturbances fig 1b in this experiment we had three plot treatments bare plot and two vegetation species and three rainfall intensity treatments each simulation was conducted on one runoff plot containing two subplots therefore each treatment was replicated under each simulated rainfall in fact we analysed the data from the two subplots after each simulation if the data were significantly different between the subplots we conducted one more simulation on these two subplots rainfall simulations were conducted from july to august for each rainfall simulation the procedures were as follows a prerainfall was applied at low intensity 0 5 mm min 1 24 h before the actual rainfall application to ensure a constant initial moisture rainfall intensity was switched to the designated value and calibrated using rainfall gauges once rainfall was generated the initial runoff time irt was recorded by a stopwatch and it was the difference between the beginning of the rainfall event and the time when runoff flowed into the barrel the irt was further used to estimate the delay effect of grass on runoff wilson et al 2004 cerdà et al 2017 yang et al 2019 plastic buckets were used to collect runoff and sediment samples at 1 min intervals sediment samples were transferred to an oven for drying at 105 c over 48 h to determine the soil loss from the plots and then the soil loss amount was calculated the runoff rate rr l min 1 was represented by the runoff depth per unit area and per unit time the soil loss rate slr g m 2 min 1 was represented by the sediment weight per unit area and per unit time which were calculated by eqs 1 and 2 as follows besides the runoff volume reduction rrv and soil loss amount reduction rsla benefits of two grass covered were also calculated by eqs 3 and 4 compared to the bare slope 1 rr q dlt where q m3 is the runoff volume measured at the plot outlet during the given time interval d m is the plot width l m is the plot length and t s is the time at which runoff samples were collected 2 slr m s dlt where ms g is the amount of soil loss during a given time interval 3 r rv 100 r v bs r v grass r v bs 4 r sla 100 sl a bs s l a grass sl a bs where rrv is the reduction in runoff volume by grass and rsla is the reduction in soil loss amount by grass surface flow velocity was measured using a dye tracing method with a digital stopwatch every 1 min the mean flow velocity was calculated by multiplying the surface flow velocity with a correction factor of 0 75 due to the runoff of spoil heaps between laminar and turbulent flows luk and merz 1992 the runoff shear stress pa and darcy weisbach friction factor represented runoff erosion capacity on the slope surface and resistance of the underlying surface to runoff erosion respectively which were calculated by eq 5 and eq 6 nearing et al 1997 knapen et al 2007 as follow 5 τ ρ g h s 6 f 8 g d s v 2 where τ is the shear stress pa ρ is the water density kg m 3 g is the gravitational acceleration m s 2 s is the slope gradient m m and h is the flow depth m the flow depth was determined as follows 7 h q vd where q is the average flow discharge corresponding to the eroded part of the plot m3 s 1 v is the average flow velocity corresponding to q m s 1 and d is the plot width 1 0 m an equivalent weight of silty loam soil was used to refill the eroded surface and then the repaired plots stood for 3 days next rainfall simulation was conducted the difference analysis between the runoff rate soil loss rate saturated hydraulic conductivity mean velocity and stem diameter between different underlying surfaces was conducted by one way anova using spss 16 0 ibm corp armonk ny usa the significance level was set as p 0 05 figures were produced by origin 8 5 software originlab corp northampton ma usa and powerpoint 2016 software 3 results 3 1 characteristics of runoff generation the initial runoff time irts at the a gmelinii c dactylon and bs plots under different rainfall intensities are shown in fig 2 where t1 t2 and t3 represent the irts of bs a gmelinii and c dactylon respectively the irts in the a gmelinii and c dactylon plots were 1 81 3 94 min and 0 69 12 96 min longer than those in the bs plots under different rainfall intensities the irts of c dactylon were 1 5 2 9 times longer than those of bs which were greater than those of the a gmelinii treatment 1 6 2 4 times moreover c dactylon showed greater delay effects on runoff generation than did a gmelinii when rainfall intensities were 0 8 and 1 2 mm min 1 while the opposite trend was observed at 1 8 mm min 1 the irt delay benefits of fibrous root grass 114 5 were 1 4 times that of taproot grass 84 5 based on the results of multiple rainfall events the changes in runoff rate rr over time were significantly different in a gmelinii and c dactylon plots compared with the bs plots fig 2 the rrs of bs sharply increased within the first 10 min and then tended to stabilize in the last 5 min the rrs in the a gmelinii and c dactylon plots gradually increased over time under the three rainfall intensities in most cases the values of rrs in the a gmelinii and c dactylon plots were lower than those in the bs plots indicating that both taproot and fibrous root grasses imposed positive effects on runoff reduction the mean value of rrs in the last 5 min was calculated as the steady runoff rate table 1 shows the steady rrs under the three rainfall intensities the steady rrs significantly increased with increasing rainfall intensity for both grass plots nevertheless there were no significant differences in the steady rrs between the taproot and fibrous root grasses at the three rainfall intensities p 0 05 the steady rrs for a gmelinii decreased by 53 6 35 3 and 44 5 compared with bs while they were 51 7 34 4 and 44 5 for c dactylon under the rainfall intensities of 0 8 1 2 and 1 8 mm min 1 respectively moreover the steady rrs of the two grass plots were significantly different among the three rainfall intensities p 0 05 3 2 characteristics of soil loss the changes in the instantaneous soil loss rate slr over time at the bs a gmelinii and c dactylon plots are shown in fig 3 the variations in slr over time in the bs plots were significantly different from those in the vegetated plots p 0 05 which were also different under the three rainfall intensities in general the slrs in the bs plots increased within the first 10 min and then decreased to relatively constant values over the latter 20 min the slrs in the a gmelinii and c dactylon plots displayed a similar trend that first gradually increased and remained at a low level with some fluctuations over time in most cases the slrs showed an order of bs c dactylon a gmelinii indicating that both kinds of grass had significant effects on reducing the soil loss of spoil heaps p 0 05 and the reduction effect of a gmelinii was higher than that of c dactylon interestingly it was observed that severe soil erosion occurred at the early stage within 10 min in the bs plots while such occurrences of severe soil erosion were not found in the a gmelinii and c dactylon plots in other words grasses were beneficial for minimizing the occurrence of severe soil erosion of spoil heaps i e rill formation and development the mean value of slrs in the last 5 min was calculated as the steady soil loss rate steady slrs significantly increased with increasing rainfall intensity table 1 there were significant differences in the slr between taproot and fibrous root grasses at the three rainfall intensities p 0 05 the steady slr for a gmelinii decreased by 85 9 91 9 and 89 6 compared with bs while the values were 79 2 81 2 and 85 4 for c dactylon under the rainfall intensities of 0 8 1 2 and 1 8 mm min 1 respectively 3 3 benefits of grasses on soil and runoff loss reduction the values of cumulative runoff volume and soil loss amount and the benefits of taproots a gmelinii and fibrous roots c dactylon on soil and runoff reduction are shown in table 2 the runoff volume reduction benefits ranged from 38 3 to 47 9 and the soil loss amount reduction benefits ranged from 87 9 to 95 9 both taproot and fibrous root grasses had greater soil loss amount reduction benefits than runoff volume reduction the average benefits of soil loss amount reduction 91 1 were approximately 2 2 times the runoff volume reduction benefits 42 1 additionally the differences in runoff volume reduction benefits were slight between the a gmelinii and c dactylon plots with mean benefits of 42 3 and 41 9 respectively there was a greater difference between a gmelinii 93 7 and c dactylon 88 5 in terms of soil loss reduction benefits and taproot grass was more efficient in controlling soil loss meanwhile there was no consistent relationship between runoff volume reduction and soil loss amount reduction benefits with rainfall intensity 4 discussion 4 1 hydrological responses to different vegetation types on the spoil heaps our study showed that the taproot and fibrous root grass affected both the generation and the development processes of runoff the irt of grass covered plots was 1 5 2 9 times longer than that of bare plots similar results have been reported previously and the reasons were twofold wilson et al 2004 cerdà et al 2017 on the one hand vegetation stems enhance rainwater infiltration inside spoil heaps and increase the tortuosity of runoff thereby delaying runoff generation wang et al 2021 moreover the root systems of grass promote the development of pores inside spoil heaps which therefore increase storage space and infiltration in grass covered plots xia et al 2015 vannoppen et al 2017 fig 4 a shows that the saturated hydraulic conductivity measured by the constant head method zhu et al 2022 of the a gmelinii and c dactylon plots increased by 239 3 and 242 9 compared to that of the bare plots respectively and there were significant differences between the grass plots and the bs plots p 0 05 on the other hand the mechanical blocking effects of the grass stem and leaf layer can intercept and retain a portion of water as well as decrease runoff velocity zhao et al 2017 we also noted that the delay effects on the irt were greater under rainfall intensities of 0 8 and 1 2 mm min 1 than under the intensity of 1 8 mm min 1 for c dactylon while opposite trends were observed for a gmelinii the delay effects at grass covered plots in our study were less pronounced than those in some other studies at similar research sites for example yang et al 2019 conducted a scouring erosion experiment on the slopes of the loess plateau china and found that the irts of hedgerow plots were 3 times longer than those of bare slopes this difference is likely attributed to the difference in vegetation types and spatial patterns more importantly in the runoff generation methods i e rainfall simulation vs pipe generated runoff pan and ma 2020 both taproot and fibrous root grasses affected runoff processes though they showed no significant differences p 0 05 table 1 in fig 2 the instantaneous rrs in the bs a gmelinii and c dactylon plots were compared the most conspicuous was the greatest rr in the bs plots this result is expected since vegetation and surface litter and intercept and retain a portion of water and by slow runoff to promote runoff infiltration wang and zhang 2017 it was also observed that the rr in the bs plots displayed greater variations than that in the a gmelinii and c dactylon plots it has been documented that surface roughness affects runoff processes rahma et al 2019 for example roughness elements e g rock fragments increase hydraulic resistance to retard water travel at the plot level furthermore roughness elements such as surface depressions retain and store water and decrease runoff connectivity li et al 2020b in our study the experimental soil contained 10 gravel mass as rainfall was simulated gravel fragments accumulated in the soil profile and small depressions formed on the soil surface due to the removal of finer surface materials in the bs plots wherein vegetation protection was lacking instantaneously affecting the soil surface microtopography and runoff generation processes meanwhile as the depressions were filled by water and rock fragments and inundated by runoff runoff connectivity increased again therefore a loop where a depression was formed and then filled was expected hence the rr in the bs plots exhibited large variations it is worth nothing that the rrs at the taproot and fibrous root grasses in most cases were not significantly different p 0 05 this result is likely to be linked to the size and spatial pattern of the vegetation stems that changed the flow tortuosity and stem flow and the thickness of the surface little layer that stored water though this process requires further research the saturated hydraulic conductivities of a gmelinii 18 66 mm s 1 and c dactylon 18 86 mm s 1 were similar fig 4a which is also an important reason for the insignificant difference in their rrs in this paper the grasses decreased the cumulative runoff volume by 38 3 47 9 which not only decreased the values of runoff volume but also reduced their fluctuations making them more stable fig 2 this result is consistent with a previous study but the magnitude and extent of the reduction in cumulative runoff volume by grasses were different from those in other studies for example zhao et al 2014 showed that lolium perenne and medicago sativa decreased the rr by 61 6 69 5 in a rainfall simulation experiment wu et al 2010 found that the regulated vegetation measures reduced the runoff volume from 74 to 7 1 as the discharge flow decreased different vegetation patterns decreased the runoff volume of the spoil heaps by 12 23 49 62 lou et al 2019 those differences may be caused by the differences in experimental methods vegetation types xia et al 2015 and research objects yang et al 2017 peng et al 2018 chehlafi et al 2019 for example gan et al 2010 showed that lolium perenne l had a higher runoff reduction effect 65 than onobrychis viciaefolia scop 45 during the last stage through simulated rainfall experiments xia et al 2015 showed that the reduction benefit of runoff volume in a mixed plant plot of grasses and shrubs 68 was significantly higher than that of shrubs alone 5 and grasses alone 65 4 2 effects of grasses on the erosion process of spoil heaps the variation in the slr over time under the bs treatment was significantly different from that under the grass treatment at the three rainfall intensities specifically the slrs under grass treatments remained at low levels as rainfall was simulated while the slrs at the bs plots first increased and then decreased a lack of vegetation protection resulted in severe erosion at the bs plots at an early stage hence the slrs at the bs plots first increased at the same time rock fragments in the soil profile were excavated and accumulated on the soil surface during the erosion processes nearing et al 2017 the accumulated rock fragments on the one hand protected the soil from overland detachment and rainfall splashing while on the other hand restricted the supply of fine materials that could be transported and detached by the overland flow hence decreasing slrs were observed over time li et al 2020c in the grass plots rock fragment excavation and accumulation were much less pronounced due to vegetation protection in most cases the slrs showed the order of bs c dactylon a gmelinii suggesting that a gmelinii had a greater soil loss reduction than c dactylon for a better understanding of how the difference between taproot and fibrous root grasses was transferred into the soil reduction efficiency different hydraulic parameters were tested and linked with sediment yield it was also found that hydraulic shear stress could well predict the slr in the a gmelinii and c dactylon plots following a power function with coefficients of determination equal to 0 72 and 0 85 respectively fig 5 fig 5 indicates that for a given runoff hydraulic shear stress more soils were detached in the c dactylon plots than in the a gmelinii plots this is perhaps because the effective hydraulic shear stress that was directly exerted on soil particles in the c dactylon plots was greater the effective shear stress which is the portion of flow energy that is directly dissipated on the soil particles should be separated from the total shear stress for predicting soil loss which is calculated by the ratio of the friction factor for the bare soil fs to the total friction factor for the composite surface ftot according to li et al 2020b the effective shear stress can be calculated as follows 8 τ effective τ total f s f tot ρ g d s f s 8 g d s v 2 ρ f s v 2 8 therefore the effective hydraulic shear stress is a function of fs and the mean flow velocity because we did not measure the friction factor that directly affects bare soil it might be reasonable to assume fs is a constant value if following the routine in the study of gilley et al 1990 therefore the effective hydraulic shear stress was mainly affected by the flow velocity fig 4b shows the mean velocity of the a gmelinii c dactylon and bs plots the results showed that the average velocity showed the order of bs c dactylon and a gmelinii the average velocities of bs a gmelinii and c dactylon under the three rainfall intensities were 0 09 0 06 and 0 04 m s 1 respectively and c dactylon and a gmelinii reduced the average velocity benefits by 33 3 and 55 6 respectively the taproot grasses had a more positive effect on controlling the flow velocity than did the fibrous root grasses it was found that the flow velocity in the c dactylon plots was much greater than that in the a gmelinii plots hence resulting in greater effective hydraulic shear stress based on eq 8 another question raised was why the flow velocity in the c dactylon plots was greater than that in the a gmelinii plots this difference is attributed to different hydraulic resistances hydraulic resistance is a composite parameter describing the retarding effects of roughness elements on water flow and is affected by soil surface macrovariation skin roughness random roughness and form roughness li et al 2020c abrahams et al 1992 conducted a study in a semiarid environment and evaluated the overland flow hydraulic over stony plots the authors separated the flow hydraulic resistance into rainfall resistance form resistance and wave resistance the authors reported that form resistance was positively related to roughness size and cover given that the coverage of the a gmelinii and c dactylon plots was similar the differences in the hydraulic resistance in the a gmelinii and c dactylon plots were mainly attributed to the differences in the roughness size fig 6 shows the comparison of stem diameter between the a gmelinii and c dactylon plots p 0 05 and the a gmelinii grass exhibited a greater stem diameter than the c dactylon plots hence providing greater form resistance moreover for the special underlying surface of the spoil heaps due to the loose structure lack of organic matter and poor cohesion the root system of the taproot vegetation is thicker and can penetrate deeper into the soil structure which can strengthen the consolidation of the internal soil particles the fibrous root system as the root system is generally distributed in the shallow layer of the soil can play a protective role only on the surface soil this is also consistent with the actual situation of the project therefore due to the greater stem diameter the taproot grass showed greater hydraulic resistance and form resistance and hence it had lower flow velocity consequently resulting in a lower effective hydraulic shear stress directly exerted on soil particles and thus a lower slr 4 3 implications and limitations of this study vegetation can significantly change the hydrological and erosion processes on slopes and plays an important role in the runoff sediment relationship and the benefits of water storage and sediment reduction nevertheless little research has been conducted to investigate whether vegetation can still play a significant role in reducing sediment and runoff on reshaped spoil heaps with loose material compositions and steep slopes therefore this research focused on comparing the hydrological and erosion responses on steep spoil heaps to two typical vegetation species artemisia gmelinii a gmelinii and cynodon dactylon c dactylon through field simulated rainfall tests the results showed that the difference in taproot and fibrous root grasses could transfer into the difference in runoff and erosion reduction benefits on spoil heaps this result can provide an important theoretical and practical basis for decision makers when implementing vegetation restoration projects however some potential limitations still existed in this study first whether the planting density and row spacing of vegetation will have a significant impact on the regulation of runoff and sediment yield on spoil heaps is still unknown second this article selected two vegetation types for comparison and comparisons among other vegetation types should be investigated in a follow up study nevertheless taproot system grasses are recommended as the dominant grass for the vegetation restoration of spoil heaps because of their erosion control benefits 5 conclusions a series of field rainfall experiments were conducted to reveal the various effects of taproot and fibrous grasses on the hydrological and sediment yield processes and soil and water loss reduction on spoil heaps the major conclusions were as follows 1 both taproot and fibrous grasses significantly decreased the runoff rate and sediment yield on spoil heaps and the benefits of soil loss amount reduction by grasses 91 1 were approximately 2 2 times those of runoff 42 1 2 shear stress could well predict soil sediment yield following power functions with coefficients of determination equal to 0 72 and 0 85 for artemisia gmelinii and cynodon dactylon respectively 3 compared to fibrous grasses the taproot grass in the present study exhibited greater sediment yield reduction benefits which was attributed to its greater diameter and associated greater form and hydraulic roughness that consequently caused lower effective hydraulic shear stress for detaching soil particles therefore taproot grass is recommended for further control practices on spoil heaps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

2192,knowledge is lacking for sediment organic matter degradation and its influence on water quality for low gradient agriculturally impacted streams despite their importance for freshwater biogeochemical cycles and ecological restoration we hypothesized degradation rates vary across sediment type and are a function of the connectivity regimes for low gradient systems we carried out aerobic incubation experiments to assess oxidation and mineralization nitrification rates and changes in stable isotopic ratios for sediment and dissolved organic matter and nitrate sediment originated from erosion across the watershed s surface shows higher carbon oxidation rates k 3 9 10 3 d 1 and lower nitrogen mineralization nitrification rates k 7 9 10 4 d 1 compared to sediment originated from the creek s streambed that integrates algae and other autotrophic matter k 1 6 10 3 d 1 and k 3 4 10 3 d 1 differences are attributed to sediment transport of humified and plant matter during storms of high watershed connectivity and sediment transport of autochthonous sediment for low connectivity results support our hypothesis and suggest that the sediment connectivity regime of the watershed exhibits control on biogeochemical cycling of the stream network cumulatively sediment degradation rates were one to two orders magnitude higher than previously assumed sediment rates reflect aerobic waters and place the organic matter as active and comparable to reported turnover of algae and fine sized leaf litter stable isotopic ratios of sediment change marginally for the two sediment types for carbon ε 0 4 and 1 3 and nitrogen ε 3 5 and 1 5 dissolved organic nitrogen of stream water degraded similarly across all experiments k 1 8 10 2 d 1 and turnover rates were an order of magnitude higher than recent rates reported for lake water nitrate concentration in the solute increased by an average 35 during experiments and the nitrogen stable isotopic ratio of nitrate decreased by over 1 showing the potential of sediment and dissolved organic matter degradation to influence nitrate flux and its isotopic signal keywords sediment transport carbon nitrogen degradation isotopes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction low gradient streams in agriculturally impacted landscapes are now well accepted to turnover carbon and transform nitrogen in the streambed birgand et al 2007 butman and raymond 2011 griffiths et al 2012 webster et al 2016 in these systems relatively high dissolved nutrient inputs associated with food production and rainfall coupled with erosion and sediment transport on rolling landscapes leads to favorable conditions for in stream carbon and nitrogen cycling fig 1 sediment organic matter originating from the landscape and produced internally provides the substrate for carbon and nitrogen cycles the landscape derived or allochthonous sediment organic matter can include sediment originating from surface soils and more degraded subsurface soils in gullies and from streambanks that fall out of suspension in the low gradient streams the internal or autochthonous sediment organic matter can include benthic algae that experiences degradation and becomes stabilized in the sediment of the streambed hotchkiss and hall 2015 ford and fox 2017 because the stream systems contain moving turbulent flow the in stream storage of sediment organic matter can undergo aerobic degradation including carbon oxidation and nitrogen mineralization nitrification and exchange solutes with the streamwater webster et al 2016 the net impact of the in stream biogeochemical reactions on allochthonous and autochthonous sediment organic matter and the overlying streamwater is under studied for these low gradient agriculturally impacted streams knowledge of these sediment water exchanges are increasingly needed for designs for ecological restoration of the streams parameterizing eco hydrological models and freshwater carbon and nitrogen budgets ford et al 2017 repasch et al 2021 the variation of degradation rates across different types of allochthonous and autochthonous sediment organic matter found in these low gradient streams remains a question for example a labile sediment organic matter pool with high concentration of recent algae growth may be expected to turnover carbon and nitrogen more quickly than a presumed recalcitrant pool of sediment organic matter from the erosion of subsurface gully soil ford et al 2015 used carbon elemental and isotopic measurements to propose a metric of organic matter quality their work suggested low to moderate flow conditions are associated with a river flux of labile sediment as opposed to high magnitude events where deep recalcitrant sediment is eroded from the landscape more broadly this variation of sediment type is associate with regimes where the low gradient stream is disconnected versus highly connected with its landscape bracken et al 2015 mahoney et al 2018 this connectivity regime of the system is increasingly being used as a predictor of water quality for river systems harvey et al 2019 support or refute of hypotheses that extend connectivity theory to the quality of sediment and water and their turnover rates in low gradient streams remains critical information for extending the intersection of these theories we hypothesized estimates of sediment organic carbon oxidation and nitrogen mineralization nitrification associated with low sediment connectivity versus high sediment connectivity hydrologic events could provide a range of rates across connectivity regimes for the low gradient systems providing information on a range of rates for sediment carbon oxidation and nitrogen mineralization nitrification is needed at this time because the measurements or other types of estimates are lacking for low gradient streams the uncertainty in estimating carbon degradation rates for this pool of organic matter has been found to vary over three orders of magnitude and is widely missing results in experimental datasets sinsabaugh et al 1994 webster et al 1999 alvarez and guerrero 2000 jackson and vallaire 2007 ford and fox 2015 fluvial sediment aggregates originating from the uplands of the landscape and the algae that gets assimilated to the sediment deposits is typically of relatively small aggregate size i e sediment aggregate and floc diameters are less than 53 µm therefore field experiments with mesh or porous flow through bags are not effective benthic chambers in the field and denitrification experiments in the laboratory can be limited in their aeration which leads to likely low estimates for oxygen degradation of the sediment pools for nitrogen results of aerobic transformation are also lacking and review shows a three order of magnitude range for potential rates in streams yoshimura et al 2008 ford and fox 2017 some results were recently published for aerobic nitrogen transformations in the yellow river china xia et al 2009 xia et al 2017 however the ammonium and suspended sediment concentrations of these experiments were both two orders of magnitude greater than conditions typical of agricultural streams a number of experiments report particulate organic carbon and nitrogen degradation rates for algae and plant detritus found in rivers howard williams et al 1983 yoshimura et al 2008 and perhaps fluvial sediment that accrues this material may take on its quality to some degree however the sediment organic matter transformation rates are lacking another consideration worthy of study for low gradient agricultural streams is the changes of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopic ratios of sediment during aerobic degradation the use of stable isotopic ratios has gained popularity when modelling stream biogeochemistry because the stable isotopic ratio sub routines provide an extra set of equations to help parameterize unknown reaction rates jensen et al 2018 however like the elemental oxidation and mineralization nitrification rates estimates of isotopic enrichment during sediment biogeochemistry remain under reported for conditions typical of fluvial sediment in low gradient systems this information will be helpful for assisting with process based modelling as well as for inference of results from hydrologic studies where researchers assess origin of carbon nitrogen and sediment in fluvial systems the mentioned hypothesis related to sediment type may also be considered in terms of isotopic changes as organic matter with concentration of labile organic matter could potentially show greater isotopic enrichment during reactions another consideration for low gradient agriculturally impacted streams is the degradation of dissolved organic matter and the impacts of the sediment water exchange on the dissolved constituents of the streamwater for example experiments that measure the degradation of dissolved organic matter were recently presented for lakes koehler et al 2012 mostovaya et al 2016 vachon et al 2017 but no studies to our knowledge carry out experiments for the dissolved component in low order rivers the changes occurring for nitrate in the water column are also of question studies across watershed gradients or over time often consider nitrate flux as function of landscape processes and delivery and the impact of internal cycling of organic matter on nitrate concentration will be of interest for low order systems in addition the isotopic ratios of nitrate provide data used in source apportionment studies for nitrate information on how these isotopic ratios are changed as function of in stream sediment and dissolved organic matter turnover will be helpful for source apportionment studies as well as parameterization of the mentioned eco hydrological models the objective was to i test the hypothesis that sediment carbon oxidation and nitrogen mineralization nitrification will vary across sediment types associated with connectivity regimes in low gradient systems and to ii provide new elemental and isotopic ratio results and transformation rates for sediment and dissolved organic matter degradation we carried out incubation experiments to assess oxidation and mineralization nitrification rates for different types of sediment from a low order system with agricultural influence in addition to sediment substrate analyses we analyze changes in dissolved nitrate as an additional quality assurance of results and to provide an indication of how nitrate may be impacted by the degradation of organic matter we include stable isotopic ratio measurements including dual isotopic ratios δ 15n δ 13c of sediment and δ 15n of nitrate throughout the experiments 2 methods 2 1 study site the south elkhorn creek watershed 62 km2 was chosen for this study and the watershed is a third order mixed land use watershed located near the cities of versailles and lexington kentucky united states fig 2 the watershed falls within the inner bluegrass region of the kentucky river basin this region is characterized by rolling hills with mild slopes and lowlands kentucky department of fish and wildlife resources 2013 this region is classified as a humid subtropical climate with approximately 1140 to 1270 mm of precipitation annually and average temperatures of 0 5 c 33 f in winter to 24 5 c 76 2 f in summer ulack et al 1998 the watershed is underlain with lexington limestone currens 1998 and silt loam soils such as the bluegrass murray silt loam make up the majority of the upper south elkhorn watershed soil matrix the soils are considered to be deep and are well drained with moderate permeability nrcs 2009 the upper south elkhorn creek drains agriculturally dominated areas to the west and south of the city of lexington as well as the urban dominated areas in the southwest of the city the watershed is 57 agricultural and 43 urban land uses which is anticipated to lead to high levels of dissolved nutrients in the watersheds stream network clare 2019 undeveloped land in the upper south elkhorn watershed consists of a majority of pasture land generally used for agricultural purposes with areas of deciduous and mixed forest and shrub scrub land dominant agricultural land use in the south elkhorn watershed is livestock grazing with a small percentage of land being used for cultivated row crops land used for livestock grazing is largely made up of horse farms with a smaller number of cattle farms developed land in the upper south elkhorn watershed consists of a majority open space and low intensity developed area urban developed areas include largely residential portions of the city of lexington and the bluegrass airport south elkhorn creek is approximately 17 km from the mainstem headwaters to the watershed outlet and has an average channel slope of 2 54 m km 1 the stream is third order and is mildly sinuous fig 2 and the channel bed is often bedrock with reaches of cobble stone gravel sands and fine sediments streambanks generally exhibit established and vegetated riparian zones while bank slopes are generally mild with some instances of incised or steep banks and evident erosion the south elkhorn creek was chosen for sediment analyses because i it well qualifies as a low gradient stream in an agriculturally impacted landscape ii it carries sediment organic matter originating from various end members including from the uplands of the basin and from stored sediment in the stream corridor iii the end member sediment types are associate with connectivity regimes as will be shown that in turn provides substrate for testing our hypothesis and iv we had available prior sediment connectivity assessment sediment samples collected from the south elkhorn and prior knowledge of the system from study over the past 15 years fox et al 2010 ford and fox 2014 2015 2017 mahoney et al 2018 2019 sediment transport in the south elkhorn system occurs from erosion and transport of upland sediment as well as mobilization of sediment within the stream corridor upland erosion and sediment transport occurs during moderate to high rainfall events and the system responds quickly with flashy hydrographs at the watershed outlet during events sediment is transported originating from agricultural and urban sources primarily from gully rill and streambank erosion processes during hydrograph recession and during low flow periods suspended sediment falls out of suspension in the bedrock controlled low gradient system mahoney 2020 in turn the sediment becomes substrate for autochthonous organic matter accrual ford et al 2017 water in the system has relatively high nutrient loads including annual mean and standard deviation were measured as 2 93 and 1 00 mg l 1 for no3 n and 0 244 and 0 053 mg l 1 for po4 p clare 2019 the dissolved phosphorus conditions reflect the geology of the area where lexington limestone contains high quantity of phosphatic limestone that creates a significant background source component high dissolved nitrogen concentration in stream water in the watershed likely reflects degradation of soil organic matter across the basin degradation of livestock waste and lawn and row crop fertilization this sediment depositional process coupled with high benthic algae growth indicative of the nutrient conditions and light availability for the south elkhorn produces perennial sediment that resides in the streambed deposition sites and can accrue autochthonous organic matter ford and fox 2014 ford et al 2017 the stored sediment in the stream can be resuspended during subsequent events and prior results show this storage zone continues to be eroded at low transport rates during relatively low flow events and baseflow conditions russo and fox 2012 ford and fox 2014 2 2 experimental design the experimental design was carried out to test the hypothesis that different types of sediment associated with contrasting connectivity regimes will show a range of sediment carbon oxidation and nitrogen mineralization rates as well as isotopic ratio changes during the reactions sediment from south elkhorn creek used in the study was chosen to reflect two different sediment connectivity regimes including 1 the high connectivity regime where sediment originates from the uplands of the basin and sediment is termed upland sediment and 2 the low connectivity regime where sediment originates from within the stream corridor and the sediment is termed in stream sediment sediment tested in the laboratory incubation experiments for oxidation and mineralization was previously collected from south elkhorn creek using sediment trap samplers therefore the sediment was indicative of turbulent flow system and constituted sediment that was an integrator of the watershed and actively available and transported sediment that was available for degradation we realized that fluvial sediment that is actively transported in the south elkhorn creek could at any time be a mixture of sediment originating from the uplands that was recently transported to the system and sediment from within the stream corridor including sediment residing in deposition zones despite the potential for some overlap of characteristics for the two sediment types our goal was the designation of upland sediment and in stream sediment as operationally defined to reflect the two end members of active sediment types as much as possible in the experimental design for carrying out the experimental design and selecting upland and in stream sediment we had in our possession i an extensive analyses of sediment connectivity for the basin calculated daily for a four year time period and ii a sample archive of sediment from south elkhorn creek collected approximately weekly over the same four year time period sediment samples were selected from the sample archive that reflected high connectivity and low connectivity conditions to do so first sediment connectivity was the basis of the analyses and the probability of sediment connectivity was previously calculated for each day of the four year investigation period in mahoney et al 2018 for the year 2006 and mahoney et al 2019 for the years from 2007 to 2009 mahoney et al 2018 2019 used the probability of sediment connectivity formula p c to estimate connectivity of the uplands to the stream corridor as 1 p c p s p d h d nh p t h t nh 1 p b where multiplicative probabilities include processes of sediment transport and s denotes supply dh is hydrologic detachment dnh is non hydrologic detachment th is hydrologic transport tnh is non hydrologic transport and b is buffers impeding sediment transport geospatial analyses at 1 5 m resolution and hydraulic calculations were used estimate the p c which is the probability that sediment from the uplands is connected to the stream corridor for each day of the study period the day with the highest sediment connectivity estimated for the south elkhorn is shown in fig 3 where the white geospatial cells in fig 3c indicate the uplands are connected to the stream corridor and the black geospatial cells indicate the uplands are disconnected mahoney et al 2018 our findings in mahoney et al 2018 2019 indicated that sediment connectivity occurred via pathways of concentrated flow high antecedent moisture and land disturbance connected sediment pathways and erosion sites occurred on high rainfall days with rain falling on wet soils and sediment connectivity was high for the ephemeral stream network steep slopes in newly constructed areas ditches adjacent to roadways and hillslopes adjacent to the stream see further visualization of these results in supplemental information fig s1 as can be seen in fig 3c sediment disconnectivity regions dominate over connected upland regions even on the most connected day of the study period the reason is microtopography across the gently rolling landscape occurs because undulating land surfaces produces flat slopes and the microtopography from the undulations causes small sources of disconnectivity because runoff loses its energy in small depressions the results in fig 3c indicate relatively high sediment connectivity for this watershed as upland sediment transports to the stream corridor while low connectivity occurs when zero rainfall or low rainfall and dry soil conditions produce little runoff to transport sediment i e a plot analogous to fig 3c is all black for low to no connectivity days after calculating connectivity practicality of the experimental design required that we had archive samples of upland and in stream sediment available during the high connectivity and low connectivity respectively events the availability of sediment samples in the archive depended on the amount of sediment that was collected from south elkhorn creek using phillips type sediment traps phillips et al 2000 these integrated sediment trap samplers continuously collect transported fluvial sediment from the river channel phillips et al 2000 sediment collected in phillips traps as opposed to excavating source soils in the uplands or deep sediment deposits in the streambed was advantageous for the focus of our study because the sediment underwent some disaggregation due to fluvial shearing that would make them more typical of sediment as opposed to soil the sediment provides a spatially integrated and thus spatially averaged sediment type for the entire basin rather than a sample collected form a single spatial source location in the watershed and the sediment was active both in terms of transport and the potential for degradation in the turbulent flow aerobic system the phillips traps were always submerged in the water column the inlet of the sampler was approximately 10 cm from the bed substrate samples were collected approximately weekly and samples were dewatered and analyzed for carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotopic composition ford and fox 2014 2015 the samplers were collected from two sites site 1 32 8 km2 and site 2 61 8 km2 in fig 1 the mass of sediment collected with the sediment traps varied widely from over 100 g of sediment for high sediment connectivity events when high sediment load from the uplands to the stream occurs to less than 0 1 g of sediment in the traps for low connectivity time periods when small hydrologic events with low connectivity of the uplands transports low sediment loads in our analyses we iterated between the four year sediment connectivity record and sample archive record to choose a set of sediment samples that reflect upland sediment and instream sediment for high and low connectivity respectively additional information included in the analyses was the knowledge of the south elkhorn s sediment transport processes and organic matter cycling during the time period reported russo and fox 2012 ford and fox 2014 2015 and ancillary information of water discharge sediment discharge and carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotopic results for the time period 2 2 1 upland sediment upland sediment was chosen to reflect the time period of september 2006 when the uplands of the watershed showed high sediment connectivity to the stream corridor fig 4 during this time period 48 of the sediment transport pathways in the uplands were estimated to be connected to the stream corridor and the sediment trap at the watershed outlet collected 107 6 g of sediment for analyses in the incubation experiments table 1 in september 2006 high rainfall fell across the basin to produced the highest water flowrate measured in the creek on record 141 9 m3s 1 and sediment discharge was estimated to peak at 1 923 6 tons per day ford and fox 2014 in addition this hydrologic event was estimated to be a time period when high sediment loads from the uplands transported sediment to the watershed outlet but also blanketed the bed of the stream network with upland sediment russo and fox 2012 ford and fox 2014 for this reason sediment transported in the days immediately subsequent the event would be collected in the sediment traps that also shows high probability of being transported upland sediment the high sediment connectivity availability of high mass of sediment trap sample for use in the experiment and the processes occurring that constitute high sediment loading from the uplands together produced a sample highly indicative of the upland sediment end member 2 2 2 in stream sediment in stream sediment was chosen to reflect the time period of summer and fall 2008 when the uplands of the watershed showed low sediment connectivity to the stream corridor and sediment transport was estimated to occur primarily from sediment within the stream corridor fig 4 during this time period 9 of the sediment transport pathways in the uplands were estimated to be connected to the stream corridor and the sediment traps in the watershed collected sediment mass ranging from 0 4 to 16 2 g of sediment the summer and fall of 2008 experienced lower than average rainfall with streamflow measuring less than 10 m3s 1 throughout the time period fig 4 the result was low surface runoff and relatively low fluvial erosion of the uplands time series analyses of sediment organic carbon transported during this time showed high carbon content reflective of algae stabilization and accrual into streambed sediment ford et al 2015 2017 this idea is seen in fig 4 where sediment organic carbon during the 2008 events are nearly double sediment organic carbon results of the upland sediment sample in september 2006 since sediment load and sediment mass collected with the sediment traps was relatively low we needed to combine archived samples from 12 different sediment trap samples to produce enough sediment mass to constitute the in stream sediment sample for carrying out incubation experiments water sediment transport and carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotope measurements for each individual sample is included in table 1 in general the percent connectivity of sediment pathways was very low for the time periods when individual sediment trap samples were collected as was water and sediment discharge and carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotope measurements were relatively constant the last sediment trap samples centered in december were the exception and sediment connectivity was higher during this time period however peak water discharge and sediment load remained very low two orders of magnitude lower than the conditions for the upland sediment sample and carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotope measurements remained consistent with the other individual in stream sediment samples collected in the preceding months these results gave us confidence the late fall and early winter sediment samples had similar in stream sediment characteristics as the in stream sediment collected in the months prior and therefore they were included in the combined archive sediment sample in turn combining these sediment trap samples to make a total of the 12 sediment trap samples produced a sufficient sediment mass to carry out the incubation experiments for the in stream sediment 2 2 3 stream water solute in experiments the upland sediment and in stream sediment were tested for oxidation and mineralization and their elemental and isotopic changes to carbon and nitrogen using incubation experiments we chose stream water solute from south elkhorn creek as the media for the incubation experiments with the intent of including the microbial population of the stream water for carrying out oxidation and mineralization we did not have archived water with live microbial popolution for the same time period as when archived sediment was collected i e 2006 to 2009 therefore we collected stream water immediately prior to start of the experiments january 2019 and used this water in the incubation our method assumes the archived sediment and recently collected results would show similar results as water collected at the same time and this result is deemed reasonable because our analyses of sediment organic matter characteristics via elemental and isotopic carbon and nitrogen measurements have not shown any dramatic shifts between the two time periods davis 2008 riddle 2020 the watershed had not shown any dramatic shifts in land use and grassland pasture and urban and residential land uses dominate in both time periods and for the data we do have available we do not see any dramatic shifts in mean nutrient or water chemistry conditions between the two time periods ford and fox 2014 clare 2019 stream water with the ambient levels of nitrate ammonium and dissolved organic nitrogen was used as the medium for the incubation experiment because the creek drains majority agricultural lands including horse and cattle farms and small sections of row crops clare 2019 the water is filtered with a 270 mesh to remove coarse particles less than 53 µm that may contribute to the incubated sediment pool while also retaining the natural microbial population of the creek water the dissolved constituents of the water for the initial conditions including no3 nh4 tkn and the isotopic ratio of nitrate δ15nno3 were analyzed table 2 2 3 experiments the incubation experiments were carried out over a 70 day period separate experiments were setup for the previously mentioned upland sediment and in stream sediment six replicate experiments were carried out for upland sediment and six replicate experiments for in stream sediment for each replicate experiment 150 mg of dewatered homogenized sediment and 200 ml of river water was added to a set of ten 250 ml flasks the setup produced a total of 120 incubation flasks the sediment water mixture was 750 mg l 1 suspended sediment concentration agreeing with typical values for the creek mahoney 2020 the flasks set up on an orbital shaker in a temperature controlled 25 environment temperature dissolved oxygen and ph measurements were recorded throughout experimentation using fixed probes and temperature variation was 0 3 c dissolved oxygen was 1 mg l 1 and averaged 6 5 mg l 1 and ph averaged 7 6 with no systematic variation throughout the experiment flask samples from each replicate set were collected and analyzed at days 0 3 7 14 21 28 42 56 and 70 since start of incubation samples were transferred into pre cleaned septa vials in preparation for separation water was siphoned with a syringe and filtered using whatman glass fiber 0 45 µm 47 mm filters then separated to splits for analyses the remaining sediment sample was transferred to a falcon 300 ml conical bottle then frozen and lyophilized to remove any remaining water the dried sediment samples were ground to a fine powder using a wig l bug mixer and transported to culture tubes the flow chart see fig 5 outlines the laboratory methods for the incubation experiments the six replicate experiments were sampled on each sample data indicated and variability of their results was analyzed to assess experimental error on a number of sample dates the three replicates were pooled during post analyses for cost effectiveness 2 4 analytical methods the dissolved constituents of the water including nitrate no3 ammonium nh4 total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn nitrogen and oxygen stable isotope ratios of nitrate δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 were analyzed at the kentucky geological survey water laboratory for elemental values via analytical methods epa 300 0 epa 350 1 and epa 351 2 respectively and the university of arkansas stabile isotope laboratory for isotopic analysis via analytical methods water samples sent to the arkansas laboratory were shipped overnight on ice powdered sediment samples were weighed into tin capsules and acidified repeatedly with a weak 0 5 m hydrochloric acid to remove inorganic carbon carbonate material inorganic carbon ic cannot be completely combusted at normal ea operating temperatures and typically has a carbon isotope composition greater than organic carbon oc so if not removed the measured carbon isotope composition of the sample will be skewed towards that of partially combusted ic harris et al 2001 total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn δ13c and δ15n were analyzed using a costech 4010 elemental analyzer interfaced with a thermo finnigan conflo iii device to a thermo finnigan delta plus xp isotopic ratio mass spectrometer irms all isotopic results are reported in per mil relative to v pdb and air for δ13c and δ15n respectively average standard deviation for usgs 40 and usgs 41 was 0 06 and 0 13 for δ13c and δ15n respectively average standard deviation for the elemental standard acetanilide was 0 35 and 0 09 for toc and tn respectively average standard deviation for toc tn δ13c and δ15n of unknowns was 0 07 0 01 0 04 and 0 11 respectively for the dissolved nitrate analysis usgs 32 34 35 were used to normalize the raw results with the values of 25 27 9 57 5 the average of the standards was 25 67 27 76 and 57 46 with a standard deviation of 0 29 0 29 and 0 23 respectively quality control included collecting data that were monitored and analyzed throughout the duration of the incubation experiment and the monitoring continuously suggested an aerobic and active system for dissolved and sediment organic matter turnover for example statistical evidence in the form of depleted nh4 i e ammonium was un detectable after day 7 see supplemental tables s1 and s2 columns six in both tables decreasing sediment carbon nitrogen and dissolved organic nitrogen supplemental tables s3 and s4 increasing no3 in all experiment replicates supplemental tables s1 and s2 suggested continuous oxidation and mineralization nitrification as relevant and occurring this was expected due to the sufficient dissolved oxygen to be non limiting throughout the experiment and the constant movement of the fairly low sediment substrate concentration 750 mg sed l 1 deep layers of sediment accrual did not occur at the bottom of the flasks so settling of a buried anaerobic layer was avoided a subset of the analytical results for sediment isotopes was also included in the paper by riddle et al 2022 focused on reasons for isotope conservativeness or lack thereof during sediment fingerprinting those results are combined with the previously un reported dataset and degradation modelling of this study 2 5 degradation and isotopic ratio modelling first order reaction mass balance modelling was carried out following the well used functional approach where net degradation does not separate mineralization and nitrification benbi and richter 2002 the mass balance modelling was carried out for sediment nitrogen dissolved organic nitrogen and sediment organic carbon the method considered the quantity of organic matter susceptible to degradation at a rate k according to first order kinetics stanford and smith 1972 alvarez and alvarez 2000 benbi and richter 2002 as 2 d x j dt k x j where x mg is the amount of decomposable substrate i e sn soc don or doc index j is included to reflect the four different substrates and t is time integration of this equation between time t0 and t yields 3 x t j x 0 j e x p k j t where x0 is the initial amount of substrate and xt is the amount of substrate at time t the amount of accumulated nitrate mg n was also modelled using model outputs from the degradation models equation 3 for mineralized sediment nitrogen and dissolved organic nitrogen at each time step nitrate was modelled as 4 no 3 t no 3 t 1 sn t 1 sn t don t 1 don t nh 4 t 1 nh 4 t where no3 t is the amount of nitrate mg at time step t and no3 t 1 is the amount of nitrate at the previous time step and so forth ammonium was not modelled explicitly but rather used the ammonium data because ammonium was only detectable in the first week of incubation so this portion of ammonium was added directly to the nitrate pool eq 4 assumes all sn and don is nitrified upon mineralization which is justified by the fact that ammonium was un detectable after the first week and that no denitrification occurs as justified by the oxic conditions and data results eq 4 also assumes immobilization and sorption fluxes are small and not reflected in the equation stable isotopic ratio modelling followed the rayleigh fractionation approach with the following assumptions 1 in a mixed system material is continuously removed that contains molecules of at least two isotopic species e g nitrate with 15n and 14n 2 the fractionation associated with the removal process at any instant may be described by the fractionation factor and the enrichment factor and 3 the fractionation factor and enrichment factor remain constant during the process kendall and caldwell 1998 the rayleigh model was applied as 5 δ m x b δ m x a ε rxn l n f b a where a and b are the two substances mx is 13c and 15n carried out separately ε is the enrichment factor and f is the fraction remaining after the process occurs the relative contribution to the nitrate isotopes to nitrate was then modelled to include n atoms originating from the mineralization of sediment and dissolved nitrogen as 6 δ 15 n n o 3 t δ 15 n n o 3 t 1 x n o 3 δ 15 n n o 3 t sn x sn δ 15 n n o 3 t don x don where δ 15 n n o 3 t 1 is the isotopic signature of nitrate at the previous time step δ 15 n n o 3 t sn is the isotopic contribution from sediment nitrogen mineralization at time t δ 15 n n o 3 t don is the isotopic contribution from dissolved organic nitrogen mineralization at time t and x is the mass contribution of each source to the nitrate pool δ 15 n n o 3 sn and δ 15 n n o 3 don were added from the sediment and dissolved pools and reflect the isotopic ratio value of nitrogen that exits those pools mass balance results and the rayleigh model are needed to calculate this value at each time step in equation 6 the δ 15 n of mineralized ammonium is assumed equal to nitrified nitrate originating from sediment nitrogen or dissolved organic nitrogen this is reasonable because all ammonium is used up and this process shows little fractionation when the entire amount of ammonium pool is nitrified both n14h4 and n15h4 molecules are used and neither is preferentially degraded when little ammonium is available the mineralization process is limited by non fractionating ammonium oxidation and the nitrate will tend to have an isotopic signature similar to that of organic nitrogen heaton 1986 only when there is a large amount of ammonium will the process be limited by the nitrification step which in turn causes the generated nitrate to be strongly depleted in 15n heaton 1986 this does not occur in this study as evidenced by the ammonium results equation 6 also assumed the δ 15 n of ammonium was equal to that of sediment nitrogen which was justified by the likely don origin from soil water percolation or runoff first order rate reactions and isotopic enrichment values associated with mineralization of organic nitrogen were optimized during modelling the mass balance modeling was optimized to fit observed data using the calibration statistics root mean square error and coefficient of determination error bounds were determined from replicate measurements and are included on the figures in the results 3 results and discussion 3 1 upland and in stream sediment degradation reflect connectivity regimes sediment degradation over the incubation experiments caused different trajectories for upland versus in stream elemental and isotopic ratio data and in turn differences in reaction rates results are shown in figs 6 and 7 and upland sediment showed greater loss of organic carbon soc and less loss of nitrogen sn compared to in stream sediment changes to stable organic carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios of sediment δ 13c and δ 15n were slightly greater for upland sediment compared to in stream sediment the differences between upland and in stream sediment organic matter degradation are most easily noticeable for the carbon to nitrogen atomic ratio c n fig 6e and 7e the c n of upland sediment decreases during incubation while the c n of in stream sediment increases soc sn δ 13c of soc δ 15n of sn and c n measured during incubation all differed significantly in paired statistical tests of upland and in stream sediment p values less than 0 05 these differences were also reflected in optimized reactions rates in mass balance modelling reported in figs 6 and 7 upland sediment carbon oxidation rates k 3 86 10 3 d 1 range k 2 10 10 3 to 6 39 10 3 d 1 were greater than carbon oxidation rates for in stream sediment k 1 56 10 3 d 1 range k 9 56 10 4 to 4 19 10 3 d 1 upland sediment nitrogen mineralization nitrification rates k 7 89 10 4 range k 3 47 10 4 to 3 69 10 3 d 1 were lower than nitrogen mineralization nitrification rates for in stream sediment k 3 35 10 3 d 1 range k 9 43 10 4 4 13 10 3 d 1 the differences in elemental results for upland versus in stream sediment during the degradation experiments table 3 supports our hypothesis in stream sediment contained approximately two times as much carbon and nitrogen as upland sediment prior to experiments likely reflecting the increased accrual of high organic matter content autochthonous material in this manner sediment organic carbon oxidation and nitrogen mineralization nitrification rates likely reflects the sediment type associated with the different sediment origin as is discussed further below we surmise that the upland sediment degradation rates reflect that of sediment residing in the low gradient stream during periods of high sediment connectivity with the landscape and in stream sediment degradation rates reflect that of sediment temporarily stored in the stream corridor during periods of sediment disconnectivity evidence and justification to these contentions is explained next upland sediment is fluvial sediment that erodes from surface and subsurface erosion across the watershed s surface and transports to the low gradient stream and this concept agrees well with the design of the experiment and the results the upland sediment used in the experiments was collected from transported sediment during a high flow hydrologic event i e highest water flowrate measured in at site 2 on record 1992 2023 in which the stream was highly connected with the landscape fig 4 table 1 during high connectivity events sediment in this system originates from soils via gully erosion mahoney et al 2018 this low gradient stream is transported limited in terms of sediment transport mechanics as are low gradient systems more generally and therefore the fluid s energy in the stream to transport sediment is not sufficient to carry the upland sediment load russo and fox 2012 upland sediment falls out of suspension during very high flow events in low gradient streams such as the south elkhorn russo and fox 2012 and blankets the streambed with sediment from the landscape and its allochthonous organic matter the high flow event considered here was estimated to deposit sediment with an averaged depth of 0 5 cm across the entire streambed the blanketed sediment decreased the carbon concentration of the streambed by approximately 1 gc 100 g sediment ford and fox 2014 this sediment deposit dominated surface layer of the streambed for approximately nine months until benthic autotrophy was able to re establish ford and fox 2014 the initial sediment organic carbon and sediment nitrogen content of the upland sediment soc 1 78 gc 100 g sed sn 0 19 gn 100 g sed table 3 agree well with streambank soil and subsurface soil below 5 cm depth measured for the region campbell et al 2009 fox et al 2010 given the high connectivity of the event and initial carbon and nitrogen concentrations the upland sediment likely contains humified soil organic matter and plant organic matter that has undergone some degree of carbon oxidation and nitrogen mineralization the results of the incubation experiment agree with suggested composition of the upland sediment organic matter degraded from the upland sediment substrate showed an average c n ratio equal to 17 based on pre and post experiment data results this c n ratio agrees with that of litter and soil organic matter for the less than 53 µm size class of soil found in this region campbell et al 2009 taken together results suggest the degradation rates are reflective of carbon and nitrogen losses for the upland sediment originating from the landscape when high connectivity exists for the watershed in stream sediment is hybrid fluvial sediment including sediment that originated in the uplands or eroded from streambanks and integrates algae and other autotrophic organic matter over time this material is continuously eroded from the streambed the majority of the year making up the background sediment load of the baseflow and transports at higher rates during low to moderate storm events when sufficient shearing exits at the bed but disconnectivity exists with the landscape russo and fox 2012 the carbon and nitrogen make up of in stream sediment was shown to change both episodically when some connectivity with the uplands deposits newly arrived sediment to the bed and seasonally due to benthic cycling that includes algae growth stabilization to the sediment deposit and turnover ford and fox 2014 2015 2017a b the in stream sediment used in this study was collected for a time period when the stream was disconnected from the landscape fig 3 and therefore the autochthonous contribution to the sediment was relatively high especially in comparison with the upland sediment for example the initial sediment organic carbon and sediment nitrogen content of the in stream sediment soc 3 72 gc 100 g sed sn 0 35 gn 100 g sed table 3 was nearly double that of the upland sediment given the low connectivity and initial carbon and nitrogen concentrations the in stream sediment used in this study likely contains in stream degraded organic matter originating from soil and plant organic matter and stabilized algae algal stabilization occurs by a coupled biotic abiotic process when algal biomass decomposes to more refractory organic matter compounds in aquatic ecosystems for extended periods lara and thomas 1995 leloup et al 2013 hotchkiss and hall 2015 the results of the incubation experiment agree with suggested composition of the in stream sediment organic matter degraded from the in stream sediment substrate showed an average c n ratio equal to 5 this c n ratio agrees with the c n ratio of algae the empirical chemical formula for algal biomass is c106h263o110n16 suggesting an organic carbon content of 36 nitrogen content 6 4 and estimated c n ratio of 5 68 these values are in agreement with literature derived values of c n between 4 and 10 for algae meyers 1994 and unicellular cellular algae such as phytoplankton and benthic microalgae following a redfield ratio of c n p 106 16 1 c n 6 63 baird and middleton 2004 taken together results suggest the degradation rates are reflective of carbon and nitrogen losses for the in stream sediment that includes a substantial contribution from autochthonous organic matter our hypothesis that sediment carbon oxidation and nitrogen mineralization nitrification rates would show a range of results reflecting connectivity regime was supported by the results however we were surprised by the directional shifts and magnitudes of the differences for example the in stream sediment organic carbon degradation showed a half order magnitude lower oxidation rate as compared to the upland sediment a super position of upland turnover and some contribution of algal turnover might be more expected to provide a greater turnover rate for the in stream sediment given its hybrid make up one explanation for the lower oxidation rate is that the algae portion of the in stream sediment has already reached a fairly recalcitrant state even more recalcitrant than soil organic matter another explanation for the lower oxidation rate is attributed to the likely pre degradation of landscape derived sediment that was deposited to the streambed this allochthonous matter undergoes degradation during temporary storage and in turn some portion of the bioavailable carbon has already been oxidated as a function of residence time the interpretation of the results suggests continuously estimating the pools of allochthonous and autochthonous organic matter content in low gradient streams will be important in stream biogeochemistry studies results support the hypothesis that degradation varies as a function of the sediment connectivity regime for low gradient systems the result shows value because scientists could use the watershed s connectivity regime for predicting biogeochemistry of the stream network the watershed is an integrator of processes and assessing the connectivity state of the system could lead to outgassing and downstream flux estimates as well as state of the system s internal processing this bridging of connectivity theory with stream ecology has received increasing attention in recent years for its potential to predict water quality for example harvey et al 2019 in practice this coupling of connectivity and stream biogeochemistry shows great potential as well stream restoration consultants tend to focus on the physical behavior of the stream and watershed system more akin to connectivity but increasingly pursue a more holistic view of how physical changes shift water quality thompson et al 2018 lammers et al 2020 3 2 degradation rates and isotopic enrichment for sediment in low gradient streams we also discuss the degradation rates and isotopic enrichment for sediment found in this study relative to other types of organic matter in rivers and soils given that these rates are seldom reported the degradation rate results for the low gradient stream figs 6 and 7 are one to two orders magnitude higher than the range considered for sediment organic carbon and sediment nitrogen ford and fox 2015 2017 report k 1 10 5 to 1 10 4 d 1 these results contrast a passive assumption of sediment and place the sediment organic matter as active in these types of systems for example the sediment nitrogen results compare more closely with experiments of degradation of algae and fine particulates from plants ford and fox 2015 yoshimura et al 2008 found fine sized leaf litter from ash f excelsior leaf and oak q robar leaf that compared similarly to the results of this study 1 5 10 3 d 1 and 1 3 10 3 d 1 one scientific report was found to somewhat corroborate our findings and provide further confidence benbi et al 2014 found that mineral associated soil organic nitrogen had a first order reaction rate for mineralization nitrification k 1 0 10 3 d 1 that was just slightly lower than our study based on results herein fluvial sediment transported in the low gradient streams appears more reactive than previously assumed one reason is the mineral associated soil organic matter portion that makes up a substantial component of fluvial sediment has higher reactivity than traditionally assumed cambardella and elliott 1992 benbi et al 2014 another reason is the aerobic conditions of river water transporting fluvial sediment as investigated in this study traditional inference of sediment mineralization nitrification for the fine sized organic matter might extrapolate from coarse and fine particulate organic matter studies ford and fox 2015 these studies typically use a substrate deposited in the bottom of a flask in the laboratory or in a riverbed deposit in the field sinsabaugh et al 1994 jackson and vallaire 2007 micro sensor research has shown oxygen levels can drop off quickly in substrates even in just a few millimeters boudreau and jorgensen 2001 for this reason extrapolation of first order rates for deposited substrates may underpredict first order rates of fluvial sediment that remains well oxygenated central values for carbon isotopic enrichment during oxidation were 0 41 and 1 25 for upland and in stream sediment organic carbon respectively figs 6 and 7 central values for nitrogen isotopic enrichment during mineralization nitrification were 3 47 and 1 53 for upland and in stream sediment nitrogen respectively figs 6 and 7 corresponding fractionation factors were 1 00041 and 1 00125 for upland and in stream sediment organic carbon respectively during oxidation and 1 00347 and 1 00153 for upland and in stream sediment nitrogen respectively during mineralization nitrification no studies to our knowledge present isotopic enrichment or fractionation factors for fluvial sediment from low gradient streams however the isotopic ratio enrichment was reported for carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios during organic matter degradation more generally e g plant litter soil organic matter sediment cores and these studies find isotopic enrichment is generally 2 delwiche and steyn 1970 miyake 1971 freyer and aly 1975 mariotti et al 1981 heaton 1986 kendall et al 2007 möbius 2013 the results in this study agree reasonably well with these ranges 3 3 dissolved nitrogen and isotopic ratio of nitrate dissolved organic nitrogen don decreased during incubation experiments nitrate no3 increased and the stable nitrogen isotopic ratio of nitrate δ 15nno3 decreased over time changes in don no3 and δ 15nno3 followed the same general distribution for both upland sediment and in stream sediment experiments figs 6 and 7 don no3 and δ 15nno3 measured during incubation all did not differ significantly in paired statistical tests of upland and in stream sediment p values 0 05 the lack of differences for don reflect the fact that the same stream water was used in both upland sediment and in stream sediment experiments the water carried the same microbial population which similarly degraded don in both sets of tests the lack of differences for no3 and δ 15nno3 are attributed to the fact that the newly generated nitrate was approximately 65 originated as don while 35 originated as sediment nitrogen the differences in sediment nitrogen degradation by mass for the upland and in stream sediment were not great enough to produce measurable differences for no3 and δ 15nno3 these lack of differences for the dissolved phases were also reflected in optimized modelling results from mass balance modelling figs 6 and 7 optimized rates for mineralization nitrification of don were nearly identical for upland sediment and in stream sediment experiments no3 and δ 15nno3 generation from the sediment and dissolved phases and isotopic ratio changes during testing respectively agreed very well with modelling inputs from first order mass balance modelling and the rayleigh isotopic ratio modelling results the results from the dissolved nitrogen and the isotopic ratio of nitrate provide further confidence in the degradation results carried out in this study when combined with the don turnover the nitrate and isotopic ratio of nitrate provide additional data without additional unknown for analyzing sediment degradation occurring in addition we carry out discussion of dissolved organic nitrogen degradation and nitrate concentration and isotopic ratio changes given that these values are seldom reported in the literature for low order streams results suggest dissolved organic nitrogen mineralization nitrification rates k 1 8 10 2 d 1 degrade with first order reaction rates that are on the upper end of studies for comparison few if any papers to our knowledge are presenting incubation experiment results for dissolved organic nitrogen mineralization nitrification for low order river water as in this study but a number of recent studies carried out dissolved organic matter incubation experiments for lake water vähätalo and zepp 2005 mostovaya et al 2016 vachon et al 2017 our present study found first order rate results k 1 95 10 2 d 1 range 9 00 10 3 to 4 50 10 2 d 1 an order of magnitude higher than those studies for example vahatalo and zepp 2005 focuses on photochemical mineralization of dissolved organic nitrogen in lake water but also presents a pretreatment dark incubation experiment with dissolved inorganic nitrogen mineralization corresponding to a first order reaction rate one order of magnitude lower than our results range for k 2 35 to 3 65 10 3 d 1 as another example some inference is possible based on dissolved organic carbon oxidation in the incubation of lake water substrate conducted by mostovaya et al 2016 where the first order decomposition rate k 1 5 to 6 2 10 3 d 1 was one order of magnitude lower than our results and vachon et al 2017 who found a first order rate for incubation of lake water k 1 1 to 2 3 10 3 d 1 that was one order magnitude lower than our results comparison shows low gradient agriculturally impacted streams may have dissolved organic nitrogen mineralization nitrification rates one order of magnitude greater than lakes the difference is plausible considering the potential source and age of organic matter in the low order rivers as compared to lakes the average c n ratio of dissolved organic matter in the low order stream used in this study was 37 which is much higher than the published range for lakes the c n ratio of dissolved organic matter in temperate lake water averaged 11 5 and ranged from 8 to 18 in the compilation by hecky 1993 dissolved organic matter sources in low order streams likely originates from soil water drainage and runoff that travel from the source soil and litter to the stream with fast transit relative to lake dissolved organic matter that is potentially more highly degraded and recalcitrant due to longer residence time as evidenced by the lower c n ratio or is indicative of oxidation and mineralization of algae nitrate mass increases by substantially from the beginning to the end of the seventy day experiment with implications for low gradient streams this result points to the potential for nitrate variability measured in low gradient streams to originate from dissolved and sediment organic matter degradation as well as landscape delivery of nitrate an average 35 increase of nitrate occurs throughout the experiments one third of the nitrate increase is due to sediment nitrogen mineralization nitrification and two thirds of the nitrate increase is due to dissolved organic nitrogen mineralization nitrification river water used in the study collected from south elkhorn creek had a background nitrate concentration 2 73 mg no3 n l 1 that falls just below the united states national average nitrate level in surface streams with significant agricultural disturbance 3 mg no3 n l 1 and above the united states national average of nitrate in surface streams with urban impacts 1 mg no3 n l 1 dubrovsky et al 2010 scientists have long relied on calculations of total nitrogen when assessing nutrient budgets e g aulenbach et al 2007 and correlations between nitrate concentration and total nitrogen concentration in river water are one way to upscale results nevertheless increased emphasis is being placed on nitrate measurements due to the fact that nitrate is a problem for water quality and at the same time is able to be measured in situ with fairly high resolution 15 min optical sensors pellerin et al 2014 miller et al 2016 the distribution of nitrogen at the beginning of the incubation experiment was 51 nitrate 10 dissolved organic nitrogen 3 ammonium and 36 sediment nitrogen and at the end of the experiment was 64 nitrate and 36 sediment nitrogen the nitrogen distribution shows the slim majority of nitrate initially as well as the importance of sediment nitrogen both at the beginning and end of the 70 day incubation the sediment concentration used in the study 750 mg sed l 1 was a typical concentration for sediment concentration in river water in this region mahoney et al 2018 as opposed to an upper limit and we expect a substantial contribution of nitrogen in rivers to be sediment nitrogen during some conditions pickering and ford 2021 the over one per mil shift of the nitrogen isotopic ratio of nitrate is also worth mentioning this isotopic ratio is often used for source apportionment studies in stream systems in some cases these studies rely on a one per difference for nitrate sources in a basin disregard of changes in the isotopic ratio due to inputs from sediment and dissolved organic matter degradation could produce error in these studies 4 conclusion data results and modelling is used to investigate sediment organic matter degradation in aerobic river water and its influence on water quality for low gradient agriculturally impacted streams the conclusion of the investigation is as follows 1 sediment originated from erosion across the watershed s surface shows higher carbon oxidation rates k 3 9 10 3 d 1 and lower nitrogen mineralization nitrification rates k 7 9 10 4 d 1 compared to sediment originated from the creek s streambed that integrates algae and other autotrophic matter k 1 6 10 3 d 1 and k 3 4 10 3 d 1 differences are attributed to sediment transport of humified and plant matter during storms of high watershed connectivity and sediment transport of autochthonous sediment for low connectivity results support the hypothesis that degradation varies as a function of the sediment connectivity regime for low gradient systems the result shows value because scientists could use the watershed s connectivity regime for predicting sediment fate in the stream network for freshwater biogeochemical cycle studies and for ecological restoration 2 sediment degradation rates were one to two orders magnitude higher than previously assumed sediment rates reflect aerobic waters and place the organic matter as active with degradation rates comparable to reported rates for algae and fine sized leaf litter the results contrast the hypothesis that sediment in rivers is passive or degrades very slowly via anaerobic degradation we hypothesis the streambed contrasts lakes and actively degrades sediment organic matter as turbulent diffusion aerates the surficial layer 3 stable isotopic ratios of sediment change marginally for the two sediment types for carbon ε 0 4 and 1 3 and nitrogen ε 3 5 and 1 5 isotopic enrichment or fractionation factors were not previously reported for fluvial sediment to our knowledge and results may be helpful for parameterizing uncertainty in process based modelling and data driven inversion modelling 4 dissolved organic nitrogen of stream water degraded similarly across all experiments k 1 8 10 2 d 1 and turnover rates were an order of magnitude higher than recent rates reported for lake water the differences are attributed to the sources and age of dissolved organic matter in the low order rivers as compared to lakes and the average c n ratio was 37 as compared 11 5 respectively dissolved organic matter in low order streams appears much more labile than that of lakes 5 nitrate concentration in the solute increased by an average 35 during experiments and the nitrogen stable isotopic ratio of nitrate decreased by over 1 showing the potential of sediment and dissolved organic matter degradation to influence nitrate flux and its isotopic signal the nitrate changes are substantial and place emphasis on including the dissolved sediment and organic matter contributions in

2192,knowledge is lacking for sediment organic matter degradation and its influence on water quality for low gradient agriculturally impacted streams despite their importance for freshwater biogeochemical cycles and ecological restoration we hypothesized degradation rates vary across sediment type and are a function of the connectivity regimes for low gradient systems we carried out aerobic incubation experiments to assess oxidation and mineralization nitrification rates and changes in stable isotopic ratios for sediment and dissolved organic matter and nitrate sediment originated from erosion across the watershed s surface shows higher carbon oxidation rates k 3 9 10 3 d 1 and lower nitrogen mineralization nitrification rates k 7 9 10 4 d 1 compared to sediment originated from the creek s streambed that integrates algae and other autotrophic matter k 1 6 10 3 d 1 and k 3 4 10 3 d 1 differences are attributed to sediment transport of humified and plant matter during storms of high watershed connectivity and sediment transport of autochthonous sediment for low connectivity results support our hypothesis and suggest that the sediment connectivity regime of the watershed exhibits control on biogeochemical cycling of the stream network cumulatively sediment degradation rates were one to two orders magnitude higher than previously assumed sediment rates reflect aerobic waters and place the organic matter as active and comparable to reported turnover of algae and fine sized leaf litter stable isotopic ratios of sediment change marginally for the two sediment types for carbon ε 0 4 and 1 3 and nitrogen ε 3 5 and 1 5 dissolved organic nitrogen of stream water degraded similarly across all experiments k 1 8 10 2 d 1 and turnover rates were an order of magnitude higher than recent rates reported for lake water nitrate concentration in the solute increased by an average 35 during experiments and the nitrogen stable isotopic ratio of nitrate decreased by over 1 showing the potential of sediment and dissolved organic matter degradation to influence nitrate flux and its isotopic signal keywords sediment transport carbon nitrogen degradation isotopes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction low gradient streams in agriculturally impacted landscapes are now well accepted to turnover carbon and transform nitrogen in the streambed birgand et al 2007 butman and raymond 2011 griffiths et al 2012 webster et al 2016 in these systems relatively high dissolved nutrient inputs associated with food production and rainfall coupled with erosion and sediment transport on rolling landscapes leads to favorable conditions for in stream carbon and nitrogen cycling fig 1 sediment organic matter originating from the landscape and produced internally provides the substrate for carbon and nitrogen cycles the landscape derived or allochthonous sediment organic matter can include sediment originating from surface soils and more degraded subsurface soils in gullies and from streambanks that fall out of suspension in the low gradient streams the internal or autochthonous sediment organic matter can include benthic algae that experiences degradation and becomes stabilized in the sediment of the streambed hotchkiss and hall 2015 ford and fox 2017 because the stream systems contain moving turbulent flow the in stream storage of sediment organic matter can undergo aerobic degradation including carbon oxidation and nitrogen mineralization nitrification and exchange solutes with the streamwater webster et al 2016 the net impact of the in stream biogeochemical reactions on allochthonous and autochthonous sediment organic matter and the overlying streamwater is under studied for these low gradient agriculturally impacted streams knowledge of these sediment water exchanges are increasingly needed for designs for ecological restoration of the streams parameterizing eco hydrological models and freshwater carbon and nitrogen budgets ford et al 2017 repasch et al 2021 the variation of degradation rates across different types of allochthonous and autochthonous sediment organic matter found in these low gradient streams remains a question for example a labile sediment organic matter pool with high concentration of recent algae growth may be expected to turnover carbon and nitrogen more quickly than a presumed recalcitrant pool of sediment organic matter from the erosion of subsurface gully soil ford et al 2015 used carbon elemental and isotopic measurements to propose a metric of organic matter quality their work suggested low to moderate flow conditions are associated with a river flux of labile sediment as opposed to high magnitude events where deep recalcitrant sediment is eroded from the landscape more broadly this variation of sediment type is associate with regimes where the low gradient stream is disconnected versus highly connected with its landscape bracken et al 2015 mahoney et al 2018 this connectivity regime of the system is increasingly being used as a predictor of water quality for river systems harvey et al 2019 support or refute of hypotheses that extend connectivity theory to the quality of sediment and water and their turnover rates in low gradient streams remains critical information for extending the intersection of these theories we hypothesized estimates of sediment organic carbon oxidation and nitrogen mineralization nitrification associated with low sediment connectivity versus high sediment connectivity hydrologic events could provide a range of rates across connectivity regimes for the low gradient systems providing information on a range of rates for sediment carbon oxidation and nitrogen mineralization nitrification is needed at this time because the measurements or other types of estimates are lacking for low gradient streams the uncertainty in estimating carbon degradation rates for this pool of organic matter has been found to vary over three orders of magnitude and is widely missing results in experimental datasets sinsabaugh et al 1994 webster et al 1999 alvarez and guerrero 2000 jackson and vallaire 2007 ford and fox 2015 fluvial sediment aggregates originating from the uplands of the landscape and the algae that gets assimilated to the sediment deposits is typically of relatively small aggregate size i e sediment aggregate and floc diameters are less than 53 µm therefore field experiments with mesh or porous flow through bags are not effective benthic chambers in the field and denitrification experiments in the laboratory can be limited in their aeration which leads to likely low estimates for oxygen degradation of the sediment pools for nitrogen results of aerobic transformation are also lacking and review shows a three order of magnitude range for potential rates in streams yoshimura et al 2008 ford and fox 2017 some results were recently published for aerobic nitrogen transformations in the yellow river china xia et al 2009 xia et al 2017 however the ammonium and suspended sediment concentrations of these experiments were both two orders of magnitude greater than conditions typical of agricultural streams a number of experiments report particulate organic carbon and nitrogen degradation rates for algae and plant detritus found in rivers howard williams et al 1983 yoshimura et al 2008 and perhaps fluvial sediment that accrues this material may take on its quality to some degree however the sediment organic matter transformation rates are lacking another consideration worthy of study for low gradient agricultural streams is the changes of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopic ratios of sediment during aerobic degradation the use of stable isotopic ratios has gained popularity when modelling stream biogeochemistry because the stable isotopic ratio sub routines provide an extra set of equations to help parameterize unknown reaction rates jensen et al 2018 however like the elemental oxidation and mineralization nitrification rates estimates of isotopic enrichment during sediment biogeochemistry remain under reported for conditions typical of fluvial sediment in low gradient systems this information will be helpful for assisting with process based modelling as well as for inference of results from hydrologic studies where researchers assess origin of carbon nitrogen and sediment in fluvial systems the mentioned hypothesis related to sediment type may also be considered in terms of isotopic changes as organic matter with concentration of labile organic matter could potentially show greater isotopic enrichment during reactions another consideration for low gradient agriculturally impacted streams is the degradation of dissolved organic matter and the impacts of the sediment water exchange on the dissolved constituents of the streamwater for example experiments that measure the degradation of dissolved organic matter were recently presented for lakes koehler et al 2012 mostovaya et al 2016 vachon et al 2017 but no studies to our knowledge carry out experiments for the dissolved component in low order rivers the changes occurring for nitrate in the water column are also of question studies across watershed gradients or over time often consider nitrate flux as function of landscape processes and delivery and the impact of internal cycling of organic matter on nitrate concentration will be of interest for low order systems in addition the isotopic ratios of nitrate provide data used in source apportionment studies for nitrate information on how these isotopic ratios are changed as function of in stream sediment and dissolved organic matter turnover will be helpful for source apportionment studies as well as parameterization of the mentioned eco hydrological models the objective was to i test the hypothesis that sediment carbon oxidation and nitrogen mineralization nitrification will vary across sediment types associated with connectivity regimes in low gradient systems and to ii provide new elemental and isotopic ratio results and transformation rates for sediment and dissolved organic matter degradation we carried out incubation experiments to assess oxidation and mineralization nitrification rates for different types of sediment from a low order system with agricultural influence in addition to sediment substrate analyses we analyze changes in dissolved nitrate as an additional quality assurance of results and to provide an indication of how nitrate may be impacted by the degradation of organic matter we include stable isotopic ratio measurements including dual isotopic ratios δ 15n δ 13c of sediment and δ 15n of nitrate throughout the experiments 2 methods 2 1 study site the south elkhorn creek watershed 62 km2 was chosen for this study and the watershed is a third order mixed land use watershed located near the cities of versailles and lexington kentucky united states fig 2 the watershed falls within the inner bluegrass region of the kentucky river basin this region is characterized by rolling hills with mild slopes and lowlands kentucky department of fish and wildlife resources 2013 this region is classified as a humid subtropical climate with approximately 1140 to 1270 mm of precipitation annually and average temperatures of 0 5 c 33 f in winter to 24 5 c 76 2 f in summer ulack et al 1998 the watershed is underlain with lexington limestone currens 1998 and silt loam soils such as the bluegrass murray silt loam make up the majority of the upper south elkhorn watershed soil matrix the soils are considered to be deep and are well drained with moderate permeability nrcs 2009 the upper south elkhorn creek drains agriculturally dominated areas to the west and south of the city of lexington as well as the urban dominated areas in the southwest of the city the watershed is 57 agricultural and 43 urban land uses which is anticipated to lead to high levels of dissolved nutrients in the watersheds stream network clare 2019 undeveloped land in the upper south elkhorn watershed consists of a majority of pasture land generally used for agricultural purposes with areas of deciduous and mixed forest and shrub scrub land dominant agricultural land use in the south elkhorn watershed is livestock grazing with a small percentage of land being used for cultivated row crops land used for livestock grazing is largely made up of horse farms with a smaller number of cattle farms developed land in the upper south elkhorn watershed consists of a majority open space and low intensity developed area urban developed areas include largely residential portions of the city of lexington and the bluegrass airport south elkhorn creek is approximately 17 km from the mainstem headwaters to the watershed outlet and has an average channel slope of 2 54 m km 1 the stream is third order and is mildly sinuous fig 2 and the channel bed is often bedrock with reaches of cobble stone gravel sands and fine sediments streambanks generally exhibit established and vegetated riparian zones while bank slopes are generally mild with some instances of incised or steep banks and evident erosion the south elkhorn creek was chosen for sediment analyses because i it well qualifies as a low gradient stream in an agriculturally impacted landscape ii it carries sediment organic matter originating from various end members including from the uplands of the basin and from stored sediment in the stream corridor iii the end member sediment types are associate with connectivity regimes as will be shown that in turn provides substrate for testing our hypothesis and iv we had available prior sediment connectivity assessment sediment samples collected from the south elkhorn and prior knowledge of the system from study over the past 15 years fox et al 2010 ford and fox 2014 2015 2017 mahoney et al 2018 2019 sediment transport in the south elkhorn system occurs from erosion and transport of upland sediment as well as mobilization of sediment within the stream corridor upland erosion and sediment transport occurs during moderate to high rainfall events and the system responds quickly with flashy hydrographs at the watershed outlet during events sediment is transported originating from agricultural and urban sources primarily from gully rill and streambank erosion processes during hydrograph recession and during low flow periods suspended sediment falls out of suspension in the bedrock controlled low gradient system mahoney 2020 in turn the sediment becomes substrate for autochthonous organic matter accrual ford et al 2017 water in the system has relatively high nutrient loads including annual mean and standard deviation were measured as 2 93 and 1 00 mg l 1 for no3 n and 0 244 and 0 053 mg l 1 for po4 p clare 2019 the dissolved phosphorus conditions reflect the geology of the area where lexington limestone contains high quantity of phosphatic limestone that creates a significant background source component high dissolved nitrogen concentration in stream water in the watershed likely reflects degradation of soil organic matter across the basin degradation of livestock waste and lawn and row crop fertilization this sediment depositional process coupled with high benthic algae growth indicative of the nutrient conditions and light availability for the south elkhorn produces perennial sediment that resides in the streambed deposition sites and can accrue autochthonous organic matter ford and fox 2014 ford et al 2017 the stored sediment in the stream can be resuspended during subsequent events and prior results show this storage zone continues to be eroded at low transport rates during relatively low flow events and baseflow conditions russo and fox 2012 ford and fox 2014 2 2 experimental design the experimental design was carried out to test the hypothesis that different types of sediment associated with contrasting connectivity regimes will show a range of sediment carbon oxidation and nitrogen mineralization rates as well as isotopic ratio changes during the reactions sediment from south elkhorn creek used in the study was chosen to reflect two different sediment connectivity regimes including 1 the high connectivity regime where sediment originates from the uplands of the basin and sediment is termed upland sediment and 2 the low connectivity regime where sediment originates from within the stream corridor and the sediment is termed in stream sediment sediment tested in the laboratory incubation experiments for oxidation and mineralization was previously collected from south elkhorn creek using sediment trap samplers therefore the sediment was indicative of turbulent flow system and constituted sediment that was an integrator of the watershed and actively available and transported sediment that was available for degradation we realized that fluvial sediment that is actively transported in the south elkhorn creek could at any time be a mixture of sediment originating from the uplands that was recently transported to the system and sediment from within the stream corridor including sediment residing in deposition zones despite the potential for some overlap of characteristics for the two sediment types our goal was the designation of upland sediment and in stream sediment as operationally defined to reflect the two end members of active sediment types as much as possible in the experimental design for carrying out the experimental design and selecting upland and in stream sediment we had in our possession i an extensive analyses of sediment connectivity for the basin calculated daily for a four year time period and ii a sample archive of sediment from south elkhorn creek collected approximately weekly over the same four year time period sediment samples were selected from the sample archive that reflected high connectivity and low connectivity conditions to do so first sediment connectivity was the basis of the analyses and the probability of sediment connectivity was previously calculated for each day of the four year investigation period in mahoney et al 2018 for the year 2006 and mahoney et al 2019 for the years from 2007 to 2009 mahoney et al 2018 2019 used the probability of sediment connectivity formula p c to estimate connectivity of the uplands to the stream corridor as 1 p c p s p d h d nh p t h t nh 1 p b where multiplicative probabilities include processes of sediment transport and s denotes supply dh is hydrologic detachment dnh is non hydrologic detachment th is hydrologic transport tnh is non hydrologic transport and b is buffers impeding sediment transport geospatial analyses at 1 5 m resolution and hydraulic calculations were used estimate the p c which is the probability that sediment from the uplands is connected to the stream corridor for each day of the study period the day with the highest sediment connectivity estimated for the south elkhorn is shown in fig 3 where the white geospatial cells in fig 3c indicate the uplands are connected to the stream corridor and the black geospatial cells indicate the uplands are disconnected mahoney et al 2018 our findings in mahoney et al 2018 2019 indicated that sediment connectivity occurred via pathways of concentrated flow high antecedent moisture and land disturbance connected sediment pathways and erosion sites occurred on high rainfall days with rain falling on wet soils and sediment connectivity was high for the ephemeral stream network steep slopes in newly constructed areas ditches adjacent to roadways and hillslopes adjacent to the stream see further visualization of these results in supplemental information fig s1 as can be seen in fig 3c sediment disconnectivity regions dominate over connected upland regions even on the most connected day of the study period the reason is microtopography across the gently rolling landscape occurs because undulating land surfaces produces flat slopes and the microtopography from the undulations causes small sources of disconnectivity because runoff loses its energy in small depressions the results in fig 3c indicate relatively high sediment connectivity for this watershed as upland sediment transports to the stream corridor while low connectivity occurs when zero rainfall or low rainfall and dry soil conditions produce little runoff to transport sediment i e a plot analogous to fig 3c is all black for low to no connectivity days after calculating connectivity practicality of the experimental design required that we had archive samples of upland and in stream sediment available during the high connectivity and low connectivity respectively events the availability of sediment samples in the archive depended on the amount of sediment that was collected from south elkhorn creek using phillips type sediment traps phillips et al 2000 these integrated sediment trap samplers continuously collect transported fluvial sediment from the river channel phillips et al 2000 sediment collected in phillips traps as opposed to excavating source soils in the uplands or deep sediment deposits in the streambed was advantageous for the focus of our study because the sediment underwent some disaggregation due to fluvial shearing that would make them more typical of sediment as opposed to soil the sediment provides a spatially integrated and thus spatially averaged sediment type for the entire basin rather than a sample collected form a single spatial source location in the watershed and the sediment was active both in terms of transport and the potential for degradation in the turbulent flow aerobic system the phillips traps were always submerged in the water column the inlet of the sampler was approximately 10 cm from the bed substrate samples were collected approximately weekly and samples were dewatered and analyzed for carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotopic composition ford and fox 2014 2015 the samplers were collected from two sites site 1 32 8 km2 and site 2 61 8 km2 in fig 1 the mass of sediment collected with the sediment traps varied widely from over 100 g of sediment for high sediment connectivity events when high sediment load from the uplands to the stream occurs to less than 0 1 g of sediment in the traps for low connectivity time periods when small hydrologic events with low connectivity of the uplands transports low sediment loads in our analyses we iterated between the four year sediment connectivity record and sample archive record to choose a set of sediment samples that reflect upland sediment and instream sediment for high and low connectivity respectively additional information included in the analyses was the knowledge of the south elkhorn s sediment transport processes and organic matter cycling during the time period reported russo and fox 2012 ford and fox 2014 2015 and ancillary information of water discharge sediment discharge and carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotopic results for the time period 2 2 1 upland sediment upland sediment was chosen to reflect the time period of september 2006 when the uplands of the watershed showed high sediment connectivity to the stream corridor fig 4 during this time period 48 of the sediment transport pathways in the uplands were estimated to be connected to the stream corridor and the sediment trap at the watershed outlet collected 107 6 g of sediment for analyses in the incubation experiments table 1 in september 2006 high rainfall fell across the basin to produced the highest water flowrate measured in the creek on record 141 9 m3s 1 and sediment discharge was estimated to peak at 1 923 6 tons per day ford and fox 2014 in addition this hydrologic event was estimated to be a time period when high sediment loads from the uplands transported sediment to the watershed outlet but also blanketed the bed of the stream network with upland sediment russo and fox 2012 ford and fox 2014 for this reason sediment transported in the days immediately subsequent the event would be collected in the sediment traps that also shows high probability of being transported upland sediment the high sediment connectivity availability of high mass of sediment trap sample for use in the experiment and the processes occurring that constitute high sediment loading from the uplands together produced a sample highly indicative of the upland sediment end member 2 2 2 in stream sediment in stream sediment was chosen to reflect the time period of summer and fall 2008 when the uplands of the watershed showed low sediment connectivity to the stream corridor and sediment transport was estimated to occur primarily from sediment within the stream corridor fig 4 during this time period 9 of the sediment transport pathways in the uplands were estimated to be connected to the stream corridor and the sediment traps in the watershed collected sediment mass ranging from 0 4 to 16 2 g of sediment the summer and fall of 2008 experienced lower than average rainfall with streamflow measuring less than 10 m3s 1 throughout the time period fig 4 the result was low surface runoff and relatively low fluvial erosion of the uplands time series analyses of sediment organic carbon transported during this time showed high carbon content reflective of algae stabilization and accrual into streambed sediment ford et al 2015 2017 this idea is seen in fig 4 where sediment organic carbon during the 2008 events are nearly double sediment organic carbon results of the upland sediment sample in september 2006 since sediment load and sediment mass collected with the sediment traps was relatively low we needed to combine archived samples from 12 different sediment trap samples to produce enough sediment mass to constitute the in stream sediment sample for carrying out incubation experiments water sediment transport and carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotope measurements for each individual sample is included in table 1 in general the percent connectivity of sediment pathways was very low for the time periods when individual sediment trap samples were collected as was water and sediment discharge and carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotope measurements were relatively constant the last sediment trap samples centered in december were the exception and sediment connectivity was higher during this time period however peak water discharge and sediment load remained very low two orders of magnitude lower than the conditions for the upland sediment sample and carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotope measurements remained consistent with the other individual in stream sediment samples collected in the preceding months these results gave us confidence the late fall and early winter sediment samples had similar in stream sediment characteristics as the in stream sediment collected in the months prior and therefore they were included in the combined archive sediment sample in turn combining these sediment trap samples to make a total of the 12 sediment trap samples produced a sufficient sediment mass to carry out the incubation experiments for the in stream sediment 2 2 3 stream water solute in experiments the upland sediment and in stream sediment were tested for oxidation and mineralization and their elemental and isotopic changes to carbon and nitrogen using incubation experiments we chose stream water solute from south elkhorn creek as the media for the incubation experiments with the intent of including the microbial population of the stream water for carrying out oxidation and mineralization we did not have archived water with live microbial popolution for the same time period as when archived sediment was collected i e 2006 to 2009 therefore we collected stream water immediately prior to start of the experiments january 2019 and used this water in the incubation our method assumes the archived sediment and recently collected results would show similar results as water collected at the same time and this result is deemed reasonable because our analyses of sediment organic matter characteristics via elemental and isotopic carbon and nitrogen measurements have not shown any dramatic shifts between the two time periods davis 2008 riddle 2020 the watershed had not shown any dramatic shifts in land use and grassland pasture and urban and residential land uses dominate in both time periods and for the data we do have available we do not see any dramatic shifts in mean nutrient or water chemistry conditions between the two time periods ford and fox 2014 clare 2019 stream water with the ambient levels of nitrate ammonium and dissolved organic nitrogen was used as the medium for the incubation experiment because the creek drains majority agricultural lands including horse and cattle farms and small sections of row crops clare 2019 the water is filtered with a 270 mesh to remove coarse particles less than 53 µm that may contribute to the incubated sediment pool while also retaining the natural microbial population of the creek water the dissolved constituents of the water for the initial conditions including no3 nh4 tkn and the isotopic ratio of nitrate δ15nno3 were analyzed table 2 2 3 experiments the incubation experiments were carried out over a 70 day period separate experiments were setup for the previously mentioned upland sediment and in stream sediment six replicate experiments were carried out for upland sediment and six replicate experiments for in stream sediment for each replicate experiment 150 mg of dewatered homogenized sediment and 200 ml of river water was added to a set of ten 250 ml flasks the setup produced a total of 120 incubation flasks the sediment water mixture was 750 mg l 1 suspended sediment concentration agreeing with typical values for the creek mahoney 2020 the flasks set up on an orbital shaker in a temperature controlled 25 environment temperature dissolved oxygen and ph measurements were recorded throughout experimentation using fixed probes and temperature variation was 0 3 c dissolved oxygen was 1 mg l 1 and averaged 6 5 mg l 1 and ph averaged 7 6 with no systematic variation throughout the experiment flask samples from each replicate set were collected and analyzed at days 0 3 7 14 21 28 42 56 and 70 since start of incubation samples were transferred into pre cleaned septa vials in preparation for separation water was siphoned with a syringe and filtered using whatman glass fiber 0 45 µm 47 mm filters then separated to splits for analyses the remaining sediment sample was transferred to a falcon 300 ml conical bottle then frozen and lyophilized to remove any remaining water the dried sediment samples were ground to a fine powder using a wig l bug mixer and transported to culture tubes the flow chart see fig 5 outlines the laboratory methods for the incubation experiments the six replicate experiments were sampled on each sample data indicated and variability of their results was analyzed to assess experimental error on a number of sample dates the three replicates were pooled during post analyses for cost effectiveness 2 4 analytical methods the dissolved constituents of the water including nitrate no3 ammonium nh4 total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn nitrogen and oxygen stable isotope ratios of nitrate δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 were analyzed at the kentucky geological survey water laboratory for elemental values via analytical methods epa 300 0 epa 350 1 and epa 351 2 respectively and the university of arkansas stabile isotope laboratory for isotopic analysis via analytical methods water samples sent to the arkansas laboratory were shipped overnight on ice powdered sediment samples were weighed into tin capsules and acidified repeatedly with a weak 0 5 m hydrochloric acid to remove inorganic carbon carbonate material inorganic carbon ic cannot be completely combusted at normal ea operating temperatures and typically has a carbon isotope composition greater than organic carbon oc so if not removed the measured carbon isotope composition of the sample will be skewed towards that of partially combusted ic harris et al 2001 total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn δ13c and δ15n were analyzed using a costech 4010 elemental analyzer interfaced with a thermo finnigan conflo iii device to a thermo finnigan delta plus xp isotopic ratio mass spectrometer irms all isotopic results are reported in per mil relative to v pdb and air for δ13c and δ15n respectively average standard deviation for usgs 40 and usgs 41 was 0 06 and 0 13 for δ13c and δ15n respectively average standard deviation for the elemental standard acetanilide was 0 35 and 0 09 for toc and tn respectively average standard deviation for toc tn δ13c and δ15n of unknowns was 0 07 0 01 0 04 and 0 11 respectively for the dissolved nitrate analysis usgs 32 34 35 were used to normalize the raw results with the values of 25 27 9 57 5 the average of the standards was 25 67 27 76 and 57 46 with a standard deviation of 0 29 0 29 and 0 23 respectively quality control included collecting data that were monitored and analyzed throughout the duration of the incubation experiment and the monitoring continuously suggested an aerobic and active system for dissolved and sediment organic matter turnover for example statistical evidence in the form of depleted nh4 i e ammonium was un detectable after day 7 see supplemental tables s1 and s2 columns six in both tables decreasing sediment carbon nitrogen and dissolved organic nitrogen supplemental tables s3 and s4 increasing no3 in all experiment replicates supplemental tables s1 and s2 suggested continuous oxidation and mineralization nitrification as relevant and occurring this was expected due to the sufficient dissolved oxygen to be non limiting throughout the experiment and the constant movement of the fairly low sediment substrate concentration 750 mg sed l 1 deep layers of sediment accrual did not occur at the bottom of the flasks so settling of a buried anaerobic layer was avoided a subset of the analytical results for sediment isotopes was also included in the paper by riddle et al 2022 focused on reasons for isotope conservativeness or lack thereof during sediment fingerprinting those results are combined with the previously un reported dataset and degradation modelling of this study 2 5 degradation and isotopic ratio modelling first order reaction mass balance modelling was carried out following the well used functional approach where net degradation does not separate mineralization and nitrification benbi and richter 2002 the mass balance modelling was carried out for sediment nitrogen dissolved organic nitrogen and sediment organic carbon the method considered the quantity of organic matter susceptible to degradation at a rate k according to first order kinetics stanford and smith 1972 alvarez and alvarez 2000 benbi and richter 2002 as 2 d x j dt k x j where x mg is the amount of decomposable substrate i e sn soc don or doc index j is included to reflect the four different substrates and t is time integration of this equation between time t0 and t yields 3 x t j x 0 j e x p k j t where x0 is the initial amount of substrate and xt is the amount of substrate at time t the amount of accumulated nitrate mg n was also modelled using model outputs from the degradation models equation 3 for mineralized sediment nitrogen and dissolved organic nitrogen at each time step nitrate was modelled as 4 no 3 t no 3 t 1 sn t 1 sn t don t 1 don t nh 4 t 1 nh 4 t where no3 t is the amount of nitrate mg at time step t and no3 t 1 is the amount of nitrate at the previous time step and so forth ammonium was not modelled explicitly but rather used the ammonium data because ammonium was only detectable in the first week of incubation so this portion of ammonium was added directly to the nitrate pool eq 4 assumes all sn and don is nitrified upon mineralization which is justified by the fact that ammonium was un detectable after the first week and that no denitrification occurs as justified by the oxic conditions and data results eq 4 also assumes immobilization and sorption fluxes are small and not reflected in the equation stable isotopic ratio modelling followed the rayleigh fractionation approach with the following assumptions 1 in a mixed system material is continuously removed that contains molecules of at least two isotopic species e g nitrate with 15n and 14n 2 the fractionation associated with the removal process at any instant may be described by the fractionation factor and the enrichment factor and 3 the fractionation factor and enrichment factor remain constant during the process kendall and caldwell 1998 the rayleigh model was applied as 5 δ m x b δ m x a ε rxn l n f b a where a and b are the two substances mx is 13c and 15n carried out separately ε is the enrichment factor and f is the fraction remaining after the process occurs the relative contribution to the nitrate isotopes to nitrate was then modelled to include n atoms originating from the mineralization of sediment and dissolved nitrogen as 6 δ 15 n n o 3 t δ 15 n n o 3 t 1 x n o 3 δ 15 n n o 3 t sn x sn δ 15 n n o 3 t don x don where δ 15 n n o 3 t 1 is the isotopic signature of nitrate at the previous time step δ 15 n n o 3 t sn is the isotopic contribution from sediment nitrogen mineralization at time t δ 15 n n o 3 t don is the isotopic contribution from dissolved organic nitrogen mineralization at time t and x is the mass contribution of each source to the nitrate pool δ 15 n n o 3 sn and δ 15 n n o 3 don were added from the sediment and dissolved pools and reflect the isotopic ratio value of nitrogen that exits those pools mass balance results and the rayleigh model are needed to calculate this value at each time step in equation 6 the δ 15 n of mineralized ammonium is assumed equal to nitrified nitrate originating from sediment nitrogen or dissolved organic nitrogen this is reasonable because all ammonium is used up and this process shows little fractionation when the entire amount of ammonium pool is nitrified both n14h4 and n15h4 molecules are used and neither is preferentially degraded when little ammonium is available the mineralization process is limited by non fractionating ammonium oxidation and the nitrate will tend to have an isotopic signature similar to that of organic nitrogen heaton 1986 only when there is a large amount of ammonium will the process be limited by the nitrification step which in turn causes the generated nitrate to be strongly depleted in 15n heaton 1986 this does not occur in this study as evidenced by the ammonium results equation 6 also assumed the δ 15 n of ammonium was equal to that of sediment nitrogen which was justified by the likely don origin from soil water percolation or runoff first order rate reactions and isotopic enrichment values associated with mineralization of organic nitrogen were optimized during modelling the mass balance modeling was optimized to fit observed data using the calibration statistics root mean square error and coefficient of determination error bounds were determined from replicate measurements and are included on the figures in the results 3 results and discussion 3 1 upland and in stream sediment degradation reflect connectivity regimes sediment degradation over the incubation experiments caused different trajectories for upland versus in stream elemental and isotopic ratio data and in turn differences in reaction rates results are shown in figs 6 and 7 and upland sediment showed greater loss of organic carbon soc and less loss of nitrogen sn compared to in stream sediment changes to stable organic carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios of sediment δ 13c and δ 15n were slightly greater for upland sediment compared to in stream sediment the differences between upland and in stream sediment organic matter degradation are most easily noticeable for the carbon to nitrogen atomic ratio c n fig 6e and 7e the c n of upland sediment decreases during incubation while the c n of in stream sediment increases soc sn δ 13c of soc δ 15n of sn and c n measured during incubation all differed significantly in paired statistical tests of upland and in stream sediment p values less than 0 05 these differences were also reflected in optimized reactions rates in mass balance modelling reported in figs 6 and 7 upland sediment carbon oxidation rates k 3 86 10 3 d 1 range k 2 10 10 3 to 6 39 10 3 d 1 were greater than carbon oxidation rates for in stream sediment k 1 56 10 3 d 1 range k 9 56 10 4 to 4 19 10 3 d 1 upland sediment nitrogen mineralization nitrification rates k 7 89 10 4 range k 3 47 10 4 to 3 69 10 3 d 1 were lower than nitrogen mineralization nitrification rates for in stream sediment k 3 35 10 3 d 1 range k 9 43 10 4 4 13 10 3 d 1 the differences in elemental results for upland versus in stream sediment during the degradation experiments table 3 supports our hypothesis in stream sediment contained approximately two times as much carbon and nitrogen as upland sediment prior to experiments likely reflecting the increased accrual of high organic matter content autochthonous material in this manner sediment organic carbon oxidation and nitrogen mineralization nitrification rates likely reflects the sediment type associated with the different sediment origin as is discussed further below we surmise that the upland sediment degradation rates reflect that of sediment residing in the low gradient stream during periods of high sediment connectivity with the landscape and in stream sediment degradation rates reflect that of sediment temporarily stored in the stream corridor during periods of sediment disconnectivity evidence and justification to these contentions is explained next upland sediment is fluvial sediment that erodes from surface and subsurface erosion across the watershed s surface and transports to the low gradient stream and this concept agrees well with the design of the experiment and the results the upland sediment used in the experiments was collected from transported sediment during a high flow hydrologic event i e highest water flowrate measured in at site 2 on record 1992 2023 in which the stream was highly connected with the landscape fig 4 table 1 during high connectivity events sediment in this system originates from soils via gully erosion mahoney et al 2018 this low gradient stream is transported limited in terms of sediment transport mechanics as are low gradient systems more generally and therefore the fluid s energy in the stream to transport sediment is not sufficient to carry the upland sediment load russo and fox 2012 upland sediment falls out of suspension during very high flow events in low gradient streams such as the south elkhorn russo and fox 2012 and blankets the streambed with sediment from the landscape and its allochthonous organic matter the high flow event considered here was estimated to deposit sediment with an averaged depth of 0 5 cm across the entire streambed the blanketed sediment decreased the carbon concentration of the streambed by approximately 1 gc 100 g sediment ford and fox 2014 this sediment deposit dominated surface layer of the streambed for approximately nine months until benthic autotrophy was able to re establish ford and fox 2014 the initial sediment organic carbon and sediment nitrogen content of the upland sediment soc 1 78 gc 100 g sed sn 0 19 gn 100 g sed table 3 agree well with streambank soil and subsurface soil below 5 cm depth measured for the region campbell et al 2009 fox et al 2010 given the high connectivity of the event and initial carbon and nitrogen concentrations the upland sediment likely contains humified soil organic matter and plant organic matter that has undergone some degree of carbon oxidation and nitrogen mineralization the results of the incubation experiment agree with suggested composition of the upland sediment organic matter degraded from the upland sediment substrate showed an average c n ratio equal to 17 based on pre and post experiment data results this c n ratio agrees with that of litter and soil organic matter for the less than 53 µm size class of soil found in this region campbell et al 2009 taken together results suggest the degradation rates are reflective of carbon and nitrogen losses for the upland sediment originating from the landscape when high connectivity exists for the watershed in stream sediment is hybrid fluvial sediment including sediment that originated in the uplands or eroded from streambanks and integrates algae and other autotrophic organic matter over time this material is continuously eroded from the streambed the majority of the year making up the background sediment load of the baseflow and transports at higher rates during low to moderate storm events when sufficient shearing exits at the bed but disconnectivity exists with the landscape russo and fox 2012 the carbon and nitrogen make up of in stream sediment was shown to change both episodically when some connectivity with the uplands deposits newly arrived sediment to the bed and seasonally due to benthic cycling that includes algae growth stabilization to the sediment deposit and turnover ford and fox 2014 2015 2017a b the in stream sediment used in this study was collected for a time period when the stream was disconnected from the landscape fig 3 and therefore the autochthonous contribution to the sediment was relatively high especially in comparison with the upland sediment for example the initial sediment organic carbon and sediment nitrogen content of the in stream sediment soc 3 72 gc 100 g sed sn 0 35 gn 100 g sed table 3 was nearly double that of the upland sediment given the low connectivity and initial carbon and nitrogen concentrations the in stream sediment used in this study likely contains in stream degraded organic matter originating from soil and plant organic matter and stabilized algae algal stabilization occurs by a coupled biotic abiotic process when algal biomass decomposes to more refractory organic matter compounds in aquatic ecosystems for extended periods lara and thomas 1995 leloup et al 2013 hotchkiss and hall 2015 the results of the incubation experiment agree with suggested composition of the in stream sediment organic matter degraded from the in stream sediment substrate showed an average c n ratio equal to 5 this c n ratio agrees with the c n ratio of algae the empirical chemical formula for algal biomass is c106h263o110n16 suggesting an organic carbon content of 36 nitrogen content 6 4 and estimated c n ratio of 5 68 these values are in agreement with literature derived values of c n between 4 and 10 for algae meyers 1994 and unicellular cellular algae such as phytoplankton and benthic microalgae following a redfield ratio of c n p 106 16 1 c n 6 63 baird and middleton 2004 taken together results suggest the degradation rates are reflective of carbon and nitrogen losses for the in stream sediment that includes a substantial contribution from autochthonous organic matter our hypothesis that sediment carbon oxidation and nitrogen mineralization nitrification rates would show a range of results reflecting connectivity regime was supported by the results however we were surprised by the directional shifts and magnitudes of the differences for example the in stream sediment organic carbon degradation showed a half order magnitude lower oxidation rate as compared to the upland sediment a super position of upland turnover and some contribution of algal turnover might be more expected to provide a greater turnover rate for the in stream sediment given its hybrid make up one explanation for the lower oxidation rate is that the algae portion of the in stream sediment has already reached a fairly recalcitrant state even more recalcitrant than soil organic matter another explanation for the lower oxidation rate is attributed to the likely pre degradation of landscape derived sediment that was deposited to the streambed this allochthonous matter undergoes degradation during temporary storage and in turn some portion of the bioavailable carbon has already been oxidated as a function of residence time the interpretation of the results suggests continuously estimating the pools of allochthonous and autochthonous organic matter content in low gradient streams will be important in stream biogeochemistry studies results support the hypothesis that degradation varies as a function of the sediment connectivity regime for low gradient systems the result shows value because scientists could use the watershed s connectivity regime for predicting biogeochemistry of the stream network the watershed is an integrator of processes and assessing the connectivity state of the system could lead to outgassing and downstream flux estimates as well as state of the system s internal processing this bridging of connectivity theory with stream ecology has received increasing attention in recent years for its potential to predict water quality for example harvey et al 2019 in practice this coupling of connectivity and stream biogeochemistry shows great potential as well stream restoration consultants tend to focus on the physical behavior of the stream and watershed system more akin to connectivity but increasingly pursue a more holistic view of how physical changes shift water quality thompson et al 2018 lammers et al 2020 3 2 degradation rates and isotopic enrichment for sediment in low gradient streams we also discuss the degradation rates and isotopic enrichment for sediment found in this study relative to other types of organic matter in rivers and soils given that these rates are seldom reported the degradation rate results for the low gradient stream figs 6 and 7 are one to two orders magnitude higher than the range considered for sediment organic carbon and sediment nitrogen ford and fox 2015 2017 report k 1 10 5 to 1 10 4 d 1 these results contrast a passive assumption of sediment and place the sediment organic matter as active in these types of systems for example the sediment nitrogen results compare more closely with experiments of degradation of algae and fine particulates from plants ford and fox 2015 yoshimura et al 2008 found fine sized leaf litter from ash f excelsior leaf and oak q robar leaf that compared similarly to the results of this study 1 5 10 3 d 1 and 1 3 10 3 d 1 one scientific report was found to somewhat corroborate our findings and provide further confidence benbi et al 2014 found that mineral associated soil organic nitrogen had a first order reaction rate for mineralization nitrification k 1 0 10 3 d 1 that was just slightly lower than our study based on results herein fluvial sediment transported in the low gradient streams appears more reactive than previously assumed one reason is the mineral associated soil organic matter portion that makes up a substantial component of fluvial sediment has higher reactivity than traditionally assumed cambardella and elliott 1992 benbi et al 2014 another reason is the aerobic conditions of river water transporting fluvial sediment as investigated in this study traditional inference of sediment mineralization nitrification for the fine sized organic matter might extrapolate from coarse and fine particulate organic matter studies ford and fox 2015 these studies typically use a substrate deposited in the bottom of a flask in the laboratory or in a riverbed deposit in the field sinsabaugh et al 1994 jackson and vallaire 2007 micro sensor research has shown oxygen levels can drop off quickly in substrates even in just a few millimeters boudreau and jorgensen 2001 for this reason extrapolation of first order rates for deposited substrates may underpredict first order rates of fluvial sediment that remains well oxygenated central values for carbon isotopic enrichment during oxidation were 0 41 and 1 25 for upland and in stream sediment organic carbon respectively figs 6 and 7 central values for nitrogen isotopic enrichment during mineralization nitrification were 3 47 and 1 53 for upland and in stream sediment nitrogen respectively figs 6 and 7 corresponding fractionation factors were 1 00041 and 1 00125 for upland and in stream sediment organic carbon respectively during oxidation and 1 00347 and 1 00153 for upland and in stream sediment nitrogen respectively during mineralization nitrification no studies to our knowledge present isotopic enrichment or fractionation factors for fluvial sediment from low gradient streams however the isotopic ratio enrichment was reported for carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios during organic matter degradation more generally e g plant litter soil organic matter sediment cores and these studies find isotopic enrichment is generally 2 delwiche and steyn 1970 miyake 1971 freyer and aly 1975 mariotti et al 1981 heaton 1986 kendall et al 2007 möbius 2013 the results in this study agree reasonably well with these ranges 3 3 dissolved nitrogen and isotopic ratio of nitrate dissolved organic nitrogen don decreased during incubation experiments nitrate no3 increased and the stable nitrogen isotopic ratio of nitrate δ 15nno3 decreased over time changes in don no3 and δ 15nno3 followed the same general distribution for both upland sediment and in stream sediment experiments figs 6 and 7 don no3 and δ 15nno3 measured during incubation all did not differ significantly in paired statistical tests of upland and in stream sediment p values 0 05 the lack of differences for don reflect the fact that the same stream water was used in both upland sediment and in stream sediment experiments the water carried the same microbial population which similarly degraded don in both sets of tests the lack of differences for no3 and δ 15nno3 are attributed to the fact that the newly generated nitrate was approximately 65 originated as don while 35 originated as sediment nitrogen the differences in sediment nitrogen degradation by mass for the upland and in stream sediment were not great enough to produce measurable differences for no3 and δ 15nno3 these lack of differences for the dissolved phases were also reflected in optimized modelling results from mass balance modelling figs 6 and 7 optimized rates for mineralization nitrification of don were nearly identical for upland sediment and in stream sediment experiments no3 and δ 15nno3 generation from the sediment and dissolved phases and isotopic ratio changes during testing respectively agreed very well with modelling inputs from first order mass balance modelling and the rayleigh isotopic ratio modelling results the results from the dissolved nitrogen and the isotopic ratio of nitrate provide further confidence in the degradation results carried out in this study when combined with the don turnover the nitrate and isotopic ratio of nitrate provide additional data without additional unknown for analyzing sediment degradation occurring in addition we carry out discussion of dissolved organic nitrogen degradation and nitrate concentration and isotopic ratio changes given that these values are seldom reported in the literature for low order streams results suggest dissolved organic nitrogen mineralization nitrification rates k 1 8 10 2 d 1 degrade with first order reaction rates that are on the upper end of studies for comparison few if any papers to our knowledge are presenting incubation experiment results for dissolved organic nitrogen mineralization nitrification for low order river water as in this study but a number of recent studies carried out dissolved organic matter incubation experiments for lake water vähätalo and zepp 2005 mostovaya et al 2016 vachon et al 2017 our present study found first order rate results k 1 95 10 2 d 1 range 9 00 10 3 to 4 50 10 2 d 1 an order of magnitude higher than those studies for example vahatalo and zepp 2005 focuses on photochemical mineralization of dissolved organic nitrogen in lake water but also presents a pretreatment dark incubation experiment with dissolved inorganic nitrogen mineralization corresponding to a first order reaction rate one order of magnitude lower than our results range for k 2 35 to 3 65 10 3 d 1 as another example some inference is possible based on dissolved organic carbon oxidation in the incubation of lake water substrate conducted by mostovaya et al 2016 where the first order decomposition rate k 1 5 to 6 2 10 3 d 1 was one order of magnitude lower than our results and vachon et al 2017 who found a first order rate for incubation of lake water k 1 1 to 2 3 10 3 d 1 that was one order magnitude lower than our results comparison shows low gradient agriculturally impacted streams may have dissolved organic nitrogen mineralization nitrification rates one order of magnitude greater than lakes the difference is plausible considering the potential source and age of organic matter in the low order rivers as compared to lakes the average c n ratio of dissolved organic matter in the low order stream used in this study was 37 which is much higher than the published range for lakes the c n ratio of dissolved organic matter in temperate lake water averaged 11 5 and ranged from 8 to 18 in the compilation by hecky 1993 dissolved organic matter sources in low order streams likely originates from soil water drainage and runoff that travel from the source soil and litter to the stream with fast transit relative to lake dissolved organic matter that is potentially more highly degraded and recalcitrant due to longer residence time as evidenced by the lower c n ratio or is indicative of oxidation and mineralization of algae nitrate mass increases by substantially from the beginning to the end of the seventy day experiment with implications for low gradient streams this result points to the potential for nitrate variability measured in low gradient streams to originate from dissolved and sediment organic matter degradation as well as landscape delivery of nitrate an average 35 increase of nitrate occurs throughout the experiments one third of the nitrate increase is due to sediment nitrogen mineralization nitrification and two thirds of the nitrate increase is due to dissolved organic nitrogen mineralization nitrification river water used in the study collected from south elkhorn creek had a background nitrate concentration 2 73 mg no3 n l 1 that falls just below the united states national average nitrate level in surface streams with significant agricultural disturbance 3 mg no3 n l 1 and above the united states national average of nitrate in surface streams with urban impacts 1 mg no3 n l 1 dubrovsky et al 2010 scientists have long relied on calculations of total nitrogen when assessing nutrient budgets e g aulenbach et al 2007 and correlations between nitrate concentration and total nitrogen concentration in river water are one way to upscale results nevertheless increased emphasis is being placed on nitrate measurements due to the fact that nitrate is a problem for water quality and at the same time is able to be measured in situ with fairly high resolution 15 min optical sensors pellerin et al 2014 miller et al 2016 the distribution of nitrogen at the beginning of the incubation experiment was 51 nitrate 10 dissolved organic nitrogen 3 ammonium and 36 sediment nitrogen and at the end of the experiment was 64 nitrate and 36 sediment nitrogen the nitrogen distribution shows the slim majority of nitrate initially as well as the importance of sediment nitrogen both at the beginning and end of the 70 day incubation the sediment concentration used in the study 750 mg sed l 1 was a typical concentration for sediment concentration in river water in this region mahoney et al 2018 as opposed to an upper limit and we expect a substantial contribution of nitrogen in rivers to be sediment nitrogen during some conditions pickering and ford 2021 the over one per mil shift of the nitrogen isotopic ratio of nitrate is also worth mentioning this isotopic ratio is often used for source apportionment studies in stream systems in some cases these studies rely on a one per difference for nitrate sources in a basin disregard of changes in the isotopic ratio due to inputs from sediment and dissolved organic matter degradation could produce error in these studies 4 conclusion data results and modelling is used to investigate sediment organic matter degradation in aerobic river water and its influence on water quality for low gradient agriculturally impacted streams the conclusion of the investigation is as follows 1 sediment originated from erosion across the watershed s surface shows higher carbon oxidation rates k 3 9 10 3 d 1 and lower nitrogen mineralization nitrification rates k 7 9 10 4 d 1 compared to sediment originated from the creek s streambed that integrates algae and other autotrophic matter k 1 6 10 3 d 1 and k 3 4 10 3 d 1 differences are attributed to sediment transport of humified and plant matter during storms of high watershed connectivity and sediment transport of autochthonous sediment for low connectivity results support the hypothesis that degradation varies as a function of the sediment connectivity regime for low gradient systems the result shows value because scientists could use the watershed s connectivity regime for predicting sediment fate in the stream network for freshwater biogeochemical cycle studies and for ecological restoration 2 sediment degradation rates were one to two orders magnitude higher than previously assumed sediment rates reflect aerobic waters and place the organic matter as active with degradation rates comparable to reported rates for algae and fine sized leaf litter the results contrast the hypothesis that sediment in rivers is passive or degrades very slowly via anaerobic degradation we hypothesis the streambed contrasts lakes and actively degrades sediment organic matter as turbulent diffusion aerates the surficial layer 3 stable isotopic ratios of sediment change marginally for the two sediment types for carbon ε 0 4 and 1 3 and nitrogen ε 3 5 and 1 5 isotopic enrichment or fractionation factors were not previously reported for fluvial sediment to our knowledge and results may be helpful for parameterizing uncertainty in process based modelling and data driven inversion modelling 4 dissolved organic nitrogen of stream water degraded similarly across all experiments k 1 8 10 2 d 1 and turnover rates were an order of magnitude higher than recent rates reported for lake water the differences are attributed to the sources and age of dissolved organic matter in the low order rivers as compared to lakes and the average c n ratio was 37 as compared 11 5 respectively dissolved organic matter in low order streams appears much more labile than that of lakes 5 nitrate concentration in the solute increased by an average 35 during experiments and the nitrogen stable isotopic ratio of nitrate decreased by over 1 showing the potential of sediment and dissolved organic matter degradation to influence nitrate flux and its isotopic signal the nitrate changes are substantial and place emphasis on including the dissolved sediment and organic matter contributions in

2193,global climate change and rapid urbanization led to frequent extreme rainstorms and waterlogging low impact development lid as an essential measure of urban stormwater control it is necessary to explore the urban hydrological response under low impact development combined with physical experiment and numerical simulation this paper takes the beiyangyuan campus of tianjin university where numerous lid practices have been implemented as the study area the prototype permeable pavement in the campus was scaled down to a laboratory scale for infiltration experiments the results show that the horton infiltration model could describe the infiltration process of permeable concrete and grass planting brick the initial infiltration rate of the permeable concrete is large but decays faster in contrast the infiltration process of the grass planting brick decays slower and the stable infiltration rate and infiltration capacity are higher than that of the permeable concrete the mean infiltration rates measured for the permeable concrete and the grass planting brick were 95 mm hr and 190 mm hr respectively a swmm mike21 coupled model was constructed based on the lid experimental results to explore the effects of the removal or density reduction of the lid practices on surface hydrological processes the results show that permeable pavement performs best in the reduction of runoff volume inundation area and inundation depth while the bio retention cell takes the second place and the sunken greenbelt has limited effect frequent light rainfall is sensitive to the density of lid practices and the implementation of even a tiny percentage 4 of the catchment area of lid practices can be effective in controlling runoff the removal or density reduction of lid practices has little effect on the inundation region but leads to an increased possibility of flood risk due to increasing inundation depth keywords urban hydrological effects low impact development physical experiment numerical simulation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction global climate change is an indisputable fact leading to frequent extreme precipitation events ipcc 2021 accompanied by urban expansion which increases impermeable surfaces the urban flooding disaster is becoming increasingly severe qiu 2012 wu et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 in order to improve the urban water cycle process the concept of low impact development lid has been proposed fisher et al 2007 hamel et al 2013 shafique and kim 2015 che et al 2015 related infrastructures such as bio retention cell bc sunken greenbelt sg and permeable pavement pp are widely used in many countries china started the construction of sponge cities based on the core theory of low impact development in 2014 with significant resources invested in constructing pilot cities every year jia et al 2017 however the mechanism of how lids control the urban stormwater yield and concentration process is still unclear especially the study on the mechanism of lid practices in mitigating urban flood is still relatively weak whether lid practices are effective in solving urban flooding is still an issue being widely debated jia 2017 physical experiment is a typical way of assessing lid performance sun et al 2011 kamali et al 2017 hou et al 2019 song et al 2021 we can easily observe the changes in the local hydrological processes caused by lid practices through physical experiments however lid experiment is hard to represent the hydrological response of the whole city zhang et al 2014a in this situation numerical modeling techniques can be applied to study the urban hydrological response under low impact development at multiple scales currently urban hydrological models such as swmm yin et al 2021 mike urban han et al 2021 and l thia lid li et al 2019 are often used to study the effect of lid practices on urban stormwater runoff reduction and their cost effectiveness the accuracy of the lid parameters in the existing models is impossible to ensure in numerical simulation studies due to the lack of observational experiments on typical lid practices and sufficient measured data and the reliability of simulation results has not yet been confirmed ahiablame et al 2012 in addition the spatial heterogeneity of the study regions and lid practices dilley et al 2005 zhang et al 2014b yang et al 2022 also leads to a significant regional character of the research results therefore obtaining valuable measured parameters from typical lid experiments and integrating them into numerical simulations of urban hydrological processes becomes an important research direction gilroy and mccuen 2009 lisenbee et al 2022 current research on the hydrological response under low impact development based on numerical simulation mainly focuses on the low impact development reconstruction of conventional development regions liu et al 2015 son et al 2017 peng et al 2020 ye and xu 2022 and the optimization of the spatial distribution of lid practices based on single or multiple objectives ahiablame et al 2012 baek et al 2015 eckart et al 2018 xu et al 2018 while the research on actual lid constructed cases is rarely reported in order to further understand the effect of low impact development it is necessary to systematically investigate the urban hydrological response in lid regions on a physical experimental basis in summary studies on the urban hydrological response in lid regions combined with physical experiments and numerical simulations have not yet been thoroughly discussed this work carried out experiments on the infiltration of typical permeable pavement with constant rainfall intensity based on an artificial rainfall experimental system quantitatively analyzed its infiltration characteristics a 1d 2d coupled urban hydrological numerical model of the study area with the experimental results was constructed to systematically quantify the effects of removing lid practices or reducing the density on the urban surface hydrological processes the research objectives of this paper are 1 to quantitatively analyze the infiltration characteristics of typical lid practices based on physical experiments and to apply the measured infiltration parameters to subsequent numerical simulation studies 2 to systematically investigate the surface hydrological response in lid regions based on the constructed swmm mike21 coupled model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data sets this paper takes the beiyangyuan campus of tianjin university as the study area which is located in jinnan district of tianjin china with a latitude and longitude between 117 17 117 20 e and 38 59 39 01 n covering an area of about 2 4 km2 fig 1 the campus has a temperate semi humid continental monsoon climate with four distinct seasons with summer concentrating about 70 of the annual rainfall the study area is a coastal and river alluvial plain with low flat topography and the soil has high salinity and weak infiltration capacity tianjin university is committed to making the beiyangyuan campus a green ecological campus it has implemented many lid practices on campus over the years mainly including bio retention cells sunken greenbelt and permeable pavement therefore as an implemented pilot sponge campus the study area is an exemplary case study for exploring the effect of lid practices on urban hydrological process in this paper the primary data and materials for constructing the model were collected mainly including topographical data of the study area drainage system data tianjin university stormwater utilization and drainage engineering planning etc the above data and materials were provided by the department of logistics and infrastructure of tianjin university gf 2 data https 36 112 130 153 7777 dssplatform productsearch html accessed on 31 october 2022 for the study area were collected to extract the land use type which is shown in fig 1 two observed rainfall events 9 october 2017 and 23 july 2018 and water depth data were collected for parameter calibration and model verification the locations of the rainfall gauge and radar water level gauge in the study area are shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental design according to the distribution of lid practices in the study area the prototype permeable pavement structure within the campus was scaled down to a laboratory scale based on the artificial rainfall experimental system fig s1 a constant rainfall intensity infiltration experiment was designed to identify the infiltration characteristics of two typical permeable pavements quantitatively including permeable concrete and grass planting brick the experimental tank was constructed according to the collected design drawings fig s2 and instructions in tianjin university the surface of the permeable concrete and grass planting brick for experiment is shown in fig 2 the experiment is based on the artificial rainfall method miu 2007 with a constant rainfall intensity of 10 mm min the same experimental initial conditions were controlled through the antecedent dry period in daytime adp daytime the experiment was repeated 3 times to reduce the measure errors when conducting artificial rainfall experiments the outflow process was continuously recorded rainfall can be stopped once the outflow is stabilized ignoring evaporation during the rainfall period the infiltration rate can be expressed by the water balance equation as follows 1 f t i t r t where f t is the infiltration rate at time t mm min i t is the rainfall intensity at time t mm min and r t is the runoff intensity at time t mm min 2 3 design rainstorm lid practices are spatially classified as green infrastructure in sponge city construction also known as small sponges and are used for source control mainly for frequent light rainfall events huang 2018 therefore the design rainstorm return period should not be too large in this paper 1 2 3 and 4 year return period were selected as the design rainstorm with a rainfall duration of 2 hrs due to the lack of observed long term rainfall data series the design rainstorm was calculated based on the equations in tianjin sponge city construction technical guidelines 2016 in the guidelines the entire tianjin city is divided into four rainstorm zones according to the characteristics of rainstorms fig s3 and the study area is located in zone ⅰ according to the guidelines the 1 year return period rainstorm intensity of zone ⅰ is given in table s1 and the calculation formula for the 2 year to 100 year return period rainstorm intensity is as follows 2 q 2141 1 0 7562 lg t t 9 6093 0 6893 where q is the design rainstorm intensity l s hm2 1 t is the rainfall duration min t is the design return period a according to the rainfall intensity under 1 year return period table s1 and formula 2 the 2 hr rainfall intensity and total rainfall under different return periods were calculated as shown in table 1 as the 1 year return period in the tianjin sponge city construction technical guidelines only gives the total rainfall volume but not the rain pattern the 1 year return period rainfall time distribution in this study is obtained by using the time distribution pattern of the 2 to 100 year return period table s2 according to table 1 and table s2 the rainfall process of the 2hr design rainstorm under different return periods is calculated shown in fig 3 2 4 modeling implementation currently existing urban rainfall runoff models such as swmm rui et al 2015 and illu das tsihrintzis and sidan 2008 can meet the needs of urban storm drainage system simulation but cannot simulate surface hydrological processes some researchers have coupled swmm with other 2d surface flow models to simulate surface hydrological processes such as swmm and iber coupling sañudo et al 2020 swmm and mike21 coupling yang et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 based on these previous studies the swmm and mike21 coupled models was established to simulate the hydrological process under lid in this study readers are referred to rossman 2015 dhi 2022 and zhao et al 2021 for more details on the swmm and mike21 models and their coupled approach the reasonable use of remote sensing data to extract information such as buildings helps the division of subcatchments zhang et al 2018 in this paper the land use types including lid practices in the study area were obtained from the gf 2 data combined with field investigations and the green campus construction plan of tianjin university fig 4 a based on the topographic slope drainage network system drainage zoning and land use type the study area was divided into 59 subcatchments with 124 junctions 15 outfalls 2 pumps and 123 conduits the digital elevation model was modified based on the measured building step heights from the field investigation to avoid overestimation of the ponding depth zhao et al 2021 and the final swmm and mike21 coupled model generalization is shown in fig 4b in order to evaluate the reliability of the model the determination coefficient r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the root mean square error rmse were used to quantitatively evaluate the degree of agreement between the simulated and observed water depths in the river the calculation formulas are as follows 3 r 2 i 1 n h o i h o h s i h s 2 i 1 n h o i h o 2 i 1 n h s i h s 2 4 nse 1 i 1 n h o i h s i 2 i 1 n h o i h o 2 5 rmse 1 n i 1 n h s i h o i 2 where h o i and h s i are the observed and simulated water depth at time i m h o and h s are the mean of the observed and simulated water depth respectively m 2 5 scenario design based on the implemented lid practices in the study area lid removal and density reduction scenarios were set up to quantitatively analyze their impact on the surface hydrological processes taking 100 of the existing lid practices in the study area as a reference three lid removal scenarios fig 5 were set 1 the removal of bio retention cells noted as bc 0 2 the removal of permeable pavements including permeable brick grass planting brick and permeable concrete noted as pp 0 3 the removal of sunken greenbelt noted as sg 0 based on the existing lid practices 20 area in proportion to each lid practice was reduced successively to obtain six lid density reduction scenarios fig 6 the removal or density reduction of lid practices does not change the subcatchment to which the lid practices belong considering the actual situation of the lid practices implementation the replacement of the area occupied by the original lid practices after the lid removal or density reduction is described as follows permeable pavement is replaced with impermeable surface sunken greenbelt and bio retention cell are replaced with permeable surface after lid removal or density reduction relevant parameters need to be changed including the impermeability of the subcatchments the area of each lid practice the proportion of impervious area treated the proportion of pervious area treated and the surface width per unit permeable pavement only 3 results 3 1 permeable pavement infiltration characteristics and parameter determination the artificial rainfall system was used to conduct the constant rainfall intensity infiltration experiment for two permeable pavements the horton infiltration model has fewer parameters and can describe the variation of infiltration rate with time course which makes it suitable for application in small urban watersheds therefore the experimental results are fitted with the horton infiltration model to quantitatively analyze the infiltration characteristics of permeable pavements the horton infiltration model horton 1940 describes the infiltration capacity as an exponential relationship with time which is calculated as follows 6 f t f c f 0 f c e k t where f t is the infiltration rate mm s fc is the stable infiltration rate mm s f0 is the initial infiltration rate mm s k is the empirical coefficient which is constant the results of the independent fitting of the permeable pavements under the three experiments are shown in table s3 the determination coefficient r2 ranged from 0 63 to 0 93 for the permeable concrete and from 0 65 to 0 79 for the grass planting brick which presented a good fit and the horton infiltration model was suitable for both permeable pavements in order to increase the sample size the experimental data of each group were fitted in concatenate and the results of the concatenate fit are shown in table 2 and fig 7 from table 2 it can be seen that the permeable concrete has a concatenate fitted r2 of 0 77 and the grass planting brick of 0 65 the overall trend is shown in fig 7 where the permeable concrete exhibits a large initial infiltration rate but a faster decay and the grass planting brick has a slower decay in the infiltration process with a greater stable infiltration rate and infiltration capacity than the permeable concrete that is caused by the fact that the upper structure of the permeable concrete is a high permeability macroporous material with a large initial infiltration rate while the grass planting brick has a larger initial water storage due to the retention effect of planted grass the lid parameters in the swmm model are divided into two main categories one for measured parameters such as thickness and area and the other for calibrated parameters the most important of which is the infiltration parameter in common studies lid infiltration parameters are obtained from model manuals or calibrated with subcatchment parameters all of which have uncertainties compared to the parameters obtained from fundamental lid experiments therefore in this paper the lid infiltration parameters obtained from the above prototype experiments are integrated into the swmm model to improve the reliability of the lid parameters specifically the concatenate fitted parameters are used to obtain the mean infiltration rate by using the equi area method and the results are shown in fig 7 after converting the unit as required in the swmm model the mean infiltration rate of permeable concrete and the grass planting brick were 95 mm hr and 190 mm hr respectively 3 2 parameter calibration and model verification the mike21 model in this paper is only used for 2d surface flow simulations and the effects of wind and coriolis force are ignored thus the main parameters to be calibrated are the hydrological and hydrodynamic parameters in the swmm model the parameters in the swmm model such as conduit diameter length and junction elevation were extracted from the drainage system in the study area parameters such as subcatchment area impervious rate and mean slope were calculated using arcgis the infiltration parameters for permeable concrete and grass planting brick were obtained from the lid experiments as described in section 3 1 the calibrated parameters in the swmm model such as manning s roughness depression storage and subcatchment infiltration parameters are calibrated via the observed water depths and the mike21 simulated water depths in the river in this paper the model parameters were calibrated using the field observed rainfall and water depth data on 9 october 2017 and the model was verified with the field observed rainfall and water depth data on 23 july 2018 fig 8 the results of the model parameter are shown in table s4 and table s5 the simulated and observed water depth of the two historical rainfalls are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the simulated values are in good agreement with the observed values while the model accuracy is quantitatively evaluated by r2 nse and rmse shown in table 3 the model had r2 greater than 0 94 nse greater than 0 86 and rmse of 2 5 cm and 5 6 cm in both the calibration and verification the closer the r2 is to 1 the better the correlation is between the simulated and the observed data the closer the nse is to 1 the better the agreement is between the simulated and the observed data and the smaller the rmse the smaller the error is between the simulated and the observed data overall r2 nse and rmse all indicate an excellent model performance in the calibration and verification nash and sutcliffe 1970 moriasi et al 2007 muthusamy et al 2021 this it be used for subsequent numerical simulation studies 3 3 urban hydrological effects in lid regions based on the swmm and mike21 coupled model constructed for the study area all lid removal and density reduction scenarios were simulated under design rainstorm events of different return periods surface hydrological characteristics such as runoff volume comprehensive runoff coefficient surcharge volume inundation area and inundation depth were obtained to quantitatively analyze the effects of different lid removal and density reduction schemes on urban surface hydrological processes 3 3 1 effects of different lid practices on surface hydrological processes based on the simulation results the runoff volumes comprehensive runoff coefficients and surcharge volumes for different lid removal scenarios under each return period were calculated table 4 as shown in table 4 no surcharge occurs during the 1 year return period for any scenario as rainfall increases the runoff volume comprehensive runoff coefficient and surcharge volume all increase after the lid practices are removed the runoff volume the comprehensive runoff coefficient and the surcharge volume all increase nevertheless the comprehensive runoff coefficient for the sg 0 scenario is much closer to the lid 100 which indicates that the effect of the sunken greenbelt on runoff control is minimal taking the 100 lid scenario as a reference the increase rate in runoff volume inundation area and inundation depth after the lid removal was calculated fig 9 as shown in fig 9 the increase rate in runoff volume inundation area and inundation depth decrease with the increase of rainfall for each scenario which indicates that the control capacity of each lid practice gradually decreases when rainfall increases as shown in fig 9a the increase in runoff volume under the 1 year return period is bc 0 pp 0 sg 0 and the increase in runoff volume under the 2 year to 4 year return period is pp 0 bc 0 sg 0 it indicates that the bio retention cell has the best effect on runoff control during the 1 year return period and more frequent light rainfall when the return period was greater than 2 years the permeable pavement performed better in runoff control but the overall effect was closer to that of the bio retention cell the increase rate in runoff volume from the sunken greenbelt removal gradually decreased from 32 to 6 with limited runoff control in order to eliminate the influence of the total lid implemented area the increased runoff volume from a unit area of each lid practice was calculated fig 9b as shown in fig 9b for increased runoff volume per unit area it is always pp 0 bc 0 sg 0 which indicates that permeable pavement per unit area is the most effective in runoff control as rainfall increases permeable pavement per unit area is more effective in runoff control more than 2 times of bio retention cell and sunken greenbelt per unit area when the return period reaches 2 years as shown in fig 9c in terms of the effect of the inundation area control it is always pp 0 bc 0 sg 0 the inundation area increases after removing each type of lid practice but the simulation results show that the inundation region does not change significantly between scenarios for different return periods fig s4 shows the inundation region for each lid removal scenario for the 4 year return period the distribution characteristics are that no inundation occurs in the central island catchment zone fig 4 where lid practices are concentrated under any of the scenarios the inundation occurs mainly in the midland catchment zone in the northeast and maximum inundation depth occurs in the low lying wetlands in the west as shown in fig 9d the increase rate in inundation depth for the pp 0 and bc 0 scenarios are very close under the 2 and 3 year return periods under the pp 0 scenario a slight increase was found for the 4 year return period and the bc 0 scenario had a decreasing trend which indicates that both permeable pavement and bio retention cell perform better in inundation depth control but the permeable pavement has a more stable control effect the sg 0 scenario shows an overall decreasing trend and the control effect is less than 20 under the 4 year return period the maximum inundation depth considers the most unfavorable situation and is often used as an important basis for assessing urban flooding losses velasco et al 2016 a boxplot of the maximum inundation depth in the study area for each scenario is shown in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 95 of the maximum inundation depths were within 25cm for each scenario the 25 75 interval and mean values show that the maximum inundation depth increased after removing each type of lid practice the increase was comparatively stable but the 2 year return period shows a more concentrated tendency 3 3 2 effects of lid density on surface hydrological processes based on the simulation results the runoff volume comprehensive runoff coefficient and surcharge volume were calculated for each lid density reduction scenario under different return periods table 5 as shown in table 5 no surcharge was generated for each lid density reduction scenario under the 1 year return period the runoff volume comprehensive runoff coefficient and surcharge volume all increase with increasing rainfall and decreasing lid density under the 1 year return period the comprehensive runoff coefficient increases faster after reducing the lid density which indicates that the 1 year return period and more frequent light rainfall are more sensitive to the lid density taking the lid 100 scenario as a reference the increase rate in runoff volume inundation area and inundation depth after the density reduction of the lid practice was calculated fig 11 as shown in fig 11 the increase rate in runoff volume inundation area and inundation depth all decrease with increasing rainfall and increase with decreasing lid density as shown in fig 11a the increase of runoff volume is small for all lid 80 scenarios and even under the 1 year return period the increase rate of runoff volume is less than 20 which indicates that the small reduction in density of the lid practice has a small impact on runoff volume the most significant increases in runoff volume occurred in the lid 0 scenario particularly under the 1 year return period where the increase was quite significant with a dramatic increase from 278 to 551 which suggests that even a tiny percentage 4 of the watershed area of lid practices implemented can be effective in runoff control and the study by ghodsi et al 2020 proposed similar conclusions as shown in fig 11b the increase in inundation area after lid density reduction has a relatively stable increasing trend compared to the effect on runoff volume even a 20 reduction in lid density significantly affects the inundation area under the 1 year return period based on the simulation results the inundation region is generally consistent across the lid density reduction scenarios fig s5 shows the inundation region for the lid density scenario under the 4 year return period and the overall distribution characteristics are similar to the lid removal scenario noteworthy the central island catchment zone does not inundate even under the lid 0 scenario as shown in fig 11c the increase in inundation depth for the lid 80 and lid 60 scenarios is very close under the 3 and 4 year return periods it indicates that the reduction of the lid density by 20 40 has minimal effect on the inundation depth after the return period reaches 3 years meanwhile large increase in inundation depth under the 2 year to 4 year return period occurred in the lid 20 lid 40 and lid 60 scenarios respectively this indicates that the effect of lid density on inundation depth is strongly related to rainfall the maximum inundation depths under the lid density reduction scenarios are shown in fig 12 the 95 quantile inundation depths grow faster after the density reduction while the 25 75 interval and 5 quantile inundation depths grow slowly it indicates that the reduction in lid density has a greater impact on regions with deeper ponding similarly the 25 75 interval under the 2 year return period is significantly reduced and shifted upwards by reducing the density of lid this suggests that lid density reduction has a greater impact on the maximum inundation depth at a light rainfall both the lid removal scenarios and density reduction scenarios show a significant increase rate in runoff volume under the 1 year return period and a rapid decay in increase rate after reaching the 2 year return period this suggests that the lid practice has the best runoff control effect during the 1 year return period and more frequent light rainfall and our work confirms this understanding from the perspective in lid regions the study by zhao et al 2021 on flood losses suggests the greater possibility of flood losses due to inundation depth with increasing rainfall comparing the relationship between the mean and median of maximum inundation depth it is found that the proportion of maximum inundation depth above the mean increases after either lid removal or density reduction considering the strong relationship between maximum inundation depth and flood risk it can be considered that lid removal and density reduction lead to a similar effect which is the increased possibility of flood risk due to increasing inundation depth 4 discussion the infiltration performance of permeable pavement significantly influences its low impact development function song et al 2021 taking advantage of the clear and controllable indoor experimental conditions sambito et al 2021 analyzing its infiltration characteristics through prototype experiments is necessary and key to improving the accuracy of lid parameters in the numerical model in order to ensure the rationality and reliability of the combination of physical experiments and numerical simulations we have made great efforts such as scaling the prototype permeable pavement according to the design drawings and instructions for the experiments considering the significant influence of the antecedent dry period in daytime adp daytime on the infiltration performance wu et al 2022 setting the same adp daytime in the swmm model as in the experiments using the equi area method which is commonly used in hydrological data processing to generalize the mean infiltration rate of the permeable pavement however due to the difference in age and maintenance conditions between the field permeable pavement in the study area and the experimental permeable pavement kumar et al 2016 sambito et al 2021 the uncertainty was inevitably introduced into the numerical model with the development of data collection techniques and urban hydrological models the use of numerical simulations to study the urban hydrological effects is an inevitable development trend xu et al 2020 determining the lid infiltration parameters through physical experiments to improve the reliability of numerical simulations is also an inevitable requirement for the development of refined simulations in general our efforts have provided a set of reliable methods to improve the accuracy of lid parameters in urban hydrological models which is of great significance for reference the maximum increase rate in runoff coefficient after different lid practice removal is only 21 that is due to 60 80 of the lid is still remained in the study area consistent with the conclusion that reducing a small percentage of lid density has little effect on runoff proposed in section 3 2 meanwhile even under the 4 year return period lid 0 scenario the comprehensive runoff coefficient is only 0 42 that is due to the high percentage of permeable area in the study area the mean permeable area proportion is still as high as 65 under the no lid practice scenario thus checking the empirical values of the urban comprehensive runoff coefficient in the china drainage manual 1990 0 42 is within the empirical value range with the limitations of the experimental conditions this study only selects permeable concrete and grass planting brick for physical experiments and permeable brick and other lid infiltration parameters are obtained by calibrating observed water depth data in future studies the lid infiltration experiments can be completed further to explore the local hydrological effect of lid practice furthermore based on the coupled model constructed in this paper combined with the theory of flood risk the effect of lid removal or density reduction on flood risk under extreme precipitation conditions can be further discussed 5 conclusions this paper quantitatively analyses the infiltration characteristics of typical permeable pavements through prototype permeable pavement infiltration experiments on this basis the measured infiltration parameters are adopted in a 1d 2d coupled urban hydrological model constructed for the study area then the effects of lid removal and density reduction on surface hydrological processes in lid regions are further explored the main conclusions are as follows 1 the infiltration process of both permeable pavements can be described by the horton infiltration model with r2 ranging from 0 63 to 0 93 the infiltration process of permeable concrete exhibits a large initial infiltration rate but decays rapidly while the infiltration process of grass planting brick decays relatively slowly the stable infiltration rate and infiltration capacity the latter are higher than those of permeable concrete the mean infiltration rates measured for permeable concrete and grass planting brick were 95 mm hr and 190 mm hr respectively 2 the bio retention cell was most effective in runoff control during frequent light rainfall while permeable pavement performed better with increasing rainfall permeable pavement per unit area has the best runoff control especially after the return period reaches 2 years permeable pavement performs best in terms of inundation area and inundation depth control bio retention cell is also effective for inundation depth control but permeable pavement performs much stably sunken greenbelt has limited effectiveness in terms of runoff volume inundation area and depth control 3 with the 1 year return period and more frequent light rainfall a 20 reduction of lid density has a small impact on runoff but a significant impact on the inundation area meanwhile the implementation of even a tiny percentage 4 of the catchment area of lid practice is effective in runoff control the effect of lid density on inundation depth is much related to rainfall a 20 40 reduction in lid density has minimal effect on inundation depth after the return period reaches 3 years 4 the lid removal and density reduction scenarios show that the effectiveness of lid control decreased with increasing rainfall with the best control effectiveness under the 1 year return period meanwhile lid removal or density reduction has little effect on the inundation region but will lead to an increased possibility of flood risk due to increasing inundation depth credit authorship contribution statement lidong zhao conceptualization methodology

2193,global climate change and rapid urbanization led to frequent extreme rainstorms and waterlogging low impact development lid as an essential measure of urban stormwater control it is necessary to explore the urban hydrological response under low impact development combined with physical experiment and numerical simulation this paper takes the beiyangyuan campus of tianjin university where numerous lid practices have been implemented as the study area the prototype permeable pavement in the campus was scaled down to a laboratory scale for infiltration experiments the results show that the horton infiltration model could describe the infiltration process of permeable concrete and grass planting brick the initial infiltration rate of the permeable concrete is large but decays faster in contrast the infiltration process of the grass planting brick decays slower and the stable infiltration rate and infiltration capacity are higher than that of the permeable concrete the mean infiltration rates measured for the permeable concrete and the grass planting brick were 95 mm hr and 190 mm hr respectively a swmm mike21 coupled model was constructed based on the lid experimental results to explore the effects of the removal or density reduction of the lid practices on surface hydrological processes the results show that permeable pavement performs best in the reduction of runoff volume inundation area and inundation depth while the bio retention cell takes the second place and the sunken greenbelt has limited effect frequent light rainfall is sensitive to the density of lid practices and the implementation of even a tiny percentage 4 of the catchment area of lid practices can be effective in controlling runoff the removal or density reduction of lid practices has little effect on the inundation region but leads to an increased possibility of flood risk due to increasing inundation depth keywords urban hydrological effects low impact development physical experiment numerical simulation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction global climate change is an indisputable fact leading to frequent extreme precipitation events ipcc 2021 accompanied by urban expansion which increases impermeable surfaces the urban flooding disaster is becoming increasingly severe qiu 2012 wu et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 in order to improve the urban water cycle process the concept of low impact development lid has been proposed fisher et al 2007 hamel et al 2013 shafique and kim 2015 che et al 2015 related infrastructures such as bio retention cell bc sunken greenbelt sg and permeable pavement pp are widely used in many countries china started the construction of sponge cities based on the core theory of low impact development in 2014 with significant resources invested in constructing pilot cities every year jia et al 2017 however the mechanism of how lids control the urban stormwater yield and concentration process is still unclear especially the study on the mechanism of lid practices in mitigating urban flood is still relatively weak whether lid practices are effective in solving urban flooding is still an issue being widely debated jia 2017 physical experiment is a typical way of assessing lid performance sun et al 2011 kamali et al 2017 hou et al 2019 song et al 2021 we can easily observe the changes in the local hydrological processes caused by lid practices through physical experiments however lid experiment is hard to represent the hydrological response of the whole city zhang et al 2014a in this situation numerical modeling techniques can be applied to study the urban hydrological response under low impact development at multiple scales currently urban hydrological models such as swmm yin et al 2021 mike urban han et al 2021 and l thia lid li et al 2019 are often used to study the effect of lid practices on urban stormwater runoff reduction and their cost effectiveness the accuracy of the lid parameters in the existing models is impossible to ensure in numerical simulation studies due to the lack of observational experiments on typical lid practices and sufficient measured data and the reliability of simulation results has not yet been confirmed ahiablame et al 2012 in addition the spatial heterogeneity of the study regions and lid practices dilley et al 2005 zhang et al 2014b yang et al 2022 also leads to a significant regional character of the research results therefore obtaining valuable measured parameters from typical lid experiments and integrating them into numerical simulations of urban hydrological processes becomes an important research direction gilroy and mccuen 2009 lisenbee et al 2022 current research on the hydrological response under low impact development based on numerical simulation mainly focuses on the low impact development reconstruction of conventional development regions liu et al 2015 son et al 2017 peng et al 2020 ye and xu 2022 and the optimization of the spatial distribution of lid practices based on single or multiple objectives ahiablame et al 2012 baek et al 2015 eckart et al 2018 xu et al 2018 while the research on actual lid constructed cases is rarely reported in order to further understand the effect of low impact development it is necessary to systematically investigate the urban hydrological response in lid regions on a physical experimental basis in summary studies on the urban hydrological response in lid regions combined with physical experiments and numerical simulations have not yet been thoroughly discussed this work carried out experiments on the infiltration of typical permeable pavement with constant rainfall intensity based on an artificial rainfall experimental system quantitatively analyzed its infiltration characteristics a 1d 2d coupled urban hydrological numerical model of the study area with the experimental results was constructed to systematically quantify the effects of removing lid practices or reducing the density on the urban surface hydrological processes the research objectives of this paper are 1 to quantitatively analyze the infiltration characteristics of typical lid practices based on physical experiments and to apply the measured infiltration parameters to subsequent numerical simulation studies 2 to systematically investigate the surface hydrological response in lid regions based on the constructed swmm mike21 coupled model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data sets this paper takes the beiyangyuan campus of tianjin university as the study area which is located in jinnan district of tianjin china with a latitude and longitude between 117 17 117 20 e and 38 59 39 01 n covering an area of about 2 4 km2 fig 1 the campus has a temperate semi humid continental monsoon climate with four distinct seasons with summer concentrating about 70 of the annual rainfall the study area is a coastal and river alluvial plain with low flat topography and the soil has high salinity and weak infiltration capacity tianjin university is committed to making the beiyangyuan campus a green ecological campus it has implemented many lid practices on campus over the years mainly including bio retention cells sunken greenbelt and permeable pavement therefore as an implemented pilot sponge campus the study area is an exemplary case study for exploring the effect of lid practices on urban hydrological process in this paper the primary data and materials for constructing the model were collected mainly including topographical data of the study area drainage system data tianjin university stormwater utilization and drainage engineering planning etc the above data and materials were provided by the department of logistics and infrastructure of tianjin university gf 2 data https 36 112 130 153 7777 dssplatform productsearch html accessed on 31 october 2022 for the study area were collected to extract the land use type which is shown in fig 1 two observed rainfall events 9 october 2017 and 23 july 2018 and water depth data were collected for parameter calibration and model verification the locations of the rainfall gauge and radar water level gauge in the study area are shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental design according to the distribution of lid practices in the study area the prototype permeable pavement structure within the campus was scaled down to a laboratory scale based on the artificial rainfall experimental system fig s1 a constant rainfall intensity infiltration experiment was designed to identify the infiltration characteristics of two typical permeable pavements quantitatively including permeable concrete and grass planting brick the experimental tank was constructed according to the collected design drawings fig s2 and instructions in tianjin university the surface of the permeable concrete and grass planting brick for experiment is shown in fig 2 the experiment is based on the artificial rainfall method miu 2007 with a constant rainfall intensity of 10 mm min the same experimental initial conditions were controlled through the antecedent dry period in daytime adp daytime the experiment was repeated 3 times to reduce the measure errors when conducting artificial rainfall experiments the outflow process was continuously recorded rainfall can be stopped once the outflow is stabilized ignoring evaporation during the rainfall period the infiltration rate can be expressed by the water balance equation as follows 1 f t i t r t where f t is the infiltration rate at time t mm min i t is the rainfall intensity at time t mm min and r t is the runoff intensity at time t mm min 2 3 design rainstorm lid practices are spatially classified as green infrastructure in sponge city construction also known as small sponges and are used for source control mainly for frequent light rainfall events huang 2018 therefore the design rainstorm return period should not be too large in this paper 1 2 3 and 4 year return period were selected as the design rainstorm with a rainfall duration of 2 hrs due to the lack of observed long term rainfall data series the design rainstorm was calculated based on the equations in tianjin sponge city construction technical guidelines 2016 in the guidelines the entire tianjin city is divided into four rainstorm zones according to the characteristics of rainstorms fig s3 and the study area is located in zone ⅰ according to the guidelines the 1 year return period rainstorm intensity of zone ⅰ is given in table s1 and the calculation formula for the 2 year to 100 year return period rainstorm intensity is as follows 2 q 2141 1 0 7562 lg t t 9 6093 0 6893 where q is the design rainstorm intensity l s hm2 1 t is the rainfall duration min t is the design return period a according to the rainfall intensity under 1 year return period table s1 and formula 2 the 2 hr rainfall intensity and total rainfall under different return periods were calculated as shown in table 1 as the 1 year return period in the tianjin sponge city construction technical guidelines only gives the total rainfall volume but not the rain pattern the 1 year return period rainfall time distribution in this study is obtained by using the time distribution pattern of the 2 to 100 year return period table s2 according to table 1 and table s2 the rainfall process of the 2hr design rainstorm under different return periods is calculated shown in fig 3 2 4 modeling implementation currently existing urban rainfall runoff models such as swmm rui et al 2015 and illu das tsihrintzis and sidan 2008 can meet the needs of urban storm drainage system simulation but cannot simulate surface hydrological processes some researchers have coupled swmm with other 2d surface flow models to simulate surface hydrological processes such as swmm and iber coupling sañudo et al 2020 swmm and mike21 coupling yang et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 based on these previous studies the swmm and mike21 coupled models was established to simulate the hydrological process under lid in this study readers are referred to rossman 2015 dhi 2022 and zhao et al 2021 for more details on the swmm and mike21 models and their coupled approach the reasonable use of remote sensing data to extract information such as buildings helps the division of subcatchments zhang et al 2018 in this paper the land use types including lid practices in the study area were obtained from the gf 2 data combined with field investigations and the green campus construction plan of tianjin university fig 4 a based on the topographic slope drainage network system drainage zoning and land use type the study area was divided into 59 subcatchments with 124 junctions 15 outfalls 2 pumps and 123 conduits the digital elevation model was modified based on the measured building step heights from the field investigation to avoid overestimation of the ponding depth zhao et al 2021 and the final swmm and mike21 coupled model generalization is shown in fig 4b in order to evaluate the reliability of the model the determination coefficient r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the root mean square error rmse were used to quantitatively evaluate the degree of agreement between the simulated and observed water depths in the river the calculation formulas are as follows 3 r 2 i 1 n h o i h o h s i h s 2 i 1 n h o i h o 2 i 1 n h s i h s 2 4 nse 1 i 1 n h o i h s i 2 i 1 n h o i h o 2 5 rmse 1 n i 1 n h s i h o i 2 where h o i and h s i are the observed and simulated water depth at time i m h o and h s are the mean of the observed and simulated water depth respectively m 2 5 scenario design based on the implemented lid practices in the study area lid removal and density reduction scenarios were set up to quantitatively analyze their impact on the surface hydrological processes taking 100 of the existing lid practices in the study area as a reference three lid removal scenarios fig 5 were set 1 the removal of bio retention cells noted as bc 0 2 the removal of permeable pavements including permeable brick grass planting brick and permeable concrete noted as pp 0 3 the removal of sunken greenbelt noted as sg 0 based on the existing lid practices 20 area in proportion to each lid practice was reduced successively to obtain six lid density reduction scenarios fig 6 the removal or density reduction of lid practices does not change the subcatchment to which the lid practices belong considering the actual situation of the lid practices implementation the replacement of the area occupied by the original lid practices after the lid removal or density reduction is described as follows permeable pavement is replaced with impermeable surface sunken greenbelt and bio retention cell are replaced with permeable surface after lid removal or density reduction relevant parameters need to be changed including the impermeability of the subcatchments the area of each lid practice the proportion of impervious area treated the proportion of pervious area treated and the surface width per unit permeable pavement only 3 results 3 1 permeable pavement infiltration characteristics and parameter determination the artificial rainfall system was used to conduct the constant rainfall intensity infiltration experiment for two permeable pavements the horton infiltration model has fewer parameters and can describe the variation of infiltration rate with time course which makes it suitable for application in small urban watersheds therefore the experimental results are fitted with the horton infiltration model to quantitatively analyze the infiltration characteristics of permeable pavements the horton infiltration model horton 1940 describes the infiltration capacity as an exponential relationship with time which is calculated as follows 6 f t f c f 0 f c e k t where f t is the infiltration rate mm s fc is the stable infiltration rate mm s f0 is the initial infiltration rate mm s k is the empirical coefficient which is constant the results of the independent fitting of the permeable pavements under the three experiments are shown in table s3 the determination coefficient r2 ranged from 0 63 to 0 93 for the permeable concrete and from 0 65 to 0 79 for the grass planting brick which presented a good fit and the horton infiltration model was suitable for both permeable pavements in order to increase the sample size the experimental data of each group were fitted in concatenate and the results of the concatenate fit are shown in table 2 and fig 7 from table 2 it can be seen that the permeable concrete has a concatenate fitted r2 of 0 77 and the grass planting brick of 0 65 the overall trend is shown in fig 7 where the permeable concrete exhibits a large initial infiltration rate but a faster decay and the grass planting brick has a slower decay in the infiltration process with a greater stable infiltration rate and infiltration capacity than the permeable concrete that is caused by the fact that the upper structure of the permeable concrete is a high permeability macroporous material with a large initial infiltration rate while the grass planting brick has a larger initial water storage due to the retention effect of planted grass the lid parameters in the swmm model are divided into two main categories one for measured parameters such as thickness and area and the other for calibrated parameters the most important of which is the infiltration parameter in common studies lid infiltration parameters are obtained from model manuals or calibrated with subcatchment parameters all of which have uncertainties compared to the parameters obtained from fundamental lid experiments therefore in this paper the lid infiltration parameters obtained from the above prototype experiments are integrated into the swmm model to improve the reliability of the lid parameters specifically the concatenate fitted parameters are used to obtain the mean infiltration rate by using the equi area method and the results are shown in fig 7 after converting the unit as required in the swmm model the mean infiltration rate of permeable concrete and the grass planting brick were 95 mm hr and 190 mm hr respectively 3 2 parameter calibration and model verification the mike21 model in this paper is only used for 2d surface flow simulations and the effects of wind and coriolis force are ignored thus the main parameters to be calibrated are the hydrological and hydrodynamic parameters in the swmm model the parameters in the swmm model such as conduit diameter length and junction elevation were extracted from the drainage system in the study area parameters such as subcatchment area impervious rate and mean slope were calculated using arcgis the infiltration parameters for permeable concrete and grass planting brick were obtained from the lid experiments as described in section 3 1 the calibrated parameters in the swmm model such as manning s roughness depression storage and subcatchment infiltration parameters are calibrated via the observed water depths and the mike21 simulated water depths in the river in this paper the model parameters were calibrated using the field observed rainfall and water depth data on 9 october 2017 and the model was verified with the field observed rainfall and water depth data on 23 july 2018 fig 8 the results of the model parameter are shown in table s4 and table s5 the simulated and observed water depth of the two historical rainfalls are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the simulated values are in good agreement with the observed values while the model accuracy is quantitatively evaluated by r2 nse and rmse shown in table 3 the model had r2 greater than 0 94 nse greater than 0 86 and rmse of 2 5 cm and 5 6 cm in both the calibration and verification the closer the r2 is to 1 the better the correlation is between the simulated and the observed data the closer the nse is to 1 the better the agreement is between the simulated and the observed data and the smaller the rmse the smaller the error is between the simulated and the observed data overall r2 nse and rmse all indicate an excellent model performance in the calibration and verification nash and sutcliffe 1970 moriasi et al 2007 muthusamy et al 2021 this it be used for subsequent numerical simulation studies 3 3 urban hydrological effects in lid regions based on the swmm and mike21 coupled model constructed for the study area all lid removal and density reduction scenarios were simulated under design rainstorm events of different return periods surface hydrological characteristics such as runoff volume comprehensive runoff coefficient surcharge volume inundation area and inundation depth were obtained to quantitatively analyze the effects of different lid removal and density reduction schemes on urban surface hydrological processes 3 3 1 effects of different lid practices on surface hydrological processes based on the simulation results the runoff volumes comprehensive runoff coefficients and surcharge volumes for different lid removal scenarios under each return period were calculated table 4 as shown in table 4 no surcharge occurs during the 1 year return period for any scenario as rainfall increases the runoff volume comprehensive runoff coefficient and surcharge volume all increase after the lid practices are removed the runoff volume the comprehensive runoff coefficient and the surcharge volume all increase nevertheless the comprehensive runoff coefficient for the sg 0 scenario is much closer to the lid 100 which indicates that the effect of the sunken greenbelt on runoff control is minimal taking the 100 lid scenario as a reference the increase rate in runoff volume inundation area and inundation depth after the lid removal was calculated fig 9 as shown in fig 9 the increase rate in runoff volume inundation area and inundation depth decrease with the increase of rainfall for each scenario which indicates that the control capacity of each lid practice gradually decreases when rainfall increases as shown in fig 9a the increase in runoff volume under the 1 year return period is bc 0 pp 0 sg 0 and the increase in runoff volume under the 2 year to 4 year return period is pp 0 bc 0 sg 0 it indicates that the bio retention cell has the best effect on runoff control during the 1 year return period and more frequent light rainfall when the return period was greater than 2 years the permeable pavement performed better in runoff control but the overall effect was closer to that of the bio retention cell the increase rate in runoff volume from the sunken greenbelt removal gradually decreased from 32 to 6 with limited runoff control in order to eliminate the influence of the total lid implemented area the increased runoff volume from a unit area of each lid practice was calculated fig 9b as shown in fig 9b for increased runoff volume per unit area it is always pp 0 bc 0 sg 0 which indicates that permeable pavement per unit area is the most effective in runoff control as rainfall increases permeable pavement per unit area is more effective in runoff control more than 2 times of bio retention cell and sunken greenbelt per unit area when the return period reaches 2 years as shown in fig 9c in terms of the effect of the inundation area control it is always pp 0 bc 0 sg 0 the inundation area increases after removing each type of lid practice but the simulation results show that the inundation region does not change significantly between scenarios for different return periods fig s4 shows the inundation region for each lid removal scenario for the 4 year return period the distribution characteristics are that no inundation occurs in the central island catchment zone fig 4 where lid practices are concentrated under any of the scenarios the inundation occurs mainly in the midland catchment zone in the northeast and maximum inundation depth occurs in the low lying wetlands in the west as shown in fig 9d the increase rate in inundation depth for the pp 0 and bc 0 scenarios are very close under the 2 and 3 year return periods under the pp 0 scenario a slight increase was found for the 4 year return period and the bc 0 scenario had a decreasing trend which indicates that both permeable pavement and bio retention cell perform better in inundation depth control but the permeable pavement has a more stable control effect the sg 0 scenario shows an overall decreasing trend and the control effect is less than 20 under the 4 year return period the maximum inundation depth considers the most unfavorable situation and is often used as an important basis for assessing urban flooding losses velasco et al 2016 a boxplot of the maximum inundation depth in the study area for each scenario is shown in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 95 of the maximum inundation depths were within 25cm for each scenario the 25 75 interval and mean values show that the maximum inundation depth increased after removing each type of lid practice the increase was comparatively stable but the 2 year return period shows a more concentrated tendency 3 3 2 effects of lid density on surface hydrological processes based on the simulation results the runoff volume comprehensive runoff coefficient and surcharge volume were calculated for each lid density reduction scenario under different return periods table 5 as shown in table 5 no surcharge was generated for each lid density reduction scenario under the 1 year return period the runoff volume comprehensive runoff coefficient and surcharge volume all increase with increasing rainfall and decreasing lid density under the 1 year return period the comprehensive runoff coefficient increases faster after reducing the lid density which indicates that the 1 year return period and more frequent light rainfall are more sensitive to the lid density taking the lid 100 scenario as a reference the increase rate in runoff volume inundation area and inundation depth after the density reduction of the lid practice was calculated fig 11 as shown in fig 11 the increase rate in runoff volume inundation area and inundation depth all decrease with increasing rainfall and increase with decreasing lid density as shown in fig 11a the increase of runoff volume is small for all lid 80 scenarios and even under the 1 year return period the increase rate of runoff volume is less than 20 which indicates that the small reduction in density of the lid practice has a small impact on runoff volume the most significant increases in runoff volume occurred in the lid 0 scenario particularly under the 1 year return period where the increase was quite significant with a dramatic increase from 278 to 551 which suggests that even a tiny percentage 4 of the watershed area of lid practices implemented can be effective in runoff control and the study by ghodsi et al 2020 proposed similar conclusions as shown in fig 11b the increase in inundation area after lid density reduction has a relatively stable increasing trend compared to the effect on runoff volume even a 20 reduction in lid density significantly affects the inundation area under the 1 year return period based on the simulation results the inundation region is generally consistent across the lid density reduction scenarios fig s5 shows the inundation region for the lid density scenario under the 4 year return period and the overall distribution characteristics are similar to the lid removal scenario noteworthy the central island catchment zone does not inundate even under the lid 0 scenario as shown in fig 11c the increase in inundation depth for the lid 80 and lid 60 scenarios is very close under the 3 and 4 year return periods it indicates that the reduction of the lid density by 20 40 has minimal effect on the inundation depth after the return period reaches 3 years meanwhile large increase in inundation depth under the 2 year to 4 year return period occurred in the lid 20 lid 40 and lid 60 scenarios respectively this indicates that the effect of lid density on inundation depth is strongly related to rainfall the maximum inundation depths under the lid density reduction scenarios are shown in fig 12 the 95 quantile inundation depths grow faster after the density reduction while the 25 75 interval and 5 quantile inundation depths grow slowly it indicates that the reduction in lid density has a greater impact on regions with deeper ponding similarly the 25 75 interval under the 2 year return period is significantly reduced and shifted upwards by reducing the density of lid this suggests that lid density reduction has a greater impact on the maximum inundation depth at a light rainfall both the lid removal scenarios and density reduction scenarios show a significant increase rate in runoff volume under the 1 year return period and a rapid decay in increase rate after reaching the 2 year return period this suggests that the lid practice has the best runoff control effect during the 1 year return period and more frequent light rainfall and our work confirms this understanding from the perspective in lid regions the study by zhao et al 2021 on flood losses suggests the greater possibility of flood losses due to inundation depth with increasing rainfall comparing the relationship between the mean and median of maximum inundation depth it is found that the proportion of maximum inundation depth above the mean increases after either lid removal or density reduction considering the strong relationship between maximum inundation depth and flood risk it can be considered that lid removal and density reduction lead to a similar effect which is the increased possibility of flood risk due to increasing inundation depth 4 discussion the infiltration performance of permeable pavement significantly influences its low impact development function song et al 2021 taking advantage of the clear and controllable indoor experimental conditions sambito et al 2021 analyzing its infiltration characteristics through prototype experiments is necessary and key to improving the accuracy of lid parameters in the numerical model in order to ensure the rationality and reliability of the combination of physical experiments and numerical simulations we have made great efforts such as scaling the prototype permeable pavement according to the design drawings and instructions for the experiments considering the significant influence of the antecedent dry period in daytime adp daytime on the infiltration performance wu et al 2022 setting the same adp daytime in the swmm model as in the experiments using the equi area method which is commonly used in hydrological data processing to generalize the mean infiltration rate of the permeable pavement however due to the difference in age and maintenance conditions between the field permeable pavement in the study area and the experimental permeable pavement kumar et al 2016 sambito et al 2021 the uncertainty was inevitably introduced into the numerical model with the development of data collection techniques and urban hydrological models the use of numerical simulations to study the urban hydrological effects is an inevitable development trend xu et al 2020 determining the lid infiltration parameters through physical experiments to improve the reliability of numerical simulations is also an inevitable requirement for the development of refined simulations in general our efforts have provided a set of reliable methods to improve the accuracy of lid parameters in urban hydrological models which is of great significance for reference the maximum increase rate in runoff coefficient after different lid practice removal is only 21 that is due to 60 80 of the lid is still remained in the study area consistent with the conclusion that reducing a small percentage of lid density has little effect on runoff proposed in section 3 2 meanwhile even under the 4 year return period lid 0 scenario the comprehensive runoff coefficient is only 0 42 that is due to the high percentage of permeable area in the study area the mean permeable area proportion is still as high as 65 under the no lid practice scenario thus checking the empirical values of the urban comprehensive runoff coefficient in the china drainage manual 1990 0 42 is within the empirical value range with the limitations of the experimental conditions this study only selects permeable concrete and grass planting brick for physical experiments and permeable brick and other lid infiltration parameters are obtained by calibrating observed water depth data in future studies the lid infiltration experiments can be completed further to explore the local hydrological effect of lid practice furthermore based on the coupled model constructed in this paper combined with the theory of flood risk the effect of lid removal or density reduction on flood risk under extreme precipitation conditions can be further discussed 5 conclusions this paper quantitatively analyses the infiltration characteristics of typical permeable pavements through prototype permeable pavement infiltration experiments on this basis the measured infiltration parameters are adopted in a 1d 2d coupled urban hydrological model constructed for the study area then the effects of lid removal and density reduction on surface hydrological processes in lid regions are further explored the main conclusions are as follows 1 the infiltration process of both permeable pavements can be described by the horton infiltration model with r2 ranging from 0 63 to 0 93 the infiltration process of permeable concrete exhibits a large initial infiltration rate but decays rapidly while the infiltration process of grass planting brick decays relatively slowly the stable infiltration rate and infiltration capacity the latter are higher than those of permeable concrete the mean infiltration rates measured for permeable concrete and grass planting brick were 95 mm hr and 190 mm hr respectively 2 the bio retention cell was most effective in runoff control during frequent light rainfall while permeable pavement performed better with increasing rainfall permeable pavement per unit area has the best runoff control especially after the return period reaches 2 years permeable pavement performs best in terms of inundation area and inundation depth control bio retention cell is also effective for inundation depth control but permeable pavement performs much stably sunken greenbelt has limited effectiveness in terms of runoff volume inundation area and depth control 3 with the 1 year return period and more frequent light rainfall a 20 reduction of lid density has a small impact on runoff but a significant impact on the inundation area meanwhile the implementation of even a tiny percentage 4 of the catchment area of lid practice is effective in runoff control the effect of lid density on inundation depth is much related to rainfall a 20 40 reduction in lid density has minimal effect on inundation depth after the return period reaches 3 years 4 the lid removal and density reduction scenarios show that the effectiveness of lid control decreased with increasing rainfall with the best control effectiveness under the 1 year return period meanwhile lid removal or density reduction has little effect on the inundation region but will lead to an increased possibility of flood risk due to increasing inundation depth credit authorship contribution statement lidong zhao conceptualization methodology

reaches can affect solute concentrations and loads in baseflow and stormflow runoff we monitored interannual changes in precipitation groundwater and stream runoff before and after the implementation

dc a before after control impact baci experimental design was used compared to the control catchment average recharge of the groundwater system of the rsc riparian area increased by 0 76 m in the post

restoration stormflow urban data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the chemical composition of stream water in predominately urban and agricultural landscapes is an integration of naturally derived solutes and pollutants from various watershed land uses and disturbances allan 2004 williams et al 2005 key pollutants such as nitrogen n phosphorus p and sediments solids in stream water generally increase with the extent of watershed development paul and meyer 2001 sweeney et al 2004 shuster et al 2005 grimm et al 2005 lowe and likens 2005 meyer et al 2005 williamson et al 2008 although the mechanisms responsible for this degradation vary according to the type of landscape and stressors walsh et al 2005 wenger et al 2009 walsh et al 2012 palmer et al 2014 it is well known that increased stormwater runoff and resultant pollutant loads to streams associated with watershed development commonly deteriorate physical habitat conditions and ecological processes doyle et al 2000 poff and zimmerman 2010 vietz et al 2012 although it has been shown that traditional stream restoration designs where in stream structures are used to stabilize the existing channel have a limited capacity to reduce pollutant export bernhardt et al 2005 kenney et al 2012 some novel designs may be more effective as a watershed management strategy to recover biophysical conditions and decrease pollutant loads craig et al 2008 designs increasingly used in urban watersheds of the mid atlantic viz maryland include regenerative stormwater conveyances rscs valley restorations and stream wetland complexes filoso and palmer 2011 filoso et al 2015 williams et al 2017 these designs are commonly used because they modify the hydrology and hydraulics of streams such that they may not only help prevent channel erosion smith et al 2010 but also potentially enhance nutrient processing and retain suspended materials i e sediment and solids that would otherwise be transported to receiving waters that have become eutrophic with chronic turbidity problems resulting from these inputs e g chesapeake bay williams et al 2017 much of the impetus behind the extensive implementation of stream restoration projects in the chesapeake bay watershed is in large part because counties in states with drainage basins that influence chesapeake bay receive substantial credits for stream restoration that can be used to meet their total maximum daily load tmdl requirements schueler and stack 2013 us epa 2013 williams et al 2017 not surprisingly the recent drive to fulfill tmdl mandates has resulted in a large increase in the number of stream restorations in this region despite frequent claims attesting to the effectiveness and benefits of novel stream restoration designs made by many water resource managers and practitioners there remain many uncertainties bernhardt et al 2005 lammers and bledsoe 2017 that can be partially attributed to a paucity of investments in high quality and robust monitoring in particular rsc structures have increasingly been utilized as both stream restorations and also stormflow outflow retrofits berg and underwood 2007 brown et al 2010 unfortunately there has been a tendency to conflate the two because of their analogous designs but each has fundamental hydrological differences that strongly regulate their performance for the purposes of this study we define stream restoration rscs as having perennial streamflow characteristics within a major portion of the restoration reach thus these structures commonly have a substantial stream restoration reach downstream of the headwater that is located in areas that have relatively constant groundwater inputs that make a substantial contribution of baseflow to total flow by contrast rscs as stormwater retrofits tend to be located in artificially created headwaters wherein flow is primarily episodic and driven by stormflow runoff from storm drain outflows these stormwater retrofits commonly have intermittent flow with little to no groundwater inputs i e baseflow to most of the structural reach and thus riffles tend to run dry between storm events many stormwater retrofit rscs are also located in areas of relatively high topographical relief there are several short term studies that have evaluated various aspects of rscs as stormflow retrofits cizek et al 2017a cizek et al 2017b fanelli et al 2017 koryto et al 2017 and thompson et al 2018 conducted a multi year study addressing the hydrological impacts and pollutant reduction capabilities of a stream restoration rsc in a predominately agricultural catchment however rigorous multi year studies of stream restoration rsc performance in predominately urban catchments are undocumented hence studies addressing such questions are needed to provide better guidance to the water resource management and stream restoration practitioner communities the current study uses a before after control impact baci experimental design to study the performance of an rsc implemented as a stream restoration in an urban landscape herein is a comprehensive analysis of the pre to post restoration changes measured in hydrological metrics i e precipitation runoff and groundwater and pollutants i e nutrients sediments bacteria heavy metals for an rsc constructed in a subcatchment of the rock creek watershed in washington dc the main objectives of this project were to determine the capacity of the rsc to modify groundwater and runoff dynamics and reduce pollutants loads 2 study sites the rsc and control sites were located in the piedmont physiographic province of washington dc and were separated by a distance of about 4 km fig 1 the rsc in this study was built in an incised headwater channel using sand and riparian soils as fill substrates organic matter was included in the construction and was about 17 by volume with much of this generally spread over the surface of the structure after construction this organic matter was meant to provide an initial source of labile carbon and establish detritus to facilitate the re colonization of macroinvertebrates and the biogeochemical processes e g denitrification that are present in healthy stream environments large woody debris such as tree trunks branches and root wads were included within the channel to serve as habitat and as an additional organic carbon source weirs were made from large boulders of ironstone also known as bog iron and silica cobble riffles were installed to create a series of step pools fig 2 and s1 in supplementary material the incised stream reach was transformed into a series of step pools meant to enhance water retention throughflow in the riffle berms and percolation to the groundwater table thereby decreasing the magnitude of peak stormwater runoff during precipitation events a small number of trees were felled during construction and the area disturbed was not much wider than the incised stream channel or drainage ditch the final rsc structure was 275 m in length with a slope 8 and consisted of 8 cobble riffles 10 ironstone cascades and 17 ponds land use land cover in the rsc and control catchments was predominately forest which accounted for about 54 and 71 of their total areas respectively tree canopy was included as part of the medium density residential areas that comprised most of the catchments the rsc and control catchments were 15 ha and 8 ha and 26 and 14 impervious respectively 3 material and methods 3 1 hydrological measurements the rsc flume at the downstream outflow 76 cm h flume was installed within a reach with a deeply incised stream bank by contrast the control stream had a 61 cm h flume flow from the rsc reach in the post restoration period was measured at a cement culvert 20 m downstream of the original site the rating curve for this site was derived from engineering specifications for the culvert s dimensions and calibrated by estimating discharge at different stage heights using a marsh mcbirney flow meter sites were outfitted with automated water samplers isco 6712 placed inside fiberglass housings iscos were activated remotely by modem instantaneous discharge was measured using the cross sectional area method rantz 1982 at the rsc inflow sampling site all locations utilized pressure transducers hobo u20 001 04 to record continuous stage height and these were programmed to record pressure and temperature at 5 minute intervals pressure transducer data were adjusted for barometric pressure with data from a pressure transducer located in the fiberglass housing at each flume site rain intensity and depth were measured using a tipping bucket rain gauge hobo rg3 m and a plastic tenite bulk volume collector co located in a residential area of the rsc catchment gauges were unobstructed by objects such as overhanging trees precipitation and stream stage records for each storm event were evaluated for the entire study period to ensure that there were no artifacts associated with these data that could affect our deposition and runoff estimates 3 2 sampling water samples were collected and discharge was measured at the inflow and outflow of the rsc stream reach and outflow of the control stream reach over a wide range of hydrological conditions i e low and high flow events baseflow samples were collected at least monthly with 12 hour antecedent dry periods and stormflow twice quarterly over the entire rising and falling limbs of hydrographs resulting from discrete precipitation events 0 2 mm stormflow samples were collected at 20 minute intervals i e 3 samples per 1 l bottle hourly using the isco automated samplers and a subset of these samples commonly 5 to 10 depending on the duration of the event were volume integrated for analysis baseflow was collected with automated samplers as pre event stream water and otherwise collected manually as grab samples water samples were collected in 1 l high density polyethylene hdpe bottles that were acid washed and rinsed copiously with analytical grade deionized water diw sample aliquots were generally filtered 24 h after an event using pre rinsed glass fiber filters gf f whatman 0 7 µm nominal pore size filtered water samples were stored in pre washed hdpe bottles new bottles were leached with diw for 24 h used bottles were acid washed and rinsed copiously with diw samples were kept on ice and in the dark while in transit to the laboratory generally within 6 h after an event when samples were not analyzed immediately filtered aliquots were frozen until analysis particulate material in the remaining unfiltered sample water was collected on pre combusted glass fiber filters 500 c for 1 5 h 3 3 parameters

tests sigmaplot 12 bacterial counts i e enterococci were analyzed from unfiltered samples taken over the rising peak and falling limbs of the stormflow hydrographs these samples were kept on ice and

product of flow and enterococci concentration data as colony forming units epa method 1600 2006 hobo dissolved oxygen do probes hobo u26 001 were used at each site to measure continuous do concentrations and streamwater temperatures at 5 minute intervals 3 4 solute concentration and flux estimates stormflow water samples were integrated by combining aliquots of water from the series of samples collected over the stormflow hydrograph proportional aliquots were combined into one sample representing a volume weighted mean concentration vwm of each constituent thus vwm concentrations were calculated as 1 vwm c i q i q i where ci is the observed solute concentration of the water sample interval i q i is the discharge volume liters for the sample interval i and the denominator is the of discharge volume for all sample intervals that represent the entire stormflow hydrograph solute fluxes were computed for each sampling station as a product of the average of all vwm concentrations eq 1 and the total discharge over the period of interest i e annual or pre and post restoration periods event based fluxes were calculated similarly using the discharge and vwm concentration data from individual events thus solute loads or fluxes f for each sampling station were calculated as 2 f vwm q where the vwm at each station is defined by eq 1 and q is the estimated total volume of water discharged during the period of interest i e annual pre and post restoration periods or individual stormflow events 3 5 rapid biological assessments biological assessments to characterize and quantify benthic macroinvertebrate populations were conducted in the spring of each year of the study at both the rsc and control watersheds consequently these assessments were done twice in the pre restoration phase of this project 2013 and 2014 and twice in the post restoration phase 2015 and 2016 the procedures used are outlined in the maryland stream waders volunteer stream monitoring manual https dnr maryland gov streams publications swmanual2015 pdf and where applicable the maryland biological stream survey manual https dnr maryland gov streams publications r4manual pdf macroinvertebrate identification was done by the maryland department of natural resources md dnr macroinvertebrate data were used in two indices the hilsenhoff biotic index hbi and the shannon wiener diversity index swdi the hbi is a measure of how pollution tolerant the macroinvertebrate community is whereas the swdi is measure of the diversity of the macroinvertebrate community weighted by the abundance of each taxon the hbi score indicates the degree of macroinvertebrate tolerance to water quality conditions 3 6 subsurface water recharge and temperature subsurface recharge was estimated using pvc casings with flush well screens installed in groundwater well holes drilled using a mud type soil auger wells were installed in 4 transects perpendicular to the stream in the rsc catchment for a total of 12 wells approximately 1 m below the groundwater table s lowest annual level to ensure continuous submergence of the pts throughout the study wells were installed approximately 0 2 to 0 6 m from the restored streambank and about 1 to 1 5 m apart the number of wells installed at the control catchment was limited to 3 due to the rocky soil these were installed about 0 5 m from the stream bank at the bottom mid and upper reaches of the stream pressure transducers were installed at the bottom of the pvc wells and were removed approximately monthly to download data all wells were vented and groundwater data were corrected for barometric pressure transducer data were calibrated during each download by measuring the distance from the soil surface to the water table determined by inserting a pvc pipe marked in mm increments inside each well and tapping the end against the surface of the water table 4 results 4 1 sampling effort a similar number of baseflow samplings and stormflow events were analyzed from the rsc inflow rsc outflow and control outflow flume sites during both the pre and post restoration periods table s1 in supplementary material the representativeness of stormflow sampling varied according to categories of different storm sizes storm sizes ranging from 4 to 10 mm represented about 30 and 35 of the total number of storm events that occurred in the pre and post restoration periods respectively of these storm events 6 and 4 were sampled for stormflow in the pre and post restoration periods respectively and this category represented 2 of total stormflow runoff from the rsc catchment by contrast storm sizes 50 mm represented only 2 to 3 of the total number of storm events that occurred over the pre and post restoration periods with 50 and 70 sampled for stormflow respectively this is the largest category of storm sizes and represented 42 and 48 of the total stormflow runoff from the rsc catchment for the pre and post restoration periods respectively 4 2 precipitation total precipitation volumes for the pre and post restoration study periods were 1 638 and 2 224 mm respectively with 184 mm during the construction period fig 3 the range in monthly volumes from the beginning of the study to the end of stormflow sampling i e until august 2016 was similar in both the pre and post restoration periods from about 30 to 200 mm the average monthly precipitation in the pre and post restoration periods was 96 and 93 mm respectively approximately 199 28 and 345 storm events of measurable precipitation at the rsc site occurred in the pre restoration and post restoration periods respectively the largest monthly volumes of precipitation typically occurred in the late spring to early summer with a maximum monthly volume of around 220 mm the largest daily event recorded in the pre restoration period was 77 mm whereas that of the post restoration period was 86 mm 4 3 stream and air temperatures between site differences in stream and air temperatures derived from pressure transducers at the rsc and control catchment sampling stations were small throughout the study ambient air temperature had the highest variability with lower temperatures than either stream site in the winter months the winters of 2014 and 2015 were unseasonably cold with air temperatures decreasing to 11 c and 17 4 c respectively data recorded on in stream and barometric pressure transducers at the rsc study sites also had small differences in average temperatures both between sites and compared to ambient air mean streamwater temperatures in the rsc catchment were slightly higher than those of the control catchment 13 5 vs 12 3 c respectively likely because of the location of the pressure transducer next to a road culvert and the lack of a forest canopy in this area no significant change in streamwater temperature occurred in the rsc catchment in the post compared to the pre construction periods likely because most of the forested canopy remained intact 4 4 stream discharge discharge at the study sites varied between the rsc and control sites with characteristically higher flows for most events at the rsc site this is primarily because of the larger size of the rsc catchment compared to that of control 13 4 and 14 7 ha in pre and post restoration periods vs 7 8 ha respectively land use of this additional area included in the rsc catchment of the post restoration period was virtually identical to that of the pre restoration catchment area the entire catchment is sewered and the added stream length from the pre to the post restoration sampling location was only 20 m which is the equivalent of only a 7 increase nevertheless we evaluated whether the slightly larger size of the rsc catchment in the post restoration period would influence our pre and post restoration comparisons by doing a preliminary sampling to compare the differences in chemistry at the two locations we determined over a one month period that there were no significant differences in either baseflow n 5 or stormflow n 2 chemistry no3 cl so4 tn and tss concentrations or discharge at the two locations the rsc and control catchment streams had very different baseflow and no flow characteristics for instance in the pre restoration period baseflow was observed at the control flume approximately half of the year compared to about 85 of the year at the rsc flume by contrast there was less baseflow in the control catchment during the post restoration period compared to the pre restoration period and continuous baseflow in the rsc catchment precipitation and discharge records for both sites indicate that the number of days per year that stormflow occurred in the pre and post restoration periods was similar the biggest difference between sites was the number of days that there was no baseflow observed at the control site about 130 and 262 days per year in the pre and post restoration periods respectively long no flow periods in the control catchment were likely because of the relatively smaller forested area contributing to baseflow and a sandy floodplain that had developed just upstream of the flume that flow percolated into during low flow periods although the study began in december 2012 we used the hydrological data for a one year period prior to the restoration i e june 2013 through may 2014 and a two year period after the restoration i e august 2014 through july 2016 to calculate runoff metrics we have high confidence in the discharge measurements during these periods annual runoff coefficients i e the ratio of runoff to precipitation for the rsc and control catchments were 52 and 25 in the pre restoration period and 50 and 32 in the post restoration period respectively total runoff was lower by 18 in the rsc catchment and higher by 8 in the control catchment in the post compared to the pre restoration period baseflow and stormflow were lower by 4 and 25 in the rsc catchment respectively and baseflow was lower by 23 and stormflow was higher by 16 in the control catchment in the post compared to the pre restoration period fig 4 these percentages were virtually identical in the post restoration water years of 2015 and 2016 because total annual rainfall and snow deposition was similar i e 1087 and 1108 mm respectively 4 5 water quality mean baseflow and vwm stormflow concentrations varied by collection site table 1 significant differences for baseflow and stormflow concentrations in the pre and the post restoration periods for each sampling station were determined using nonparametric tests whereas at the rsc inflow and control outflow sites there were only 3 constituents in baseflow and stormflow respectively that had significantly lower concentrations in the post compared to the pre restoration periods table s2 in supplementary material p 0 05 most constituents in baseflow and stormflow at the rsc outflow had significantly lower concentrations in particular no3 and po4 in both baseflow and stormflow and tss and the particulate fractions of n and p in stormflow at the rsc outflow were significantly lower in the post restoration compared to the pre restoration period fig 5 figure s2 in supplementary material by contrast nh4 and don concentrations were both significantly higher in baseflow of the post restoration period compared to the pre restoration period in the rsc outflow we observed increases in concentrations of heavy metals from the pre to the post restoration period at both the rsc and control sites that could not be explained by environmental variables this created a positive bias that we assume was the result of increased sensitivity of the instrumentation i e icp oes or a change in methodology used for the analysis of heavy metals at the analytical lab nasl but neither could be confirmed consequently to avoid attributing possible changes in heavy metal concentrations to the rsc comparisons such as those made in table 3 and table s2 were not done with heavy metals rather heavy metal concentrations were compared in baseflow and stormflow of the rsc outflow with those of the control outflow independently for the pre and post restoration periods in a comparison of the rsc outflow to the control outflow the rsc had significantly lower concentrations of cd in baseflow in the pre restoration period and cu and pb in stormflow of the post restoration period table s3 in supplementary material by contrast fe concentrations were higher in baseflow of the rsc outflow compared to the control outflow in the pre restoration period and in both baseflow and stormflow in the post restoration period at the outflow compared to the inflow of the rsc there were significantly lower concentrations of most water quality constituents in baseflow in both the pre and post restoration periods table s4 in supplementary material by contrast the same comparison for stormflow indicates that significantly lower concentrations occurred only in the post restoration period for most constituents 4 6 dissolved oxygen concentrations stream water in the rsc and control catchments exhibited seasonality in do concentrations throughout the study with the highest concentrations in the winter and lowest in the summer monthly average do concentrations varied between about 7 and 11 mg l at the control and 3 to 12 mg l at the rsc outflow fig 6 do concentrations between the outflow sites of the rsc and control catchments tracked one another commonly to within about 1 mg l in the spring of 2015 do in the rsc decreased proportionally more than at the control consequently do concentrations in the spring and summer months of the post restoration period at the rsc outflow site were lower than in the pre restoration period and fell below the criteria threshold during may through september 2015 and the summer of 2016 4 7 solute loads catchment areas were used in conjunction with the vwm solute concentrations and discharge measurements to estimate annual area yields from each sampling station tables 2 and 3 loads of the constituents measured in this study were generally lower in the post compared to the pre restoration period in the rsc catchment of all the constituents measured some of the largest contrasts in the rsc outflow were evident with area yields of tn tp and tss as percentages tn tp and tss decreased by 59 54 and 76 from the pre to the post restoration period in the rsc catchment in contrast to the control catchment that decreased by roughly half these percentages i e 23 28 and 40 respectively table 3 of the metals analyzed area yields of fe were higher by a factor of 5 times in the same type of comparison despite non significant differences in bacteria concentrations in stormflow area yields were higher in the control and substantially lower in the rsc catchment change of 10 and 40 respectively in the post compared to the pre restoration period table 3 4 8 groundwater recharge the distance below the forest floor to the water table was routinely measured in 12 and 3 wells in the rsc and control catchments respectively throughout the study period water tables in both catchments were positively correlated decreasing to their lowest levels in the months of august to october fig 7 an abrupt increase in the water table heights of all wells in the rsc catchment occurred from groundwater recharge after construction in june july 2014 recharge increased the average water table level in the rsc catchment by about 76 cm after which time the water table levels in both catchments were again well correlated 4 9 rapid biological assessments biological surveys of the rsc and control catchment streams were done each spring of 2013 through 2016 the hbi and swdi were low in the pre restoration period at both sites and remained considerably low throughout the post restoration period tables s5 and s6 in supplementary material 5 discussion 5 1 effects of restoration on runoff and groundwater this study is a comprehensive evaluation of the performance i e nutrient and sediment reduction capacity of an rsc located in a largely urban catchment rigorous measurements of precipitation discharge and groundwater were used to characterize changes in hydrology associated with this type of stream restoration design and how they contribute to potential solute load reductions hydrological measurements are critical to determining restoration performance because environmental variables such as differences in total precipitation volumes in the pre and post restoration periods can account for the majority of either increases or decreases in nutrient and sediment loads rather than what can be attributed to inherent solute retention and loss capabilities of the structure itself fortunately the performance of the rsc in this study was not influenced by large differences in inter annual precipitation for example although monthly precipitation volumes varied by up to a factor of 15 throughout the study total precipitation volumes in the pre and post restoration periods 17 and 24 months that coincide with water quality measurements respectively had similar average monthly values of 96 and 93 mm respectively and thus precipitation in the post restoration period was lower by only about 3 nevertheless runoff estimates were calculated using the one year period prior to and two year period after the restoration to avoid potential bias in our estimates of annual precipitation for the 17 month pre restoration period by not including a full second year of data with the late spring and early summer months i e june and july 2012 which preceded the onset of the project that commonly have larger rainfall totals more importantly we have high confidence in our discharge estimates during this pre restoration period average annual runoff was 18 lower in the rsc catchment and 8 higher in the control catchment in the post compared to the pre restoration period respectively because average annual precipitation was only about 15 lower in the post restoration period compared to the annual precipitation measured in the pre restoration period and this percentage approximates the decrease in runoff the runoff coefficients in the rsc catchment are similar in both periods i e 52 and 50 respectively the higher runoff coefficient in the control catchment in the post compared to the pre restoration period i e 32 and 25 respectively is likely due to higher precipitation in this catchment area than in the rsc catchment the control catchment was located about 4 km sw of the rsc catchment and did not have a tipping bucket rain gauge due to the lack of an accessible site free of overhanging trees the construction of the rsc had pronounced effects on baseflow and stormflow in the post restoration period baseflow and stormflow were 4 and 25 lower in the rsc catchment respectively in the post compared to the pre restoration period the observed changes in the runoff in the post restoration period of the rsc were likely due to increased retention of stormwater runoff in the step pools and percolation to the groundwater reservoir this percolation resulted in groundwater recharge and an increase in the groundwater table of about 76 cm increased storage capacity of the groundwater reservoir from this recharge resulted in baseflow at the outflow even during dry periods which in the pre restoration period in the rsc catchment resulted in intermittent no flow conditions however no flow conditions were observed throughout the structure during the late summer and fall coinciding with the lowest groundwater levels fig 7 and were more prevalent in the first several ponds of the upper reaches that were less influenced by groundwater inputs in the control catchment baseflow was 23 lower and stormflow was 16 higher in the post compared to the pre restoration period baseflow was dramatically lower despite higher stormflow because as mentioned previously of an extensive buildup of sediment and sand from bedload transport that developed upstream of the h flume that allowed baseflow to percolate and circumvent the flume during low flow periods bedload transport was commonly observed and although it was not quantified was substantial however bedload transport was virtually eliminated after the construction of rsc except during extremely high stormflow events that altered the structural integrity of the restoration design hydrological modifications of the rsc decreased solute loads not only by increasing percolation to the groundwater reservoir thereby reducing stormflow runoff but also by increasing the retention times of water temporarily stored in the step pools the rsc design creates more convoluted flowpaths of streamwater and shunts solutes through the filtration media which promotes the uptake and loss of nutrients and settling of particulates kasahara and hill 2006 kasahara and hill 2008 measurements of groundwater level in our wells indicated that variations were dynamic with rapid increases in response to precipitation events figures s3 and s4 in supplementary materials average values of hydraulic head determined from our groundwater well data indicate that the interaction with the groundwater table and hyporheic zone is highly variable and depends on catchment topography and groundwater table height generally during periods when the groundwater table is higher november may a significant positive gradient towards the stream developed in some well transects that is presumed to enhance hyporheic inputs to streamwater wells positioned in the hyporheic zone of each well transect had no3 and po4 concentrations that were significantly lower than in stream water williams et al 2016 thus biogeochemical processes enhanced by organic matter inputs robertson 2010 williams et al 2016 included in the construction as well as increased contact with the stream bed filtration media and riparian hyporheic zone peterjohn and correll 1984 lawrence et al 2013 welsh et al 2017 due to the elevated groundwater table in the rsc were likely responsible for lower concentrations of solutes such as inorganic nutrients i e no3 and po4 that are potentially affected by biological uptake or loss processes measured at the outflow in the post compared to the pre restoration period and compared to those of the control table 1 5 2 effects of restoration on solute concentrations and loads the product of runoff volume and solute concentrations generally resulted in lower constituent loads and area yields in the post compared to the pre restoration period in the rsc catchment nevertheless as indicated previously total annual runoff was 18 lower in the post restoration period in the rsc catchment which had the effect of magnifying reductions in area yields accordingly our analyses included an evaluation of significant differences in solute concentrations from the pre to post restoration period these analyses indicate that n and p commonly had significantly lower concentrations at the outflow compared to the inflow of the restoration reach in both the pre and post restoration periods table 1 by contrast tss concentrations in the pre restoration environment were significantly higher because of streambank erosion and streambed scouring concentrations of tss in stormflow at the inflow of the rsc reach were not significantly higher even though higher concentrations were observed during a house construction in the post restoration period it is also noteworthy that a house construction occurred in the pre restoration period of the control resulting in significantly lower concentrations and net area yields of tss and other particulates in the post restoration period that are likely an artifact of this disturbance table 3 figure s2 in supplementary material although we were unable to collect complete records of sediment losses during the construction period in the rsc catchment estimates indicate that this accounts for 10 of the area yield reductions calculated from the pre to the post restoration period a few constituents had higher concentrations in the post compared to the pre restoration period in the rsc ammonium and don were both higher in baseflow after construction likely a result of enhanced ammonification and uptake of inorganic n and conversion to organic matter which appears to be a fairly common process observed at recent stream restoration sites williams et al 2017 in baseflow doc and fe were also significantly higher in concentration in the post compared to the pre restoration period and fe was the only solute to increase in stormflow as well we speculate that the increase in fe concentrations in the rsc was derived from a combination of fe in construction materials i e ironstone and sand and natural soils of the area that were in contact with labile doc from organic matter embedded in the structure williams et al 2016 nevertheless differences in doc concentrations between the rsc and control catchments in the post restoration period were relatively small i e 4 4 mg l 1 vs 2 6 mg l 1 in baseflow and 6 0 mg l 1 and 8 6 mg l 1 in stormflow respectively and suggest that conditions were not favorable for the growth of iron oxidizing bacteria and associated flocculate emerson et al 2010 indeed other than surface biofilms of this bacteria observed in the rsc ponds in the fall very little fe flocculate was observed throughout the restoration reach for the duration of the study organic matter in another rsc structure located in a watershed with predominately agricultural and forested land use covers were observed to contribute much higher doc jordan et al 2017 and fe concentrations to streamwater that likely accentuated biogeochemical processes such as denitrification robertson 2010 nevertheless other than a brief period during the fall of 2016 after the rsc construction when biofilms of fe oxidizing bacteria were observed we did not measure a pulse of higher doc concentrations in either stream or groundwater williams et al 2016 that could account for significant no3 loss and enhanced hypoxia anoxia due to higher bacterial productivity this effect however has been observed in other rscs and thus likely depends on site specific attributes such as the type and quantity of organic matter used and whether it is thoroughly mixed within the top layer of the sand filtration media rather than spread on the surface in this study the only time that no3 concentrations in the rsc outflow were below detection occurred in the first 6 months of the post restoration period suggesting that such effects are probably transient and diminish as labile doc is consumed other conditions in the aquatic environment changed as a result of the rsc construction for example do concentrations in the post compared to the pre restoration period in the rsc catchment decreased below the 5 mg l criteria threshold during the summer and fall months of 2015 and 2016 this decrease was likely due to hypoxia that developed in the rsc ponding basins during low flow periods and was reflected in the outflow of the catchment enhanced hypoxic and anoxic conditions in the stream that support the reduction of organic sulfur to sulfides and subsequent oxidation to so4 in surface waters may explain in part why so4 was the only constituent to have significantly higher concentrations at the outflow compared to the inflow in stormflow of the post restoration period table s4 we surmise that lower do conditions in conjunction with organic matter also promote the reduction of fe and increase in fe concentrations in stream water as evidenced by the significantly higher fe concentrations in post restoration baseflow and stormflow compared to those in the pre restoration period moreover the development of biofilms of fe oxidizing bacteria on the ponds commonly occurred during hypoxic periods and was accentuated during leaf fall 5 3 macroinvertebrates and bacteria other parameters that were measured in this study included benthic macroinvertebrates and bacteria the loss of aquatic macroinvertebrates is common in urbanized streams due to a variety of factors king et al 2011 such as altered flow regimes king et al 2016 elevated nutrient and salt concentrations and higher water temperatures compared to reference streams göbel et al 2007 corsi et al 2015 somers et al 2013 not surprisingly measurable improvement in the benthic macroinvertebrate community was not observed and thus populations remained in the fair to poor range for the indices i e hbi and swdi used to characterize the systems in the post restoration period in both the rsc and control catchments this lack of measurable improvement is likely due to the persistence of influential stressors such as cl concentrations which were higher in the post compared to the pre restoration period table 1 and primarily derived from road salting in the winter it is also possible that a longer post restoration period is needed to reconstitute healthier macroinvertebrate communities at many stream restoration sites likewise we did not observe significantly lower concentrations of enterococci between the study periods albeit concentrations in the rsc were substantially lower in the post restoration period table 1 given the high variability in the concentrations of enterococci measured it is likely that statistically lower concentrations would have been detected with a larger sample size 6 conclusions results of the current study indicate that rscs as stream restorations impact hydrological dynamics and can significantly decrease pollutant loads from highly urbanized watersheds however an important distinction is that whereas rscs as stormwater retrofit tend to decrease loads more from a higher infiltration capacity and percolation of stormwater runoff to groundwater rscs as stream restoration have less infiltration capacity because they tend to be water saturated for much of the year due to elevated groundwater levels that create neutral to positive hydraulic gradients toward the stream the hydrological distinction between rscs as stream restorations and stormwater retrofits is evidenced by the differences in substantially lower runoff coefficients in comparisons of rsc structures as stormwater retrofits in other studies cizek et al 2017a cizek et al 2017b fanelli et al 2017 koryto et al 2017 with that of the stream restoration rsc in the current study and respective control thus when stream restoration rscs are well saturated from high volumes of antecedent precipitation and or a strong groundwater influence i e groundwater levels intersecting with stream level then they are most likely just conveying water downstream with throughflow occurring in the sand fill media within the cobble riffles the groundwater influence varies seasonally and is generally strongest during the months of november through may though this influence in other rscs as stream restorations will likely depend on the inherent characteristics of the structure and catchment as well as the extent to which the groundwater table is elevated after construction figures s3 and s4 in supplementary material thus pollutant reductions in stream restoration rscs occur not only from the infiltration of stormwater runoff during drier periods of low antecedent precipitation and groundwater tables but also from increased retention times that allow for enhanced solute processing and particulate settling of both base and stormflow we assume based on the hydrological evidence presented herein that these types of restorations given equivalent precipitation deposition both in terms of total volume but also timing and intensity would result in slightly lower runoff i e lower runoff coefficients thus enhancing load reductions for those solutes that have lower concentrations in the post compared to the pre restoration environment practitioners and water resource managers alike have been touting the advantages of relatively novel stream restorations such as rscs since their introduction without strong corroborating scientific evidence results of study provide evidence that rscs decrease pollutant loads and improve natural hydrological functions thus rscs as a stream restoration design have the potential to be used as an effective best management practice bmp to improve water quality and help attain tmdl goals for

restoration stormflow urban data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the chemical composition of stream water in predominately urban and agricultural landscapes is an integration of naturally derived solutes and pollutants from various watershed land uses and disturbances allan 2004 williams et al 2005 key pollutants such as nitrogen n phosphorus p and sediments solids in stream water generally increase with the extent of watershed development paul and meyer 2001 sweeney et al 2004 shuster et al 2005 grimm et al 2005 lowe and likens 2005 meyer et al 2005 williamson et al 2008 although the mechanisms responsible for this degradation vary according to the type of landscape and stressors walsh et al 2005 wenger et al 2009 walsh et al 2012 palmer et al 2014 it is well known that increased stormwater runoff and resultant pollutant loads to streams associated with watershed development commonly deteriorate physical habitat conditions and ecological processes doyle et al 2000 poff and zimmerman 2010 vietz et al 2012 although it has been shown that traditional stream restoration designs where in stream structures are used to stabilize the existing channel have a limited capacity to reduce pollutant export bernhardt et al 2005 kenney et al 2012 some novel designs may be more effective as a watershed management strategy to recover biophysical conditions and decrease pollutant loads craig et al 2008 designs increasingly used in urban watersheds of the mid atlantic viz maryland include regenerative stormwater conveyances rscs valley restorations and stream wetland complexes filoso and palmer 2011 filoso et al 2015 williams et al 2017 these designs are commonly used because they modify the hydrology and hydraulics of streams such that they may not only help prevent channel erosion smith et al 2010 but also potentially enhance nutrient processing and retain suspended materials i e sediment and solids that would otherwise be transported to receiving waters that have become eutrophic with chronic turbidity problems resulting from these inputs e g chesapeake bay williams et al 2017 much of the impetus behind the extensive implementation of stream restoration projects in the chesapeake bay watershed is in large part because counties in states with drainage basins that influence chesapeake bay receive substantial credits for stream restoration that can be used to meet their total maximum daily load tmdl requirements schueler and stack 2013 us epa 2013 williams et al 2017 not surprisingly the recent drive to fulfill tmdl mandates has resulted in a large increase in the number of stream restorations in this region despite frequent claims attesting to the effectiveness and benefits of novel stream restoration designs made by many water resource managers and practitioners there remain many uncertainties bernhardt et al 2005 lammers and bledsoe 2017 that can be partially attributed to a paucity of investments in high quality and robust monitoring in particular rsc structures have increasingly been utilized as both stream restorations and also stormflow outflow retrofits berg and underwood 2007 brown et al 2010 unfortunately there has been a tendency to conflate the two because of their analogous designs but each has fundamental hydrological differences that strongly regulate their performance for the purposes of this study we define stream restoration rscs as having perennial streamflow characteristics within a major portion of the restoration reach thus these structures commonly have a substantial stream restoration reach downstream of the headwater that is located in areas that have relatively constant groundwater inputs that make a substantial contribution of baseflow to total flow by contrast rscs as stormwater retrofits tend to be located in artificially created headwaters wherein flow is primarily episodic and driven by stormflow runoff from storm drain outflows these stormwater retrofits commonly have intermittent flow with little to no groundwater inputs i e baseflow to most of the structural reach and thus riffles tend to run dry between storm events many stormwater retrofit rscs are also located in areas of relatively high topographical relief there are several short term studies that have evaluated various aspects of rscs as stormflow retrofits cizek et al 2017a cizek et al 2017b fanelli et al 2017 koryto et al 2017 and thompson et al 2018 conducted a multi year study addressing the hydrological impacts and pollutant reduction capabilities of a stream restoration rsc in a predominately agricultural catchment however rigorous multi year studies of stream restoration rsc performance in predominately urban catchments are undocumented hence studies addressing such questions are needed to provide better guidance to the water resource management and stream restoration practitioner communities the current study uses a before after control impact baci experimental design to study the performance of an rsc implemented as a stream restoration in an urban landscape herein is a comprehensive analysis of the pre to post restoration changes measured in hydrological metrics i e precipitation runoff and groundwater and pollutants i e nutrients sediments bacteria heavy metals for an rsc constructed in a subcatchment of the rock creek watershed in washington dc the main objectives of this project were to determine the capacity of the rsc to modify groundwater and runoff dynamics and reduce pollutants loads 2 study sites the rsc and control sites were located in the piedmont physiographic province of washington dc and were separated by a distance of about 4 km fig 1 the rsc in this study was built in an incised headwater channel using sand and riparian soils as fill substrates organic matter was included in the construction and was about 17 by volume with much of this generally spread over the surface of the structure after construction this organic matter was meant to provide an initial source of labile carbon and establish detritus to facilitate the re colonization of macroinvertebrates and the biogeochemical processes e g denitrification that are present in healthy stream environments large woody debris such as tree trunks branches and root wads were included within the channel to serve as habitat and as an additional organic carbon source weirs were made from large boulders of ironstone also known as bog iron and silica cobble riffles were installed to create a series of step pools fig 2 and s1 in supplementary material the incised stream reach was transformed into a series of step pools meant to enhance water retention throughflow in the riffle berms and percolation to the groundwater table thereby decreasing the magnitude of peak stormwater runoff during precipitation events a small number of trees were felled during construction and the area disturbed was not much wider than the incised stream channel or drainage ditch the final rsc structure was 275 m in length with a slope 8 and consisted of 8 cobble riffles 10 ironstone cascades and 17 ponds land use land cover in the rsc and control catchments was predominately forest which accounted for about 54 and 71 of their total areas respectively tree canopy was included as part of the medium density residential areas that comprised most of the catchments the rsc and control catchments were 15 ha and 8 ha and 26 and 14 impervious respectively 3 material and methods 3 1 hydrological measurements the rsc flume at the downstream outflow 76 cm h flume was installed within a reach with a deeply incised stream bank by contrast the control stream had a 61 cm h flume flow from the rsc reach in the post restoration period was measured at a cement culvert 20 m downstream of the original site the rating curve for this site was derived from engineering specifications for the culvert s dimensions and calibrated by estimating discharge at different stage heights using a marsh mcbirney flow meter sites were outfitted with automated water samplers isco 6712 placed inside fiberglass housings iscos were activated remotely by modem instantaneous discharge was measured using the cross sectional area method rantz 1982 at the rsc inflow sampling site all locations utilized pressure transducers hobo u20 001 04 to record continuous stage height and these were programmed to record pressure and temperature at 5 minute intervals pressure transducer data were adjusted for barometric pressure with data from a pressure transducer located in the fiberglass housing at each flume site rain intensity and depth were measured using a tipping bucket rain gauge hobo rg3 m and a plastic tenite bulk volume collector co located in a residential area of the rsc catchment gauges were unobstructed by objects such as overhanging trees precipitation and stream stage records for each storm event were evaluated for the entire study period to ensure that there were no artifacts associated with these data that could affect our deposition and runoff estimates 3 2 sampling water samples were collected and discharge was measured at the inflow and outflow of the rsc stream reach and outflow of the control stream reach over a wide range of hydrological conditions i e low and high flow events baseflow samples were collected at least monthly with 12 hour antecedent dry periods and stormflow twice quarterly over the entire rising and falling limbs of hydrographs resulting from discrete precipitation events 0 2 mm stormflow samples were collected at 20 minute intervals i e 3 samples per 1 l bottle hourly using the isco automated samplers and a subset of these samples commonly 5 to 10 depending on the duration of the event were volume integrated for analysis baseflow was collected with automated samplers as pre event stream water and otherwise collected manually as grab samples water samples

samples collected over the stormflow hydrograph proportional aliquots were combined into one sample representing a volume weighted mean concentration vwm of each constituent thus vwm concentrations were calculated as 1 vwm c i q i q i where ci is the observed solute concentration of the water sample interval i q i is the discharge volume liters for the sample interval i and the denominator is the of discharge volume for all sample intervals that represent the entire stormflow hydrograph solute fluxes were computed for each sampling station as a product of the average of all vwm concentrations eq 1 and the total discharge over the period of interest i e annual or pre and post restoration periods event based fluxes were calculated similarly using the discharge and vwm concentration data from individual events thus solute loads or fluxes f for each sampling station were calculated as 2 f vwm q where the vwm at each station is defined by eq 1 and q is the estimated total volume of water discharged during the period of interest i e annual pre and post restoration periods or individual stormflow events 3 5 rapid biological assessments biological assessments to characterize and quantify benthic macroinvertebrate populations were conducted in the spring of each year of the study at both the rsc and control watersheds consequently these assessments were done twice in the pre restoration phase of this project 2013 and 2014 and twice in the post restoration phase 2015 and 2016 the procedures used are outlined in the maryland stream waders volunteer stream monitoring manual https dnr maryland gov streams publications swmanual2015 pdf and where applicable the maryland biological stream survey manual https dnr maryland gov streams publications r4manual pdf macroinvertebrate identification was done by the maryland department of natural resources md dnr macroinvertebrate data were used in two indices the hilsenhoff biotic index hbi and the shannon wiener diversity index swdi the hbi is a measure of how pollution tolerant the macroinvertebrate community is whereas the swdi is measure of the diversity of the macroinvertebrate community weighted by the abundance of each taxon the hbi score indicates the degree of macroinvertebrate tolerance to water quality conditions 3 6 subsurface water recharge and temperature subsurface recharge was estimated using pvc casings with flush well screens installed in groundwater well holes drilled using a mud type soil auger wells were installed in 4 transects perpendicular to the stream in the rsc catchment for a total of 12 wells approximately 1 m below the groundwater table s lowest annual level to ensure continuous submergence of the pts throughout the study wells were installed approximately 0 2 to 0 6 m from the restored streambank and about 1 to 1 5 m apart the number of wells installed at the control catchment was limited to 3 due to the rocky soil these were installed about 0 5 m from the stream bank at the bottom mid and upper reaches of the stream pressure transducers were installed at the bottom of the pvc wells and were removed approximately monthly to download data all wells were vented and groundwater data were corrected for barometric pressure transducer data were calibrated during each download by measuring the distance from the soil surface to the water table determined by inserting a pvc pipe marked in mm increments inside each well and tapping the end against the surface of the water table 4 results 4 1 sampling effort a similar number of baseflow samplings and stormflow events were analyzed from the rsc inflow rsc outflow and control outflow flume sites during both the pre and post restoration periods table s1 in supplementary material the representativeness of stormflow sampling varied according to categories of different storm sizes storm sizes ranging from 4 to 10 mm represented about 30 and 35 of the total number of storm events that occurred in the pre and post restoration periods respectively of these storm events 6 and 4 were sampled for stormflow in the pre and post restoration periods respectively and this category represented 2 of total stormflow runoff from the rsc catchment by contrast storm sizes 50 mm represented only 2 to 3 of the total number of storm events that occurred over the pre and post restoration periods with 50 and 70 sampled for stormflow respectively this is the largest category of storm sizes and represented 42 and 48 of the total stormflow runoff from the rsc catchment for the pre and post restoration periods respectively 4 2 precipitation total precipitation volumes for the pre and post restoration study periods were 1 638 and 2 224 mm respectively with 184 mm during the construction period fig 3 the range in monthly volumes from the beginning of the study to the end of stormflow sampling i e until august 2016 was similar in both the pre and post restoration periods from about 30 to 200 mm the average monthly precipitation in the pre and post restoration periods was 96 and 93 mm respectively approximately 199 28 and 345 storm events of measurable precipitation at the rsc site occurred in the pre restoration and post restoration periods respectively the largest monthly volumes of precipitation typically occurred in the late spring to early summer with a maximum monthly volume of around 220 mm the largest daily event recorded in the pre restoration period was 77 mm whereas that of the post restoration period was 86 mm 4 3 stream and air temperatures between site differences in stream and air temperatures derived from pressure transducers at the rsc and control catchment sampling stations were small throughout the study ambient air temperature had the highest variability with lower temperatures than either stream site in the winter months the winters of 2014 and 2015 were unseasonably cold with air temperatures decreasing to 11 c and 17 4 c respectively data recorded on in stream and barometric pressure transducers at the rsc study sites also had small differences in average temperatures both between sites and compared to ambient air mean streamwater temperatures in the rsc catchment were slightly higher than those of the control catchment 13 5 vs 12 3 c respectively likely because of the location of the pressure transducer next to a road culvert and the lack of a forest canopy in this area no significant change in streamwater temperature occurred in the rsc catchment in the post compared to the pre construction periods likely because most of the forested canopy remained intact 4 4 stream discharge discharge at the study sites varied between the rsc and control sites with characteristically higher flows for most events at the rsc site this is primarily because of the larger size of the rsc catchment compared to that of control 13 4 and 14 7 ha in pre and post restoration periods vs 7 8 ha respectively land use of this additional area included in the rsc catchment of the post restoration period was virtually identical to that of the pre restoration catchment area the entire catchment is sewered and the added stream length from the pre to the post restoration sampling location was only 20 m which is the equivalent of only a 7 increase nevertheless we evaluated whether the slightly larger size of the rsc catchment in the post restoration period would influence our pre and post restoration comparisons by doing a preliminary sampling to compare the differences in chemistry at the two locations we determined over a one month period that there were no significant differences in either baseflow n 5 or stormflow n 2 chemistry no3 cl so4 tn and tss concentrations or discharge at the two locations the rsc and control catchment streams had very different baseflow and no flow characteristics for instance in the pre restoration period baseflow was observed at the control flume approximately half of the year compared to about 85 of the year at the rsc flume by contrast there was less baseflow in the control catchment during the post restoration period compared to the pre restoration period and continuous baseflow in the rsc catchment precipitation and discharge records for both sites indicate that the number of days per year that stormflow occurred in the pre and post restoration periods was similar the biggest difference between sites was the number of days that there was no baseflow observed at the control site about 130 and 262 days per year in the pre and post restoration periods respectively long no flow periods in the control catchment were likely because of the relatively smaller forested area contributing to baseflow and a sandy floodplain that had developed just upstream of the flume that flow percolated into during low flow periods although the study began in december 2012 we used the hydrological data for a one year period prior to the restoration i e june 2013 through may 2014 and a two year period after the restoration i e august 2014 through july 2016 to calculate runoff metrics we have high confidence in the discharge measurements during these periods annual runoff coefficients i e the ratio of runoff to precipitation for the rsc and control catchments were 52 and 25 in the pre restoration period and 50 and 32 in the post restoration period respectively total runoff was lower by 18 in the rsc catchment and higher by 8 in the control catchment in the post compared to the pre restoration period baseflow and stormflow were lower by 4 and 25 in the rsc catchment respectively and baseflow was lower by 23 and stormflow was higher by 16 in the control catchment in the post compared to the pre restoration period fig 4 these percentages were virtually identical in the post restoration water years of 2015 and 2016 because total annual rainfall and snow deposition was similar i e 1087 and 1108 mm respectively 4 5 water quality mean baseflow and vwm stormflow concentrations varied by collection site table 1 significant differences for baseflow and stormflow concentrations in the pre and the post restoration periods for each sampling station were determined using nonparametric tests whereas at the rsc inflow and control outflow sites there were only 3 constituents in baseflow and stormflow respectively that had significantly lower concentrations in the post compared to the pre restoration periods table s2 in supplementary material p 0 05 most constituents in baseflow and stormflow at the rsc outflow had significantly lower concentrations in particular no3 and po4 in both baseflow and stormflow and tss and the particulate fractions of n and p in stormflow at the rsc outflow were significantly lower in the post restoration compared to the pre restoration period fig 5 figure s2 in supplementary material by contrast nh4 and don concentrations were both significantly higher in baseflow of the post restoration period compared to the pre restoration period in the rsc outflow we observed increases in concentrations of heavy metals from the pre to the post restoration period at both the rsc and control sites that could not be explained by environmental variables this created a positive bias that we assume was the result of increased sensitivity of the instrumentation i e icp oes or a change in methodology used for the analysis of heavy metals at the analytical lab nasl but neither could be confirmed consequently to avoid attributing possible changes in heavy metal concentrations to the rsc comparisons such as those made in table 3 and table s2 were not done with heavy metals rather heavy metal concentrations were compared in baseflow and stormflow of the rsc outflow with those of the control outflow independently for the pre and post restoration periods in a comparison of the rsc outflow to the control outflow the rsc had significantly lower concentrations of cd in baseflow in the pre restoration period and cu and pb in stormflow of the post restoration period table s3 in supplementary material by contrast fe concentrations were higher in baseflow of the rsc outflow compared to the control outflow in the pre restoration period and in both baseflow and stormflow in the post restoration period at the outflow compared to the inflow of the rsc there were significantly lower concentrations of most water quality constituents in baseflow in both the pre and post restoration periods table s4 in supplementary material by contrast the same comparison for stormflow indicates that significantly lower concentrations occurred only in the post restoration period for most constituents 4 6 dissolved oxygen concentrations stream water in the rsc and control catchments exhibited seasonality in do concentrations throughout the study with the highest concentrations in the winter and lowest in the summer monthly average do concentrations varied between about 7 and 11 mg l at the control and 3 to 12 mg l at the rsc outflow fig 6 do concentrations between the outflow sites of the rsc and control catchments tracked one another commonly to within about 1 mg l in the spring of 2015 do in the rsc decreased proportionally more than at the control consequently do concentrations in the spring and summer months of the post restoration period at the rsc outflow site were lower than in the pre restoration period and fell below the criteria threshold during may through september 2015 and the summer of 2016 4 7 solute loads catchment areas were used in conjunction with the vwm solute concentrations and discharge measurements to estimate annual area yields from each sampling station tables 2 and 3 loads of the constituents measured in this study were generally lower in the post compared to the pre restoration period in the rsc catchment of all the constituents measured some of the largest contrasts in the rsc outflow were evident with area yields of tn tp and tss as percentages tn tp and tss decreased by 59 54 and 76 from the pre to the post restoration period in the rsc catchment in contrast to the control catchment that decreased by roughly half these percentages i e 23 28 and 40 respectively table 3 of the metals analyzed area yields of fe were higher by a factor of 5 times in the same type of comparison despite non significant differences in bacteria concentrations in stormflow area yields were higher in the control and substantially lower in the rsc catchment change of 10 and 40 respectively in the post compared to the pre restoration period table 3 4 8 groundwater recharge the distance below the forest floor to the water table was routinely measured in 12 and 3 wells in the rsc and control catchments respectively throughout the study period water tables in both catchments were positively correlated decreasing to their lowest levels in the months of august to october fig 7 an abrupt increase in the water table heights of all wells in the rsc catchment occurred from groundwater recharge after construction in june july 2014 recharge increased the average water table level in the rsc catchment by about 76 cm after which time the water table levels in both catchments were again well correlated 4 9 rapid biological assessments biological surveys of the rsc and control catchment streams were done each spring of 2013 through 2016 the hbi and swdi were low in the pre restoration period at both sites and remained considerably low throughout the post restoration period tables s5 and s6 in supplementary material 5 discussion 5 1 effects of restoration on runoff and groundwater this study is a comprehensive evaluation of the performance i e nutrient and sediment reduction capacity of an rsc located in a largely urban catchment rigorous measurements of precipitation discharge and groundwater were used to characterize changes in hydrology associated with this type of stream restoration design and how they contribute to potential solute load reductions hydrological measurements are critical to determining restoration performance because environmental variables such as differences in total precipitation volumes in the pre and post restoration periods can account for the majority of either increases or decreases in nutrient and sediment loads rather than what can be attributed to inherent solute retention and loss capabilities of the structure itself fortunately the performance of the rsc in this study was not influenced by large differences in inter annual precipitation for example although monthly precipitation volumes varied by up to a factor of 15 throughout the study total precipitation volumes in the pre and post restoration periods 17 and 24 months that coincide with water quality measurements respectively had similar average monthly values of 96 and 93 mm respectively and thus precipitation in the post restoration period was lower by only about 3 nevertheless runoff estimates were calculated using the one year period prior to and two year period after the restoration to avoid potential bias in our estimates of annual precipitation for the 17 month pre restoration period by not including a full second year of data with the late spring and early summer months i e june and july 2012 which preceded the onset of the project that commonly have larger rainfall totals more importantly we have high confidence in our discharge estimates during this pre restoration period average annual runoff was 18 lower in the rsc catchment and 8 higher in the control catchment in the post compared to the pre restoration period respectively because average annual precipitation was only about 15 lower in the post restoration period compared to the annual precipitation measured in the pre restoration period and this percentage approximates the decrease in runoff the runoff coefficients in the rsc catchment are similar in both periods i e 52 and 50 respectively the higher runoff coefficient in the control catchment in the post compared to the pre restoration period i e 32 and 25 respectively is likely due to higher precipitation in this catchment area than in the rsc catchment the control catchment was located about 4 km sw of the rsc catchment and did not have a tipping bucket rain gauge due to the lack of an accessible site free of overhanging trees the construction of the rsc had pronounced effects on baseflow and stormflow in the post restoration period baseflow and stormflow were 4 and 25 lower in the rsc catchment respectively in the post compared to the pre restoration period the observed changes in the runoff in the post restoration period of the rsc were likely due to increased retention of stormwater runoff in the step pools and percolation to the groundwater reservoir this percolation resulted in groundwater recharge and an increase in the groundwater table of about 76 cm increased storage capacity of the groundwater reservoir from this recharge resulted in baseflow at the outflow even during dry periods which in the pre restoration period in the rsc catchment resulted in intermittent no flow conditions however no flow conditions were observed throughout the structure during the late summer and fall coinciding with the lowest groundwater levels fig 7 and were more prevalent in the first several ponds of the upper reaches that were less influenced by groundwater inputs in the control catchment baseflow was 23 lower and stormflow was 16 higher in the post compared to the pre restoration period baseflow was dramatically lower despite higher stormflow because as mentioned previously of an extensive buildup of sediment and sand from bedload transport that developed upstream of the h flume that allowed baseflow to percolate and circumvent the flume during low flow periods bedload transport was commonly observed and although it was not quantified was substantial however bedload transport was virtually eliminated after the construction of rsc except during extremely high stormflow events that altered the structural integrity of the restoration design hydrological modifications of the rsc decreased solute loads not only by increasing percolation to the groundwater reservoir thereby reducing stormflow runoff but also by increasing the retention times of water temporarily stored in the step pools the rsc design creates more convoluted flowpaths of streamwater and shunts solutes through the filtration media which promotes the uptake and loss of nutrients and settling of particulates kasahara and hill 2006 kasahara and hill 2008 measurements of groundwater level in our wells indicated that variations were dynamic with rapid increases in response to precipitation events figures s3 and s4 in supplementary materials average values of hydraulic head determined from our groundwater well data indicate that the interaction with the groundwater table and hyporheic zone is highly variable and depends on catchment topography and groundwater table height generally during periods when the groundwater table is higher november may a significant positive gradient towards the stream developed in some well transects that is presumed to enhance hyporheic inputs to streamwater wells positioned in the hyporheic zone of each well transect had no3 and po4 concentrations that were significantly lower than in stream water williams et al 2016 thus biogeochemical processes enhanced by organic matter inputs robertson 2010 williams et al 2016 included in the construction as well as increased contact with the stream bed filtration media and riparian hyporheic zone peterjohn and correll 1984 lawrence et al 2013 welsh et al 2017 due to the elevated groundwater table in the rsc were likely responsible for lower concentrations of solutes such as inorganic nutrients i e no3 and po4 that are potentially affected by biological uptake or loss processes measured at the outflow in the post compared to the pre restoration period and compared to those of the control table 1 5 2 effects of restoration on solute concentrations and loads the product of runoff volume and solute concentrations generally resulted in lower constituent loads and area yields in the post compared to the pre restoration period in the rsc catchment nevertheless as indicated previously total annual runoff was 18 lower in the post restoration period in the rsc catchment which had the effect of magnifying reductions in area yields accordingly our analyses included an evaluation of significant differences in solute concentrations from the pre to post restoration period these analyses indicate that n and p commonly had significantly lower concentrations at the outflow compared to the inflow of the restoration reach in both the pre and post restoration periods table 1 by contrast tss concentrations in the pre restoration environment were significantly higher because of streambank erosion and streambed scouring concentrations of tss in stormflow at the inflow of the rsc reach were not significantly higher even though higher concentrations were observed during a house construction in the post restoration period it is also noteworthy that a house construction occurred in the pre restoration period of the control resulting in significantly lower concentrations and net area yields of tss and other particulates in the post restoration period that are likely an artifact of this disturbance table 3 figure s2 in supplementary material although we were unable to collect complete records of sediment losses during the construction period in the rsc catchment estimates indicate that this accounts for 10 of the area yield reductions calculated from the pre to the post restoration period a few constituents had higher concentrations in the post compared to the pre restoration period in the rsc ammonium and don were both higher in baseflow after construction likely a result of enhanced ammonification and uptake of inorganic n and conversion to organic matter which appears to be a fairly common process observed at recent stream restoration sites williams et al 2017 in baseflow doc and fe were also significantly higher in concentration in the post compared to the pre restoration period and fe was the only solute to increase in stormflow as well we speculate that the increase in fe concentrations in the rsc was derived from a combination of fe in construction materials i e ironstone and sand and natural soils of the area that were in contact with labile doc from organic matter embedded in the structure williams et al 2016 nevertheless differences in doc concentrations between the rsc and control catchments in the post restoration period were relatively small i e 4 4 mg l 1 vs 2 6 mg l 1 in baseflow and 6 0 mg l 1 and 8 6 mg l 1 in stormflow respectively and suggest that conditions were not favorable for the growth of iron oxidizing bacteria and associated flocculate emerson et al 2010 indeed other than surface biofilms of this bacteria observed in the rsc ponds in the fall very little fe flocculate was observed throughout the restoration reach for the duration of the study organic matter in another rsc structure located in a watershed with predominately agricultural and forested land use covers were observed to contribute much higher doc jordan et al 2017 and fe concentrations to streamwater that likely accentuated biogeochemical processes such as denitrification robertson 2010 nevertheless other than a brief period during the fall of 2016 after the rsc construction when biofilms of fe oxidizing bacteria were observed we did not measure a pulse of higher doc concentrations in either stream or groundwater williams et al 2016 that could account for significant no3 loss and enhanced hypoxia anoxia due to higher bacterial productivity this effect however has been observed in other rscs and thus likely depends on site specific attributes such as the type and quantity of organic matter used and whether it is thoroughly mixed within the top layer of the sand filtration media rather than spread on the surface in this study the only time that no3 concentrations in the rsc outflow were below detection occurred in the first 6 months of the post restoration period suggesting that such effects are probably transient and diminish as labile doc is consumed other conditions in the aquatic environment changed as a result of the rsc construction for example do concentrations in the post compared to the pre restoration period in the rsc catchment decreased below the 5 mg l criteria threshold during the summer and fall months of 2015 and 2016 this decrease was likely due to hypoxia that developed in the rsc ponding basins during low flow periods and was reflected in the outflow of the catchment enhanced hypoxic and anoxic conditions in the stream that support the reduction of organic sulfur to sulfides and subsequent oxidation to so4 in surface waters may explain in part why so4 was the only constituent to have significantly higher concentrations at the outflow compared to the inflow in stormflow of the post restoration period table s4 we surmise that lower do conditions in conjunction with organic matter also promote the reduction of fe and increase in fe concentrations in stream water as evidenced by the significantly higher fe concentrations in post restoration baseflow and stormflow compared to those in the pre restoration period moreover the development of biofilms of fe oxidizing bacteria on the ponds commonly occurred during hypoxic periods and was accentuated during leaf fall 5 3 macroinvertebrates and bacteria other parameters that were measured in this study included benthic macroinvertebrates and bacteria the loss of aquatic macroinvertebrates is common in urbanized streams due to a variety of factors king et al 2011 such as altered flow regimes king et al 2016 elevated nutrient and salt concentrations and higher water temperatures compared to reference streams göbel et al 2007 corsi et al 2015 somers et al 2013 not surprisingly measurable improvement in the benthic macroinvertebrate community was not observed and thus populations remained in the fair to poor range for the indices i e hbi and swdi used to characterize the systems in the post restoration period in both the rsc and control catchments this lack of measurable improvement is likely due to the persistence of influential stressors such as cl concentrations which were higher in the post compared to the pre restoration period table 1 and primarily derived from road salting in the winter it is also possible that a longer post restoration period is needed to reconstitute healthier macroinvertebrate communities at many stream restoration sites likewise we did not observe significantly lower concentrations of enterococci between the study periods albeit concentrations in the rsc were substantially lower in the post restoration period table 1 given the high variability in the concentrations of enterococci measured it is likely that statistically lower concentrations would have been detected with a larger sample size 6 conclusions results of the current study indicate that rscs as stream restorations impact hydrological dynamics and can significantly decrease pollutant loads from highly urbanized watersheds however an important distinction is that whereas rscs as stormwater retrofit tend to decrease loads more from a higher infiltration capacity and percolation of stormwater runoff to groundwater rscs as stream restoration have less infiltration capacity because they tend to be water saturated for much of the year due to elevated groundwater levels that create neutral to positive hydraulic gradients toward the stream the hydrological distinction between rscs as stream restorations and stormwater retrofits is evidenced by the differences in substantially lower runoff coefficients in comparisons of rsc structures as stormwater retrofits in other studies cizek et al 2017a cizek et al 2017b fanelli et al 2017 koryto et al 2017 with that of the stream restoration rsc in the current study and respective control thus when stream restoration rscs are well saturated from high volumes of antecedent precipitation and or a strong groundwater influence i e groundwater levels intersecting with stream level then they are most likely just conveying water downstream with throughflow occurring in the sand fill media within the cobble riffles the groundwater influence varies seasonally and is generally strongest during the months of november through may though this influence in other rscs as stream restorations will likely depend on the inherent characteristics of the structure and catchment as well as the extent to which the groundwater table is elevated after construction figures s3 and s4 in supplementary material thus pollutant reductions in stream restoration rscs occur not only from the infiltration of stormwater runoff during drier periods of low antecedent precipitation and groundwater tables but also from increased retention times that allow for enhanced solute processing and particulate settling of both base and stormflow we assume based on the hydrological evidence presented herein that these types of restorations given equivalent precipitation deposition both in terms of total volume but also timing and intensity would result in slightly lower runoff i e lower runoff coefficients thus enhancing load reductions for those solutes that have lower concentrations in the post compared to the pre restoration environment practitioners and water resource managers alike have been touting the advantages of relatively novel stream restorations such as rscs since their introduction without strong corroborating scientific evidence results of study provide evidence that rscs decrease pollutant loads and improve natural hydrological functions thus rscs as a stream restoration design have the potential to be used as an effective best management practice bmp to improve water quality and help attain tmdl goals for
