5755,the radius of influence and radius of investigation of a pumping well are fundamental concepts in hydrogeology with various uses in well hydraulics and aquifer testing however numerous definitions have been given of these radii which have often been equated while they are fundamentally different here radius of influence is qualitatively defined as the maximum distance from a pumping well up to which the influence of pumping is significant on the other hand radius of investigation is qualitatively defined as the maximum distance from a pumping well up to which aquifer properties have a significant influence on drawdown at the well the exact meaning of the term significant is open to interpretation and consequently various operational definitions i e definitions that enable quantification have been given of radius of influence and radius of investigation we comprehensively review these definitions and corresponding estimation methods and discuss the relevance of each definition in view of different potential uses we also propose new definitions that are more adapted to several applications next we quantitatively compare the various definitions of radius of influence and radius of investigation the results show that while remaining of the same order of magnitude the radii are significantly affected by the choice of operational definition and associated parameters as a rule of thumb the radius of investigation is half of the radius of influence we eventually propose a practical guide for choosing a suitable operational definition of radius of influence or radius of investigation depending on the objective keywords radius of influence radius of investigation radius of drainage well hydraulics aquifer test pumping test 1 introduction well hydraulics and aquifer testing play a major role in applied hydrogeology renard 2006 in studying these topics it is frequently needed to estimate the radius of influence or radius of investigation of a pumping well however a lot of confusion surrounds these concepts to start with these two radii have often been assumed to be equal while in reality they are fundamentally different bourdet 2002 daungkaew et al 2000 oliver 1990 tabatabaie et al 2017 next numerous definitions have been given of these radii but the conceptual differences between the various definitions have barely been discussed and little guidance is available regarding when to choose a specific definition rather than another as a result the practical use of these concepts is challenging and prone to misinterpretations to resolve this situation we present a comprehensive review of the concepts of radius of influence or radius of investigation and the methods to estimate them new definitions and methods are also proposed to address gaps that were identified during the course of our review our main objectives are to clarify the concepts of radius of influence and radius of investigation and facilitate their practical use the concepts of radius of influence and radius of investigation have more extensively been discussed in the petroleum engineering literature in which the term radius of drainage has also been used than in the groundwater literature these concepts have an uppermost importance in petroleum engineering because they are often used to identify reservoir limits which are directly related to the volume of oil and gas reserves kuchuk 2009 nonetheless identifying aquifer boundaries is also crucial in hydrogeology in fact we found that the concepts of radius of influence and radius of investigation have many potential uses that are relevant to both petroleum engineering and groundwater applications thus in this work an important effort was made to integrate the literature from both fields of study qualitative definitions of radius of influence and radius of investigation are given in section 2 together with a presentation of the potential uses of these concepts the definitions given in this section are only qualitative because they do not specify a criterion to decide what is a negligible or significant response to a perturbation note that the diffusivity equation which governs groundwater flow implies that a perturbation at some point instantaneously induces a non zero response at an infinite distance from the source the fundamental reason for this behavior is discussed in appendix a as the magnitude of the response continuously decreases with distance from the source in practice the response can be considered as being effectively negligible beyond some distance however as there is no clear natural cutoff this distance i e the radius of influence investigation is intrinsically ambiguous in this work we review and introduce new ways of precisely defining radius of influence and radius of investigation discuss the relevance of each definition in view of different potential uses and quantitatively compare the various definitions sections 3 and 4 for radius of influence and radius of investigation respectively as an outcome we propose a practical guide for choosing a suitable operational definition depending on the objective section 5 the equations presented in this article rely on major simplifying assumptions namely most of them rely on the theis solution to pumping which assumes horizontal flow in a homogeneous confined aquifer of infinite extent constant rate pumping fully penetrating well and negligible wellbore storage and skin effects there are three reasons for this choice the first reason is that the primary objective of this work is to discuss the relevance of various definitions of radius of influence and radius of investigation in view of the potential uses of these concepts this discussion is mostly conceptual and independent of the flow model taken for deriving the equations therefore in spite of the simplifying assumptions made most of the ideas developed in this work will contribute to clarifying the concepts of radius of influence and radius of investigation in more sophisticated frameworks as well the second reason is that we aim to present simple methods for estimating the radius of influence and radius of investigation of a pumping well at first order the theis solution allows for reaching this goal because it is an analytical solution and it only requires a small number of parameters lastly the third reason is that virtually an infinity of approaches may be developed depending on the assumptions made on the system hence it is practically not feasible to make an exhaustive presentation of all the potential solutions while keeping our focus on clarifying the concepts of radius of influence and radius of investigation thus while we do acknowledge the existence of various effects induced by heterogeneity boundary conditions etc these effects are not further discussed in this work previous studies adopting different frameworks are nonetheless listed in table 1 2 qualitative definitions and potential uses 2 1 radius of influence in this work the radius of influence of a pumping well is qualitatively defined as the maximum distance from the well up to which the influence of pumping is significant fig 1 a estimating the radius of influence of a pumping well is useful when designing a well interference test i e a pumping test where the observation well is different from the pumping well renard 2006 in which case it allows for determining the maximum distance from the well up to which drawdown may be measured at a given time or inversely one may estimate the minimum pumping duration for drawdown to be measurable at a given distance note however that this distance does not directly inform the area of aquifer of which the results of a pumping test are representative for this see section 2 2 estimating the radius of influence of a pumping well is also useful when designing a multiple well system in which case it allows for determining the minimum spacing between wells that is required for avoiding any significant well interference and hence minimizing well operation costs estimating the radius of influence of a pumping well can also serve the purpose of impact assessment studies by informing the maximum distance from the well up to which drawdown may affect other wells or groundwater dependent ecosystems note that the radius of influence of a pumping well is generally understood as a transient concept and it is so in this article that is this radius increases with time in response to pumping a steady state concept of radius of influence is probably of limited relevance because under steady flow conditions the drawdown mostly depends on boundary conditions and it is generally not radially distributed around the well the term radius of influence is nonetheless often used to denote the distance to a zero drawdown circular boundary condition in the context of the dupuit solution also known as the thiem solution which describes steady flow to a pumping well bear 1979 dupuit 1863 houben 2015 kresic 2006 thiem 1906 however in practice the dupuit solution is typically used as an approximation of a slowly evolving transient situation in that case a practical way of determining the radius of influence is again to estimate it from a transient method such as those reviewed in this article 2 2 radius of investigation in this work the radius of investigation of a pumping well is qualitatively defined as the maximum distance from the well up to which aquifer properties have a significant influence on drawdown at the well fig 1b estimating the radius of investigation of a pumping well allows for determining the area of aquifer investigated during a single well test i e a pumping test where the pumping well is also the observation well renard 2006 indirectly it also allows for determining the area of aquifer investigated during a well interference test details are given below this information is critical both when designing a test e g to determine the minimum required test duration for covering a target area and when interpreting it e g to inform the area of aquifer of which the results of the test are representative as a particular application the radius of investigation informs the maximum distance from the well up to which the presence of a major feature e g a hydraulic barrier could be detected during a test furthermore if a major feature is really identified during a test evaluating the radius of investigation at the time at which the feature starts to have an influence on drawdown will provide an estimate of the distance to the feature however also note that if a major feature does exist the concept of radius of investigation is only strictly meaningful until it reaches the feature beyond this time the influence of the feature becomes significant and the area of investigation is not circular any more thus at later times one would need to employ a more sophisticated framework to study the area of investigation in our definition of radius of investigation it is explicitly stated that drawdown is analyzed at the pumping well itself and not anywhere else however in practice well interference tests are often preferred over single well tests because drawdown at the pumped well may be affected by turbulence and well losses sterrett 2007 when the observation well is different from the pumping well the problem of determining the area of investigation of the test is notably different first of all while the radius of investigation of a single well grows from nothing as soon as the pumping starts the area of investigation of a pair of pumping and observation wells is nil until the radius of influence indeed and not the radius of investigation of the pumping well becomes larger than the distance between the two wells secondly when it is not nil the area of investigation of a pair of pumping and observation wells is not circular rather it is elliptical oliver 1993 fig 2 a b the bounding ellipse of the area of investigation has foci at the pumping and observation wells and it satisfies the relationship d p d o 2 r inv where d p and d o represent the distances from any point of the ellipse to the pumping and observation wells respectively and r inv is the radius of investigation of the pumping well as defined above oliver 1993 therefore although our definition of radius of investigation is only directly related to single well tests this concept can also be used to estimate the area of investigation of well interference tests the term radius of investigation originates from the petroleum engineering literature nonetheless the potential uses of this concept i e design and interpretation of pumping tests as discussed above are clearly relevant to groundwater applications as well also note that the radius of influence and radius of investigation of a pumping well are in fact very much related precisely as will be demonstrated later it is generally reasonable to consider that r infl 2 r inv this result can be explained by the fact that in order for a feature to have an influence on drawdown at the well the signal induced by pumping must first reach this feature and then the effect of the feature has to diffuse back to the well bourdet 2002 jones 1962 hence the two radii can be easily derived from one another 3 radius of influence operational definitions and estimation methods we identified three fundamentally different types of operational definitions i e definitions that enable quantification of radius of influence definitions based on an absolute criterion definitions based on a relative criterion and heuristic definitions definitions of the first two types use a threshold to determine what is considered as being a significant influence and thus they have an accurate meaning in contrast heuristic definitions make use of some uniquely defined distance that only qualitative agrees with the concept of radius of influence below the various definitions are classified and discussed according to these three types 3 1 definitions based on an absolute criterion 3 1 1 absolute drawdown criterion an intuitive way of obtaining a practical radius of influence is to define it as the distance at which drawdown is equal to a specified small value fig 1a dragoni 1998 kresic 2006 kuchuk 2009 this definition is relevant when one wants to know the distance from the well up to which hydraulic head measurements can be taken e g during a well interference test indeed in practice hydraulic head measurements have a finite resolution consequently beyond a certain distance from the well the drawdown is too small to be observed and can thus be considered negligible the resolution of hydraulic head measurements depends both on the resolution of the measurement device e g pressure gauge and on the background noise which overlaps with the signal induced by pumping i e any event that is not accounted for in the idealized representation of the system such as small variations in the pumping rate the sum of measurement device resolution and background noise may be called apparent resolution kuchuk 2009 the exact apparent resolution may be difficult to anticipate prior to data acquisition but different authors reported similar practical values in the range 0 01 0 07 m dragoni 1998 kuchuk 2009 defining radius of influence as a function of a given drawdown value may also be relevant for impact assessment studies in that case drawdown may be considered as being effectively negligible when it is smaller than some regulatory limit which may be decided to avoid potential conflicts between different groundwater users or adverse environmental effects with this definition estimating the radius of influence consists in inverting a drawdown function that is it consists in finding the distance from the center of the well at which drawdown is equal to a given threshold criterion here we adopt the theis solution for drawdown theis 1935 however in principle there is no restriction on the choice of the drawdown function which may even be the result of a numerical model the reasons for using the theis solution in this work are discussed in the introduction section 1 the following parameters are introduced q l3 t 1 is the pumping rate t l2 t 1 is the aquifer transmissivity s is the aquifer storativity t t is the time elapsed from the start of pumping and s c l is the specified drawdown threshold criterion we also define the combined parameter s c 4 π t s c q which may be referred to as dimensionless drawdown threshold criterion by inverting the theis solution for drawdown the radius of influence r infl l is obtained as appendix b 1 r infl 2 tt e 1 1 s c s where e 1 1 is the inverse function of the function e 1 which is the well known exponential integral function defined by eq b2 often called well function in the groundwater literature bear 1979 fetter 2001 the evaluation of e 1 1 poses some practical difficulties as no analytical form is known for this function pecina 1986 ricker and von rosen 2018 therefore a numerical procedure must be used a python code based on a simple root finding algorithm jones et al 2001 was written for this purpose this code was made publicly available as part of a python package named wellradpy bresciani 2020 which was developed to implement all the methods discussed in this manuscript alternatively we also developed an approximate analytical expression for e 1 1 in the form of a shifted power law obtained by curve fitting text s1 and fig s1 2 e 1 1 s c 3 656 s c 0 1295 3 445 the maximum error on e 1 1 implied by this approximation is 2 3 for s c in the range 0 0036 0 63 which probably encompasses most common situations based on parameter values reported by dragoni 1998 somewhat similarly dragoni 1998 developed approximate analytical expressions for r infl based on a specified drawdown criterion however they derived several expressions corresponding to different values of s c they did so for five values of s c the approach presented above is more powerful because we arrived at a single expression in which s c is a parameter embedded into s c to mention a last option one may also read in reverse tabulated values for e 1 as provided for instance in bear 1979 table 8 2 and fetter 2001 p 245 however this method is somewhat tedious and not very accurate note that the use of the well known logarithmic approximation of the e 1 function e g cooper and jacob 1946 theis 1935 which would greatly simplify the inversion is strongly discouraged in the present context indeed this approximation is only valid for small values of the argument u of the function u 0 01 is usually recommended bear 1979 small values of u are obtained for small distances from the well and are thus in contradiction with the fact that the radius of influence is naturally large in fact at the radius of influence u will typically be larger than 0 44 fig s1 which is well beyond the range of validity of the logarithmic approximation 3 2 definitions based on a relative criterion 3 2 1 relative drawdown criterion in some situations it may be meaningful to define radius of influence as the maximum distance from a pumping well up to which drawdown is significant relative to drawdown at the well as opposed to significant in absolute namely when designing a multiple well system it is informative to know the minimum well spacing that is required for avoiding significant well interference well interference can never be completely avoided due to the instantaneous pressure propagation already discussed in the introduction but one may want it to be small enough for the productivity of each well to be almost equal to that of a single well since well productivity is essentially a function of drawdown at the pumping well referring to the energy cost required to lift up a unit volume of water using a criterion that is relative to drawdown at that pumped well is relevant in this context in this case the radius of influence is defined from the equation 3 drawdown at the radius of influence drawdown at the well α where α is a specified threshold criterion 0 α 1 the choice of α is somewhat arbitrary but a value of 0 01 i e 1 is deemed meaningful van poolen 1964 van poolen 1964 was the first to introduce this definition of radius of influence and to derive an expression for estimating it however they did not use the theis solution for drawdown instead they considered a semi infinite slab aquifer model also called linear aquifer model where one end of the slab is subject to a sudden and fixed drawdown although this model may be suitable in some particular situations it is inappropriate when the flow is radial and a constant pumping rate is applied at the well thus this expression is not reported here to the best of our knowledge no expression for radius of influence has previously been presented based on the definition given above and using the theis solution for drawdown using the theis solution for drawdown the radius of influence as defined here can be derived as appendix c 4 r infl 2 tt e 1 1 α e 1 u w s where u w s r w 2 4 t t and r w l is the well radius in this expression the common logarithmic approximation of e 1 may be used to simplify e 1 u w because u w is typically small since the well radius is small yielding 5 r infl 2 tt e 1 1 α ln 1 78 u w s as already mentioned in section 3 1 the evaluation of e 1 1 poses some practical difficulties nonetheless the methods discussed in that section can also be used here in particular the approximate analytical expression shown in eq 2 can be used as long as the argument of e 1 1 lies within the indicated range of values note that here the radius of influence depends on u w and thus on the well radius the smaller the value of u w i e the smaller the well radius the smaller the radius of influence 3 2 2 relative flow rate criterion instead of defining radius of influence from a relative drawdown criterion one may similarly define it from a relative flow rate criterion that is radius of influence may be defined from the requirement that the flow rate across the walls of a cylinder of radius r infl centered on the well is small relative to the flow rate at the well i e the pumping rate tek et al 1957 we suggest that this definition may be relevant in the context of impact assessment studies indeed the radius of influence will then indicate the area within which the disturbance induced by pumping is the strongest relative to the overall disturbance of the system thus this area could be designated as the target of detailed assessment and monitoring for example with this definition the radius of influence is obtained as appendix d 6 r infl 2 t t ln α s where α is a specified threshold criterion 0 α 1 the choice of α is somewhat arbitrary but a value of 0 01 i e 1 is deemed meaningful tek et al 1957 van poolen 1964 a key difference between this expression and the previous one eq 4 is that this expression is independent of the well radius this makes sense when the purpose of estimating the radius of influence is related to impact assessment since drawdown is everywhere independent of the well radius except at the well itself 3 2 3 relative volume criterion alternatively one may use a relative criterion bearing on the volume of the cone of depression induced by pumping or equivalently the volume of extracted fluid johnson 1988 that is radius of influence may be defined from the requirement that the volume of the portion of the cone of depression beyond this distance is small relative to the total volume of the cone of depression as in the previous section section 3 2 2 such a definition may be relevant in the context of impact assessment studies as it will indicate the area within which the disturbance induced by pumping is the strongest relative to the overall disturbance of the system in fact it might be more relevant to evaluate the disturbance in terms of volume of the cone of depression than in terms of flow rate because this quantity more directly relates to drawdown with this definition and denoting again by α a specified threshold criterion 0 α 1 where a value of 0 01 is deemed meaningful the radius of influence is obtained as appendix e 7 r infl 2 tt f 1 α s where f 1 is the inverse function of the function f which is defined by eq e8 no analytical expression is known for f 1 and so a numerical procedure is required to evaluate this function a suitable code is available as part of the wellradpy package alternatively we developed an approximate analytical expression for f 1 in the form of a shifted power law function obtained by curve fitting text s2 and fig s2 8 f 1 α 14 404 α 0 0457 14 734 the maximum error on f 1 implied by this approximation is 0 5 for α in the range 0 001 0 1 note that this approach is conceptually identical to that presented by johnson 1988 however johnson 1988 did not exactly follow the same steps as here and as a result they arrived at slightly more complicated expression their expression yields slightly larger errors for small values of α up to 8 1 for α 0 001 but is as accurate otherwise 3 3 heuristic definitions a number of heuristic definitions have been proposed for estimating radius of influence table 2 most of these definitions rely on an approximation of the drawdown response according to which drawdown is assumed to be exactly equal to zero beyond some distance which increases with time at any time the latter distance is well defined and can be derived as a result of the approximation made the radius of influence is then simply equated to this distance the impulse response peak definition is different from the other heuristic definitions and is somewhat more elegant because it does not rely on an approximation of the response instead it uses a special characteristic of the response details in table 2 in all cases none of these definitions requires the choice of a threshold criterion however it does not mean that they are less arbitrary than the criterion based methods the heuristic definitions are still based on the choice of an approximate response model or of a special characteristic of the response furthermore as will be shown next section 3 4 these definitions do not necessarily yield a distance beyond which the influence of pumping may really be considered as being negligible depending on the exact meaning given to the term negligible hence these definitions must be used with caution in practice we suggest that they should only be used when seeking no more than an order of magnitude 3 4 comparison there is a major difference between the definitions of section 3 1 and those of sections 3 2 3 3 the former depend on the pumping rate whereas the latter do not for the definitions of sections 3 1 3 2 these properties directly follow from those definitions being based on either an absolute criterion or a relative criterion the fact that the heuristic definitions are independent of the pumping rate reveals that implicitly these definitions are also of a relative nature regardless of the differences all the equations for radius of influence can be put into the form 9 r infl c tt s where c is a coefficient that may either depend on s c section 3 1 1 depend on α sections 3 2 1 3 2 3 and possibly u w section 3 2 1 or be constant section 3 3 as the coefficient c effectively controls the quantitative difference between the definitions it is informative to study the values this coefficient may take fig 3 in fig 3 for those formulae where c depends on parameters wide ranges of realistic parameter values have been used the results show that overall c ranges between 0 and 6 a value of 0 would theoretically be obtained for an infinitely small well radius in the definition based on a relative drawdown criterion c displays similar trends although it has different values in all the definitions that are based on a criterion whether absolute or relative this is interpreted as a consequence of the fact that the various criteria used in these definitions are actually correlated the values of c for three of the heuristic definitions quasi steady state model impulse response peak and extension of logarithmic regime are somewhat on the lower end of the overall range of values of c thus these definitions will often effectively yield an underestimation of the radius of influence to further illustrate this finding note that c 2 value in the quasi steady state model and impulse response peak definitions implies a relative flow criterion α 0 37 i e 37 and that c 1 5 value in the extension of logarithmic regime definition implies a relative flow criterion α 0 57 i e 57 that is these definitions give a distance from the well at which the flow rate towards the well is still a large proportion of the pumping rate and thus they may not be considered as suitable definitions of radius of influence depending on the objective the facts that the radius of influence is proportional to tt s regardless of the definition and that the coefficient c is in practice never too far from unity can be given a simple explanation assuming homogeneous hydraulic properties the diffusivity equation may be written in dimensionless form as domenico and schwartz 1997 10 δ h s l c 2 t t c h t where l c l is a characteristic distance t c t is a characteristic time and the star symbol indicates the normalization of the variables and the laplacian operator by these characteristic dimensions as domenico and schwartz 1997 noted the transient period that occurs after a perturbation of the system will thus be noticeable at the characteristic distance and time i e at l c and t c only if the dimensionless group n f s l c 2 t t c called the fourier number is of the order of unity the condition n f 1 directly yields 11 l c t t c s i e the scaling identified above in fact if only an order of magnitude is sought the expression 12 r infl tt s i e c 1 could be used the above reasoning serving as a justification 4 radius of investigation operational definitions and estimation methods although the qualitative definition of radius of investigation given in section 2 2 is intuitive it does not obviously translate into an operational definition i e it is more challenging than for radius of influence this may explain why in practice many authors have simply equated the radius of investigation to the radius of influence to understand the difficulties involved note that for aquifer properties to have an influence on drawdown these properties must be considered over some area i e not only at an infinitesimal point for example one way of precisely defining radius of investigation could be to choose an area of 1 m2 and see up to what distance from the well a heterogeneity say a squared shape impervious lens of this size would significantly influence drawdown at the well the problem is is 1 m2 a relevant size also why taking a squared shape impervious lens and not for instance a round shaped semi impervious lens in fact there are probably no universally correct answers to these questions or in other words there are as many correct answers as there are possible heterogeneity types in spite of this a number of definitions of radius of investigation are possible that arguably have a somewhat general relevance below these definitions are classified and discussed according to the same three categories as in section 3 i e definitions based on an absolute criterion definitions based on a relative criterion and heuristic definitions 4 1 definitions based on an absolute criterion several authors made the case for accounting for the apparent resolution of hydraulic head measurements when quantifying the radius of investigation of a pumping well daungkaew et al 2000 kuchuk 2009 stewart 2011 this aspect is indeed primordial aquifer properties at some distance from the well can only be investigated if they affect the response more than the measurement resolution or apparent resolution see section 3 1 1 however to the best of our knowledge no equation for radius of investigation has been presented based on measurement resolution except for the case of recovery i e once pumping is stopped stewart 2011 here we fill this gap by developing suitable operational definitions of radius of investigation and corresponding estimation methods for the pumping period 4 1 1 absolute drawdown difference criterion radius of investigation may be conveniently defined as the distance from the well at which the presence of a hypothetical linear barrier assumed infinite and perfectly impervious in an otherwise homogeneous aquifer would induce a difference in drawdown at the well equal to the apparent resolution s c when compared with an unbounded aquifer fig 1b the choice of a linear barrier for heterogeneity type is somewhat arbitrary as discussed above in principle any heterogeneity type could be employed nevertheless a linear barrier represents a mid range heterogeneity type indeed it is neither a small localized heterogeneity nor a circular impervious barrier centered on the well both of which would be extreme heterogeneity types and it is scale independent i e it has the same relative effect whatever its distance from the well therefore it is regarded as a relevant proxy for analyzing the influence of heterogeneity in general at a given distance from the well technically it is also a practical choice because the influence of a linear barrier on drawdown can be easily evaluated using the principle of images bear 1972 muskat 1937 thus with this definition the radius of investigation r inv l is derived as appendix f 13 r inv tt e 1 1 s c s refer to section 3 1 1 for the nomenclature and indications regarding the evaluation of e 1 1 one may notice that the radius of investigation obtained here is exactly half of the radius of influence obtained in section 3 1 1 compare with eq 1 4 1 2 absolute drawdown derivative difference criterion the derivative of drawdown with respect to the natural logarithm of time is commonly used to interpret pumping test data bourdet 2002 when this is the case essentially the same definition as in the previous section can be used but looking at the drawdown derivative instead of drawdown that is radius of investigation may be defined as the distance from the well at which the presence of a hypothetical linear barrier assumed infinite and perfectly impervious in an otherwise homogeneous aquifer would induce a difference in drawdown derivative at the well equal to the apparent drawdown derivative resolution s c when compared with an unbounded aquifer if the apparent drawdown resolution is s c the apparent drawdown derivative resolution can be obtained by using uncertainty propagation rules this yields s c 2 s c δ where δ is the size measured in ln t of the window used to calculate the derivative from the drawdown data appendix g with this definition the radius of investigation is obtained as appendix g 14 r inv tt s ln 2 s c δ note that this equation implies a minimum constraint on the window size δ 2 s c since the argument of the logarithm must be smaller than 1 for r inv to be positive this constraint is a consequence of the fact that there is a maximum theoretical difference between the drawdown derivative in the presence or absence of a linear barrier 4 2 definitions based on a relative criterion the fact that a heterogeneity has a measurable influence on the response does not automatically imply that it has a significant influence on the parameters derived from the test i e transmissivity and storativity for this to be the case the influence of the heterogeneity must also be significant relative to the overall response recorded at the well indeed if the influence of the heterogeneity is small relative to the overall response the calibrated parameters will essentially be the same regardless of the presence or absence of the heterogeneity note that this discussion assumes that the test is interpreted using classical type curves where each hydraulic property is regarded as an equivalent homogeneous parameter and that the entire response is used and not only part of it therefore in this context it is meaningful to define qualitatively radius of investigation as the maximum distance from the well up to which aquifer properties have a significant influence relative to the overall response at the well the next four operational definitions are based on this idea sections 4 2 1 4 2 4 in section 4 2 5 another type of definition based on a relative criterion is presented that satisfies the needs of a different objective 4 2 1 relative drawdown difference criterion the definition of section 4 1 1 can be simply modified to get a definition based on a relative criterion that is the radius of investigation may be conveniently defined as the distance from the well at which the presence of a hypothetical linear barrier in an otherwise homogeneous aquifer would induce a difference in drawdown at the well equal to a given small ratio of the drawdown obtained for an unbounded aquifer denoting by α this ratio 0 α 1 where a value of 0 01 is deemed meaningful the radius of investigation according to this definition is obtained as appendix h 15 r inv tt e 1 1 α e 1 u w s one may notice that the radius of investigation obtained here is exactly half of the radius of influence obtained in section 3 2 1 compare with eq 4 4 2 2 relative drawdown derivative difference criterion similarly the definition of section 4 1 2 can be simply modified to get a definition based on a relative criterion that is suitable when the derivative of drawdown with respect to the natural logarithm of time is analyzed that is the radius of investigation may be defined as the distance from the well at which the presence of a hypothetical linear barrier in an otherwise homogeneous aquifer would induce a difference in drawdown derivative at the well equal to a given small ratio of the drawdown derivative obtained for an unbounded aquifer denoting again this ratio by α 0 α 1 where a value of 0 01 is deemed meaningful the radius of investigation is then given by appendix i 16 r inv t t u w ln α s in practice u w is typically smaller than 10 2 since the well radius is small consequently for meaningful values of α say α 0 1 we have u w ln α and so 17 r inv t t ln α s which is independent of u w one may notice that in this expression the radius of investigation is exactly half of the radius of influence obtained in section 3 2 2 compare with eq 6 4 2 3 relative drawdown averaging criterion oliver 1990 conducted an elegant theoretical analysis of the underlying averaging process that occurs when estimating transmissivity from a single well test in a heterogeneous aquifer their approach consisted in representing the influence of variations in transmissivity on drawdown as a weighted average of the transmissivity variations where the weighting function is a function of distance from the well using a perturbation approach oliver 1990 analytically derived the weighting function under the assumption that the transmissivity variations are much smaller than the average transmissivity integrating this function between any two points provides a measure of the contribution of the transmissivity variations of the corresponding region to drawdown thus oliver 1990 suggested to define radius of investigation as the distance from the well beyond which the integral of the weighting function is negligible more precisely equal to a given small proportion α 0 α 1 where a value of 0 01 is deemed meaningful oliver 1990 of the integral from the well radius to infinity with this definition the radius of investigation can be derived as appendix j 18 r inv 2 tt g u w 1 α s where g u w 1 is the inverse function of the function of g u w which is defined by eq j3 the evaluation of g u w 1 poses serious practical difficulties namely because the calculation of g u w itself requires the numerical evaluation of a double integral the latter takes a significant runtime using standard integration tools in python bresciani 2020 jones et al 2001 furthermore this function depends in an essential way on u w and thus we could not develop an approximate expression by fitting a simple analytical function in spite of this technical limitation this approach is elegant because it does not rely on the choice of a particular type of heterogeneity yet it also admits a major conceptual limitation due to the assumption of relatively small variations in transmissivity indeed if transmissivity variations are small then the overall response will be mostly controlled by the average transmissivity and not by the transmissivity variations and consequently the transmissivity value derived from the test will be fairly independent of the averaging process just described nonetheless oliver 1990 described an example where transmissivity variations were relatively large and the drawdown was still fairly well predicted by their model this result suggests that this approach may still be meaningful to understand the area of aquifer of which the transmissivity value derived from the test is representative 4 2 4 relative drawdown derivative averaging criterion oliver 1990 also developed the same approach as above for the case where the derivative of drawdown with respect to the natural logarithm of time is analyzed instead of drawdown that is they analytically derived the weighting function that describes the contribution of transmissivity variations to the drawdown derivative at the well as a function of distance from the well then with the same definition as above only the weighting function is different the radius of investigation can be obtained as appendix k 19 r inv 2 tt h u w 1 α s where h u w 1 is the inverse function of the function of h u w which is defined by eq k3 this function must still be evaluated numerically but it poses less difficulties than g u w 1 because it only requires the evaluation of a single integral furthermore this function is essentially independent of u w thus we were able to develop an approximate analytical expression for h u w 1 in the form of a shifted power law function obtained by curve fitting text s3 and fig s3 20 h u w 1 α 21 131 α 0 0136 21 208 the maximum error on h u w 1 implied by this approximation is 0 9 for α in the range 0 001 0 1 and u w in the range 10 16 10 2 which certainly encompass most common situations note that the conceptual limitation highlighted above regarding the assumption of relatively small variations in transmissivity applies here as well 4 2 5 proportion of linear barrier regime daungkaew et al 2000 qualitatively defined radius of investigation as the distance from the well up to which a feature e g a sealing fault could be interpreted using drawdown derivative data the derivative being again taken with respect to the natural logarithm of time in contrast with the previous definitions i e sections 4 2 1 4 2 4 here a feature must be clearly recognizable and not merely have a non negligible influence on drawdown that is this definition is tailored for the specific objective of feature detection to achieve an operational definition daungkaew et al 2000 used the well known fact that a feature typically induces a notable change in regime in the drawdown derivative data when compared with a homogeneous case bourdet et al 1989 thus daungkaew et al 2000 gave an operational definition of radius of investigation as the distance from the well at which the presence of a linear barrier in an otherwise homogeneous aquifer would imply that at the evaluation time the drawdown derivative has reached a given proportion 0 α 1 of the change in regime induced by the barrier with this definition daungkaew et al 2000 derived an equation for radius of investigation assuming that the derivative data are analyzed in logarithmic scale for completeness here we also present the case where the data are analyzed in linear i e normal scale in the latter case the radius of investigation is obtained as appendix l 21 r inv tt s ln α while when the data are analyzed in logarithmic scale it is obtained as appendix m 22 r inv tt s ln 2 α 1 one may notice that the radius of investigation given by eq 21 is exactly half of the radius of influence obtained in section 3 2 2 for a same value of α compare with eq 6 eq 21 also essentially gives the same radius of investigation as in section 4 2 2 compare with eq 17 however in the present case the parameter α has a fairly different meaning here it can be viewed as a confidence level at which the presence of a feature could be detected by looking for a change in regime in the drawdown derivative data the choice of an appropriate value for α is quite subjective but relevant values are typically much larger than in the previous approaches for instance daungkaew et al 2000 assumed that a feature is identifiable if α 0 9 4 3 heuristic definitions as for radius of influence a number of heuristic definitions have been proposed for estimating radius of investigation table 3 most of these definitions result from an approximation of the drawdown response according to which the effect of the presence of a feature e g a sealing fault on drawdown at the pumping well would be strictly zero until the evaluation time time at which it would suddenly start to have an effect this allows for the distance to the feature to be uniquely defined and subsequently derived the radius of investigation is then equated to this distance analogous to the impulse response peak definition for radius of influence the impulse response difference peak definition is different and somewhat more elegant than the other heuristic definitions because it does not rely on an approximation of the response instead it uses a special characteristic of the response details in table 3 the same remarks as for radius of influence apply here regarding the implicit arbitrariness of these definitions and their inherent lack of rigorous meaning section 3 3 see also section 4 4 below hence these definitions must be used with caution in practice we suggest that they should only be used when seeking no more than an order of magnitude 4 4 comparison analogous to the case of radius of influence there is a major difference between the definitions of section 4 1 and those of sections 4 2 4 3 the former depend on the pumping rate whereas the latter do not for the definitions of sections 4 1 4 2 these properties directly follow from those definitions being based on either an absolute criterion or a relative criterion the fact that the heuristic definitions are independent of the pumping rate reveals that implicitly these definitions are also of a relative nature regardless of the differences all the equations for radius of investigation can also be put into the form 23 r inv c tt s where the coefficient c may either depend on s c section 4 1 1 depend on 2 s c δ section 4 1 2 depend on α sections 4 2 1 4 2 5 or be constant section 4 3 the values that the coefficient c may take in practice are analyzed in fig 4 for all the definitions except the one based on a proportion of linear barrier regime the latter is better discussed separately see below for those formulae where c depends on a parameter wide ranges of realistic parameter values have been used overall c ranges between 0 and 3 in spite of the differences between the various definitions generally speaking the values of c are about half of the values obtained for radius of influence compare with fig 3 in fact as already noted above a number of definitions of radius of investigation make the latter exactly equal to half of the radius of influence as observed for radius of influence c displays similar trends although it has different values in most of the definitions that are based on a criterion whether absolute or relative fig 4 reflecting the fact that the various criteria are actually correlated the definition based on an absolute drawdown derivative difference criterion is somewhat different in this case the radius of investigation rapidly decreases when 2 s c δ increases it reaches zero when δ 2 s c note that a large window size can only be employed if the test duration is large enough thus with this definition the test duration is doubly important since time already explicitly appears in eq 23 for two of the heuristic definitions semi empirical start of head boundary effect and intersection of unbounded and closed reservoir regimes the values of c are somewhat on the higher end of the overall range of values this can be explained by the fact that these two definitions rely on models where the well is exactly located at the center of a perfectly circular reservoir in which case the boundary will simultaneously impact the drawdown at the well from all sides in contrast a linear barrier will have more gradual effects the latter model is likely a better representation of what may occur in reality fig 4 shows that the radius of investigation is typically larger when drawdown derivative data are used than when drawdown data are used for an otherwise equivalent definition compare solid versus dashed lines of the same color this outcome is somewhat intuitive the drawdown derivative can be expected to be more sensitive to what is newly explored i e further away nonetheless this finding is not completely obvious and here the results allow for a quantification of this phenomenon for instance with a definition based on a relative difference criterion i e sections 4 2 1 and 4 2 2 orange lines in fig 4 using drawdown derivative data will yield a radius of investigation that is between 32 and 1 132 larger than when using drawdown data depending on parameter values u w s c and δ the definitions based on a relative averaging criterion i e sections 4 2 3 and 4 2 4 green lines in fig 4 systematically yield a larger radius of investigation than those based on a relative difference criterion i e sections 4 2 1 and 4 2 2 orange lines in fig 4 for comparable data types i e drawdown or drawdown derivative we hypothesize that this result is related to the fact that the definitions based on a relative averaging criterion only focus on the transmissivity variations independently of the average transmissivity value see section 4 2 3 thus transmissivity variations at the radius of investigation may be given too much importance in comparison with their influence on the overall response and this could yield an overestimation of the radius of investigation in spite of these observations it should be noted that in most cases the differences between these two types of definitions are not huge this is somewhat reassuring and provides further support to our claim that defining radius of investigation based on the consideration of the effect of a linear barrier is meaningful possible values of the coefficient c in the definition based on a proportion of linear barrier regime are shown in fig 5 as already explained section 4 2 5 here α represents a confidence level for feature detection and so relevant values are typically larger than in the other definitions based on a relative criterion c and thus the radius of investigation is then logically smaller than in the other definitions based on a relative derivative criterion compare with fig 4 in particular the radius of investigation tends to zero when α approaches 1 reflecting the fact that the asymptotic regime can never be perfectly reached fig 5 also shows that the scale of analysis i e linear or logarithmic scale does not have much impact on the radius of investigation 5 practical guide on the basis of the discussion led throughout this work a decision tree is proposed to assist in choosing a suitable operational definition of radius of influence or radius of investigation depending on the objective fig 6 at the first level one should obviously determine whether their objective requires estimation of the radius of influence or the radius of investigation on the next level one must determine whether they only seek an order of magnitude or a more precise estimation in the former case one may use a heuristic definition although any other definition would also do but heuristic definitions are arguably the simplest since they do not depend on any parameter in this case our suggestion would be to use the impulse response peak definition for radius of influence and the analogous impulse response difference peak definition for radius of investigation in contrast with the other heuristic definitions these definitions have a precise physical meaning furthermore they may easily be extended to heterogeneous media although using more advanced modelling techniques datta gupta et al 2011 and thus the underlying idea is in fact quite general however one must keep in mind that heuristic definitions can imply a significant underestimation or overestimation of the radius depending on what operational definition would otherwise be chosen see fig 3 and fig 4 when one requires a more accurate estimate a method based on an explicit criterion must be used the choice then depends on the specific objective for which the radius needs to be evaluated as summarized in fig 6 the case where one wants to determine the area of aquifer of which the derived parameters of a pumping test are representative deserves some discussion in this case we suggest that in principle one must in fact use a combination of two definitions one of the definitions based on a relative criterion i e sections 4 2 1 4 2 4 and the corresponding definition based on an absolute criterion i e section 4 1 1 or 4 1 2 the latter definition should indeed be also used to check that the apparent resolution of head measurements allows for aquifer properties to be seen as far as the former definition will suggest that is the two radii must be calculated and the smallest of them must be retained nonetheless the quantitative analysis in fig 5 shows that in practice the definition based on an absolute difference criterion will often yield a radius of investigation that is smaller than with the definition based on a relative difference criterion this is especially true when the drawdown derivative is used therefore the final radius will often be the one given by the absolute difference criterion definition thus in order to simplify the procedure we suggest that only using the absolute difference criterion definition i e section 4 1 1 or 4 1 2 can be considered reasonable we warn the reader that this practical guide only consists of suggestions derived from the authors own opinions as exposed above we acknowledge that particular constraints might exist that have not been recognized in this work and could lead to a different better choice other objectives might also exist that have not been discussed nonetheless we believe that the indications provided herein will be relevant in a majority of situations it is obvious that all the methods require an a priori knowledge of transmissivity and storativity ideally these parameters may be estimated from a pumping test conducted at the well when this is not available e g when the purpose of estimating radius influence or radius of investigation is precisely to design a first pumping test at the well one may interpolate or extrapolate values obtained from nearest available pumping tests use regional scale estimates e g obtained from a calibrated numerical model or employ literature values in the worst case as new information is obtained e g as new pumping tests are conducted or even as a pumping test goes on estimates of transmissivity and storativity may be refined and the radius of influence investigation can be reevaluated in particular at the end of a pumping test a final value of the radius of investigation can be calculated this value can then be reported along with the results of the pumping test in order to inform the area of aquifer of which the estimated parameters are representative in fact we suggest that this should be a standard practice 6 conclusions the radius of influence and radius of investigation of a pumping well are useful concepts with various uses in well hydraulics and aquifer testing although their qualitative definition is straightforward numerous operational definitions are possible classifying the definitions according to their nature i e based on an absolute criterion based on a relative criterion or heuristic helps understanding the conceptual differences between them we also suggest that different definitions are best suited for different objectives accordingly the practical guide developed herein will assist anyone in choosing a suitable definition depending on the objective section 5 quantitatively radius of influence and radius of investigation are significantly affected by the choice of operational definition and associated parameters figs 3 5 as a rule of thumb the radius of investigation is half of the radius of influence in all cases the two radii are proportional to tt s this outcome can be given a simple explanation based on a dimensional analysis of the diffusivity equation we also found that the radius of investigation is generally larger when using the derivative of drawdown with respect to the natural logarithm of time than when simply using drawdown this insight can help in choosing a type of analysis when processing pumping test data declaration of competing interest the authors declare

commission on minnesota resources lccmr the authors are grateful to two reviewers for their valuable comments this work does not rely on any data appendix a instantaneous response property the diffusivity equation implies that a perturbation of the system at some point is felt instantaneously at an infinite distance from the source even though the magnitude of the response rapidly decreases with distance the theis solution is illustrative of this property theis 1935 drawdown is everywhere non zero right after the pumping starts in reality a signal cannot propagate infinitely fast without contradicting fundamental physical principles i e a signal cannot propagate faster than the speed of light this paradox of the diffusivity equation is a consequence of darcy s law which in its classical form implies an all time equilibrium of the groundwater flux with the hydraulic head gradient at any point in fact when the hydraulic head gradient at a given point is perturbated a transient phase exists during which the groundwater flux gradually evolves towards a new equilibrium foster et al 1967 neuman 1977 oroveanu and pascal 1959 philip 1957 darcy s law may actually be modified to account for this transient phase and on this basis an alternative governing equation describing the pressure wave propagation may be derived that suppresses the instantaneous propagation paradox foster et al 1967 oroveanu and pascal 1959 wave propagation is nonetheless very fast it has the speed of sound at field scale it is thus the pressure diffusion process that controls the overall response of the system unless the fluid is exposed to high frequency pressure waves kuchuk 2009 pascal 1986 therefore in classical applications wave propagation may indeed be considered instantaneous and the diffusivity equation is appropriate appendix b derivation of radius of influence equation based on an absolute drawdown criterion the theis solution for drawdown s l can be written as b1 s u q 4 π t e 1 u where u s r 2 4 t t is dimensionless and e 1 is the exponential integral function defined by b2 e 1 u u e x x d x where u is a strictly positive number thus to calculate the radius of influence r infl l based on an absolute drawdown criterion s c l one needs to invert the equation b3 q 4 π t e 1 u infl s c where u infl s r infl 2 4 t t formally we thus have b4 u infl e 1 1 4 π t s c q where e 1 1 is the inverse function of e 1 noting s c 4 π t s c q and solving for r infl yields eq 1 appendix c derivation of radius of influence equation based on a relative drawdown criterion using the theis solution for drawdown eq 3 translates into c1 e 1 u infl e 1 u w α where u infl s r infl 2 4 t t u w s r w 2 4 t t and r w is the well radius therefore c2 u infl e 1 1 α e 1 u w and solving for r infl yields eq 4 appendix d derivation of radius of influence equation based on a relative flow rate criterion in this case the definition of radius of influence translates into the equation d1 q infl q α where q infl is the flow rate across the walls of a cylinder centered on the well and having radius r infl q infl is easily derived from the theis solution and darcy s law as d2 q infl q e s r infl 2 4 t t using this expression in eq d1 and rearranging terms yields eq 6 appendix e derivation of radius of influence equation based on a relative volume criterion in this case the definition of radius of influence translates into the equation e1 v r infl v 0 α where v r 1 r 2 for any r 1 and r 2 denotes the volume of the cone of depression between radial distances r 1 and r 2 from the well for convenience let us introduce a s 4 t t the volume of the cone of depression v r 1 r 2 between any two radial distances r 1 and r 2 is given by e2 v r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 2 π r s a r 2 d r where s represents the drawdown function given by the theis solution eq b1 replacing and integrating by parts yields e3 v r 1 r 2 q 4 t r 2 2 a r 2 2 e x x d x r 1 2 a r 1 2 e x x d x e a r 1 2 e a r 2 2 a the form r 2 a r 2 e x x d x is indeterminate both for r and r 0 but both cases can be resolved using l hospital rule and yield 0 thus e4 v r infl q 4 t r infl 2 a r infl 2 e x x d x e a r infl 2 a and e5 v 0 q 4 t a note that the latter expression can also be obtained by noting that v 0 is the cumulative volume of extracted fluid divided by s it follows that note u infl a r infl 2 e6 v r infl v 0 e u infl u inf e 1 u infl therefore eq e1 is equivalent to e7 e u infl u infl e 1 u infl α let us introduce the function f defined such that f u infl is equal to the left hand side of this equation that is f is the function defined by e8 f u e u u e 1 u where u is a strictly positive number then formally eq e7 is equivalent to u infl f 1 α and solving this equation for r infl yields eq 7 appendix f derivation of radius of investigation equation based on an absolute drawdown difference criterion this definition translates into the equation f1 s barrier u inv s nobarrier s c where s barrier and s nobarrier represent the drawdowns at the pumping well in the presence and absence of a linear barrier respectively and u inv s r inv 2 4 t t both s barrier and s nobarrier depend on t q t s and r w but these parameters are not explicitly shown in this equation because they are given parameters of the problem s barrier further depends on the distance from the well to the barrier i e r inv taken as the perpendicular from the well to the barrier which is the unknown of the problem and is embedded in u inv s nobarrier is given by the theis solution eq b1 whereas s barrier is easily obtained from the method of images bear 1972 muskat 1937 as f2 s barrier u inv s nobarrier q 4 π t e 1 4 u inv where r w r inv is assumed using this expression in eq f1 and solving for r inv yields eq 13 appendix g derivation of radius of investigation equation based on an absolute drawdown derivative difference criterion the derivative of drawdown with respect to the natural logarithm of time s is given by g1 s s ln t t s t in practice s is typically evaluated from pumping test data using a sliding window along ln t i e g2 s ln t s ln t δ 2 s ln t δ 2 δ where δ dimensionless since it has the dimension of ln t is the window size therefore if s c is the apparent resolution on drawdown uncertainty propagation rules farrance and frenkel 2012 imply that the apparent resolution on the drawdown derivative will be equal to 2 s c δ consequently in this case the definition of radius of investigation translates into the equation g3 s barrier u inv s nobarrier 2 s c δ the derivative terms in this equation are given by g4 s nobarrier q 4 π t e u w and g5 s barrier r inv q 4 π t e u w e 4 u inv making replacements in eq g3 and solving for r inv yields eq 14 appendix h derivation of radius of investigation equation based on a relative drawdown difference criterion this definition translates into the equation h1 s barrier u inv s nobarrier s nobarrier α using eqs b1 and f2 and solving for r inv yields eq 15 appendix i derivation of radius of investigation equation based on a relative drawdown derivative difference criterion this definition translates into the equation i1 s barrier u inv s nobarrier s nobarrier α using eqs g4 and g5 and solving for r inv yields eq 16 appendix j derivation of radius of investigation equation based on a relative drawdown averaging criterion for the drawdown response oliver 1990 derived the non normalized weighting function as j1 w t d r d π 2 0 t d r d t 2 exp r d 2 2 t w 1 2 1 2 r d 2 t d t where r d r r w and t d tt s r w 2 are dimensionless variables and w κ μ is the whittaker function abramowitz and stegun 1974 the relative contribution of the transmissivity variations of the region located beyond the dimensionless radius of investigation r dinv r inv r w at some dimensionless time t d is thus given by j2 g t d r dinv r dinv w t d r d d r d 1 w t d r d d r d for consistency with the rest of this paper we prefer to work with the dimensionless variables u and u w rather than with r d and t d the conversions between these two sets of dimensionless variables are given by u r d 2 4 t d and u w 1 4 t d then by using the rule of integration by substitution it can be shown that the previous equation is equivalent to j3 g u w u inv u inv w u d u u w w u d u where j4 w u π u u exp 2 u w 1 2 1 2 4 u d u i e w is our weighting function the radius of investigation is then given by eq 18 appendix k derivation of radius of investigation equation based on a relative drawdown derivative averaging criterion for the drawdown derivative response oliver 1990 derived the non normalized weighting function as k1 w t d r d π r d 2 t d exp r d 2 2 t d w 1 2 1 2 r d 2 t d the relative contribution of the transmissivity variations of the region located beyond the dimensionless radius of investigation r dinv at some dimensionless time t d is thus given by k2 h t d r dinv r dinv w t d r d d r d 1 w t d r d d r d as in appendix j we transform this equation so as to use the dimensionless variables u and u w instead of r d and t d then by using the rule of integration by substitution it can be shown that the previous equation is equivalent to k3 h u w u inv u inv w u d u u w w u d u where k4 w u π exp 2 u w 1 2 1 2 4 u i e w is our weighting function the radius of investigation is then given by eq 19 appendix l derivation of radius of investigation equations based on a proportion of linear barrier regime linear scale in a homogeneous unbounded aquifer the drawdown quickly tends towards a regime in which the drawdown derivative is constant and equal to see eq g4 l1 s nobarrier q 4 π t this value is often essentially reached before the presence of a major feature would have any significant influence on drawdown in the presence of a linear barrier drawdown will transit from this regime towards a final asymptotic regime at large times characterized by another constant value which happens to be the double of the first regime value see eq g5 i e l2 s barrier q 2 π t denoting by α a given proportion 0 α 1 of the transition between these two regimes daungkaew et al s 2000 definition of radius of investigation when the drawdown derivative data are analyzed in linear scale translates into the equation l3 s barrier r inv s nobarrier s barrier s nobarrier α making suitable replacements using eqs g5 l1 and l2 and simplifying yields l4 e u w e 4 u inv 1 α in this expression it is reasonable to assume that e u w 1 this is assuming that the first regime has been reached solving for r inv then yields eq 21 appendix m derivation of radius of investigation equations based on a proportion of linear barrier regime logarithmic scale when the drawdown derivative data are analyzed in logarithmic scale daungkaew et al s 2000 definition of radius of investigation translates into the equation m1 l o g 10 s barrier r inv l o g 10 s nobarrier l o g 10 s barrier l o g 10 s nobarrier α where the same notation as in appendix l is used making suitable replacements using eqs g5 l1 and l2 and simplifying yields m2 ln e u w e 4 u inv ln 2 α as already mentioned appendix l it is reasonable to assume that e u w 1 solving for r inv then yields eq 22 appendix n derivation of radius of investigation equation intersection of unbounded and linear barrier regimes in the presence of a linear barrier drawdown at the pumping well is characterized by two regimes jones 1962 a first regime valid at relatively early times where drawdown essentially behaves as in an unbounded aquifer and may be approximated by n1 s nobarrier q 4 π t ln 1 e γ u w where γ is the euler mascheroni constant γ 0 5772 and a second regime valid at relatively large times where the influence of the barrier which we consider located at a distance r inv from the well is fully effective and drawdown may be approximated by n2 s barrier q 4 π t ln 1 e γ u w ln 1 4 e γ u inv if the first regime is extended forward in time and the second regime is extended backward in time the two regimes will intersect at a specific time this specific time is a unique function of r inv and is characteristic of the transition between the two regimes but in reality the transition is smooth finding this time i e equating eqs n1 and n2 and reversing the relationship to find r inv as a function of time yields n3 r inv tt e γ s 0 75 tt s previously jones 1962 proposed this expression for estimating the distance to a linear barrier from pumping test data since in practice the intersection between the two regimes can easily be found from straight line analysis in semi log plots however to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that this approach is proposed to define radius of investigation appendix o derivation of radius of investigation equation impulse response difference peak vela and mckinley 1970 and lee 1982 both proposed the same definition of radius of influence which is called impulse response peak in this article table 2 here we propose to adapt the idea underlying this definition to obtain a meaningful definition of radius of investigation to adapt this idea we consider the response to a pressure impulse in the presence of a linear barrier and to compare it to the response to a pressure impulse without a linear barrier in an unbounded aquifer the response at the well noted s below to a pressure impulse is given by o1 s nobarrier a t e u w where a is a constant with no importance in what follows in the presence of a linear barrier located at a distance r inv from the well the response to a pressure impulse is easily obtained by using the method of images as o2 s barrier u inv a t e u w e 4 u inv the difference between the two responses is given by o3 s barrier u inv s nobarrier a t e 4 u inv this difference will reach peak at a specific time that depends on r inv determining this time i e solving s barrier u inv s nobarrier t 0 and inverting the relationship to find r inv as a function of time yields o4 r inv tt s in other words in this definition r inv is the distance from the well at which the presence of a linear barrier would imply that the peak difference in drawdown when compared with the drawdown obtained for an unbounded aquifer occurs at the evaluation time equivalently this is the distance to a linear barrier that would make the rate of drawdown difference variation be the fastest at the evaluation time in the problem of constant rate pumping this can be verified by noting that the second time derivative of s barrier s nobarrier is equal to zero when eq o4 holds see eqs b1 and f2 one may notice that the radius of investigation obtained here is exactly half of the radius of influence given by the impulse response

5755,the radius of influence and radius of investigation of a pumping well are fundamental concepts in hydrogeology with various uses in well hydraulics and aquifer testing however numerous definitions have been given of these radii which have often been equated while they are fundamentally different here radius of influence is qualitatively defined as the maximum distance from a pumping well up to which the influence of pumping is significant on the other hand radius of investigation is qualitatively defined as the maximum distance from a pumping well up to which aquifer properties have a significant influence on drawdown at the well the exact meaning of the term significant is open to interpretation and consequently various operational definitions i e definitions that enable quantification have been given of radius of influence and radius of investigation we comprehensively review these definitions and corresponding estimation methods and discuss the relevance of each definition in view of different potential uses we also propose new definitions that are more adapted to several applications next we quantitatively compare the various definitions of radius of influence and radius of investigation the results show that while remaining of the same order of magnitude the radii are significantly affected by the choice of operational definition and associated parameters as a rule of thumb the radius of investigation is half of the radius of influence we eventually propose a practical guide for choosing a suitable operational definition of radius of influence or radius of investigation depending on the objective keywords radius of influence radius of investigation radius of drainage well hydraulics aquifer test pumping test 1 introduction well hydraulics and aquifer testing play a major role in applied hydrogeology renard 2006 in studying these topics it is frequently needed to estimate the radius of influence or radius of investigation of a pumping well however a lot of confusion surrounds these concepts to start with these two radii have often been assumed to be equal while in reality they are fundamentally different bourdet 2002 daungkaew et al 2000 oliver 1990 tabatabaie et al 2017 next numerous definitions have been given of these radii but the conceptual differences between the various definitions have barely been discussed and little guidance is available regarding when to choose a specific definition rather than another as a result the practical use of these concepts is challenging and prone to misinterpretations to resolve this situation we present a comprehensive review of the concepts of radius of influence or radius of investigation and the methods to estimate them new definitions and methods are also proposed to address gaps that were identified during the course of our review our main objectives are to clarify the concepts of radius of influence and radius of investigation and facilitate their practical use the concepts of radius of influence and radius of investigation have more extensively been discussed in the petroleum engineering literature in which the term radius of drainage has also been used than in the groundwater literature these concepts have an uppermost importance in petroleum engineering because they are often used to identify reservoir limits which are directly related to the volume of oil and gas reserves kuchuk 2009 nonetheless identifying aquifer boundaries is also crucial in hydrogeology in fact we found that the concepts of radius of influence and radius of investigation have many potential uses that are relevant to both petroleum engineering and groundwater applications thus in this work an important effort was made to integrate the literature from both fields of study qualitative definitions of radius of influence and radius of investigation are given in section 2 together with a presentation of the potential uses of these concepts the definitions given in this section are only qualitative because they do not specify a criterion to decide what is a negligible or significant response to a perturbation note that the diffusivity equation which governs groundwater flow implies that a perturbation at some point instantaneously induces a non zero response at an infinite distance from the source the fundamental reason for this behavior is discussed in appendix a as the magnitude of the response continuously decreases with distance from the source in practice the response can be considered as being effectively negligible beyond some distance however as there is no clear natural cutoff this distance i e the radius of influence investigation is intrinsically ambiguous in this work we review and introduce new ways of precisely defining radius of influence and radius of investigation discuss the relevance of each definition in view of different potential uses and quantitatively compare the various definitions sections 3 and 4 for radius of influence and radius of investigation respectively as an outcome we propose a practical guide for choosing a suitable operational definition depending on the objective section 5 the equations presented in this article rely on major simplifying assumptions namely most of them rely on the theis solution to pumping which assumes horizontal flow in a homogeneous confined aquifer of infinite extent constant rate pumping fully penetrating well and negligible wellbore storage and skin effects there are three reasons for this choice the first reason is that the primary objective of this work is to discuss the relevance of various definitions of radius of influence and radius of investigation in view of the potential uses of these concepts this discussion is mostly conceptual and independent of the flow model taken for deriving the equations therefore in spite of the simplifying assumptions made most of the ideas developed in this work will contribute to clarifying the concepts of radius of influence and radius of investigation in more sophisticated frameworks as well the second reason is that we aim to present simple methods for estimating the radius of influence and radius of investigation of a pumping well at first order the theis solution allows for reaching this goal because it is an analytical solution and it only requires a small number of parameters lastly the third reason is that virtually an infinity of approaches may be developed depending on the assumptions made on the system hence it is practically not feasible to make an exhaustive presentation of all the potential solutions while keeping our focus on clarifying the concepts of radius of influence and radius of investigation thus while we do acknowledge the existence of various effects induced by heterogeneity boundary conditions etc these effects are not further discussed in this work previous studies adopting different frameworks are nonetheless listed in table 1 2 qualitative definitions and potential uses 2 1 radius of influence in this work the radius of influence of a pumping well is qualitatively defined as the maximum distance from the well up to which the influence of pumping is significant fig 1 a estimating the radius of influence of a pumping well is useful when designing a well interference test i e a pumping test where the observation well is different from the pumping well renard 2006 in which case it allows for determining the maximum distance from the well up to which drawdown may be measured at a given time or inversely one may estimate the minimum pumping duration for drawdown to be measurable at a given distance note however that this distance does not directly inform the area of aquifer of which the results of a pumping test are representative for this see section 2 2 estimating the radius of influence of a pumping well is also useful when designing a multiple well system in which case it allows for determining the minimum spacing between wells that is required for avoiding any significant well interference and hence minimizing well operation costs estimating the radius of influence of a pumping well can also serve the purpose of impact assessment studies by informing the maximum distance from the well up to which drawdown may affect other wells or groundwater dependent ecosystems note that the radius of influence of a pumping well is generally understood as a transient concept and it is so in this article that is this radius increases with time in response to pumping a steady state concept of radius of influence is probably of limited relevance because under steady flow conditions the drawdown mostly depends on boundary conditions and it is generally not radially distributed around the well the term radius of influence is nonetheless often used to denote the distance to a zero drawdown circular boundary condition in the context of the dupuit solution also known as the thiem solution which describes steady flow to a pumping well bear 1979 dupuit 1863 houben 2015 kresic 2006 thiem 1906 however in practice the dupuit solution is typically used as an approximation of a slowly evolving transient situation in that case a practical way of determining the radius of influence is again to estimate it from a transient method such as those reviewed in this article 2 2 radius of investigation in this work the radius of investigation of a pumping well is qualitatively defined as the maximum distance from the well up to which aquifer properties have a significant influence on drawdown at the well fig 1b estimating the radius of investigation of a pumping well allows for determining the area of aquifer investigated during a single well test i e a pumping test where the pumping well is also the observation well renard 2006 indirectly it also allows for determining the area of aquifer investigated during a well interference test details are given below this information is critical both when designing a test e g to determine the minimum required test duration for covering a target area and when interpreting it e g to inform the area of aquifer of which the results of the test are representative as a particular application the radius of investigation informs the maximum distance from the well up to which the presence of a major feature e g a hydraulic barrier could be detected during a test furthermore if a major feature is really identified during a test evaluating the radius of investigation at the time at which the feature starts to have an influence on drawdown will provide an estimate of the distance to the feature however also note that if a major feature does exist the concept of radius of investigation is only strictly meaningful until it reaches the feature beyond this time the influence of the feature becomes significant and the area of investigation is not circular any more thus at later times one would need to employ a more sophisticated framework to study the area of investigation in our definition of radius of investigation it is explicitly stated that drawdown is analyzed at the pumping well itself and not anywhere else however in practice well interference tests are often preferred over single well tests because drawdown at the pumped well may be affected by turbulence and well losses sterrett 2007 when the observation well is different from the pumping well the problem of determining the area of investigation of the test is notably different first of all while the radius of investigation of a single well grows from nothing as soon as the pumping starts the area of investigation of a pair of pumping and observation wells is nil until the radius of influence indeed and not the radius of investigation of the pumping well becomes larger than the distance between the two wells secondly when it is not nil the area of investigation of a pair of pumping and observation wells is not circular rather it is elliptical oliver 1993 fig 2 a b the bounding ellipse of the area of investigation has foci at the pumping and observation wells and it satisfies the relationship d p d o 2 r inv where d p and d o represent the distances from any point of the ellipse to the pumping and observation wells respectively and r inv is the radius of investigation of the pumping well as defined above oliver 1993 therefore although our definition of radius of investigation is only directly related to single well tests this concept can also be used to estimate the area of investigation of well interference tests the term radius of investigation originates from the petroleum engineering literature nonetheless the potential uses of this concept i e design and interpretation of pumping tests as discussed above are clearly relevant to groundwater applications as well also note that the radius of influence and radius of investigation of a pumping well are in fact very much related precisely as will be demonstrated later it is generally reasonable to consider that r infl 2 r inv this result can be explained by the fact that in order for a feature to have an influence on drawdown at the well the signal induced by pumping must first reach this feature and then the effect of the feature has to diffuse back to the well bourdet 2002 jones 1962 hence the two radii can be easily derived from one another 3 radius of influence operational definitions and estimation methods we identified three fundamentally different types of operational definitions i e definitions that enable quantification of radius of influence definitions based on an absolute criterion definitions based on a relative criterion and heuristic definitions definitions of the first two types use a threshold to determine what is considered as being a significant influence and thus they have an accurate meaning in contrast heuristic definitions make use of some uniquely defined distance that only qualitative agrees with the concept of radius of influence below the various definitions are classified and discussed according to these three types 3 1 definitions based on an absolute criterion 3 1 1 absolute drawdown criterion an intuitive way of obtaining a practical radius of influence is to define it as the distance at which drawdown is equal to a specified small value fig 1a dragoni 1998 kresic 2006 kuchuk 2009 this definition is relevant when one wants to know the distance from the well up to which hydraulic head measurements can be taken e g during a well interference test indeed in practice hydraulic head measurements have a finite resolution consequently beyond a certain distance from the well the drawdown is too small to be observed and can thus be considered negligible the resolution of hydraulic head measurements depends both on the resolution of the measurement device e g pressure gauge and on the background noise which overlaps with the signal induced by pumping i e any event that is not accounted for in the idealized representation of the system such as small variations in the pumping rate the sum of measurement device resolution and background noise may be called apparent resolution kuchuk 2009 the exact apparent resolution may be difficult to anticipate prior to data acquisition but different authors reported similar practical values in the range 0 01 0 07 m dragoni 1998 kuchuk 2009 defining radius of influence as a function of a given drawdown value may also be relevant for impact assessment studies in that case drawdown may be considered as being effectively negligible when it is smaller than some regulatory limit which may be decided to avoid potential conflicts between different groundwater users or adverse environmental effects with this definition estimating the radius of influence consists in inverting a drawdown function that is it consists in finding the distance from the center of the well at which drawdown is equal to a given threshold criterion here we adopt the theis solution for drawdown theis 1935 however in principle there is no restriction on the choice of the drawdown function which may even be the result of a numerical model the reasons for using the theis solution in this work are discussed in the introduction section 1 the following parameters are introduced q l3 t 1 is the pumping rate t l2 t 1 is the aquifer transmissivity s is the aquifer storativity t t is the time elapsed from the start of pumping and s c l is the specified drawdown threshold criterion we also define the combined parameter s c 4 π t s c q which may be referred to as dimensionless drawdown threshold criterion by inverting the theis solution for drawdown the radius of influence r infl l is obtained as appendix b 1 r infl 2 tt e 1 1 s c s where e 1 1 is the inverse function of the function e 1 which is the well known exponential integral function defined by eq b2 often called well function in the groundwater literature bear 1979 fetter 2001 the evaluation of e 1 1 poses some practical difficulties as no analytical form is known for this function pecina 1986 ricker and von rosen 2018 therefore a numerical procedure must be used a python code based on a simple root finding algorithm jones et al 2001 was written for this purpose this code was made publicly available as part of a python package named wellradpy bresciani 2020 which was developed to implement all the methods discussed in this manuscript alternatively we also developed an approximate analytical expression for e 1 1 in the form of a shifted power law obtained by curve fitting text s1 and fig s1 2 e 1 1 s c 3 656 s c 0 1295 3 445 the maximum error on e 1 1 implied by this approximation is 2 3 for s c in the range 0 0036 0 63 which probably encompasses most common situations based on parameter values reported by dragoni 1998 somewhat similarly dragoni 1998 developed approximate analytical expressions for r infl based on a specified drawdown criterion however they derived several expressions corresponding to different values of s c they did so for five values of s c the approach presented above is more powerful because we arrived at a single expression in which s c is a parameter embedded into s c to mention a last option one may also read in reverse tabulated values for e 1 as provided for instance in bear 1979 table 8 2 and fetter 2001 p 245 however this method is somewhat tedious and not very accurate note that the use of the well known logarithmic approximation of the e 1 function e g cooper and jacob 1946 theis 1935 which would greatly simplify the inversion is strongly discouraged in the present context indeed this approximation is only valid for small values of the argument u of the function u 0 01 is usually recommended bear 1979 small values of u are obtained for small distances from the well and are thus in contradiction with the fact that the radius of influence is naturally large in fact at the radius of influence u will typically be larger than 0 44 fig s1 which is well beyond the range of validity of the logarithmic approximation 3 2 definitions based on a relative criterion 3 2 1 relative drawdown criterion in some situations it may be meaningful to define radius of influence as the maximum distance from a pumping well up to which drawdown is significant relative to drawdown at the well as opposed to significant in absolute namely when designing a multiple well system it is informative to know the minimum well spacing that is required for avoiding significant well interference well interference can never be completely avoided due to the instantaneous pressure propagation already discussed in the introduction but one may want it to be small enough for the productivity of each well to be almost equal to that of a single well since well productivity is essentially a function of drawdown at the pumping well referring to the energy cost required to lift up a unit volume of water using a criterion that is relative to drawdown at that pumped well is relevant in this context in this case the radius of influence is defined from the equation 3 drawdown at the radius of influence drawdown at the well α where α is a specified threshold criterion 0 α 1 the choice of α is somewhat arbitrary but a value of 0 01 i e 1 is deemed meaningful van poolen 1964 van poolen 1964 was the first to introduce this definition of radius of influence and to derive an expression for estimating it however they did not use the theis solution for drawdown instead they considered a semi infinite slab aquifer model also called linear aquifer model where one end of the slab is subject to a sudden and fixed drawdown although this model may be suitable in some particular situations it is inappropriate when the flow is radial and a constant pumping rate is applied at the well thus this expression is not reported here to the best of our knowledge no expression for radius of influence has previously been presented based on the definition given above and using the theis solution for drawdown using the theis solution for drawdown the radius of influence as defined here can be derived as appendix c 4 r infl 2 tt e 1 1 α e 1 u w s where u w s r w 2 4 t t and r w l is the well radius in this expression the common logarithmic approximation of e 1 may be used to simplify e 1 u w because u w is typically small since the well radius is small yielding 5 r infl 2 tt e 1 1 α ln 1 78 u w s as already mentioned in section 3 1 the evaluation of e 1 1 poses some practical difficulties nonetheless the methods discussed in that section can also be used here in particular the approximate analytical expression shown in eq 2 can be used as long as the argument of e 1 1 lies within the indicated range of values note that here the radius of influence depends on u w and thus on the well radius the smaller the value of u w i e the smaller the well radius the smaller the radius of influence 3 2 2 relative flow rate criterion instead of defining radius of influence from a relative drawdown criterion one may similarly define it from a relative flow rate criterion that is radius of influence may be defined from the requirement that the flow rate across the walls of a cylinder of radius r infl centered on the well is small relative to the flow rate at the well i e the pumping rate tek et al 1957 we suggest that this definition may be relevant in the context of impact assessment studies indeed the radius of influence will then indicate the area within which the disturbance induced by pumping is the strongest relative to the overall disturbance of the system thus this area could be designated as the target of detailed assessment and monitoring for example with this definition the radius of influence is obtained as appendix d 6 r infl 2 t t ln α s where α is a specified threshold criterion 0 α 1 the choice of α is somewhat arbitrary but a value of 0 01 i e 1 is deemed meaningful tek et al 1957 van poolen 1964 a key difference between this expression and the previous one eq 4 is that this expression is independent of the well radius this makes sense when the purpose of estimating the radius of influence is related to impact assessment since drawdown is everywhere independent of the well radius except at the well itself 3 2 3 relative volume criterion alternatively one may use a relative criterion bearing on the volume of the cone of depression induced by pumping or equivalently the volume of extracted fluid johnson 1988 that is radius of influence may be defined from the requirement that the volume of the portion of the cone of depression beyond this distance is small relative to the total volume of the cone of depression as in the previous section section 3 2 2 such a definition may be relevant in the context of impact assessment studies as it will indicate the area within which the disturbance induced by pumping is the strongest relative to the overall disturbance of the system in fact it might be more relevant to evaluate the disturbance in terms of volume of the cone of depression than in terms of flow rate because this quantity more directly relates to drawdown with this definition and denoting again by α a specified threshold criterion 0 α 1 where a value of 0 01 is deemed meaningful the radius of influence is obtained as appendix e 7 r infl 2 tt f 1 α s where f 1 is the inverse function of the function f which is defined by eq e8 no analytical expression is known for f 1 and so a numerical procedure is required to evaluate this function a suitable code is available as part of the wellradpy package alternatively we developed an approximate analytical expression for f 1 in the form of a shifted power law function obtained by curve fitting text s2 and fig s2 8 f 1 α 14 404 α 0 0457 14 734 the maximum error on f 1 implied by this approximation is 0 5 for α in the range 0 001 0 1 note that this approach is conceptually identical to that presented by johnson 1988 however johnson 1988 did not exactly follow the same steps as here and as a result they arrived at slightly more complicated expression their expression yields slightly larger errors for small values of α up to 8 1 for α 0 001 but is as accurate otherwise 3 3 heuristic definitions a number of heuristic definitions have been proposed for estimating radius of influence table 2 most of these definitions rely on an approximation of the drawdown response according to which drawdown is assumed to be exactly equal to zero beyond some distance which increases with time at any time the latter distance is well defined and can be derived as a result of the approximation made the radius of influence is then simply equated to this distance the impulse response peak definition is different from the other heuristic definitions and is somewhat more elegant because it does not rely on an approximation of the response instead it uses a special characteristic of the response details in table 2 in all cases none of these definitions requires the choice of a threshold criterion however it does not mean that they are less arbitrary than the criterion based methods the heuristic definitions are still based on the choice of an approximate response model or of a special characteristic of the response furthermore as will be shown next section 3 4 these definitions do not necessarily yield a distance beyond which the influence of pumping may really be considered as being negligible depending on the exact meaning given to the term negligible hence these definitions must be used with caution in practice we suggest that they should only be used when seeking no more than an order of magnitude 3 4 comparison there is a major difference between the definitions of section 3 1 and those of sections 3 2 3 3 the former depend on the pumping rate whereas the latter do not for the definitions of sections 3 1 3 2 these properties directly follow from those definitions being based on either an absolute criterion or a relative criterion the fact that the heuristic definitions are independent of the pumping rate reveals that implicitly these definitions are also of a relative nature regardless of the differences all the equations for radius of influence can be put into the form 9 r infl c tt s where c is a coefficient that may either depend on s c section 3 1 1 depend on α sections 3 2 1 3 2 3 and possibly u w section 3 2 1 or be constant section 3 3 as the coefficient c effectively controls the quantitative difference between the definitions it is informative to study the values this coefficient may take fig 3 in fig 3 for those formulae where c depends on parameters wide ranges of realistic parameter values have been used the results show that overall c ranges between 0 and 6 a value of 0 would theoretically be obtained for an infinitely small well radius in the definition based on a relative drawdown criterion c displays similar trends although it has different values in all the definitions that are based on a criterion whether absolute or relative this is interpreted as a consequence of the fact that the various criteria used in these definitions are actually correlated the values of c for three of the heuristic definitions quasi steady state model impulse response peak and extension of logarithmic regime are somewhat on the lower end of the overall range of values of c thus these definitions will often effectively yield an underestimation of the radius of influence to further illustrate this finding note that c 2 value in the quasi steady state model and impulse response peak definitions implies a relative flow criterion α 0 37 i e 37 and that c 1 5 value in the extension of logarithmic regime definition implies a relative flow criterion α 0 57 i e 57 that is these definitions give a distance from the well at which the flow rate towards the well is still a large proportion of the pumping rate and thus they may not be considered as suitable definitions of radius of influence depending on the objective the facts that the radius of influence is proportional to tt s regardless of the definition and that the coefficient c is in practice never too far from unity can be given a simple explanation assuming homogeneous hydraulic properties the diffusivity equation may be written in dimensionless form as domenico and schwartz 1997 10 δ h s l c 2 t t c h t where l c l is a characteristic distance t c t is a characteristic time and the star symbol indicates the normalization of the variables and the laplacian operator by these characteristic dimensions as domenico and schwartz 1997 noted the transient period that occurs after a perturbation of the system will thus be noticeable at the characteristic distance and time i e at l c and t c only if the dimensionless group n f s l c 2 t t c called the fourier number is of the order of unity the condition n f 1 directly yields 11 l c t t c s i e the scaling identified above in fact if only an order of magnitude is sought the expression 12 r infl tt s i e c 1 could be used the above reasoning serving as a justification 4 radius of investigation operational definitions and estimation methods although the qualitative definition of radius of investigation given in section 2 2 is intuitive it does not obviously translate into an operational definition i e it is more challenging than for radius of influence this may explain why in practice many authors have simply equated the radius of investigation to the radius of influence to understand the difficulties involved note that for aquifer properties to have an influence on drawdown these properties must be considered over some area i e not only at an infinitesimal point for example one way of precisely defining radius of investigation could be to choose an area of 1 m2 and see up to what distance from the well a heterogeneity say a squared shape impervious lens of this size would significantly influence drawdown at the well the problem is is 1 m2 a relevant size also why taking a squared shape impervious lens and not for instance a round shaped semi impervious lens in fact there are probably no universally correct answers to these questions or in other words there are as many correct answers as there are possible heterogeneity types in spite of this a number of definitions of radius of investigation are possible that arguably have a somewhat general relevance below these definitions are classified and discussed according to the same three categories as in section 3 i e definitions based on an absolute criterion definitions based on a relative criterion and heuristic definitions 4 1 definitions based on an absolute criterion several authors made the case for accounting for the apparent resolution of hydraulic head measurements when quantifying the radius of investigation of a pumping well daungkaew et al 2000 kuchuk 2009 stewart 2011 this aspect is indeed primordial aquifer properties at some distance from the well can only be investigated if they affect the response more than the measurement resolution or apparent resolution see section 3 1 1 however to the best of our knowledge no equation for radius of investigation has been presented based on measurement resolution except for the case of recovery i e once pumping is stopped stewart 2011 here we fill this gap by developing suitable operational definitions of radius of investigation and corresponding estimation methods for the pumping period 4 1 1 absolute drawdown difference criterion radius of investigation may be conveniently defined as the distance from the well at which the presence of a hypothetical linear barrier assumed infinite and perfectly impervious in an otherwise homogeneous aquifer would induce a difference in drawdown at the well equal to the apparent resolution s c when compared with an unbounded aquifer fig 1b the choice of a linear barrier for heterogeneity type is somewhat arbitrary as discussed above in principle any heterogeneity type could be employed nevertheless a linear barrier represents a mid range heterogeneity type indeed it is neither a small localized heterogeneity nor a circular impervious barrier centered on the well both of which would be extreme heterogeneity types and it is scale independent i e it has the same relative effect whatever its distance from the well therefore it is regarded as a relevant proxy for analyzing the influence of heterogeneity in general at a given distance from the well technically it is also a practical choice because the influence of a linear barrier on drawdown can be easily evaluated using the principle of images bear 1972 muskat 1937 thus with this definition the radius of investigation r inv l is derived as appendix f 13 r inv tt e 1 1 s c s refer to section 3 1 1 for the nomenclature and indications regarding the evaluation of e 1 1 one may notice that the radius of investigation obtained here is exactly half of the radius of influence obtained in section 3 1 1 compare with eq 1 4 1 2 absolute drawdown derivative difference criterion the derivative of drawdown with respect to the natural logarithm of time is commonly used to interpret pumping test data bourdet 2002 when this is the case essentially the same definition as in the previous section can be used but looking at the drawdown derivative instead of drawdown that is radius of investigation may be defined as the distance from the well at which the presence of a hypothetical linear barrier assumed infinite and perfectly impervious in an otherwise homogeneous aquifer would induce a difference in drawdown derivative at the well equal to the apparent drawdown derivative resolution s c when compared with an unbounded aquifer if the apparent drawdown resolution is s c the apparent drawdown derivative resolution can be obtained by using uncertainty propagation rules this yields s c 2 s c δ where δ is the size measured in ln t of the window used to calculate the derivative from the drawdown data appendix g with this definition the radius of investigation is obtained as appendix g 14 r inv tt s ln 2 s c δ note that this equation implies a minimum constraint on the window size δ 2 s c since the argument of the logarithm must be smaller than 1 for r inv to be positive this constraint is a consequence of the fact that there is a maximum theoretical difference between the drawdown derivative in the presence or absence of a linear barrier 4 2 definitions based on a relative criterion the fact that a heterogeneity has a measurable influence on the response does not automatically imply that it has a significant influence on the parameters derived from the test i e transmissivity and storativity for this to be the case the influence of the heterogeneity must also be significant relative to the overall response recorded at the well indeed if the influence of the heterogeneity is small relative to the overall response the calibrated parameters will essentially be the same regardless of the presence or absence of the heterogeneity note that this discussion assumes that the test is interpreted using classical type curves where each hydraulic property is regarded as an equivalent homogeneous parameter and that the entire response is used and not only part of it therefore in this context it is meaningful to define qualitatively radius of investigation as the maximum distance from the well up to which aquifer properties have a significant influence relative to the overall response at the well the next four operational definitions are based on this idea sections 4 2 1 4 2 4 in section 4 2 5 another type of definition based on a relative criterion is presented that satisfies the needs of a different objective 4 2 1 relative drawdown difference criterion the definition of section 4 1 1 can be simply modified to get a definition based on a relative criterion that is the radius of investigation may be conveniently defined as the distance from the well at which the presence of a hypothetical linear barrier in an otherwise homogeneous aquifer would induce a difference in drawdown at the well equal to a given small ratio of the drawdown obtained for an unbounded aquifer denoting by α this ratio 0 α 1 where a value of 0 01 is deemed meaningful the radius of investigation according to this definition is obtained as appendix h 15 r inv tt e 1 1 α e 1 u w s one may notice that the radius of investigation obtained here is exactly half of the radius of influence obtained in section 3 2 1 compare with eq 4 4 2 2 relative drawdown derivative difference criterion similarly the definition of section 4 1 2 can be simply modified to get a definition based on a relative criterion that is suitable when the derivative of drawdown with respect to the natural logarithm of time is analyzed that is the radius of investigation may be defined as the distance from the well at which the presence of a hypothetical linear barrier in an otherwise homogeneous aquifer would induce a difference in drawdown derivative at the well equal to a given small ratio of the drawdown derivative obtained for an unbounded aquifer denoting again this ratio by α 0 α 1 where a value of 0 01 is deemed meaningful the radius of investigation is then given by appendix i 16 r inv t t u w ln α s in practice u w is typically smaller than 10 2 since the well radius is small consequently for meaningful values of α say α 0 1 we have u w ln α and so 17 r inv t t ln α s which is independent of u w one may notice that in this expression the radius of investigation is exactly half of the radius of influence obtained in section 3 2 2 compare with eq 6 4 2 3 relative drawdown averaging criterion oliver 1990 conducted an elegant theoretical analysis of the underlying averaging process that occurs when estimating transmissivity from a single well test in a heterogeneous aquifer their approach consisted in representing the influence of variations in transmissivity on drawdown as a weighted average of the transmissivity variations where the weighting function is a function of distance from the well using a perturbation approach oliver 1990 analytically derived the weighting function under the assumption that the transmissivity variations are much smaller than the average transmissivity integrating this function between any two points provides a measure of the contribution of the transmissivity variations of the corresponding region to drawdown thus oliver 1990 suggested to define radius of investigation as the distance from the well beyond which the integral of the weighting function is negligible more precisely equal to a given small proportion α 0 α 1 where a value of 0 01 is deemed meaningful oliver 1990 of the integral from the well radius to infinity with this definition the radius of investigation can be derived as appendix j 18 r inv 2 tt g u w 1 α s where g u w 1 is the inverse function of the function of g u w which is defined by eq j3 the evaluation of g u w 1 poses serious practical difficulties namely because the calculation of g u w itself requires the numerical evaluation of a double integral the latter takes a significant runtime using standard integration tools in python bresciani 2020 jones et al 2001 furthermore this function depends in an essential way on u w and thus we could not develop an approximate expression by fitting a simple analytical function in spite of this technical limitation this approach is elegant because it does not rely on the choice of a particular type of heterogeneity yet it also admits a major conceptual limitation due to the assumption of relatively small variations in transmissivity indeed if transmissivity variations are small then the overall response will be mostly controlled by the average transmissivity and not by the transmissivity variations and consequently the transmissivity value derived from the test will be fairly independent of the averaging process just described nonetheless oliver 1990 described an example where transmissivity variations were relatively large and the drawdown was still fairly well predicted by their model this result suggests that this approach may still be meaningful to understand the area of aquifer of which the transmissivity value derived from the test is representative 4 2 4 relative drawdown derivative averaging criterion oliver 1990 also developed the same approach as above for the case where the derivative of drawdown with respect to the natural logarithm of time is analyzed instead of drawdown that is they analytically derived the weighting function that describes the contribution of transmissivity variations to the drawdown derivative at the well as a function of distance from the well then with the same definition as above only the weighting function is different the radius of investigation can be obtained as appendix k 19 r inv 2 tt h u w 1 α s where h u w 1 is the inverse function of the function of h u w which is defined by eq k3 this function must still be evaluated numerically but it poses less difficulties than g u w 1 because it only requires the evaluation of a single integral furthermore this function is essentially independent of u w thus we were able to develop an approximate analytical expression for h u w 1 in the form of a shifted power law function obtained by curve fitting text s3 and fig s3 20 h u w 1 α 21 131 α 0 0136 21 208 the maximum error on h u w 1 implied by this approximation is 0 9 for α in the range 0 001 0 1 and u w in the range 10 16 10 2 which certainly encompass most common situations note that the conceptual limitation highlighted above regarding the assumption of relatively small variations in transmissivity applies here as well 4 2 5 proportion of linear barrier regime daungkaew et al 2000 qualitatively defined radius of investigation as the distance from the well up to which a feature e g a sealing fault could be interpreted using drawdown derivative data the derivative being again taken with respect to the natural logarithm of time in contrast with the previous definitions i e sections 4 2 1 4 2 4 here a feature must be clearly recognizable and not merely have a non negligible influence on drawdown that is this definition is tailored for the specific objective of feature detection to achieve an operational definition daungkaew et al 2000 used the well known fact that a feature typically induces a notable change in regime in the drawdown derivative data when compared with a homogeneous case bourdet et al 1989 thus daungkaew et al 2000 gave an operational definition of radius of investigation as the distance from the well at which the presence of a linear barrier in an otherwise homogeneous aquifer would imply that at the evaluation time the drawdown derivative has reached a given proportion 0 α 1 of the change in regime induced by the barrier with this definition daungkaew et al 2000 derived an equation for radius of investigation assuming that the derivative data are analyzed in logarithmic scale for completeness here we also present the case where the data are analyzed in linear i e normal scale in the latter case the radius of investigation is obtained as appendix l 21 r inv tt s ln α while when the data are analyzed in logarithmic scale it is obtained as appendix m 22 r inv tt s ln 2 α 1 one may notice that the radius of investigation given by eq 21 is exactly half of the radius of influence obtained in section 3 2 2 for a same value of α compare with eq 6 eq 21 also essentially gives the same radius of investigation as in section 4 2 2 compare with eq 17 however in the present case the parameter α has a fairly different meaning here it can be viewed as a confidence level at which the presence of a feature could be detected by looking for a change in regime in the drawdown derivative data the choice of an appropriate value for α is quite subjective but relevant values are typically much larger than in the previous approaches for instance daungkaew et al 2000 assumed that a feature is identifiable if α 0 9 4 3 heuristic definitions as for radius of influence a number of heuristic definitions have been proposed for estimating radius of investigation table 3 most of these definitions result from an approximation of the drawdown response according to which the effect of the presence of a feature e g a sealing fault on drawdown at the pumping well would be strictly zero until the evaluation time time at which it would suddenly start to have an effect this allows for the distance to the feature to be uniquely defined and subsequently derived the radius of investigation is then equated to this distance analogous to the impulse response peak definition for radius of influence the impulse response difference peak definition is different and somewhat more elegant than the other heuristic definitions because it does not rely on an approximation of the response instead it uses a special characteristic of the response details in table 3 the same remarks as for radius of influence apply here regarding the implicit arbitrariness of these definitions and their inherent lack of rigorous meaning section 3 3 see also section 4 4 below hence these definitions must be used with caution in practice we suggest that they should only be used when seeking no more than an order of magnitude 4 4 comparison analogous to the case of radius of influence there is a major difference between the definitions of section 4 1 and those of sections 4 2 4 3 the former depend on the pumping rate whereas the latter do not for the definitions of sections 4 1 4 2 these properties directly follow from those definitions being based on either an absolute criterion or a relative criterion the fact that the heuristic definitions are independent of the pumping rate reveals that implicitly these definitions are also of a relative nature regardless of the differences all the equations for radius of investigation can also be put into the form 23 r inv c tt s where the coefficient c may either depend on s c section 4 1 1 depend on 2 s c δ section 4 1 2 depend on α sections 4 2 1 4 2 5 or be constant section 4 3 the values that the coefficient c may take in practice are analyzed in fig 4 for all the definitions except the one based on a proportion of linear barrier regime the latter is better discussed separately see below for those formulae where c depends on a parameter wide ranges of realistic parameter values have been used overall c ranges between 0 and 3 in spite of the differences between the various definitions generally speaking the values of c are about half of the values obtained for radius of influence compare with fig 3 in fact as already noted above a number of definitions of radius of investigation make the latter exactly equal to half of the radius of influence as observed for radius of influence c displays similar trends although it has different values in most of the definitions that are based on a criterion whether absolute or relative fig 4 reflecting the fact that the various criteria are actually correlated the definition based on an absolute drawdown derivative difference criterion is somewhat different in this case the radius of investigation rapidly decreases when 2 s c δ increases it reaches zero when δ 2 s c note that a large window size can only be employed if the test duration is large enough thus with this definition the test duration is doubly important since time already explicitly appears in eq 23 for two of the heuristic definitions semi empirical start of head boundary effect and intersection of unbounded and closed reservoir regimes the values of c are somewhat on the higher end of the overall range of values this can be explained by the fact that these two definitions rely on models where the well is exactly located at the center of a perfectly circular reservoir in which case the boundary will simultaneously impact the drawdown at the well from all sides in contrast a linear barrier will have more gradual effects the latter model is likely a better representation of what may occur in reality fig 4 shows that the radius of investigation is typically larger when drawdown derivative data are used than when drawdown data are used for an otherwise equivalent definition compare solid versus dashed lines of the same color this outcome is somewhat intuitive the drawdown derivative can be expected to be more sensitive to what is newly explored i e further away nonetheless this finding is not completely obvious and here the results allow for a quantification of this phenomenon for instance with a definition based on a relative difference criterion i e sections 4 2 1 and 4 2 2 orange lines in fig 4 using drawdown derivative data will yield a radius of investigation that is between 32 and 1 132 larger than when using drawdown data depending on parameter values u w s c and δ the definitions based on a relative averaging criterion i e sections 4 2 3 and 4 2 4 green lines in fig 4 systematically yield a larger radius of investigation than those based on a relative difference criterion i e sections 4 2 1 and 4 2 2 orange lines in fig 4 for comparable data types i e drawdown or drawdown derivative we hypothesize that this result is related to the fact that the definitions based on a relative averaging criterion only focus on the transmissivity variations independently of the average transmissivity value see section 4 2 3 thus transmissivity variations at the radius of investigation may be given too much importance in comparison with their influence on the overall response and this could yield an overestimation of the radius of investigation in spite of these observations it should be noted that in most cases the differences between these two types of definitions are not huge this is somewhat reassuring and provides further support to our claim that defining radius of investigation based on the consideration of the effect of a linear barrier is meaningful possible values of the coefficient c in the definition based on a proportion of linear barrier regime are shown in fig 5 as already explained section 4 2 5 here α represents a confidence level for feature detection and so relevant values are typically larger than in the other definitions based on a relative criterion c and thus the radius of investigation is then logically smaller than in the other definitions based on a relative derivative criterion compare with fig 4 in particular the radius of investigation tends to zero when α approaches 1 reflecting the fact that the asymptotic regime can never be perfectly reached fig 5 also shows that the scale of analysis i e linear or logarithmic scale does not have much impact on the radius of investigation 5 practical guide on the basis of the discussion led throughout this work a decision tree is proposed to assist in choosing a suitable operational definition of radius of influence or radius of investigation depending on the objective fig 6 at the first level one should obviously determine whether their objective requires estimation of the radius of influence or the radius of investigation on the next level one must determine whether they only seek an order of magnitude or a more precise estimation in the former case one may use a heuristic definition although any other definition would also do but heuristic definitions are arguably the simplest since they do not depend on any parameter in this case our suggestion would be to use the impulse response peak definition for radius of influence and the analogous impulse response difference peak definition for radius of investigation in contrast with the other heuristic definitions these definitions have a precise physical meaning furthermore they may easily be extended to heterogeneous media although using more advanced modelling techniques datta gupta et al 2011 and thus the underlying idea is in fact quite general however one must keep in mind that heuristic definitions can imply a significant underestimation or overestimation of the radius depending on what operational definition would otherwise be chosen see fig 3 and fig 4 when one requires a more accurate estimate a method based on an explicit criterion must be used the choice then depends on the specific objective for which the radius needs to be evaluated as summarized in fig 6 the case where one wants to determine the area of aquifer of which the derived parameters of a pumping test are representative deserves some discussion in this case we suggest that in principle one must in fact use a combination of two definitions one of the definitions based on a relative criterion i e sections 4 2 1 4 2 4 and the corresponding definition based on an absolute criterion i e section 4 1 1 or 4 1 2 the latter definition should indeed be also used to check that the apparent resolution of head measurements allows for aquifer properties to be seen as far as the former definition will suggest that is the two radii must be calculated and the smallest of them must be retained nonetheless the quantitative analysis in fig 5 shows that in practice the definition based on an absolute difference criterion will often yield a radius of investigation that is smaller than with the definition based on a relative difference criterion this is especially true when the drawdown derivative is used therefore the final radius will often be the one given by the absolute difference criterion definition thus in order to simplify the procedure we suggest that only using the absolute difference criterion definition i e section 4 1 1 or 4 1 2 can be considered reasonable we warn the reader that this practical guide only consists of suggestions derived from the authors own opinions as exposed above we acknowledge that particular constraints might exist that have not been recognized in this work and could lead to a different better choice other objectives might also exist that have not been discussed nonetheless we believe that the indications provided herein will be relevant in a majority of situations it is obvious that all the methods require an a priori knowledge of transmissivity and storativity ideally these parameters may be estimated from a pumping test conducted at the well when this is not available e g when the purpose of estimating radius influence or radius of investigation is precisely to design a first pumping test at the well one may interpolate or extrapolate values obtained from nearest available pumping tests use regional scale estimates e g obtained from a calibrated numerical model or employ literature values in the worst case as new information is obtained e g as new pumping tests are conducted or even as a pumping test goes on estimates of transmissivity and storativity may be refined and the radius of influence investigation can be reevaluated in particular at the end of a pumping test a final value of the radius of investigation can be calculated this value can then be reported along with the results of the pumping test in order to inform the area of aquifer of which the estimated parameters are representative in fact we suggest that this should be a standard practice 6 conclusions the radius of influence and radius of investigation of a pumping well are useful concepts with various uses in well hydraulics and aquifer testing although their qualitative definition is straightforward numerous operational definitions are possible classifying the definitions according to their nature i e based on an absolute criterion based on a relative criterion or heuristic helps understanding the conceptual differences between them we also suggest that different definitions are best suited for different objectives accordingly the practical guide developed herein will assist anyone in choosing a suitable definition depending on the objective section 5 quantitatively radius of influence and radius of investigation are significantly affected by the choice of operational definition and associated parameters figs 3 5 as a rule of thumb the radius of investigation is half of the radius of influence in all cases the two radii are proportional to tt s this outcome can be given a simple explanation based on a dimensional analysis of the diffusivity equation we also found that the radius of investigation is generally larger when using the derivative of drawdown with respect to the natural logarithm of time than when simply using drawdown this insight can help in choosing a type of analysis when processing pumping test data declaration of competing interest the authors declare

commission on minnesota resources lccmr the authors are grateful to two reviewers for their valuable comments this work does not rely on any data appendix a instantaneous response property the diffusivity equation implies that a perturbation of the system at some point is felt instantaneously at an infinite distance from the source even though the magnitude of the response rapidly decreases with distance the theis solution is illustrative of this property theis 1935 drawdown is everywhere non zero right after the pumping starts in reality a signal cannot propagate infinitely fast without contradicting fundamental physical principles i e a signal cannot propagate faster than the speed of light this paradox of the diffusivity equation is a consequence of darcy s law which in its classical form implies an all time equilibrium of the groundwater flux with the hydraulic head gradient at any point in fact when the hydraulic head gradient at a given point is perturbated a transient phase exists during which the groundwater flux gradually evolves towards a new equilibrium foster et al 1967 neuman 1977 oroveanu and pascal 1959 philip 1957 darcy s law may actually be modified to account for this transient phase and on this basis an alternative governing equation describing the pressure wave propagation may be derived that suppresses the instantaneous propagation paradox foster et al 1967 oroveanu and pascal 1959 wave propagation is nonetheless very fast it has the speed of sound at field scale it is thus the pressure diffusion process that controls the overall response of the system unless the fluid is exposed to high frequency pressure waves kuchuk 2009 pascal 1986 therefore in classical applications wave propagation may indeed be considered instantaneous and the diffusivity equation is appropriate appendix b derivation of radius of influence equation based on an absolute drawdown criterion the theis solution for drawdown s l can be written as b1 s u q 4 π t e 1 u where u s r 2 4 t t is dimensionless and e 1 is the exponential integral function defined by b2 e 1 u u e x x d x where u is a strictly positive number thus to calculate the radius of influence r infl l based on an absolute drawdown criterion s c l one needs to invert the equation b3 q 4 π t e 1 u infl s c where u infl s r infl 2 4 t t formally we thus have b4 u infl e 1 1 4 π t s c q where e 1 1 is the inverse function of e 1 noting s c 4 π t s c q and solving for r infl yields eq 1 appendix c derivation of radius of influence equation based on a relative drawdown criterion using the theis solution for drawdown eq 3 translates into c1 e 1 u infl e 1 u w α where u infl s r infl 2 4 t t u w s r w 2 4 t t and r w is the well radius therefore c2 u infl e 1 1 α e 1 u w and solving for r infl yields eq 4 appendix d derivation of radius of influence equation based on a relative flow rate criterion in this case the definition of radius of influence translates into the equation d1 q infl q α where q infl is the flow rate across the walls of a cylinder centered on the well and having radius r infl q infl is easily derived from the theis solution and darcy s law as d2 q infl q e s r infl 2 4 t t using this expression in eq d1 and rearranging terms yields eq 6 appendix e derivation of radius of influence equation based on a relative volume criterion in this case the definition of radius of influence translates into the equation e1 v r infl v 0 α where v r 1 r 2 for any r 1 and r 2 denotes the volume of the cone of depression between radial distances r 1 and r 2 from the well for convenience let us introduce a s 4 t t the volume of the cone of depression v r 1 r 2 between any two radial distances r 1 and r 2 is given by e2 v r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 2 π r s a r 2 d r where s represents the drawdown function given by the theis solution eq b1 replacing and integrating by parts yields e3 v r 1 r 2 q 4 t r 2 2 a r 2 2 e x x d x r 1 2 a r 1 2 e x x d x e a r 1 2 e a r 2 2 a the form r 2 a r 2 e x x d x is indeterminate both for r and r 0 but both cases can be resolved using l hospital rule and yield 0 thus e4 v r infl q 4 t r infl 2 a r infl 2 e x x d x e a r infl 2 a and e5 v 0 q 4 t a note that the latter expression can also be obtained by noting that v 0 is the cumulative volume of extracted fluid divided by s it follows that note u infl a r infl 2 e6 v r infl v 0 e u infl u inf e 1 u infl therefore eq e1 is equivalent to e7 e u infl u infl e 1 u infl α let us introduce the function f defined such that f u infl is equal to the left hand side of this equation that is f is the function defined by e8 f u e u u e 1 u where u is a strictly positive number then formally eq e7 is equivalent to u infl f 1 α and solving this equation for r infl yields eq 7 appendix f derivation of radius of investigation equation based on an absolute drawdown difference criterion this definition translates into the equation f1 s barrier u inv s nobarrier s c where s barrier and s nobarrier represent the drawdowns at the pumping well in the presence and absence of a linear barrier respectively and u inv s r inv 2 4 t t both s barrier and s nobarrier depend on t q t s and r w but these parameters are not explicitly shown in this equation because they are given parameters of the problem s barrier further depends on the distance from the well to the barrier i e r inv taken as the perpendicular from the well to the barrier which is the unknown of the problem and is embedded in u inv s nobarrier is given by the theis solution eq b1 whereas s barrier is easily obtained from the method of images bear 1972 muskat 1937 as f2 s barrier u inv s nobarrier q 4 π t e 1 4 u inv where r w r inv is assumed using this expression in eq f1 and solving for r inv yields eq 13 appendix g derivation of radius of investigation equation based on an absolute drawdown derivative difference criterion the derivative of drawdown with respect to the natural logarithm of time s is given by g1 s s ln t t s t in practice s is typically evaluated from pumping test data using a sliding window along ln t i e g2 s ln t s ln t δ 2 s ln t δ 2 δ where δ dimensionless since it has the dimension of ln t is the window size therefore if s c is the apparent resolution on drawdown uncertainty propagation rules farrance and frenkel 2012 imply that the apparent resolution on the drawdown derivative will be equal to 2 s c δ consequently in this case the definition of radius of investigation translates into the equation g3 s barrier u inv s nobarrier 2 s c δ the derivative terms in this equation are given by g4 s nobarrier q 4 π t e u w and g5 s barrier r inv q 4 π t e u w e 4 u inv making replacements in eq g3 and solving for r inv yields eq 14 appendix h derivation of radius of investigation equation based on a relative drawdown difference criterion this definition translates into the equation h1 s barrier u inv s nobarrier s nobarrier α using eqs b1 and f2 and solving for r inv yields eq 15 appendix i derivation of radius of investigation equation based on a relative drawdown derivative difference criterion this definition translates into the equation i1 s barrier u inv s nobarrier s nobarrier α using eqs g4 and g5 and solving for r inv yields eq 16 appendix j derivation of radius of investigation equation based on a relative drawdown averaging criterion for the drawdown response oliver 1990 derived the non normalized weighting function as j1 w t d r d π 2 0 t d r d t 2 exp r d 2 2 t w 1 2 1 2 r d 2 t d t where r d r r w and t d tt s r w 2 are dimensionless variables and w κ μ is the whittaker function abramowitz and stegun 1974 the relative contribution of the transmissivity variations of the region located beyond the dimensionless radius of investigation r dinv r inv r w at some dimensionless time t d is thus given by j2 g t d r dinv r dinv w t d r d d r d 1 w t d r d d r d for consistency with the rest of this paper we prefer to work with the dimensionless variables u and u w rather than with r d and t d the conversions between these two sets of dimensionless variables are given by u r d 2 4 t d and u w 1 4 t d then by using the rule of integration by substitution it can be shown that the previous equation is equivalent to j3 g u w u inv u inv w u d u u w w u d u where j4 w u π u u exp 2 u w 1 2 1 2 4 u d u i e w is our weighting function the radius of investigation is then given by eq 18 appendix k derivation of radius of investigation equation based on a relative drawdown derivative averaging criterion for the drawdown derivative response oliver 1990 derived the non normalized weighting function as k1 w t d r d π r d 2 t d exp r d 2 2 t d w 1 2 1 2 r d 2 t d the relative contribution of the transmissivity variations of the region located beyond the dimensionless radius of investigation r dinv at some dimensionless time t d is thus given by k2 h t d r dinv r dinv w t d r d d r d 1 w t d r d d r d as in appendix j we transform this equation so as to use the dimensionless variables u and u w instead of r d and t d then by using the rule of integration by substitution it can be shown that the previous equation is equivalent to k3 h u w u inv u inv w u d u u w w u d u where k4 w u π exp 2 u w 1 2 1 2 4 u i e w is our weighting function the radius of investigation is then given by eq 19 appendix l derivation of radius of investigation equations based on a proportion of linear barrier regime linear scale in a homogeneous unbounded aquifer the drawdown quickly tends towards a regime in which the drawdown derivative is constant and equal to see eq g4 l1 s nobarrier q 4 π t this value is often essentially reached before the presence of a major feature would have any significant influence on drawdown in the presence of a linear barrier drawdown will transit from this regime towards a final asymptotic regime at large times characterized by another constant value which happens to be the double of the first regime value see eq g5 i e l2 s barrier q 2 π t denoting by α a given proportion 0 α 1 of the transition between these two regimes daungkaew et al s 2000 definition of radius of investigation when the drawdown derivative data are analyzed in linear scale translates into the equation l3 s barrier r inv s nobarrier s barrier s nobarrier α making suitable replacements using eqs g5 l1 and l2 and simplifying yields l4 e u w e 4 u inv 1 α in this expression it is reasonable to assume that e u w 1 this is assuming that the first regime has been reached solving for r inv then yields eq 21 appendix m derivation of radius of investigation equations based on a proportion of linear barrier regime logarithmic scale when the drawdown derivative data are analyzed in logarithmic scale daungkaew et al s 2000 definition of radius of investigation translates into the equation m1 l o g 10 s barrier r inv l o g 10 s nobarrier l o g 10 s barrier l o g 10 s nobarrier α where the same notation as in appendix l is used making suitable replacements using eqs g5 l1 and l2 and simplifying yields m2 ln e u w e 4 u inv ln 2 α as already mentioned appendix l it is reasonable to assume that e u w 1 solving for r inv then yields eq 22 appendix n derivation of radius of investigation equation intersection of unbounded and linear barrier regimes in the presence of a linear barrier drawdown at the pumping well is characterized by two regimes jones 1962 a first regime valid at relatively early times where drawdown essentially behaves as in an unbounded aquifer and may be approximated by n1 s nobarrier q 4 π t ln 1 e γ u w where γ is the euler mascheroni constant γ 0 5772 and a second regime valid at relatively large times where the influence of the barrier which we consider located at a distance r inv from the well is fully effective and drawdown may be approximated by n2 s barrier q 4 π t ln 1 e γ u w ln 1 4 e γ u inv if the first regime is extended forward in time and the second regime is extended backward in time the two regimes will intersect at a specific time this specific time is a unique function of r inv and is characteristic of the transition between the two regimes but in reality the transition is smooth finding this time i e equating eqs n1 and n2 and reversing the relationship to find r inv as a function of time yields n3 r inv tt e γ s 0 75 tt s previously jones 1962 proposed this expression for estimating the distance to a linear barrier from pumping test data since in practice the intersection between the two regimes can easily be found from straight line analysis in semi log plots however to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that this approach is proposed to define radius of investigation appendix o derivation of radius of investigation equation impulse response difference peak vela and mckinley 1970 and lee 1982 both proposed the same definition of radius of influence which is called impulse response peak in this article table 2 here we propose to adapt the idea underlying this definition to obtain a meaningful definition of radius of investigation to adapt this idea we consider the response to a pressure impulse in the presence of a linear barrier and to compare it to the response to a pressure impulse without a linear barrier in an unbounded aquifer the response at the well noted s below to a pressure impulse is given by o1 s nobarrier a t e u w where a is a constant with no importance in what follows in the presence of a linear barrier located at a distance r inv from the well the response to a pressure impulse is easily obtained by using the method of images as o2 s barrier u inv a t e u w e 4 u inv the difference between the two responses is given by o3 s barrier u inv s nobarrier a t e 4 u inv this difference will reach peak at a specific time that depends on r inv determining this time i e solving s barrier u inv s nobarrier t 0 and inverting the relationship to find r inv as a function of time yields o4 r inv tt s in other words in this definition r inv is the distance from the well at which the presence of a linear barrier would imply that the peak difference in drawdown when compared with the drawdown obtained for an unbounded aquifer occurs at the evaluation time equivalently this is the distance to a linear barrier that would make the rate of drawdown difference variation be the fastest at the evaluation time in the problem of constant rate pumping this can be verified by noting that the second time derivative of s barrier s nobarrier is equal to zero when eq o4 holds see eqs b1 and f2 one may notice that the radius of investigation obtained here is exactly half of the radius of influence given by the impulse response

5756,in the restoration of subtropical forests the hydrological fluxes of dissolved organic carbon doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn have not been fully investigated in different stages dominated by different tree species the concentrations of doc and tdn in rainfall throughfall stemflow and surface runoff were measured for two years in each of the three forests at different restoration stages early coniferous forest pinus massoniana lithocarpus glaber intermediate deciduous broadleaved forest choerospondias axillaris and late evergreen broadleaved forest l glaber cyclobalanopsis glauca input and output fluxes as well as leaching and migration coefficients of doc and tdn were calculated to examine the nutrient cycling status in the processes of forest restoration in stemflow doc concentrations in the evergreen broadleaved forest differed significantly from those in the coniferous and deciduous broadleaved forests whereas tdn concentrations differed significantly between the coniferous forest and other two forests in throughfall doc and tdn concentrations were not significantly different among the three forests the amount of doc leached was primarily influenced by rainfall and was significantly related to fluxes in throughfall with the highest value in the deciduous broadleaved forest 57 78 kg c ha 1 however the amount of tdn leached was affected by rainfall and the absorption of vegetation and was not significantly related to fluxes in throughfall except for the deciduous broadleaved forest the highest value of tdn leached was in the coniferous forest 11 90 kg n ha 1 mean tdn concentration in surface runoff tended to increase but annual tdn output fluxes decreased with forest restoration however both mean concentration and annual output fluxes of doc in surface runoff were the highest in the deciduous broadleaved forest at the intermediate restoration stage the concentrations were closely related to surface runoff decomposition rate of litterfall and soil organic matter content the annual output fluxes of doc and tdn in surface runoff were less than 30 of the input in throughfall indicating nutrient accumulation in subtropical secondary

in the canopy extreme weather conditions bäumler and zech 1997 van stan and stubbins 2018 the increase of nutrient concentrations in throughfall and stemflow compared to precipitation are mainly attributed to the leaching process composed of washing off dry deposited gasses and particles by rainfall and leaching of nutrients from plants zimmermann et al 2003 specially the concentration of dissolved n is usually lower than that in precipitation due to uptake or microbial transformations in canopy jiří et al 2009 the characteristics of dissolved organic matter dom during leaching are highly variable across different forests and the variabilities are more pronounced when differences in seasonal leaf states and rain conditions occur van stan and stubbins 2018 the above marked

known about nutrients concentration variations in deciduous broadleaved forest and evergreen broadleaved forest during hydrological input for the lateral output of nutrients in surface runoff several

precipitation and temperature and human activities i e land use change and management regimes are the main factors influencing the recycle or loss of dom in surface runoff hua et al 2014 furthermore forest litterfall play pivotal role in the interaction between plants and soil which can change the soil active organic carbon pool and n cycle of different forests quideau 2001 lovett et al 2004 several hypotheses have been proposed for the changes in patterns of nutrient recycle and loss during forest restoration or successional stages odum 1969 hypothesized that ecosystems increased the retention of major nutrients as they mature conservative consumption strategy in contrast vitousek and reiners 1975 proposed that mature ecosystems have an open cycle resource spending strategy yan et al 2015 reported that doc concentrations significantly decreased whereas tdn concentrations increased in forests along a successional gradient from pioneer pine forest to transitional coniferous and broadleaved mixed forest to mature broadleaved forest in southern china the changes were attributed to the differences in biological activities and changes in soil chemical properties in particular the variation in soil n saturation state at successional stages although high precipitation abundant substrate supply and rapid decomposition characterize these subtropical forest ecosystems kalbitz et al 2000 the cycling of doc and tdn in surface runoff at different restoration stages were less reported especially in the deciduous broadleaved forest previous studies found that the deciduous broadleaved had higher litterfall faster decomposition rate and the highest n transformation rates xiang and fang 2018 which expected to have the highest doc concentration in surface runoff meanwhile the total n and microbial biomass c and n contents in organic and mineral soils increase from early to intermediate to late restoration stages zeng et al 2014 how the output fluxes of doc and tdn change with the restoration stages under the influence of surface runoff and concentrations remain unclear in this study three forests at different restoration stages were selected including an early coniferous forest an intermediate deciduous broadleaved forest and a late evergreen broadleaved forest xiang and fang 2018 to examine how the concentrations of doc and tdn in different hydrological processes change with restoration stages and unveil the nutrients cycling of internal nutrients by vegetation the concentrations of doc tdn nh4 n and no3 n were measured in rainfall throughfall stemflow and surface runoff continuously over two years we hypothesized that 1 the concentrations of doc and tdn during leaching decreased along forest restoration stages 2 the concentrations of doc in surface runoff was the highest in the deciduous broadleaved forest but tdn concentrations increased along forest restoration stages and 3 the deciduous broadleaved forest showed an open nutrient cycling of doc while the evergreen broadleaved forest expressed obviously positive effects of nutrients accumulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this study was conducted in the

soil that is classified as an alliti udic ferrosol corresponding to acrisol according to the world reference base for soil resources iuss working group wrb 2006 soil ph values range from 3 62 to 4 33 at the 0 20 cm depth the evergreen broadleaved forest is the subtropical climax vegetation in the region because of human disturbance and management activities secondary forests at different restoration stages dominated by different tree species are found in the region the forests mainly include 1 early stage pinus massoniana and lithocarpus glaber coniferous forests pm 2 intermediate stage choerospondias axillaris deciduous broadleaved forests ca and 3 late stage l glaber and cyclobalanopsis glauca evergreen broadleaved forests cg xiang et al 2015 ouyang et al 2016 the three forests are un even age stands with an average age of approximately 70 years according to historical records which developed on similar soil under the same climate 2 2 experimental set up and sample collection a 1 ha permanent plot was established in each of the three types of forest in 2013 and stand characteristics were investigated table 1 ouyang et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 to quantify the effects of forest restoration and minimize the effects of other factors on hydrological fluxes we set up a 10 m 20 m runoff plot within each forest type in 2016 trenches were dug along all sides of the runoff plots to bedrock at the depth of approximately 1 m and were then supplied with a concrete base the surface runoff was collected into a cuboid cement reservoir facing to the lowest side of each runoff plot through a pipeline connected the forest floor and the reservoir which then flowed out through a v shaped notch weir in the back of the reservoir the gauges of the data acquisition system cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa were fixed on a support frame attached to the reservoirs approximately 1 5 m above the normal water level to collect rainfall data uninterruptedly the vertical distance from the water level to the vertex of the v shaped notch weir h inside the cuboid cement reservoir was recorded in real time the surface runoff discharge q was estimated from the measured h with a formula q h regression routinely used in hydrological studies wu and wang 1993 within each of the three runoff plots several automatic recording rainfall gauges te525mm campbell scientific ltd shepshed uk with diameters of 24 5 cm and the height up to 30 cm were installed at uphill and downhill positions to record the throughfall amount stemflow amount were also monitored by such rainfall gauges to ensure that the experimental conditions were relatively consistent in the three plots some important factors such as stand density canopy coverage the distance between the rainfall gauges and the trees and average stand height were considered in addition the observation tower over the administrative office building of dashanchong forest park was designated as a collection point for atmospheric precipitation which monitored by several automatic recording rainfall gauges without interruption the samples of rainfall were collected using rain collectors installed in an open area of approximately 40 m2 and 10 m away from the runoff plot of the pm forest the rain collectors consisted of a 15 cm diameter funnel with a plastic mesh and a 1 l plastic cylinder and the funnel inserted in the top of the cylinder the collectors were placed 1 5 m above ground level and fastened to a 2 m high pole the throughfall samples were collected using four identical rain collectors set up under the canopy within each forest at randomly selected uphill and downhill positions the stemflow samples were collected using another rain collector consisted of a 15 l plastic cylinder and a longitudinally split plastic pipe with a diameter of one centimeter placed on each selected tree the plastic pipe was snaked around the selected trees and then embedded in and sealed to the bark surface with silica gel the samples of surface runoff were acquired from a rubber barrel placed in the cement reservoir from march 2017 to february 2019 the above samples were collected regularly twice a month using the bottles rinsed with pure water before collection if there were heavy rain we took additional samples immediately after rainfall events the samples of rainfall throughfall stemflow and surface runoff from various rain collectors were mixed in one bottle correspondingly and labeled separately for a particular determination of hydrographic concentration all experimental equipment was checked and cleaned out after sampling the samples were transported to the laboratory immediately where the samples were measured or stored in a refrigerator at 4 c for no more than one day until chemical analysis 2 3 chemical analyses before the analyses all samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm mixed cellulose microporous filter membrane under vacuum which were rinsed with deionized and sample water the concentrations of doc in the filtered water samples were determined by using a toc analyzer shimadzu kyoto japan the concentrations of tdn nh4 n and no3 n were measured using an auto analyzer 3 aa3 bran luebbe ltd hamburg germany the concentration of don was calculated as the difference between the concentration of tdn and that of the sum of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din nh4 n and no3 n don tdn din 2 4 data analyses bartlett and shapiro wilk tests were performed to determine whether the data conforms to homogeneity of variance and normal distribution two way analysis of variance anova and tukey s honestly significant difference hsd test were used to examine the effects of different restoration stages and seasons on hydrological fluxes and concentrations of doc and tdn the fluxes of doc tdn nh4 n no3 n and don in the three forests were calculated by multiplying the concentration by the corresponding amount of rain data the monthly seasonal and yearly rainfall amount and hydrological fluxes in rainfall throughfall stemflow and surface runoff were obtained from the sum of the data in the corresponding period the input fluxes of doc and tdn are defined as the mean monthly annual concentrations and total amount of doc and tdn in rainfall above the forest canopy the output fluxes of doc and tdn are defined as the mean monthly annual concentrations and total amount of doc and tdn amount leached through surface runoff izquieta rojano et al 2016 internal fluxes of doc and tdn in throughfall and stemflow reflect mainly return to the soil in forests schroth et al 2001 to quantify the differences in amounts of nutrients leached in different forest restoration stages the net nutrient leaching amount was calculated by subtracting the nutrient fluxes in throughfall ntf and stemflow nsf from that in rainfall nrf the sum of the monthly leaching amount of doc and tdn made up the total leaching amount during the sampling period and the negative values need to be absolute to investigate the stability of doc and tdn leaching coefficients were calculated by dividing the nutrient concentrations in throughfall or stemflow by those in rainfall and migration coefficients were calculated by dividing the total amount of doc and tdn in surface runoff by those in throughfall oyarzún and hervé fernández 2015 multivariate regression model was used to examine the effects of doc and tdn fluxes in rainfall throughfall and stemflow on the output fluxes in surface runoff linear regression analysis was performed to examine the relations between ntf and the corresponding net leaching amount as well as the relations between nutrient output amount and surface runoff the statistical software r 3 4 4 r development core team 2018 was used to perform all data analyses and to produce the figures 3 results 3 1 seasonal changes in the amounts of rainfall throughfall stemflow and surface runoff the rainfall outside the forests varied seasonally fig 1 d with average values of 150 5 66 4 mm in spring 179 7 159 6 mm in summer 71 2 21 0 mm in autumn and 82 2 36 2 mm in winter there were significant differences p 0 05 between rainfall amount in summer and other seasons especially with autumn and winter the seasonal variation in throughfall stemflow and surface runoff were significantly p 0 001 related to those of rainfall in the three forests at different restoration stages fig 1a b and c 3 2 concentrations of doc and tdn in throughfall and stemflow the changes in concentrations of doc and tdn in throughfall and stemflow were evaluated using the leaching coefficients of throughfall lct and stemflow lcs table 2 in general the concentrations of doc and tdn were enriched in throughfall and stemflow and the greatest enrichment was for doc in stemflow the concentrations of doc were significantly higher in autumn p 0 05 while the concentrations of tdn were prominently higher in autumn and winter p 0 05 in throughfall and stemflow in the three forests fig 2 a and b the concentrations of doc in stemflow were significantly lower p 0 001 in the cg forest than those in the ca and pm forests but the difference between the ca and pm forests was not significant fig 2a b the mean annual concentrations of doc in stemflow were 21 19 10 94 mg l 1 in the pm forest 20 92 16 04 mg l 1 in the ca forest and 8 29 4 66 mg l 1 in the cg forest the concentrations of tdn in stemflow decreased significantly p 0 05 in the order pm forest 6 04 4 06 mg l 1 ca forest 3 79 1 88 mg l 1 and cg forest 3 03 1 73 mg l 1 fig 2b b the mean annual concentrations of doc in throughfall were higher in the ca 9 51 7 21 mg l 1 and pm 9 13 4 34 mg l 1 forests than those in the cg forest 7 55 4 53 mg l 1 fig 2a a however the differences in throughfall doc or tdn fig 2b a concentrations among the three forests were not significant the mean annual concentrations of tdn decreased from the pm forest 4 31 2 23 mg l 1 to the ca forest 3 27 1 67 mg l 1 to the cg forest 3 53 1 68 mg l 1 which was similar to the order found in stemflow 3 3 concentrations of doc and tdn in surface runoff the concentrations of doc and tdn in surface runoff in the three forests varied significantly p 0 05 among seasons with higher values in autumn than in other seasons fig 2a c and b c the concentrations of doc and tdn in surface runoff were not significantly different among the three forests the mean annual concentrations of doc in surface runoff was 19 43 13 06 mg l 1 in the pm forest 20 51 16 15 mg l 1 in the ca forest and 17 16 9 74 mg l 1 in the cg forest the mean annual concentration of tdn in surface runoff was 4 17 2 49 mg l 1 in the pm forest 4 38 2 72 mg l 1 in the ca forest and 4 82 3 07 mg l 1 in the cg forest 3 4 net nutrient leaching fluxes in throughfall and stemflow different hydrological fluxes of doc and tdn in the three forests over the sampling period were showed in fig 3 the total net doc leaching fluxes were lower in the cg 31 53 5 94 kg c ha 1 yr 1 and pm 36 34 14 03 kg c ha 1 yr 1 forests than that in the ca forest 57 77 20 49 kg c ha 1 yr 1 the leaching fluxes of doc were significantly p 0 001 related to the fluxes in throughfall in the three forests fig 4 a the primary contribution to net doc leaching was from the washing off of nutrients retained in the canopy by contrast the total net tdn leaching fluxes were lower in the cg 9 96 1 92 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and ca 11 52 4 07 kg n ha 1 yr 1 forests than that in the pm forest 11 90 3 77 kg n ha 1 yr 1 except for in the ca forest no significant relationships were detected between tdn leaching fluxes and fluxes in throughfall fig 4b 3 5 nutrient output fluxes in surface runoff the monthly mean output fluxes of doc fig 5 a b and c and tdn fig 5d e and f in surface runoff varied with forest restoration stages the highest values in pm and ca forests occurred in spring and summer but in the cg forest the highest values occurred in autumn and winter the lowest values appeared in june in the pm and ca forest in april in the cg forest the relations between output fluxes of doc fig 6 a and tdn fig 6b and surface runoff were significant p 0 05 the mean annual output fluxes of doc in surface runoff were higher in the ca forest than in pm forest and cg forest fig 7 while output fluxes of tdn decreased from the pm forest to ca forest to cg forest the doc and tdn fluxes in rainfall were significantly related to those in surface runoff in pm and cg forests while doc and tdn fluxes in throughfall and stemflow were significantly related to those in surface runoff in ca forest table s1 4 discussion 4 1 concentrations of doc and tdn in throughfall and stemflow the nutrient composition of rainfall is altered after passing through the forest canopy lovett and lindberg 1993 the tree species and canopy structure leaves branches bark etc can greatly alter the amount spatiotemporal patterning and chemical properties of precipitation via several processes including leaching of compounds from leaves and stems and increasing dry deposition crona 1983 levia et al 2011 pypker et al 2011 in general nutrient concentrations in stemflow were higher than those in rainfall fig 2a b and b b in stemflow the leaching of compounds from leaves and stems and the retention or uptake of nutrients by the vegetation are considered as the primary factors influencing the variability in c and n concentrations ciglasch et al 2004 in this study the concentrations of doc in stemflow were significantly lower p 0 05 in the cg forest 8 29 4 66 mg l 1 than those in the ca 20 92 16 04 mg l 1 and pm 21 19 10 94 mg l 1 forests fig 2a b those concentrations were directly affected by the differences in stemflow amount and the organic material leached from the trunks in the three forests canopy gaps and leaf area index lai are the primary parameters determining rainfall partitioning marin et al 2000 komatsu et al 2008 and therefore a higher lai can intercept more rainfall and diminish the amount of rainfall entering the forest i e via throughfall and stemflow consequently the highest lai in the cg forest table 1 resulted in the lowest stemflow with less flow to leach organic material from the trunks as a result the concentrations of doc in stemflow in the cg forest were less compared with those in the stemflow of ca and pm forests the concentrations of tdn in stemflow decreased from the pm forest to the ca forest to the cg forest and the difference was significant between the pm forests and the other forests fig 2b b in throughfall fig 2a a the concentrations of doc were significantly higher than those in rainfall fig 2a d which result from the dissolution of dissolved organic matter deposited on leaf and branch surfaces hoffman et al 1980 the secretions produced by animals and microorganisms whitehead et al 1983 and the leaching of leaves and needles in this study the monthly concentrations of doc in throughfall ranged from 1 98 mg l 1 to 19 53 mg l 1 in the pm forest 2 38 mg l 1 to 29 66 mg l 1 in the ca forest and 1 29 mg l 1 to 16 98 mg l 1 in the cg forest fig 2a a these concentrations are within the range of concentrations of doc in throughfall 1 61 mg l 1 reported by van stan and stubbins 2018 the mean annual concentrations of doc were higher in the ca 9 51 7 21 mg l 1 and pm 9 13 4 34 mg l 1 forests than those in the cg forest 7 55 4 53 mg l 1 these results are partly consistent with those of van stan and stubbins 2018 who reported that forests with pronounced differences in seasonal leaf states and rain conditions had the maximum range of throughfall doc concentrations i e the ca forest whereas evergreen forest types had the minimum variability in throughfall doc concentrations i e the pm and cg forests however in this study no significant differences in throughfall doc or tdn concentrations were detected among the three forests the mean annual concentrations of tdn decreased in the order pm forest 4 31 2 23 mg l 1 ca forest 3 27 1 67 mg l 1 and cg forest 3 53 1 68 mg l 1 which was similar to the order observed for stemflow fig 2b a the concentrations of doc and tdn in throughfall and stemflow were significantly higher in autumn than the other seasons fig 2 the dilution effect is an important factor during the leaching process in the forest canopy that lowers the concentrations of doc and tdn in the relatively wet spring and summer thus the increase in concentrations of doc and tdn associated with lower rainfall amounts in autumn could be attributed to the particles and aerosols long accumulated on leaf and branch surfaces being washed off with less water michalzik and matzner 2010 other factors such as tree species canopy structure and leaf morphology also have a synergistic role strohmeier et al 2013 the results of this study are consistent with those of a previous report that seasonal effects on metabolic processes such as changes in biological activity and dry deposition can affect the concentrations of most nutrients in throughfall with the lowest concentrations at the beginning of the growing season and then increasing to the highest in autumn when leaves fall parker 1983 because stemflow is considered as a concentrated version of throughfall mccoll 1970 and a significant relation was detected for the concentrations of doc and tdn between throughfall and stemflow in the three forests the seasonal pattern of stemflow was similar to that of throughfall 4 2 concentrations of doc and tdn in surface runoff the amount of rainfall that reaches the soil surface and the organic materials in forest soil are the major determinants of dom transport from soil to surface runoff hua et al 2014 specifically nutrient inputs and the dilution effect by rainfall decomposition of litterfall adsorption of mineral soil and microbial activity affect concentrations of doc and tdn in surface runoff kalbitz et al 2000 long et al 2015 the content of readily oxidizable organic c in forest soils decreases along forest succession in southern china chen et al 2012 and yan et al 2015 report that concentrations of doc in surface runoff decrease gradually from pine forest to coniferous and broadleaved mixed forest to broadleaved forest similarly in this study the mean annual concentrations of doc decreased from the ca forest 20 51 16 15 mg l 1 to the pm forest 19 43 13 06 mg l 1 to the cg forest 17 16 9 74 mg l 1 notably the surface runoff in the ca forest was higher than that in the pm and cg forests fig 1c which could increase nutrient inputs to the forest floor and accelerate the leaching of doc and tdn among the three forest ecosystems the total c content in litterfall decreases from the pm forest to the ca forest to the cg forest but the total c in organic and mineral soils increases with the restoration stages zeng et al 2014 these results are primarily attributed to the faster decomposition rate of litterfall in the ca forest xiang and fang 2018 and the higher accumulation rate in the cg forest jiang et al 2016 in addition the total n and microbial biomass c and n contents in the organic and mineral soils as important nutrient sources increase from the pm forest to the ca forest to the cg forest zeng et al 2014 which can result in less doc and more tdn leaching to surface runoff akselsson et al 2010 kim et al 2010 as a possible explanation for this relation the increase in soil n availability may also expand the demand for labile c as a substrate for n immobilization aber 1992 directly reducing the doc content in surface runoff in the ca and cg forests nitrogen deposition is increasing in subtropical forests in china chen and mulder 2007 and the increase may exceed the n retention capacity of forest soils and lead to leaching of n in surface runoff akselsson et al 2010 based on previous findings the rate of n input and the differences in n production and demand influence the tdn concentrations in surface runoff lajtha 2005 yan et al 2015 in a previous study the concentrations of soil n increased from the pm forest to the ca forest to the cg forest in organic and mineral soils zeng et al 2014 in particular the higher n input in rainfall and forest soil and the faster litterfall decomposition xiang and fang 2018 could result in higher concentrations of tdn in surface runoff in the ca forest as the climax vegetation of southern china s subtropical region evergreen broadleaved forests accumulate more litterfall and soil organic matter but have a lower decomposition rate of leaf litterfall xiang and fang 2018 than the ca forests which can lead to the highest concentrations of leached n jiang et al 2016 these reasons could explain the increase in the mean annual concentrations of tdn in surface runoff from the pm forest 4 17 2 49 mg l 1 to the ca forest 4 38 2 72 mg l 1 to the cg forest 4 82 3 07 mg l 1 this result is consistent with that of yan et al 2015 who reported that concentrations of tdn in surface runoff increase from pine forests to coniferous and broadleaved mixed forests to broadleaved forests the concentrations of doc and tdn in surface runoff were higher in autumn than in other seasons this result may be explained because rainfall is the primary source of nutrients in surface runoff fig 1 which dilutes the concentrations of doc and tdn in spring and summer in addition biological factors such as increased absorption of doc and tdn by plants and microbes during wet seasons tian et al 2012 can reduce dom concentrations in surface runoff van gaelen et al 2014 dry deposition in the dormant season is much higher than that in the growing season in subtropical china zhang et al 2006 which also increases the input of doc and tdn in autumn and winter 4 3 effects of forest types on the hydrological fluxes of doc and tdn the amount of doc and tdn leached depends on their concentrations and the amount of rainfall throughfall and stemflow the amount of doc leached was enriched primarily because of wash off by rainfall and was significantly related to the amount input in throughfall in the three forests fig 4a in addition to rainfall amount determining the leaching fluxes canopy structure and forest type affect water and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems sun et al 2018 by contrast the amount of tdn leached was primarily determined by the absorption by vegetation rather than wash off from rainfall a significant relation between the amount of tdn leached and the amount of fluxes in throughfall was only found in the ca forest fig 4b a plausible explanation is the lowest lai and the seasonal change in leaf morphology rothe et al 2002 in the ca forest which can reduce canopy interception and increase tdn fluxes into forest ecosystems livesley et al 2014 however the amounts of doc and tdn leached were not significantly different among the three forests this result is consistent with the report of no significant differences in n leaching between broadleaved and coniferous forests based on the data of n fluxes in rainfall throughfall and leaching from 69 forests at 50 sites in china fang et al 2011 the annual output fluxes of doc or tdn in surface runoff were mostly less than 30 of those in throughfall fig 3 indicating the positive effect of nutrient accumulation in subtropical forests liu et al 2003 also found that nutrient amounts leached from the canopy were generally higher than those in surface runoff and that most of the nutrients were maintained in the subtropical forest ecosystems of china this could be due to slow transport and physical biogeochemical mass transfer as well as retention processes sorption and immobilization with long time lags in soils darracq et al 2008 destouni et al 2010 however it should be caution that doc and tdn accumulation might be legacy source for c and n export in surface runoff in future basu et al 2010 jantze et al 2013 destouni and jarsjö 2018 mccrackin et al 2018 as ecosystems mature the preservation of nutrients is predicted to increase odum 1969 and although this hypothesis is supported by kellman and roulet 1990 using observations from a tropical sand dune succession it is not entirely applicable to subtropical forest ecosystems hedin et al 2003 in this study the output fluxes of doc were higher in the ca forest than in the pm and cg forests while output fluxes of tdn were in the order pm forest ca forest cg forest the output fluxes of doc and tdn are closely related to the amount and concentration of surface runoff annual stream discharge can serve as a reliable surrogate for estimating annual loads of geogenic constituents exported from managed catchments at diverse spatial scales basu et al 2010 and surface runoff is one of the crucial processes and important drivers for water and nutrient loss in forest ecosystems núñez et al 2006 schmidt et al 2010 in this study surface runoff in the ca forest was much higher than that in the other two forests fig 1c a significant p 0 05 relationship was identified between surface runoff and output fluxes of doc and tdn in the three forests fig 6 difference in the amount of doc and tdn leached among the three forests fig 3 also contributed substantial inputs of nutrients to the forest floor the differences in output fluxes of doc and tdn in surface runoff indicated that nutrient cycling differed among the restoration stages the highest output fluxes of doc were in the ca forest because of the highest litterfall fastest decomposition rate and relatively high surface runoff which accelerated nutrient recycling and maintained soil fertility xiang and fang 2018 however the doc output fluxes of the pm forest were higher than that of the cg forest according to quideau 2001 different types of forest vegetation lead to differences in litter production and decomposition rates which significantly change soil organic carbon inputs resulting in differences in soil doc content in a previous study the c content of litterfall decreased significantly during litterfall decomposition in all stages of forest restoration zeng et al 2014 although the decomposition rate decreased gradually from the ca forest to the cg forest to the pm forest which directly affected the differences in concentrations and fluxes of doc in surface runoff among the three forests in addition to explain the higher tdn output fluxes in the pm forest than in the ca and cg forest besides the increase in n deposition chen and mulder 2007 in subtropical forests the increase in concentration of tdn among the three forests and the higher n accumulation efficiency jiang et al 2016 surface runoff as a direct source of nutrient input should be considered in this study the nutrient cycling of doc in the ca forest was more open than that of early pm and late cg restoration stages which attributed to the influence of the deciduous broadleaved tree species moreover the nutrient cycling of tdn was relatively closed along with the forest restoration stages 5 conclusions subtropical forests in china contain a diversity of tree species and have complex canopy structure the topography and soil conditions are typically heterogeneous and the forests experience high rainfall amounts and n deposition the concentrations of doc and tdn increased in throughfall and stemflow as rainfall passed through the forest canopy there was no significant difference in concentrations of doc and tdn in throughfall among three forests but the concentrations of doc and tdn in stemflow decreased significantly with forest restoration this partially supported the first hypothesis and revealed that different forests and canopy structures leaves branches bark etc altered the chemical properties of the precipitation via leaching in surface runoff mean concentration and annual output fluxes of doc were the highest in the deciduous broadleaved forest at the intermediate restoration stage whereas mean concentration of tdn tended to increase but annual tdn output fluxes decreased with forest restoration supporting other two hypotheses this result reflected that the nutrients carried by precipitation the decomposition rate of litterfall and the organic material in forest soil were the major determinants of doc and tdn transport from soil to surface runoff overall doc cycle in the deciduous broadleaved forest was relatively open whereas tdn cycle turned to be closed as forest restored subtropical forest exhibited nutrient accumulation in terms of low proportion of doc and tdn output fluxes forest restoration should be taken into account for catchment management to control nutrient loading in surface runoff credit authorship contribution statement yuyu you investigation methodology formal analysis writing original draft writing review editing wenhua xiang conceptualization funding acquisition

5756,in the restoration of subtropical forests the hydrological fluxes of dissolved organic carbon doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn have not been fully investigated in different stages dominated by different tree species the concentrations of doc and tdn in rainfall throughfall stemflow and surface runoff were measured for two years in each of the three forests at different restoration stages early coniferous forest pinus massoniana lithocarpus glaber intermediate deciduous broadleaved forest choerospondias axillaris and late evergreen broadleaved forest l glaber cyclobalanopsis glauca input and output fluxes as well as leaching and migration coefficients of doc and tdn were calculated to examine the nutrient cycling status in the processes of forest restoration in stemflow doc concentrations in the evergreen broadleaved forest differed significantly from those in the coniferous and deciduous broadleaved forests whereas tdn concentrations differed significantly between the coniferous forest and other two forests in throughfall doc and tdn concentrations were not significantly different among the three forests the amount of doc leached was primarily influenced by rainfall and was significantly related to fluxes in throughfall with the highest value in the deciduous broadleaved forest 57 78 kg c ha 1 however the amount of tdn leached was affected by rainfall and the absorption of vegetation and was not significantly related to fluxes in throughfall except for the deciduous broadleaved forest the highest value of tdn leached was in the coniferous forest 11 90 kg n ha 1 mean tdn concentration in surface runoff tended to increase but annual tdn output fluxes decreased with forest restoration however both mean concentration and annual output fluxes of doc in surface runoff were the highest in the deciduous broadleaved forest at the intermediate restoration stage the concentrations were closely related to surface runoff decomposition rate of litterfall and soil organic matter content the annual output fluxes of doc and tdn in surface runoff were less than 30 of the input in throughfall indicating nutrient accumulation in subtropical secondary forests keywords carbon lateral transport dissolved organic carbon surface runoff subtropical secondary forest throughfall total dissolved nitrogen 1 introduction changes in floristic composition and

in the canopy extreme weather conditions bäumler and zech 1997 van stan and stubbins 2018 the increase of nutrient concentrations in throughfall and stemflow compared to precipitation are mainly attributed to the leaching process composed of washing off dry deposited gasses and particles by rainfall and leaching of nutrients from plants zimmermann et al 2003 specially the concentration of dissolved n is usually lower than that in precipitation due to uptake or microbial transformations in canopy jiří et al 2009 the characteristics of dissolved organic matter dom during leaching are highly variable across different forests and the variabilities are more pronounced when differences in seasonal leaf states and rain conditions occur van stan and stubbins 2018 the above marked changes have been widely reported at different forest restoration stages especially in coniferous and deciduous forests currie et al 1996 schrijver et al 2007 sleutel et al 2009 considering that canopy gaps and leaf area index lai are the primary parameters determining rainfall partitioning and affecting nutrient input marin et al 2000 komatsu et al 2008 a higher leaf area index lai and faster deposition rate of coniferous forest is conducive to have higher nutrients accumulation rate and interception capacity to increase nutrient concentrations rothe et al 2002 however little is known about nutrients concentration variations in deciduous broadleaved forest and evergreen broadleaved forest during hydrological input for the lateral output of nutrients in surface runoff several studies emphasize the turnover of doc and tdn in soils as important pathways of biogeochemical cycling kalbitz et al 2000 strohmeier et al 2013 yang et al 2013 van gaelen et al 2014 the efficient

retention of major nutrients as they mature conservative consumption strategy in contrast vitousek and reiners 1975 proposed that mature ecosystems have an open cycle resource spending strategy yan et al 2015 reported that doc concentrations significantly decreased whereas tdn concentrations increased in forests along a successional gradient from pioneer pine forest to transitional coniferous and broadleaved mixed forest to mature broadleaved forest in southern china the changes were attributed to the differences in biological activities and changes in soil chemical properties in particular the variation in soil n saturation state at successional stages although high precipitation abundant substrate supply and rapid decomposition characterize these subtropical forest ecosystems kalbitz et al 2000 the cycling of doc and tdn in surface runoff at different restoration stages were less reported especially in the deciduous broadleaved forest previous studies found that the deciduous broadleaved had higher litterfall faster decomposition rate and the highest n transformation rates xiang and fang 2018 which expected to have the highest doc concentration in surface runoff meanwhile the total n and microbial biomass c and n contents in organic and mineral soils increase from early to intermediate to late restoration stages zeng et al 2014 how the output fluxes of doc and tdn change with the restoration stages under the influence of surface runoff and concentrations remain unclear in this study three forests at different restoration stages were selected including an early coniferous forest an intermediate deciduous broadleaved forest and a late evergreen broadleaved forest xiang and fang 2018 to examine how the concentrations of doc and tdn in different hydrological processes change with restoration stages and unveil the nutrients cycling of internal nutrients by vegetation the concentrations of doc tdn nh4 n and no3 n were measured in rainfall throughfall stemflow and surface runoff continuously over two years we hypothesized that 1 the concentrations of doc and tdn during leaching decreased along forest restoration stages 2 the concentrations of doc in surface runoff was the highest in the deciduous broadleaved forest but tdn concentrations increased along forest restoration stages and 3 the deciduous broadleaved forest showed an open nutrient cycling of doc while the evergreen broadleaved forest expressed obviously positive effects of nutrients accumulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this study was conducted in the dashanchong forest park 28 23 58 28 24 58 n 113 17 46 113 19 08 e in changsha county hunan china the terrain is typical hilly with an altitude ranging from 55 m to 217 4 m above sea level the region

forests are un even age stands with an average age of approximately 70 years according to historical records which developed on similar soil under the same climate 2 2 experimental set up and sample collection a 1 ha permanent plot was established in each of the three types of forest in 2013 and stand characteristics were investigated table 1 ouyang et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 to quantify the effects of forest restoration and minimize the effects of other factors on hydrological fluxes we set up a 10 m 20 m runoff plot within each forest type in 2016 trenches were dug along all sides of the runoff plots to bedrock at the depth of approximately 1 m and were then supplied with a concrete base the surface runoff was collected into a cuboid cement reservoir facing to the lowest side of each runoff plot through a pipeline connected the forest floor and the reservoir which then flowed out through a v shaped notch weir in the back of the reservoir the gauges of the data acquisition system cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa were fixed on a support frame attached to the reservoirs approximately 1 5 m above the normal water level to collect rainfall data uninterruptedly the vertical distance from the water level to the vertex of the v shaped notch weir h inside the cuboid cement reservoir was recorded in real time the surface runoff discharge q was estimated from the measured h with a formula q h regression routinely used in hydrological studies wu and wang 1993 within each of the three runoff plots several automatic recording rainfall gauges te525mm campbell scientific ltd shepshed uk with diameters of 24 5 cm and the height up to 30 cm were installed at uphill and downhill positions to record the throughfall amount stemflow amount were also monitored by such rainfall gauges to ensure that the experimental conditions were relatively consistent in the three plots some important factors such as stand density canopy coverage the distance between the rainfall gauges and the trees and average stand height were considered in addition the observation tower over the administrative office building of dashanchong forest park was designated as a collection point for atmospheric precipitation which monitored by several automatic recording rainfall gauges without interruption the samples of rainfall were collected using rain collectors installed in an open area of approximately 40 m2 and 10 m away from the runoff plot of the pm forest the rain collectors consisted of a 15 cm diameter funnel with a plastic mesh and a 1 l plastic cylinder and the funnel inserted in the top of the cylinder the collectors were placed 1 5 m above ground level and fastened to a 2 m high pole the throughfall samples were collected using four identical rain collectors set up under the canopy within each forest at randomly selected uphill and downhill positions the stemflow samples were collected using another rain collector consisted of a 15 l plastic cylinder and a longitudinally split plastic pipe with a diameter of one centimeter placed on each selected tree the plastic pipe was snaked around the selected trees and then embedded in and sealed to the bark surface with silica gel the samples of surface runoff were acquired from a rubber barrel placed in the cement reservoir from march 2017 to february 2019 the above samples were collected regularly twice a month using the bottles rinsed with pure water before collection if there were heavy rain we took additional samples immediately after rainfall events the samples of rainfall throughfall stemflow and surface runoff from various rain collectors were mixed in one bottle correspondingly and labeled separately for a particular determination of hydrographic concentration all experimental equipment was checked and cleaned out after sampling the samples were transported to the laboratory immediately where the samples were measured or stored in a refrigerator at 4 c for no more than one day until chemical analysis 2 3 chemical analyses before the analyses all samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm mixed cellulose microporous filter membrane under vacuum which were rinsed with deionized and sample water the concentrations of doc in the filtered water samples were determined by using a toc analyzer shimadzu kyoto japan the concentrations of tdn nh4 n and no3 n were measured using an auto analyzer 3 aa3 bran luebbe ltd hamburg germany the concentration of don was calculated as the difference between the concentration of tdn and that of the sum of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din nh4 n and no3 n don tdn din 2 4 data analyses bartlett and shapiro wilk tests were performed to determine whether the data conforms to homogeneity of variance and normal distribution two way analysis of variance anova and tukey s honestly significant difference hsd test were used to examine the effects of different restoration stages and seasons on hydrological fluxes and concentrations of doc and tdn the fluxes of doc tdn nh4 n no3 n and don in the three forests were calculated by multiplying the concentration by the corresponding amount of rain data the monthly seasonal and yearly rainfall amount and hydrological fluxes in rainfall throughfall stemflow and surface runoff were obtained from the sum of the data in the corresponding period the input fluxes of doc and tdn are defined as the mean monthly annual concentrations and total amount of doc and tdn in rainfall above the forest canopy the output fluxes of doc and tdn are defined as the mean monthly annual concentrations and total amount of doc and tdn amount leached through surface runoff izquieta rojano et al 2016 internal fluxes of doc and tdn in throughfall and stemflow reflect mainly return to the soil in forests schroth et al 2001 to quantify the differences in amounts of nutrients leached in different forest restoration stages the net nutrient leaching amount was calculated by subtracting the nutrient fluxes in throughfall ntf and stemflow nsf from that in rainfall nrf the sum of the monthly leaching amount of doc and tdn made up the total leaching amount during the sampling period and the negative values need to be absolute to investigate the stability of doc and tdn leaching coefficients were calculated by dividing the nutrient concentrations in throughfall or stemflow by those in rainfall and migration coefficients were calculated by dividing the total amount of doc and tdn in surface runoff by those in throughfall oyarzún and hervé fernández 2015 multivariate regression model was used to examine the effects of doc and tdn fluxes in rainfall throughfall and stemflow on the output fluxes in surface runoff linear regression analysis was performed to examine the relations between ntf and the corresponding net leaching amount as well as the relations between nutrient output amount and surface runoff the statistical software r 3 4 4 r development core team 2018 was used to perform all data analyses and to produce the figures 3 results 3 1 seasonal changes in the amounts of rainfall throughfall stemflow and surface runoff the rainfall outside the forests varied seasonally fig 1 d with average values of 150 5 66 4 mm in spring 179 7 159 6 mm in summer 71 2 21 0 mm in autumn and 82 2 36 2 mm in winter there were significant differences p 0 05 between rainfall amount in summer and other seasons especially with autumn and winter the seasonal variation in throughfall stemflow and surface runoff were significantly p 0 001 related to those of rainfall in the three forests at different restoration stages fig 1a b and c 3 2 concentrations of doc and tdn in throughfall and stemflow the changes in concentrations of doc and tdn in throughfall and stemflow were evaluated using the leaching coefficients of throughfall lct and stemflow lcs table 2 in general the concentrations of doc and tdn were enriched in throughfall and stemflow and the greatest enrichment was for doc in stemflow the concentrations of doc were significantly higher in autumn p 0 05 while the concentrations of tdn were prominently higher in autumn and winter p 0 05 in throughfall and stemflow in the three forests fig 2 a and b the concentrations of doc in stemflow were significantly lower p 0 001 in the cg forest than those in the ca and pm forests but the difference between the ca and pm forests was not significant fig 2a b the mean annual concentrations of doc in stemflow were 21 19 10 94 mg l 1 in the pm forest 20 92 16 04 mg l 1 in the ca forest and 8 29 4 66 mg l 1 in the cg forest the concentrations of tdn in stemflow decreased significantly p 0 05 in the order pm forest 6 04 4 06 mg l 1 ca forest 3 79 1 88 mg l 1 and cg forest 3 03 1 73 mg l 1 fig 2b b the mean annual concentrations of doc in throughfall were higher in the ca 9 51 7 21 mg l 1 and pm 9 13 4 34 mg l 1 forests than those in the cg forest 7 55 4 53 mg l 1 fig 2a a however the differences in throughfall doc or tdn fig 2b a concentrations among the three forests were not significant the mean annual concentrations of tdn decreased from the pm forest 4 31 2 23 mg l 1 to the ca forest 3 27 1 67 mg l 1 to the cg forest 3 53 1 68 mg l 1 which was similar to the order found in stemflow 3 3 concentrations of doc and tdn in surface runoff the concentrations of doc and tdn in surface runoff in the three forests varied significantly p 0 05 among seasons with higher values in autumn than in other seasons fig 2a c and b c the concentrations of doc and tdn in surface runoff were not significantly different among the three forests the mean annual concentrations of doc in surface runoff was 19 43 13 06 mg l 1 in the pm forest 20 51 16 15 mg l 1 in the ca forest and 17 16 9 74 mg l 1 in the cg forest the mean annual concentration of tdn in surface runoff was 4 17 2 49 mg l 1 in the pm forest 4 38 2 72 mg l 1 in the ca forest and 4 82 3 07 mg l 1 in the cg forest 3 4 net nutrient leaching fluxes in throughfall and stemflow different hydrological fluxes of doc and tdn in the three forests over the sampling period were showed in fig 3 the total net doc leaching fluxes were lower in the cg 31 53 5 94 kg c ha 1 yr 1 and pm 36 34 14 03 kg c ha 1 yr 1 forests than that in the ca forest 57 77 20 49 kg c ha 1 yr 1 the leaching fluxes of doc were significantly p 0 001 related to the fluxes in throughfall in the three forests fig 4 a the primary contribution to net doc leaching was from the washing off of nutrients retained in the canopy by contrast the total net tdn leaching fluxes were lower in the cg 9 96 1 92 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and ca 11 52 4 07 kg n ha 1 yr 1 forests than that in the pm forest 11 90 3 77 kg n ha 1 yr 1 except for in the ca forest no significant relationships were detected between tdn leaching fluxes and fluxes in throughfall fig 4b 3 5 nutrient output fluxes in surface runoff the monthly mean output fluxes of doc fig 5 a b and c and tdn fig 5d e and f in surface runoff varied with forest restoration stages the highest values in pm and ca forests occurred in spring and summer but in the cg forest the highest values occurred in autumn and winter the lowest values appeared in june in the pm and ca forest in april in the cg forest the relations between output fluxes of doc fig 6 a and tdn fig 6b and surface runoff were significant p 0 05 the mean annual output fluxes of doc in surface runoff were higher in the ca forest than in pm forest and cg forest fig 7 while output fluxes of tdn decreased from the pm forest to ca forest to cg forest the doc and tdn fluxes in rainfall were significantly related to those in surface runoff in pm and cg forests while doc and tdn fluxes in throughfall and stemflow were significantly related to those in surface runoff in ca forest table s1 4 discussion 4 1 concentrations of doc and tdn in throughfall and stemflow the nutrient composition of rainfall is altered after passing through the forest canopy lovett and lindberg 1993 the tree species and canopy structure leaves branches bark etc can greatly alter the amount spatiotemporal patterning and chemical properties of precipitation via several processes including leaching of compounds from leaves and stems and increasing dry deposition crona 1983 levia et al 2011 pypker et al 2011 in general nutrient concentrations in stemflow were higher than those in rainfall fig 2a b and b b in stemflow the leaching of compounds from leaves and stems and the retention or uptake of nutrients by the vegetation are considered as the primary factors influencing the variability in c and n concentrations ciglasch et al 2004 in this study the concentrations of doc in stemflow were significantly lower p 0 05 in the cg forest 8 29 4 66 mg l 1 than those in the ca 20 92 16 04 mg l 1 and pm 21 19 10 94 mg l 1 forests fig 2a b those concentrations were directly affected by the differences in stemflow amount and the organic material leached from the trunks in the three forests canopy gaps and leaf area index lai are the primary parameters determining rainfall partitioning marin et al 2000 komatsu et al 2008 and therefore a higher lai can intercept more rainfall and diminish the amount of rainfall entering the forest i e via throughfall and stemflow consequently the highest lai in the cg forest table 1 resulted in the lowest stemflow with less flow to leach organic material from the trunks as a result the concentrations of doc in stemflow in the cg forest were less compared with those in the stemflow of ca and pm forests the concentrations of tdn in stemflow decreased from the pm forest to the ca forest to the cg forest and the difference was significant between the pm forests and the other forests fig 2b b in throughfall fig 2a a the concentrations of doc were significantly higher than those in rainfall fig 2a d which result from the dissolution of dissolved organic matter deposited on leaf and branch surfaces hoffman et al 1980 the secretions produced by animals and microorganisms whitehead et al 1983 and the leaching of leaves and needles in this study the monthly concentrations of doc in throughfall ranged from 1 98 mg l 1 to 19 53 mg l 1 in the pm forest 2 38 mg l 1 to 29 66 mg l 1 in the ca forest and 1 29 mg l 1 to 16 98 mg l 1 in the cg forest fig 2a a these concentrations are within the range of concentrations of doc in throughfall 1 61 mg l 1 reported by van stan and stubbins 2018 the mean annual concentrations of doc were higher in the ca 9 51 7 21 mg l 1 and pm 9 13 4 34 mg l 1 forests than those in the cg forest 7 55 4 53 mg l 1 these results are partly consistent with those of van stan and stubbins 2018 who reported that forests with pronounced differences in seasonal leaf states and rain conditions had the maximum range of throughfall doc concentrations i e the ca forest whereas evergreen forest types had the minimum variability in throughfall doc concentrations i e the pm and cg forests however in this study no significant differences in throughfall doc or tdn concentrations were detected among the three forests the mean annual concentrations of tdn decreased in the order pm forest 4 31 2 23 mg l 1 ca forest 3 27 1 67 mg l 1 and cg forest 3 53 1 68 mg l 1 which was similar to the order observed for stemflow fig 2b a the concentrations of doc and tdn in throughfall and stemflow were significantly higher in autumn than the other seasons fig 2 the dilution effect is an important factor during the leaching process in the forest canopy that lowers the concentrations of doc and tdn in the relatively wet spring and summer thus the increase in concentrations of doc and tdn associated with lower rainfall amounts in autumn could be attributed to the particles and aerosols long accumulated on leaf and branch surfaces being washed off with less water michalzik and matzner 2010 other factors such as tree species canopy structure and leaf morphology also have a synergistic role strohmeier et al 2013 the results of this study are consistent with those of a previous report that seasonal effects on metabolic processes such as changes in biological activity and dry deposition can affect the concentrations of most nutrients in throughfall with the lowest concentrations at the beginning of the growing season and then increasing to the highest in autumn when leaves fall parker 1983 because stemflow is considered as a concentrated version of throughfall mccoll 1970 and a significant relation was detected for the concentrations of doc and tdn between throughfall and stemflow in the three forests the seasonal pattern of stemflow was similar to that of throughfall 4 2 concentrations of doc and tdn in surface runoff the amount of rainfall that reaches the soil surface and the organic materials in forest soil are the major determinants of dom transport from soil to surface runoff hua et al 2014 specifically nutrient inputs and the dilution effect by rainfall decomposition of litterfall adsorption of mineral soil and microbial activity affect concentrations of doc and tdn in surface runoff kalbitz et al 2000 long et al 2015 the content of readily oxidizable organic c in forest soils decreases along forest succession in southern china chen et al 2012 and yan et al 2015 report that concentrations of doc in surface runoff decrease gradually from pine forest to coniferous and broadleaved mixed forest to broadleaved forest similarly in this study the mean annual concentrations of doc decreased from the ca forest 20 51 16 15 mg l 1 to the pm forest 19 43 13 06 mg l 1 to the cg forest 17 16 9 74 mg l 1 notably the surface runoff in the ca forest was higher than that in the pm and cg forests fig 1c which could increase nutrient inputs to the forest floor and accelerate the leaching of doc and tdn among the three forest ecosystems the total c content in litterfall decreases from the pm forest to the ca forest to the cg forest but the total c in organic and mineral soils increases with the restoration stages zeng et al 2014 these results are primarily attributed to the faster decomposition rate of litterfall in the ca forest xiang and fang 2018 and the higher accumulation rate in the cg forest jiang et al 2016 in addition the total n and microbial biomass c and n contents in the organic and mineral soils as important nutrient sources increase from the pm forest to the ca forest to the cg forest zeng et al 2014 which can result in less doc and more tdn leaching to surface runoff akselsson et al 2010 kim et al 2010 as a possible explanation for this relation the increase in soil n availability may also expand the demand for labile c as a substrate for n immobilization aber 1992 directly reducing the doc content in surface runoff in the ca and cg forests nitrogen deposition is increasing in subtropical forests in china chen and mulder 2007 and the increase may exceed the n retention capacity of forest soils and lead to leaching of n in surface runoff akselsson et al 2010 based on previous findings the rate of n input and the differences in n production and demand influence the tdn concentrations in surface runoff lajtha 2005 yan et al 2015 in a previous study the concentrations of soil n increased from the pm forest to the ca forest to the cg forest in organic and mineral soils zeng et al 2014 in particular the higher n input in rainfall and forest soil and the faster litterfall decomposition xiang and fang 2018 could result in higher concentrations of tdn in surface runoff in the ca forest as the climax vegetation of southern china s subtropical region evergreen broadleaved forests accumulate more litterfall and soil organic matter but have a lower decomposition rate of leaf litterfall xiang and fang 2018 than the ca forests which can lead to the highest concentrations of leached n jiang et al 2016 these reasons could explain the increase in the mean annual concentrations of tdn in surface runoff from the pm forest 4 17 2 49 mg l 1 to the ca forest 4 38 2 72 mg l 1 to the cg forest 4 82 3 07 mg l 1 this result is consistent with that of yan et al 2015 who reported that concentrations of tdn in surface runoff increase from pine forests to coniferous and broadleaved mixed forests to broadleaved forests the concentrations of doc and tdn in surface runoff were higher in autumn than in other seasons this result may be explained because rainfall is the primary source of nutrients in surface runoff fig 1 which dilutes the concentrations of doc and tdn in spring and summer in addition biological factors such as increased absorption of doc and tdn by plants and microbes during wet seasons tian et al 2012 can reduce dom concentrations in surface runoff van gaelen et al 2014 dry deposition in the dormant season is much higher than that in the growing season in subtropical china zhang et al 2006 which also increases the input of doc and tdn in autumn and winter 4 3 effects of forest types on the hydrological fluxes of doc and tdn the amount of doc and tdn leached depends on their concentrations and the amount of rainfall throughfall and stemflow the amount of doc leached was enriched primarily because of wash off by rainfall and was significantly related to the amount input in throughfall in the three forests fig 4a in addition to rainfall amount determining the leaching fluxes canopy structure and forest type affect water and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems sun et al 2018 by contrast the amount of tdn leached was primarily determined by the absorption by vegetation rather than wash off from rainfall a significant relation between the amount of tdn leached and the amount of fluxes in throughfall was only found in the ca forest fig 4b a plausible explanation is the lowest lai and the seasonal change in leaf morphology rothe et al 2002 in the ca forest which can reduce canopy interception and increase tdn fluxes into forest ecosystems livesley et al 2014 however the amounts of doc and tdn leached were not significantly different among the three forests this result is consistent with the report of no significant differences in n leaching between broadleaved and coniferous forests based on the data of n fluxes in rainfall throughfall and leaching from 69 forests at 50 sites in china fang et al 2011 the annual output fluxes of doc or tdn in surface runoff were mostly less than 30 of those in throughfall fig 3 indicating the positive effect of nutrient accumulation in subtropical forests liu et al 2003 also found that nutrient amounts leached from the canopy were generally higher than those in surface runoff and that most of the nutrients were maintained in the subtropical forest ecosystems of china this could be due to slow transport and physical biogeochemical mass transfer as well as retention processes sorption and immobilization with long time lags in soils darracq et al 2008 destouni et al 2010 however it should be caution that doc and tdn accumulation might be legacy source for c and n export in surface runoff in future basu et al 2010 jantze et al 2013 destouni and jarsjö 2018 mccrackin et al 2018 as ecosystems mature the preservation of nutrients is predicted to increase odum 1969 and although this hypothesis is supported by kellman and roulet 1990 using observations from a tropical sand dune succession it is not entirely applicable to subtropical forest ecosystems hedin et al 2003 in this study the output fluxes of doc were higher in the ca forest than in the pm and cg forests while output fluxes of tdn were in the order pm forest ca forest cg forest the output fluxes of doc and tdn are closely related to the amount and concentration of surface runoff annual stream discharge can serve as a reliable surrogate for estimating annual loads of geogenic constituents exported from managed catchments at diverse spatial scales basu et al 2010 and surface runoff is one of the crucial processes and important drivers for water and nutrient loss in forest ecosystems núñez et al 2006 schmidt et al 2010 in this study surface runoff in the ca forest was much higher than that in the other two forests fig 1c a significant p 0 05 relationship was identified between surface runoff and output fluxes of doc and tdn in the three forests fig 6 difference in the amount of doc and tdn leached among the three forests fig 3 also contributed substantial inputs of nutrients to the forest floor the differences in output fluxes of doc and tdn in surface runoff indicated that nutrient cycling differed among the restoration stages the highest output fluxes of doc were in the ca forest because of the highest litterfall fastest decomposition rate and relatively high surface runoff which accelerated nutrient recycling and maintained soil fertility xiang and fang 2018 however the doc output fluxes of the pm forest were higher than that of the cg forest according to quideau 2001 different types of forest vegetation lead to differences in litter production and decomposition rates which significantly change soil organic carbon inputs resulting in differences in soil doc content in a previous study the c content of litterfall decreased significantly during litterfall decomposition in all stages of forest restoration zeng et al 2014 although the decomposition rate decreased gradually from the ca forest to the cg forest to the pm forest which directly affected the differences in concentrations and fluxes of doc in surface runoff among the three forests in addition to explain the higher tdn output fluxes in the pm forest than in the ca and cg forest besides the increase in n deposition chen and mulder 2007 in subtropical forests the increase in concentration of tdn among the three forests and the higher n accumulation efficiency jiang et al 2016 surface runoff as a direct source of nutrient input should be considered in this study the nutrient cycling of doc in the ca forest was more open than that of early pm and late cg restoration stages which attributed to the influence of the deciduous broadleaved tree species moreover the nutrient cycling of tdn was relatively closed along with the forest restoration stages 5 conclusions subtropical forests in china contain a diversity of tree species and have complex canopy structure the topography and soil conditions are typically heterogeneous and the forests experience high rainfall amounts and n deposition the concentrations of doc and tdn increased in throughfall and stemflow as rainfall passed through the forest canopy there was no significant difference in concentrations of doc and tdn in throughfall among three forests but the concentrations of doc and tdn in stemflow decreased significantly with forest restoration this partially supported the first hypothesis and revealed that different forests and canopy structures leaves branches bark etc altered the chemical properties of the precipitation via leaching in surface runoff mean concentration and annual output fluxes of doc were the highest in the deciduous broadleaved forest at the intermediate restoration stage whereas mean concentration of tdn tended to increase but annual tdn output fluxes decreased with forest restoration supporting other two hypotheses this result reflected that the nutrients carried by precipitation the decomposition rate of litterfall and the organic material in forest soil were the major determinants of doc and tdn transport from soil to surface runoff overall doc cycle in the deciduous broadleaved forest was relatively open whereas tdn cycle turned to be closed as forest restored subtropical forest exhibited nutrient accumulation in terms of low proportion of doc and tdn output fluxes forest restoration should be taken into account for catchment management to control nutrient loading in surface runoff credit authorship contribution statement yuyu you investigation methodology formal analysis writing original draft writing review editing wenhua xiang conceptualization funding acquisition

5757,karst waters spring fed streams lakes and reservoirs characterized by relatively high concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon dic and p co2 significantly impact regional and global carbon cycles by releasing carbon dioxide to the atmosphere investigating the transfer of dic from karst waters to the atmosphere is important to further our understanding of carbon cycling in karst environments there is still considerable uncertainty about the controls of dic transfer in karst waters because of challenges associated with investigations that aim to mimic the continuum of changes in dic concentrations to equilibrium with atmospheric co2 in natural settings laboratory simulations can create controlled conditions that allow targeted investigations in this study four tanks were taken to investigate the variations of pco2 dic and δ13cdic when karst spring waters were exposed to the atmosphere from 40 to 360 h as 1 agitated water containing hydrilla verticillata 2 static water containing hydrilla verticillata 3 agitated water without hydrilla verticillata and 4 static water without hydrilla verticillata the rates of photosynthesis respiration of submerged plants co2 outgassing and carbonate precipitation dissolution were quantified by a time stepping chemical isotopic mass balance model this experiment was designed to create ideal conditions to estimate the temporal evolution of dic and δ13cdic and investigate mechanisms that control their evolution when karst spring waters interact with atmospheric co2 results show 1 generally a steep decrease in dic concentrations and δ13cdic enrichment 2 dic loss and δ13cdic enrichment are faster in the agitated waters with submerged plants 3 dic evolution is mainly controlled by the metabolism of aquatic plants 4 carbonate precipitation dissolution and co2 outgassing has a lower effect on the dic evolution in waters with submerged plants 5 δ13cdic evolution is mainly controlled by the metabolism of submerged plants 6 co2 evasion photosynthesis and δ13cdic enrichment are accelerated by the agitation of waters our analyses show that more than 40 of the total dic resulting from carbonate weathering was used for photosynthesis by submerged aquatic plants thereby transforming the dic into organic carbon oc suggesting that intense aquatic photosynthetic activities in continental surface water systems could

eventually lithify to constitute a relatively long term natural carbon sink current estimates suggest that 2 7 pg c year 1 of terrestrial c fluxes organic and inorganic carbon are exported to continental waters of which 1 2 pg c year 1 are released to the atmosphere 0 6 pg c year 1 are trapped in sediment and only 0 9 pg c year 1 are delivered to the world s oceans aufdenkampe et al 2011 however there remain large uncertainties on the magnitude of c fluxes in global continental waters cole et al 2007 battin et al 2009 aufdenkampe et al 2011 liu 2011 carbonate outcrops represent approximately 20 of the earth s ice free surface ford williams 2007 and their rapid dissolution by carbonic acid increases the amount of dissolved inorganic carbon dic species hco3 co3 2 h2co3 and co2 aq and calcium ions in karst ground and surface waters high concentrations of dic leading to a change in the pco2 in these karst waters e g in aquifers rivers streams reservoirs and lakes is a potential source for atmospheric co2 which could significantly impact the regional and ultimately the global carbon cycle liu 2011 martin 2017 thus to address the uncertainties of c fluxes in global continental waters it is necessary to investigate and assess the role of karst carbonate impacted surface water bodies like streams on dic evolution ultimately the transfer of dic from sediments and waters to the atmosphere depends on the processes and concentrations that are locally at play three principal processes that control dic and δ13cdic evolution in surface waters from karst spring waters are 1 physical water air exchange i e co2 g transfer to the atmosphere 2 geochemical reactions involving carbonate precipitation and or dissolution and 3 biogeochemical processes involving respiration and photosynthesis the extent of the effect of each process depends on hydrologic conditions e g recharge discharge flow velocity aquatic plant type and productivity residence time and ion saturation underlying geology climate and atmospheric conditions etc co2 g exchange is a physical flux driven by dic concentrations speciation reactions and relative the pco2 between water and the atmosphere surface waters with high dic concentrations and higher pco2 will lose co2 g to the atmosphere as the waters evolve towards chemical equilibrium with atmospheric co2 g as a result of co2 evasion increase the solubility of calcite leads to saturation and caco3 precipitation from the solution e g jacobson and usdowski 1975 dreybrodt et al 1992 metabolic reactions by submerged plants can force diel cycles of dic in waters especially in karst waters with high pco2 parker et al 2007 2010 de montety et al 2011 gray et al 2011 nimick et al 2011 tobias böhlke 2011 jiang et al 2013 peter et al 2014 liu et al 2015 chen et al 2017 pu et al 2017 calcite precipitation due to the joint effect of chemical and biological processes can be represented by eq 1 smith and gattuso 2011 1 ca 2 2 hco 3 caco 3 x ch 2 o o 2 1 x co 2 h 2 o thus in addition to being a source for atmospheric co2 high concentrations of dic and pco2 in karst waters can also be the c source for photosynthesis of submerged plants converting dic into organic carbon with time some of the organic carbon could eventually be buried and converted into autochthonous organic matter as a long term or permanent carbon sink cole et al 2007 einsele et al 2001 in these karst water systems the δ13cdic in the evolving dic waters will change because of the isotopic fractionation accompanying carbon loss gain degassing to the atmosphere calcite precipitation dissolution and carbon assimilation disassimilation during metabolism from the system e g clark and fritz 1997 parker et al 2007 tobias böhlke 2011 abongwa and atekwana 2013 2015 jiang et al 2013 khadka et al 2014 liu et al 2015 van geldern et al 2015 pu et al 2017 the resulting δ13cdic of the karst waters can thus be described by either kinetic or equilibrium isotope fractionation zhang et al 1995 although dic evolution in surface waters tends towards chemical and isotopic equilibrium with the atmosphere it is challenging especially in karst waters to map this kind of dic evolution these challenges result from complications due to the complexity of reaction pathways and large variations in field settings thus far isotopic disequilibrium appears to be the rule especially for field based investigations of karst waters to date laboratory experiments e g abongwa and atekwana 2013 2015 can provide near ideal ways to assess how the dic and δ13cdic of karst waters evolve to chemical and isotopic equilibrium with the atmosphere in this study the temporal evolutions of dic and δ13cdic were assessed in karst spring waters treated to different hydro biological conditions and exposed to attain equilibrium with the atmosphere in a laboratory setting the objectives are to 1 document how the dic and δ13cdic in karst spring waters exposed to atmospheric co2 g evolve under agitated and static conditions with without aquatic plants and 2 determine the effect of physical chemical and biological processes on the evolution of dic and δ13cdic in karst spring waters exposed to atmospheric co2 g 2 experimental design and methods 2 1 experimental design four tanks were prepared with different treatments to address the hydro biological conditions for investigation as follows two tanks with 465 g 2 5 g of contain a common submerged macrophyte in karst environments hydrilla verticillata e g sousa 2011 collected from an experimental pool on the campus of the southwest university and two other tanks treated with clo2 were mixed with 1 l of a 2 5 mg l clo2 solution to eliminate microbial activity one tank from each set treated with hydrilla verticillata and clo2 was subjected to agitation by continuously circulating the water at a rate of 14 l min using a submersible pump to simulate turbulent flow conditions and the other tanks were maintained under static conditions to simulate laminar flow or steady conditions table 1 unfiltered and untreated water was collected from chongqing qingmuguan karst spring 106 20 10 e 29 47 00 n around 8 00 a m on july 7th 2015 in 80 l tightly sealed headspace free tanks and transported within 15 min to the laboratory under laboratory conditions the water was transferred by pumping into four smaller 63 cm 45 cm acid pre washed plastic tanks wt1 wt2 wt3 and wt4 and immediately measured for physicochemical parameters the initial measurements of the unfiltered untreated water are reported in table 2 after initial measurements the water samples were then subjected to hydro biological and chemical treatments as shown in table 1 all four tanks were exposed under the same atmospheric conditions for the duration of the experiment by placing them on the roof of the building of the school of geographical sciences the duration of the experiments depended on the time required by each tank to reach chemical and isotopic equilibrium with atmospheric co2 g as a consequence the experiments lasted between 48 and 360 h depending on the time it took for the waters to reach chemical and isotopic equilibrium with atmospheric co2 g the experimental setup of the four tanks is shown in fig 1 2 2 measurements sampling and laboratory analyses 2 2 1 measurements two wtw technology multiline 340 multi probes and two hach multi parameter data loggers were programmed to regularly measure ph water temperature t dissolved oxygen do and specific conductivity spc at 15 min

using four gmp22 carbon dioxide probes fitted with films that prevent water from entering the probes but allow co2 with a resolution of 1 ppmv in situ hco3 co3 2 and ca2 concentrations were determined by test kits using a titration pipette aquamerck with resolutions of 0 1 mmol l and 1 mg l respectively at 1 h intervals for the first 48 h the measurements and samplings of tanks wt1 and wt2 ended after 48 h measurements of hco3 co3 2 and ca2 ions were continued for tanks wt3 and wt4 until equilibrium was reached after 96 and 360 h respectively sampling intervals were determined from variations

analysis of dissolved inorganic carbon a 10 ml water sample was injected by syringe into glass bottles that were pre filled with 1 ml 85 phosphoric acid and magnetic stir bars the co2 in the samples was extracted and purified after cryogenic removal of h2o using a liquid nitrogen ethanol trap finally the extracted co2 was transferred cryogenically into a tube for isotope measurement the δ13cdic were measured by delta plus xl gas stable isotope mass spectrometry for the δ13cco2 of atmospheric gas samples were collected from the air around the tanks in the mornings and afternoons using an evacuated glass vessel from july 7 to 13 and measured by trace gas gas sample concentration system linked with an isoprime 100 mass spectrometer the hydrilla verticillata samples were ultrasonically cleaned for 15 min in deionized water and dried in an oven at 50 c for 48 h after drying the plant samples were ground into a powder form with diameters 150 μm to ensure homogeneity one to 2 mg of the powdered sample was placed into stannum cups for carbon isotope analysis the carbon isotopic compositions of hydrilla verticillata samples were determined using an elemental analyzer coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer ea irms the isotopic analyses were conducted in the environmental stable isotope laboratory of the chinese academy of agricultural sciences stable carbon isotope

data were recorded from a bs28 vp2 field weather station located at the experimental site parameters were measured at 15 min interval including air temperature solar radiation and evaporation rate the resolutions of the measurements were 0 5 c 5 and 0 25 mm respectively 3 data processing and analysis 3 1 preprocessing since ca2 and hco3 are the main ions in karst waters the time series of ca2 and hco3 concentrations were calculated from the linear relationship between the in situ titration data and logged data of spc table 3 the dic concentrations were calculated from the time series of hco3

concentrations from calcite carbonate precipitation decreases ca2 and hco3 concentrations by a ratio of 1 2 mol and simultaneously releases 1 mol of co2 aq into solution and conversely carbonate dissolution increases ca2 and hco3 concentrations by a ratio of 1 2 mol and remove 1 mol of co2 aq from the solution thus the dic loss by calcite precipitation or gain by calcite dissolution were calculated from the changes in ca2 concentrations and molar ratio between ca2 and hco3 concentrations 3 4 determining changes in dic from the metabolism of hydrilla verticillata the biologically

respiration rate at night t and taverage are the observed water temperature and the average value of water temperature c respectively the gpp can be calculated from the mass balance of do concentrations the dic affected by the metabolism of hydrilla verticillata can be estimated based on c o2 molar stoichiometry 1 1 del giorgio and williams 2005 3 5 estimated magnitudes of δ13cdic variations the contributions of biological chemical and physical processes to variations in δ13cdic were calculated using a time stepping chemical isotope 12c and 13c mass balance model tobias and böhlke 2011 based on the dic loss gain the model requires 1 the initial δ13c values of the dic from the karst spring water table 2 hydrilla verticillata and atmospheric co2 table 4 2 the isotope

respectively the δ13cdic values were calculated from the modeled 12c and 13c molar concentrations according to the relation 5 δ 13 c dic 13 c 12 c 89 45 1 where 89 45 is the molar ratio of 12c 13c in the vpdb isotopic reference coplen et al 2002 3 6 equilibrium values of dic and δ13cdic for the duration of the experiments atmospheric pco2 varied between 350 ppmv and 500 ppmv with a mean value of 410 ppmv table 2 and δ13cco2 varied between 8 0 and 11 9 with a mean value of 9 9 table 4 the stable carbon isotope fractionation between dic and co2 g is about 8 4 at 25 c zhang et al 1995 therefore the pco2 and δ13cdic in karst waters that achieve chemical and isotopic equilibrium with atmospheric co2 g will be around 410 ppmv and 1 5 0 4 to 3 5 respectively 4 results 4 1 temporal variations of

increases at nighttime during the first day ca2 and dic decreased steeply from 120 mg l to 70 mg l and 356 mg l to 140 mg l during the day and then slightly increased to 80 mg l and 180 mg l overnight respectively the next day ca2 and dic gradually decreased to 45 mg l and 42 mg l during the daytime and then stabilized around a low of 48 mg l and 58 mg l to the end of the experiment respectively the pco2 for wt2 fig 2f also generally decreased with small diel variations the pco2 values decreased steeply from 16 500 ppmv down to 3000 ppmv during the first 7 h and then gradually to 1500 ppmv

to 2 3 at night 4 3 temporal variations of physico chemical parameters and δ13cdic in agitated karst spring water without hydrilla verticillata wt3 the ph in wt3 fig 3 b generally increased to the end

ppmv during the night the pco2 continued to decline gradually to 410 ppmv after 70 h and then slowly to 300 ppmv to the end of the experiment the δ13cdic of wt3 fig 3g showed a different temporal pattern when compared to wt1 and wt2 the δ13cdic of wt3 was rapidly enriched by 7 4 from 10 9 to 3 5 at the first 36 h followed by a more gradual enrichment phase to 1 5 4 4 temporal variations of

and minima in the evenings the diel pattern shows symmetry with sharp minimum and maximum peaks and varied between 6 5 mg l and 8 0 mg l the ca2 and dic concentrations in wt4 fig 4d and e generally decreased over time during the first 36 h the ca2 and dic concentrations remained near stable followed by a steep decline to about 144 h before slightly steadying to the end of the experiment ca2 decreased from 117 mg l to 60 mg l and dic decreased from 330 mg l to 145 mg l and then remained more or less stable until the end of experiment the pco2 in wt4 fig 4f decreased steeply from 16 500 ppmv to 5000 ppmv during the first 36 h and then gradually to 1400 ppmv after 144 h the pco2 continued to decrease slowly to 1000 ppmv by the 192 h and then to 410 ppmv after 330 h and then stabilized to the end of the experiment the δ13cdic of wt4 fig 4g showed similar variation as wt3 fig 3g the δ13cdic increased with slight enrichment of 0 9 from 10 9 to 10 0 during the first 12 h followed by significant enrichment of 7 9 from 10 0 to 2 1 during the next 256 h by the end of the experiment gradual enrichment continued to 1 5 5 discussion 5 1 chemical and isotopic behavior of dic in karst spring waters exposed to the atmosphere the dic concentrations and δ13cdic in treated karst spring waters with different hydro biological conditions exposed to the same atmosphere exhibit different temporal chemical and isotopic behaviors figs 5 and 6 and table s1 although the dic concentrations and δ13cdic in all karst spring waters reached chemical and isotopic equilibrium with atmospheric co2 fig 2e 2 g 3e 3 g 4e and 4 g dic loss and δ13cdic enrichment are faster in waters that contained hydrilla verticillata wt1 and wt2 than in waters without hydrilla verticillata wt3 and wt4 dic loss and δ13cdic enrichment are faster in agitated waters than in static waters wt1 vs wt2 and wt3 vs wt4 it took 25 h and 26 h for the agitated water with hydrilla verticillata wt1 and 29 h and 30 h for the static water with hydrilla verticillata wt2 to reach chemical and isotopic equilibrium with atmospheric co2 respectively meanwhile it took more time 70 h and 96 h for the agitated water without hydrilla verticillata wt3 and 330 h and 360 h for the static water without hydrilla verticillata wt4 to reach chemical and isotopic equilibrium with atmospheric co2 respectively since all the waters were obtained from the same karst spring source and had similar initial dic concentrations and δ13cdic values and were all exposed to the same laboratory atmosphere the different temporal response and chemical and isotopic behaviors of the waters as they attained equilibrium could be attributed to differences in hydro biological conditions of the treated waters thus such significant differences in the temporal evolution of dic and δ13cdic in karst spring waters exposed to the atmosphere is primarily related to the effects of the aquatic plants and also of the water agitation with these observations we show that by evaluating the effects of different processes physical chemical and biological under different hydrological conditions on the temporal evolution of dic and δ13cdic greater insights into how and why different karst spring waters exhibit different chemical and isotopic behaviors are gained 5 2 dic δ13cdic evolution in karst spring waters with without aquatic plants metabolic process vs physical process vs chemical process fig 7 shows that as waters evolved to chemical equilibrium with atmospheric co2 for the waters with aquatic plants wt1 and wt2 the dic evolution is primarily controlled by metabolic processes photosynthesis and respiration of hydrilla verticillata during metabolism the dic loss by hydrilla verticillata was 200 mmol accounting for 42 and 210 mmol accounting for 44 in wt1 and wt2 respectively of which 225 mmol and 225 mmol of dic was used for photosynthesis while 25 mmol and 15 mmol dic were produced during the respiration of hydrilla verticillata in wt1 and wt2 respectively the secondary control on the dic evolution as the waters evolved to chemical equilibrium with atmospheric co2 is calcite precipitation dissolution where 95 mmol and 100 mmol dic were lost by calcite precipitation while 15 mmol and 25 mmol were produced by calcite dissolution in wt1 and wt2 respectively the third control on dic evolution is co2 outgassing where 75 mmol and 55 mmol co2 was released to the atmosphere as the waters evolved to chemical equilibrium with atmospheric co2 in wt1 and wt2 respectively in contrast as the waters without aquatic plants evolved to chemical equilibrium with atmospheric co2 the dic evolution was primarily controlled by co2 outgassing where 210 mmol accounting for 44 and 240 mmol accounting for 50 of co2 were released to the atmosphere from wt3 and wt4 respectively the dic evolution in these waters without aquatic plants was secondly controlled by calcite precipitation where 150 mmol and 190 mmol of dic were lost from wt3 and wt4 respectively as the waters evolved to chemical equilibrium with atmospheric co2 thus the sharp decrease in dic concentrations observed in wt1 and wt2 is primarily caused by the photosynthesis of hydrilla verticillata while the gentler loss in dic observed in wt3 and wt4 is caused by co2 outgassing and calcite precipitation similarly to dic evolution as shown in fig 7 and table s1 for karst spring waters with aquatic plants wt1 and wt2 the δ13cdic evolution is almost entirely controlled by the metabolic activities photosynthesis and respiration of hydrilla verticillata as a result the δ13cdic was enriched by 12 65 and 12 47 during photosynthesis and depleted by 0 82 and 1 78 during respiration in wt1 and wt2 respectively calcite precipitation dissolution and co2 outgassing show negligible effects on the δ13cdic evolution in these waters wt1 and wt2 in contrast for waters without aquatic plants as the waters evolved to isotopic equilibrium with atmospheric co2 the δ13cdic increased by 11 90 and 14 20 as a result of co2 outgassing and decreased by 2 80 and 5 10 due to calcite precipitation in wt3 and wt4 respectively thus the observed sharp increase in δ13cdic in wt1 and wt2 waters is primarily resulted from the photosynthesis of hydrilla verticillata while the slower increase in δ13cdic in wt3 and wt4 is entirely caused by co2 outgassing 5 3 dic δ13cdic evolution in the agitated static karst spring waters the results in fig 7 and table s1 show that not only are there differences in the rate of dic loss from the waters subject to different bio chemical treatments there is also a significant difference in the amount of dic loss due to different physical treatment either by agitation or static for agitated waters wt1 vs wt2 the water with aquatic plants wt1 lost 75 mmol dic 15 of the total dic 80 mmol dic 17 of the total dic and 200 mmol dic 42 of the total dic by outgassing calcite precipitation and photosynthesis respectively within 25 h while the static water wt2 treated with the same aquatic plants lost 55 mmol dic 11 of the total dic 75 mmol dic 16 of the total dic and 210 mmol dic 44 of the total dic by outgassing calcite precipitation and photosynthesis within 29 h respectively in other words our results suggest that the average rate of dic loss by the co2 evasion calcite precipitation and photosynthesis is about 3 0 mmol h 3 2 mmol h and 8 0 mmol h respectively for agitated turbulent karst spring water with aquatic plants and 1 9 mmol h 2 6 mmol h and 7 2 mmol h respectively for static lamina karst spring water with the same aquatic plants regarding waters without aquatic plants wt3 vs wt4 for the agitated water without the aquatic plants wt3 210 mmol dic 44 of the total dic and 150 mmol dic 31 of the total dic was lost to the atmosphere by outgassing and lost by calcite precipitation within 70 h respectively while in the static water without aquatic plants 240 mmol dic 50 of the total dic and 190 mmol dic 40 of the total dic wt4 was lost to the atmosphere by outgassing and by calcite precipitation after 330 h respectively in other words the average rate of dic loss by co2 evasion and calcite precipitation from agitated karst spring water without aquatic plants is about 3 0 mmol h and 2 1 mmol h respectively while the average rate of dic loss by co2 evasion is 0 7 mmol h and by calcite precipitation is 0 6 mmol h in static karst spring water without aquatic plants these results suggest that the agitation turbulence of water accelerates co2 evasion calcite precipitation and photosynthesis of aquatic plants hydrilla verticillata however as shown in table s1 and fig 7 although no obvious differences appear in the overall δ13cdic enrichment for the agitated and static karst spring waters with without aquatic plants there are marked differences in the timing of when the karst spring waters evolved to isotopic equilibrium with atmospheric co2 in the agitated and static karst spring waters the δ13cdic enrichment is faster in the agitated waters than that in the static waters indicating that the agitation turbulence of water may accelerate δ13cdic enrichment 6 implications our results show that dic produced from carbonate weathering can be used by aquatic organisms thereby converting it into oc this means that the view of carbon shifts that exclude sequestration during the transformation of weathered carbonate rock deposits curl 2012 could be revisited in order to factor in the proportion of dic from the weathered carbonate that is converted by aquatic plants through photosynthesis into organic carbon for possible long term sequestration by aquatic organisms rather than being released to the atmosphere as co2 in continental surface water systems or oceans furthermore as shown in fig 7 the significant flux of co2 from the atmosphere to the karst spring waters after they attain chemical equilibrium with atmospheric co2 suggest that intense aquatic photosynthetic activities in continental surface water systems could play an important role as a natural carbon sink drawing co2 directly from the atmosphere when there is not enough dic in the waters rivers and streams to maintain the normal metabolic rates of the aquatic organisms 7 conclusion at the laboratory scale the temporal evolutions of dic and δ13cdic in karst spring waters with high pco2 exposed to atmospheric co2 under agitated and static conditions with without aquatic plants were quantitatively assessed the controls on dic and δ13cdic of the karst spring waters during evolution to equilibrium with atmospheric co2 were deciphered results of the temporal behavior of dic and δ13cdic observed from the laboratory experiments could be applied to characterize carbon evolution in carbonate rich surface waters e g streams lakes and reservoirs evolving and interacting with the atmosphere dic evolution appears to be mainly controlled by the metabolism of aquatic plants 40 while calcite precipitation dissolution and co2 outgassing show little effects on the dic evolution in the karst spring waters with aquatic plants 20 the δ13cdic evolution is also mainly controlled by the metabolism of the aquatic plants while calcite precipitation dissolution and co2 outgassing have a lesser effect on the δ13cdic evolution in the karst spring

5757,karst waters spring fed streams lakes and reservoirs characterized by relatively high concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon dic and p co2 significantly impact regional and global carbon cycles by releasing carbon dioxide to the atmosphere investigating the transfer of dic from karst waters to the atmosphere is important to further our understanding of carbon cycling in karst environments there is still considerable uncertainty about the controls of dic transfer in karst waters because of challenges associated with investigations that aim to mimic the continuum of changes in dic concentrations to equilibrium with atmospheric co2 in natural settings laboratory simulations can create controlled conditions that allow targeted investigations in this study four tanks were taken to investigate the variations of pco2 dic and δ13cdic when karst spring waters were exposed to the atmosphere from 40 to 360 h as 1 agitated water containing hydrilla verticillata 2 static water containing hydrilla verticillata 3 agitated water without hydrilla verticillata and 4 static water without hydrilla verticillata the rates of photosynthesis respiration of submerged plants co2 outgassing and carbonate precipitation dissolution were quantified by a time stepping chemical isotopic mass balance model this experiment was designed to create ideal conditions to estimate the temporal evolution of dic and δ13cdic and investigate mechanisms that control their evolution when karst spring waters interact with atmospheric co2 results show 1 generally a steep decrease in dic concentrations and δ13cdic enrichment 2 dic loss and δ13cdic enrichment are faster in the agitated waters with submerged plants 3 dic evolution is mainly controlled by the metabolism of aquatic plants 4 carbonate precipitation dissolution and co2 outgassing has a lower effect on the dic evolution in waters with submerged plants 5 δ13cdic evolution is mainly controlled by the metabolism of submerged plants 6 co2 evasion photosynthesis and δ13cdic enrichment are accelerated by the agitation of waters our analyses show that more than 40 of the total dic resulting from carbonate weathering was used for photosynthesis by submerged aquatic plants thereby transforming the dic into organic carbon oc suggesting that intense aquatic photosynthetic activities in continental surface water systems could play an important role as natural carbon sinks keywords dissolved inorganic carbon stable carbon isotope biological process chemical process physical process karst spring waters atmosphere interaction 1 introduction continental waters such as rivers and streams are important links in the global carbon cycle long considered to be passive pipes and conduits in carbon budgets and weathered products of carbonate rocks schlesinger and melack 1981 however recent findings suggest an alternative view that the carbon discharged to the oceans is only a fraction of the total carbon entering rivers from terrestrial ecosystems most of the influx of carbon into rivers from soil respiration and physico chemical weathering is 1 returned to the atmosphere through degassing as co2 g before the rivers discharge into the ocean e g richey et al 2002 cole et al 2007 battin et al 2009 aufdenkampe et al 2011 striegl et al 2012 raymond et al 2013 due to the high co2 partial pressure p co2 in the rivers compared to atmospheric co2 and 2 sedimentary organic carbon oc buried in river deposits e g cole et al 2007 battin et al 2009 aufdenkampe et al 2011 that accumulates over thousands of years and may eventually lithify to constitute a relatively long term natural carbon sink current estimates suggest that 2 7 pg c year 1 of terrestrial c fluxes organic and inorganic carbon are exported to continental waters of which 1 2 pg c year 1 are released to the atmosphere 0 6 pg c year 1 are trapped in sediment and only 0 9 pg c year 1 are delivered to the world s oceans aufdenkampe et al 2011 however there remain large uncertainties on the magnitude of c fluxes in global continental waters cole et al 2007 battin et al 2009 aufdenkampe et al 2011 liu 2011 carbonate outcrops represent approximately 20 of the earth s ice free surface ford williams 2007 and their rapid dissolution by carbonic acid increases the amount of dissolved inorganic carbon dic species hco3 co3 2 h2co3 and co2 aq and calcium ions in karst ground and surface waters high concentrations of dic leading to a change in the pco2 in these karst waters e g in aquifers rivers streams reservoirs and lakes is a potential source for atmospheric co2 which could significantly impact the regional and ultimately the global carbon cycle liu 2011 martin 2017 thus to address the uncertainties of c fluxes in global continental waters it is necessary to investigate and assess the role of karst carbonate impacted surface water bodies like streams on dic evolution ultimately the transfer of dic from sediments and waters to the atmosphere depends on the processes and concentrations that are locally at play three principal processes that control dic and δ13cdic evolution in surface waters from karst spring waters are 1 physical water air exchange i e co2 g transfer to the atmosphere 2 geochemical reactions involving carbonate precipitation and or dissolution and 3 biogeochemical processes involving respiration and photosynthesis the extent of the effect of each process depends on hydrologic conditions e g recharge discharge flow velocity aquatic plant type and productivity residence time and ion saturation underlying geology climate and atmospheric conditions etc co2 g exchange is a physical flux driven by dic concentrations speciation reactions and relative the pco2 between water and the atmosphere surface waters with high dic concentrations and higher pco2 will lose co2 g to the atmosphere as the waters evolve towards chemical equilibrium with atmospheric co2 g as a result of co2 evasion increase the solubility of calcite leads to saturation and caco3 precipitation from the solution e g jacobson and usdowski 1975 dreybrodt et al 1992 metabolic reactions by submerged plants can force diel cycles of dic in waters especially in karst waters with high pco2 parker et al 2007 2010 de montety et al 2011 gray et al 2011 nimick et al 2011 tobias böhlke 2011 jiang et al 2013 peter et al 2014 liu et al 2015 chen et al 2017 pu et al 2017 calcite precipitation due to the joint effect of chemical and biological processes can be represented by eq 1 smith and gattuso 2011 1 ca 2 2 hco 3 caco 3 x ch 2 o o 2 1 x co 2 h 2 o thus in addition to being a source for atmospheric co2 high concentrations of dic and pco2 in karst waters can also be the c source for photosynthesis of submerged plants converting dic into organic carbon with time some of the organic carbon could eventually be buried and converted into autochthonous organic matter as a long term or permanent carbon sink cole et al 2007 einsele et al 2001 in these karst water systems the δ13cdic in the evolving dic waters will change because of the isotopic fractionation accompanying carbon loss gain degassing to the atmosphere calcite precipitation dissolution and carbon assimilation disassimilation during metabolism from the system e g clark and fritz 1997 parker et al 2007 tobias böhlke 2011 abongwa and atekwana 2013 2015 jiang et al 2013 khadka et al 2014 liu et al 2015 van geldern et al 2015 pu et al 2017 the resulting δ13cdic of the karst waters can thus be described by either kinetic or equilibrium isotope fractionation zhang et al 1995 although dic evolution in surface waters tends towards chemical and isotopic equilibrium with the atmosphere it is challenging especially in karst waters to map this kind of dic evolution these challenges result from complications due to the complexity of reaction pathways and large variations in field settings thus far isotopic disequilibrium appears to be the rule especially for field based investigations of karst waters to date laboratory experiments e g abongwa and atekwana 2013 2015 can provide near ideal ways to assess how the dic and δ13cdic of karst waters evolve to chemical and isotopic equilibrium with the atmosphere in this study the temporal evolutions of dic and δ13cdic were assessed in karst spring waters treated to different hydro biological conditions and exposed to attain equilibrium with the atmosphere in a laboratory setting the objectives are to 1 document how the dic and δ13cdic in karst spring waters exposed to atmospheric co2 g evolve under agitated and static conditions with without aquatic plants and 2 determine the effect of physical chemical and biological processes on the evolution of dic and δ13cdic in karst spring waters exposed to atmospheric co2 g 2 experimental design and methods 2 1 experimental design four tanks were prepared with different treatments to address the hydro biological conditions for investigation as follows two tanks with 465 g 2 5 g of contain a common submerged macrophyte in karst environments hydrilla verticillata e g sousa 2011 collected from an experimental pool on the campus of the southwest university and two other tanks treated with clo2 were mixed with 1 l of a 2 5 mg l clo2 solution to eliminate microbial activity one tank from each set treated with hydrilla verticillata and clo2 was subjected to agitation by continuously circulating the water at a rate of 14 l min using a submersible pump to simulate turbulent flow conditions and the other tanks were maintained under static conditions to simulate laminar flow or steady conditions table 1 unfiltered and untreated water was collected from chongqing qingmuguan karst spring 106 20 10 e 29 47 00 n around 8 00 a m on july 7th 2015 in 80 l tightly sealed headspace free tanks and transported within 15 min to the laboratory under laboratory conditions the water was transferred by pumping into four smaller 63 cm 45 cm acid pre washed plastic tanks wt1 wt2 wt3 and wt4 and immediately measured for physicochemical parameters the initial measurements of the unfiltered untreated water are reported in table 2 after initial measurements the water samples were then subjected to hydro biological and chemical treatments as shown in table 1 all four tanks were exposed under the same atmospheric conditions for the duration of the experiment by placing them on the roof of the building of the school of geographical sciences the duration of the experiments depended on the time required by each tank to reach chemical and isotopic equilibrium with atmospheric co2 g as a consequence the experiments lasted between 48 and 360 h depending on the time it took for the waters to reach chemical and isotopic equilibrium with atmospheric co2 g the experimental setup of the four tanks is shown in fig 1 2 2 measurements sampling and laboratory analyses 2 2 1 measurements two wtw

using four gmp22 carbon dioxide probes fitted with films that prevent water from entering the probes but allow co2 with a resolution of 1 ppmv in situ hco3 co3 2 and ca2 concentrations were determined by test kits using a titration pipette aquamerck with resolutions of 0 1 mmol l and 1 mg l respectively at 1 h intervals for the first 48 h the measurements and samplings of tanks wt1 and wt2 ended after 48 h measurements of hco3 co3 2 and ca2 ions were continued for tanks wt3 and wt4 until equilibrium was reached after 96 and 360 h respectively sampling intervals were determined from variations

an inductively coupled plasma optimal emission spectrometer icp oes with a resolution of 0 01 mg l at chongqing key laboratory of karst environment southwest university samples collected for δ13cdic measurements were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane to which 2 drops of a saturated solution of hgcl2 were added using the modified method by atekwana and krishnamurthy 1998 for stable carbon isotope analysis of dissolved inorganic carbon a 10 ml water sample was injected by syringe into glass bottles that were pre filled with 1 ml 85 phosphoric acid and magnetic stir bars the co2 in the samples was extracted and purified after cryogenic removal of h2o using a liquid nitrogen ethanol trap finally the extracted co2 was transferred cryogenically into a tube for isotope measurement the δ13cdic were measured by delta plus xl gas stable isotope mass spectrometry for the δ13cco2 of atmospheric gas samples were collected from the air around the tanks in the mornings and afternoons using an evacuated glass vessel from july 7 to 13 and measured by trace gas gas sample concentration system linked with an isoprime 100 mass spectrometer the hydrilla verticillata samples were ultrasonically cleaned for 15 min in deionized water and dried in an oven at 50 c for 48 h after drying the plant samples were ground into a powder form with diameters 150 μm to ensure homogeneity one to 2 mg of the powdered sample was placed into stannum cups for carbon isotope analysis the carbon isotopic compositions of hydrilla verticillata samples were determined using an elemental analyzer coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer ea irms the isotopic analyses were conducted in the environmental stable isotope laboratory of the chinese academy of agricultural sciences stable carbon isotope

data were recorded from a bs28 vp2 field weather station located at the experimental site parameters were measured at 15 min interval including air temperature solar radiation and evaporation rate the resolutions of the measurements were 0 5 c 5 and 0 25 mm respectively 3 data processing and analysis 3 1 preprocessing since ca2 and hco3 are the main ions in karst waters the time series of ca2 and hco3 concentrations were calculated from the linear relationship between the in situ titration data and logged data of spc table 3 the dic concentrations were calculated from the time series of hco3 co3 2 concentrations and logged data of pco2 3 2 determining dic loss by co2 evasion carbon dioxide fluxes across the water air interface were calculated using a molecular diffusion model raymond et

concentrations from calcite carbonate precipitation decreases ca2 and hco3 concentrations by a ratio of 1 2 mol and simultaneously releases 1 mol of co2 aq into solution and conversely carbonate dissolution increases ca2 and hco3 concentrations by a ratio of 1 2 mol and remove 1 mol of co2 aq from the solution thus the dic loss by calcite precipitation or gain by calcite dissolution were calculated from the changes in ca2 concentrations and molar ratio between ca2 and hco3 concentrations 3 4 determining changes in dic from the metabolism of hydrilla verticillata the biologically generated dic was obtained from the gross primary productivity gpp and respiration rates r through variations in do concentrations hotchkiss and hall 2014 tobias et al 2007 gpp and r were calculated

respiration rate at night t and taverage are the observed water temperature and the average value of water temperature c respectively the gpp can be calculated from the mass balance of do concentrations the dic affected by the metabolism of hydrilla verticillata can be estimated based on c o2 molar stoichiometry 1 1 del giorgio and williams 2005 3 5 estimated magnitudes of δ13cdic variations the contributions of biological chemical and physical processes to variations in δ13cdic were calculated using a time stepping chemical isotope 12c and 13c mass balance model tobias and böhlke 2011 based on the dic loss gain the model requires 1 the initial δ13c values of the dic from the karst spring water table 2 hydrilla verticillata and atmospheric co2 table 4 2 the isotope

respectively the δ13cdic values were calculated from the modeled 12c and 13c molar concentrations according to the relation 5 δ 13 c dic 13 c 12 c 89 45 1 where 89 45 is the molar ratio of 12c 13c in the vpdb isotopic reference coplen et al 2002 3 6 equilibrium values of dic and δ13cdic for the duration of the experiments atmospheric pco2 varied between 350 ppmv and 500 ppmv with a mean value of 410 ppmv table 2 and δ13cco2 varied between 8 0 and 11 9 with a mean value of 9 9 table 4 the stable carbon isotope fractionation between dic and co2 g is about 8 4 at 25 c zhang et al 1995 therefore the pco2 and δ13cdic in karst waters that achieve chemical and isotopic equilibrium with atmospheric co2 g will be around 410 ppmv and 1 5 0 4 to 3 5 respectively 4 results 4 1 temporal variations of

ppmv during the night the pco2 continued to decline gradually to 410 ppmv after 70 h and then slowly to 300 ppmv to the end of the experiment the δ13cdic of wt3 fig 3g showed a different temporal

decreased from 117 mg l to 60 mg l and dic decreased from 330 mg l to 145 mg l and then remained more or less stable until the end of experiment the pco2 in wt4 fig 4f decreased steeply from 16 500 ppmv to 5000 ppmv during the first 36 h and then gradually to 1400 ppmv after 144 h the pco2 continued to decrease slowly to 1000 ppmv by the 192 h and then to 410 ppmv after 330 h and then stabilized

spring waters exposed to the atmosphere the dic concentrations and δ13cdic in treated karst spring waters with different hydro biological conditions exposed to the same atmosphere exhibit different temporal chemical and isotopic behaviors figs 5 and 6 and table s1 although the dic concentrations and δ13cdic in all karst spring waters reached chemical and isotopic equilibrium with atmospheric co2 fig 2e 2 g 3e 3 g 4e and 4 g dic loss and δ13cdic enrichment are faster in waters that contained hydrilla verticillata wt1 and wt2 than in waters without hydrilla verticillata wt3 and wt4 dic loss and δ13cdic enrichment are faster in agitated waters than in static waters wt1 vs wt2 and wt3 vs wt4 it took 25 h and 26 h for the agitated water with hydrilla verticillata wt1 and 29 h and 30 h for the static water with hydrilla verticillata wt2 to reach chemical and isotopic equilibrium with atmospheric co2 respectively meanwhile it took more time 70 h and 96 h for the agitated water without hydrilla verticillata wt3 and 330 h and 360 h for the static water without hydrilla verticillata wt4 to reach chemical and isotopic equilibrium with atmospheric co2 respectively since all the waters were obtained from the same karst spring source and had similar initial dic concentrations and δ13cdic values and were all exposed to the same laboratory atmosphere the different temporal response and chemical and isotopic behaviors of the waters as they attained equilibrium could be attributed to differences in hydro biological conditions of the treated waters thus such significant differences in the temporal evolution of dic and δ13cdic in karst spring waters exposed to the atmosphere is primarily related to the effects of the aquatic plants and also of the water agitation with these observations we show that by evaluating the effects of different processes physical chemical and biological under different hydrological conditions on the temporal evolution of dic and δ13cdic greater insights into how and why different karst spring waters exhibit different chemical and isotopic behaviors are gained 5 2 dic δ13cdic evolution in karst spring waters with without aquatic plants metabolic process vs physical process vs chemical process fig 7 shows that as waters evolved to chemical equilibrium with atmospheric co2 for the waters with aquatic plants wt1 and wt2 the dic evolution is primarily controlled by metabolic processes photosynthesis and respiration of hydrilla verticillata during metabolism the dic loss by hydrilla verticillata was 200 mmol accounting for 42 and 210 mmol accounting for 44 in wt1 and wt2 respectively of which 225 mmol and 225 mmol of dic was used for photosynthesis while 25 mmol and 15 mmol dic were produced during the respiration of hydrilla verticillata in wt1 and wt2 respectively the secondary control on the dic evolution as the waters evolved to chemical equilibrium with atmospheric co2 is calcite precipitation dissolution where 95 mmol and 100 mmol dic were lost by calcite precipitation while 15 mmol and 25 mmol were produced by calcite dissolution in wt1 and wt2 respectively the third control on dic evolution is co2 outgassing where 75 mmol and 55 mmol co2 was released to the atmosphere as the waters evolved to chemical equilibrium with atmospheric co2 in wt1 and wt2 respectively in contrast as the waters without aquatic plants evolved to chemical equilibrium with atmospheric co2 the dic evolution was primarily controlled by co2 outgassing where 210 mmol accounting for 44 and 240 mmol accounting for 50 of co2 were released to the atmosphere from wt3 and wt4 respectively the dic evolution in these waters without aquatic plants was secondly controlled by calcite precipitation where 150 mmol and 190 mmol of dic were lost from wt3 and wt4 respectively as the waters evolved to chemical equilibrium with atmospheric co2 thus the sharp decrease in dic concentrations observed in wt1 and wt2 is primarily caused by the photosynthesis of hydrilla verticillata while the gentler loss in dic observed in wt3 and wt4 is caused by co2 outgassing and calcite precipitation similarly to dic evolution as shown in fig 7 and table s1 for karst spring waters with aquatic plants wt1 and wt2 the δ13cdic evolution is almost entirely controlled by the metabolic activities photosynthesis and respiration of hydrilla verticillata as a result the δ13cdic was enriched by 12 65 and 12 47 during photosynthesis and depleted by 0 82 and 1 78 during respiration in wt1 and wt2 respectively calcite precipitation dissolution and co2 outgassing show negligible effects on the δ13cdic evolution in these waters wt1 and wt2 in contrast for waters without aquatic plants as the waters evolved to isotopic equilibrium with atmospheric co2 the δ13cdic increased by 11 90 and 14 20 as a result of co2 outgassing and decreased by 2 80 and 5 10 due to calcite precipitation in wt3 and wt4 respectively thus the observed sharp increase in δ13cdic in wt1 and wt2 waters is primarily resulted from the photosynthesis of hydrilla verticillata while the slower increase in δ13cdic in wt3 and wt4 is entirely caused by co2 outgassing 5 3 dic δ13cdic evolution in the agitated static karst spring waters the results in fig 7 and table s1 show that not only are there differences in the rate of dic loss from the waters subject to different bio chemical treatments there is also a significant difference in the amount of dic loss due to different physical treatment either by agitation or static for agitated waters wt1 vs wt2 the water with aquatic plants wt1 lost 75 mmol dic 15 of the total dic 80 mmol dic 17 of the total dic and 200 mmol dic 42 of the total dic by outgassing calcite precipitation and photosynthesis respectively within 25 h while the static water wt2 treated with the same aquatic plants lost 55 mmol dic 11 of the total dic 75 mmol dic 16 of the total dic and 210 mmol dic 44 of the total dic by outgassing calcite precipitation and photosynthesis within 29 h respectively in other words our results suggest that the average rate of dic loss by the co2 evasion calcite precipitation and photosynthesis is about 3 0 mmol h 3 2 mmol h and 8 0 mmol h respectively for agitated turbulent karst spring water with aquatic plants and 1 9 mmol h 2 6 mmol h and 7 2 mmol h respectively for static lamina karst spring water with the same aquatic plants regarding waters without aquatic plants wt3 vs wt4 for the agitated water without the aquatic plants wt3 210 mmol dic 44 of the total dic and 150 mmol dic 31 of the total dic was lost to the atmosphere by outgassing and lost by calcite precipitation within 70 h respectively while in the static water without aquatic plants 240 mmol dic 50 of the total dic and 190 mmol dic 40 of the total dic wt4 was lost to the atmosphere by outgassing and by calcite precipitation after 330 h respectively in other words the average rate of dic loss by co2 evasion and calcite precipitation from agitated karst spring water without aquatic plants is about 3 0 mmol h and 2 1 mmol h respectively while the average rate of dic loss by co2 evasion is 0 7 mmol h and by calcite precipitation is 0 6 mmol h in static karst spring water without aquatic plants these results suggest that the agitation turbulence of water accelerates co2 evasion calcite precipitation and photosynthesis of aquatic plants hydrilla verticillata however as shown in table s1 and fig 7 although no obvious differences appear in the overall δ13cdic enrichment for the agitated and static karst spring waters with without aquatic plants there are marked differences in the timing of when the karst spring waters evolved to isotopic equilibrium with atmospheric co2 in the agitated and static karst spring waters the δ13cdic enrichment is faster in the agitated waters than that in the static waters indicating that the agitation turbulence of water may accelerate δ13cdic enrichment 6 implications our results show that dic produced from carbonate weathering can be used by aquatic organisms thereby converting it into oc this means that the view of carbon shifts that exclude sequestration during the transformation of weathered carbonate rock deposits curl 2012 could be revisited in order to factor in the proportion of dic from the weathered carbonate that is converted by aquatic plants through photosynthesis into organic carbon for possible long term sequestration by aquatic organisms rather than being released to the atmosphere as co2 in continental surface water systems or oceans furthermore as shown in fig 7 the significant flux of co2 from the atmosphere to the karst spring waters after they attain chemical equilibrium with atmospheric co2 suggest that intense aquatic photosynthetic activities in continental surface water systems could play an important role as a natural carbon sink drawing co2 directly from the atmosphere when there is not enough dic in the waters rivers and streams to maintain the normal metabolic rates of the aquatic organisms 7 conclusion at the laboratory scale the temporal evolutions of dic and δ13cdic in karst spring waters with high pco2 exposed to atmospheric co2 under agitated and static conditions with without aquatic plants were quantitatively assessed the controls on dic and δ13cdic of the karst spring waters during evolution to equilibrium with atmospheric co2 were deciphered results of the temporal behavior of dic and δ13cdic observed from the laboratory experiments could be applied to characterize carbon evolution in carbonate rich surface waters e g streams lakes and reservoirs evolving and interacting with the atmosphere dic evolution appears to be mainly controlled by the metabolism of aquatic plants 40 while calcite precipitation dissolution and co2 outgassing show little effects on the dic evolution in the karst spring waters with aquatic plants 20 the δ13cdic evolution is also mainly controlled by the metabolism of the aquatic plants while calcite precipitation dissolution and co2 outgassing have a lesser effect on the δ13cdic evolution in the karst spring

5758,poiseuille flow was widely assumed in the analysis of fluid flow in porous media due to its simple form it can describe the flow behavior at creeping flow conditions very well however errors were reported in the literature by the use of this parabolic velocity profile in some dynamic circumstances the effect of velocity profiles on the capillary flow was discussed in this study when oscillation forcing was applied to the flow an example of the response of nonwetting droplets to the oscillation forcing in a constricted capillary was analyzed the velocity profiles of poiseuille flow starting flow and oscillatory flow were used in this analysis for a comparison the easiness of implementing these velocity profiles in the theoretical analysis is in this order poiseuille flow starting flow and oscillatory flow but the accuracy is in the order oscillatory flow starting flow and poiseuille flow by using theoretical approach we quantified the dimensionless numbers at which the velocity profile of poiseuille flow profile can be used to approximate the velocity profiles of starting flow or oscillatory flow the sensitivity of the viscosity ratio was also discussed in this study when certain conditions of the dimensionless numbers are met the use of the velocity profile of poiseuille flow can be justified even though the flow is in a dynamic condition otherwise the approximation by using poiseuille flow could cause significant errors when the flow is subjected to oscillation forcing keywords oscillation forcing flow profiles poiseuille flow starting flow oscillatory flow two phase flow 1 introduction the velocity profile of flow is a key factor to quantify the flow and transport such as in the hydrogeology environmental remediation vadose zone ecology and oil recovery in current theoretical and numerical studies of the flow in porous media the poiseuille flow was widely assumed for its effectiveness and simple form fries and dreyer 2008 keller et al 2004 may et al 2012 moebius and or 2014a moebius and or 2014b quéré 1997 taherzadeh et al 2012 wang et al 2012 the underlying assumption of this parabolic velocity profile is that the flow is fully developed laminar flow this assumption however becomes invalid in some circumstances when the inertial force dominates the flow for example in the initial stage of the imbibition at the unsaturated condition the inertial force mainly controls the motion of invading fluids alava et al 2004 zhmud et al 2000 in addition when an invading fluid passes through the pore throat in porous media haines jumps morrow 1970 could occur and the pressure was observed to fluctuate rapidly due to the acceleration of invading fluid the parabolic profile of poiseuille flow is invalid in this circumstance moebius and or 2014a moebius and or 2014b oscillatory flow is ubiquitous in the subsurface porous media and very likely to be inertia dominated seismic waves induced by earthquake or volcanic eruption were found to oscillate the stationary fluid and mobilize the entrapped non wetting droplet in nearby formation layers elkhoury et al 2006 elkhoury et al 2011 geballe et al 2011 manga et al 2012 flow field under oscillation forcing may not be able to be approximated by fully developed velocity profile tidal flow in estuarine environments and continental slopes causes the oscillatory behavior of fluid flow in the wetland pawlak and maccready 2002 xin et al 2013 gravity wave on the free water surface produces a variety of oscillatory flow inside bed forms and ripples in rivers and lakes best 2005 bridge and best 1988 in barometric pumping the barometric pressure variation causes oscillatory flow of gas and expedites the extraction of entrapped gas and contaminants in fractured rock or partially saturated soil neeper 2001 nilson et al 1991 the transpiration of plants induces oscillatory flow of water in the partially saturated soil near the roots of the plants cowan 1972 wallach et al 2010 the pumping test in the aquifer causes oscillation of water table leading to oscillatory flow in the vadose zone cardiff et al 2013 the engineered blows on the surface also cause perturbation of the flow in the subsurface naudascher and rockwell 1994 in all of these cases inertial force dominated the flow and thus the assumption of the parabolic profile could be inappropriate in the theoretical analysis among these oscillatory flow phenomena the dynamic motion of non wetting droplets in response to the oscillatory forcing was taken as an example in this paper for the analysis of the effect of the velocity profile compared to expensive computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations the theoretical method was generally preferred for the analysis of the generalized oscillatory motion of the droplet by taking the advantage of rapid computation and deep insight of the mechanism beresnev 2006 beresnev and deng 2010 deng and cardenas 2013 hilpert 2007 iassonov and beresnev 2008 the profile of poiseuille flow was generally used for developing the theoretical models for its simplicity but the suitability of using poiseuille flow as an approximation in the theoretical analysis were not quantitatively elaborated this paper aims to quantitatively investigate the effect of the flow profile on the flow subjected to oscillation forcing by implementing three different velocity profiles including the poiseuille flow starting flow and oscillatory flow into the physics based theoretical model and comparing theoretical results with the results of cfd simulation the starting flow is referred to the developing laminar flow in the tube the condition of using the appropriate velocity profile with suitable choice of corresponding dimensionless number will be clarified through the theoretical work by considering both the accuracy and the easiness of implementation of the velocity profile into the theoretical analysis of hydrologic problems this paper is organized as the following in section 2 the shape of three different velocity profiles with corresponding dimensionless numbers was compared in section 3 the theoretical model was derived to describe the response of the non wetting droplet to the oscillation forcing in a constricted tube in section 4 the theoretical results with implementation of three different velocity profiles in the model were compared with the results of cfd simulations in section 5 the effect of the absolute viscosity and the viscosity ratio of two phase fluids was taken into consideration of the comparison of the theoretical results by using three different velocity profiles in section 6 the main points of this study were summarized and potential applications for hydrological problems were discussed briefly 2 comparison of flow profiles in the theoretical and numerical analysis of pore scale fluid flow in porous media certain flow profiles could be assumed to simplify the analysis among these flow profiles the poiseuille flow profile was widely used in the analysis of laminar flow regime and such an assumption can have a good accuracy in most cases however when the flow has a rapid change of the velocity the flow rate can be significantly overestimated by assuming the parabolic velocity profile of poiseuille flow which is based on a fully developed laminar flow situation in the situation of the rapid change of the velocity the inertia effect in the flow profile cannot be neglected and the plug like velocity profile is more realistic than the parabolic velocity profile the error of theoretical analysis of the flow could be reduced by using more accurate flow profiles in this study three flow velocity profiles including poiseuille flow starting flow and oscillatory flow were compared and evaluated by applying these velocity profiles in the oscillatory flow analysis to generalize the various conditions of pressure gradient the pressure gradient imposed on the fluid was assumed to be in the form as follows 1 p p s i n 2 π f t φ where p is the amplitude of the oscillatory pressure gradient f is the frequency of the oscillatory pressure gradient and we assumed the frequency as zero when the pressure gradient was constant in this study φ is the phase of the oscillatory pressure gradient t is the oscillatory time of the driving pressure gradient the velocity profile of the poiseuille flow with oscillatory pressure gradient can be given by 2 v r t p s i n 2 π f t φ 4 μ r 2 r 2 where μ is the dynamic viscosity of fluid r is the radius of circular tube r is the radial distance from the centerline the velocity profile of the starting flow was also considered in this analysis the velocity profile in the starting flow regime in a circular tube is szymanski 1932 3 v r t p s i n 2 π f t φ r 2 4 μ 1 r 2 r 2 m 0 8 j 0 λ m r r λ m 3 j 1 λ m e λ m 2 β where j0 and j1 are the bessel functions of the first kind of order zero and one respectively λm is the m th zero of j0 β μ ρ r 2 t s is the dimensionless number controlling the shape of flow profile where ts is the time for the velocity to develop for the unsteady flow due to a suddenly imposed pressure gradient and ρ is the density of the fluid when β 0 the flow is inertia dominated when β the flow is viscous dominated the velocity profile of the oscillatory flow in circular tube under the oscillatory pressure gradient is womersley 1955 4 v r t r e a l p 2 π f ρ 1 j 0 i 3 2 r ξ j 0 i 3 2 α e i 2 π f t φ where i is the imaginary number ξ μ 2 π f ρ is the penetration depth boundary layer thickness in the oscillatory pressure gradient landau and lifshitz 1985 the operator real is to take the real part of a complex number α r ξ is a dimensionless number which is usually used to characterize the velocity profile of the oscillatory flow representing a ratio of inertial force to viscous force when α is small i e α 1 it means the frequency of the oscillation is sufficiently low that a parabolic velocity profile has time to develop during each oscillation cycle when α is large i e α 10 it means the frequency of oscillation is sufficiently high that the velocity profile is relatively flat or plug like in the central part of the cross section of the tube to better compare the velocity profile effect the normalized velocity as the ratio of transient velocity to mean velocity was used to show their difference the normalized velocity for the poiseuille flow is 5 v v 2 1 r 2 r 2 where the v is the mean velocity of the poiseuille flow the normalized velocity for the starting flow is 6 v v 2 1 r 2 r 2 m 1 8 j 0 r λ m r λ m 3 j 1 λ m e λ m 2 β 1 32 m 1 e λ m 2 β λ m 4 the normalized velocity for the oscillatory flow is 7 v v r e a l j 0 i 3 2 α r r j 0 i 3 2 α j 2 i 3 2 α the comparison of these normalized velocity profiles are shown in fig 1 fig 1a shows that the velocity profile gradually changes from a plug like shape to a parabolic shape as β increases for the starting flow as shown in eq 3 β characterizes the dimensionless time for the flow to fully develop the larger β is the velocity profile is more like parabolic shape plug like profile i e when β 0 01 in the central part of the tube indicates that the fluid at this stage is like an inertia mass which is not affected by the viscous force from the wall this profile shape change can also be observed for the oscillatory flow in fig 1b as α increases the central plug like region becomes wider correspondingly the viscous region is constrained to a small region near the wall and the shear stress at the wall increases the plug like velocity profile can cause larger viscous dissipation compared to the parabolic velocity profile at the same flow rate it is noted that we did not consider the effect of the time factor of the oscillatory pressure gradient i e p p s i n 2 π f t φ on the velocity profiles presented in fig 1 because the time factor in eqs 6 and 7 was cancelled out by the normalization the evolution of velocity profiles by incorporating the time factor of oscillatory pressure gradient is presented in fig 2 the ϕ 2πft φ represents the phase of the oscillatory pressure gradient which is a function of the time of the oscillation the phase of the oscillatory pressure gradient varies from 0 to 2π in one period the transient velocity profile in one period is presented fig 2 the blue curve in fig 2a 1 denotes the oscillatory pressure gradient in one period the velocity profiles of the poiseuille flow starting flow and oscillatory flow are displayed in the order in fig 2a 2 4 the velocity profiles were normalized by the maximum absolute value of the velocity of the poiseuille flow for all three graphs for a better comparison in this study the velocity profiles at positive pressure gradient head towards left and the velocity profile head towards right at negative pressure gradient the velocity profile of the poiseuille flow in fig 2a 2 is in phase with negative pressure gradient the velocity profile of the starting flow in fig 2a 3 has little difference from that of the poiseuille flow and the maximum magnitude of the velocity in the starting flow is less than that in the poiseuille flow which can be expected from fig 1a the change of the velocity profile for the starting flow keeps the same phase as the change of the pressure gradient for the velocity profile of the oscillatory flow the velocity at ϕ 0 is nonzero there is a bit of phase shift compared to other two velocity profiles it is noted that the velocity profiles in fig 2 do not start from the initial static state but from an arbitrary selected state of the oscillating flow the velocity profiles of the oscillatory flow with changing α are presented in fig 2b the velocity profiles at these three α were normalized by the maximum absolute value of the velocity for each α which was different from the velocity normalization by the maximum absolute value of the velocity of the poiseuille flow in fig 2a 2 4 with increasing α the inertial force becomes dominant in the central part of the flow while the viscous force is dominant at the wall boundary in fig 2b 2 4 it is noted that the direction of velocity at the wall could be different from the direction of velocity in the central part of the flow since the flow at the wall is viscous dominated the phase change of the velocity at the wall keeps the same as that of the oscillation forcing however since the flow in the central part is inertia dominated the phase change of the velocity in the central part of the flow has the phase lag compared to the oscillatory pressure gradient with the increase of α the velocity profile in the central part of the flow becomes flatter as it is shown in fig 2b 4 3 mobilization of the nonwetting droplet by wall vibration the mobilization of the nonwetting droplet by the seismic excitation can be a good example to analyze the effect of velocity profiles on the oscillatory flow in porous media the nonwetting droplets could be trapped at pore throats by the capillary force seismicity was demonstrated to be an efficient way to unplug trapped droplets and enhance the permeability of geologic formations the seismic excitation is equivalent to imposing an oscillatory body force on the fluid system by using the wall as a reference frame the parameters of the seismic excitation such as the acceleration amplitude and excited frequency are important to unplug the droplet specifically the effect of velocity profiles on the critical mobilization amplitude for the droplet mobilization at different exited frequencies was analyzed in following section the physics based theoretical model was preferred for this comparison and hence was established to implement this comparison in this section 3 1 model geometry a capillary trapped nonwetting droplet in an axisymmetric sinusoidally constricted tube was considered in this analysis fig 3 the radius of the tube profile follows the equation 8 λ x r max l 1 x l r min r max r min 1 2 1 r max r min 1 c o s π x l l x l r max l x l 2 where rmin and rmax are the minimum and the maximum radii of the tube respectively l 1 and l 2 are the entrance and exit of the tube respectively 2l is the spatial wavelength of the sinusoidally curved portion in fig 3 h and x 0 are axial positions at the downstream and upstream three phase contact line respectively pw 1 and pw 2 are the pressure exerted on the entrance and exit of the tube for the wetting fluid respectively the external pressure gradient in fig 3 is from left to the right therefore we defined the left side as upstream and right side as downstream we further defined the narrowest part of the tube as the throat such a simplified capillary tube model was commonly considered before beresnev and deng 2010 deng and cardenas 2013 gauglitz and radke 1989 graham and higdon 2000a 3 2 initially stationary state the droplet is trapped in the constriction as shown in fig 3 the flow in the tube is therefore blocked by the droplet the external pressure drop balances the capillary difference between two menisci of the droplet the capillary pressure across the interface of immiscible fluids can be calculated based on the young laplace equation in the calculation of the capillary pressure the perfect wetting of tube wall was assumed in this study to calculate the capillary pressure the radius of the curvature of the tube wall can be calculated by 9 λ w x λ x 1 λ 2 x the position of downstream contact line lies in the constricted segment of tube as shown in fig 3 when the droplet is long enough the upstream contact line can be located in the flat segment of the tube due to the perfect wetting assumption the capillary pressure at downstream and upstream menisci can be calculated respectively as 10 p c h 2 σ λ w h 11 p c x 0 2 σ λ w x 0 where σ is the interfacial tension between nonwetting and wetting fluids in this study then the force balance equation at initially stationary state is 12 p w 1 p w 2 p c h p c x 0 this equation only holds at the stationary state when the droplet is at the mobile state it cannot be used as seen in following analysis 3 3 transient state when the oscillatory forcing is excited the droplet starts to move the transient motion of the nonwetting droplet can be described by the macroscopic momentum balance equation the flow was assumed to be axisymmetric and have only longitudinal velocity component by using the lubrication approximation in this study the axial component of the momentum balance equation is 13 ρ n d dt v v n d v f x f p f a p nu a u p nd a d where the left hand side denotes the rate of the change of momentum within the control volume v ρn is the density of the nonwetting fluid and v n is the cross sectional mean velocity of the nonwetting droplet on the right hand side fx fp fa pnuau and pndad are viscous drag the pressure force along the tube wall the oscillatory fictitious force the entrance force due to pressure and the exit force due to pressure respectively pnu and pnd are the pressure at the upstream and downstream menisci of the nonwetting fluid and au and ad are the cross sectional areas at the three phase contact line for the upstream and downstream menisci of the nonwetting fluid in this model the acceleration of vibrating tube was assumed to be monochromatic 14 a t a s i n 2 π f t where t is the vibrating time a is the acceleration amplitude the viscous pressure gradient in the nonwetting phase and wetting phase are pk t k n w the overall pressure gradient on the nonwetting and wetting fluid is 15 p sin 2 π f t φ p k t ρ k a t where p is the amplitude of the overall pressure gradient k n denotes nonwetting fluid and k w denotes wetting fluid φ 0 holds in this scenario since the external body force and viscous pressure gradient are in phase in the derivation of the momentum balance equation three velocity profiles as shown in eqs 2 4 were used respectively as the transient velocity formula in the substitution the radius r was replaced by λ x at here the lubrication approximation was used for the velocity profile at the constricted part of the tube for the dimensionless numbers both α and β characterize the relative thickness of the viscous layer near the wall within which the flow is viscous dominated in the calculation of β the time t s for the flow to develop was needed as the input since the flow is oscillatory in this study the longest time for the flow to develop without change the direction of the velocity is one half of the vibration period which is 1 2 f in our study of the velocity profile of the starting flow we chose to set t s 1 2 f and develop the velocity profile of the starting flow as much as possible to track the motion of the oscillatory droplet the transient position of the downstream contact line h was used therefore all terms in eq 13 can be expressed as a function of h in the following derivation of force components on the droplet the velocity for three profiles in the derivation are symbolically represented by vk k n w when k n it denotes vk is the velocity of the nonwetting phase when k w it denotes vk is the velocity of the wetting phase the volumetric rate at axial position h is 16 q π λ 2 h dh dt where dh dt represents the mean velocity at the position of h the volumetric flow rate is the same at arbitrary cross section of the tube therefore the mean velocity can also be formulated as 17 v k x λ 2 h λ 2 x dh dt the control volume v of the droplet has three parts left semi spherical cap middle cylinder and right spherical cap see fig 1 eq 17 is used for integration to obtain the momentum of the nonwetting phase the rate change of momentum in the control volume v can be calculated as 18 ρ n d dt v v n d v π ρ n λ 2 h h x 0 2 3 λ x 0 λ h d 2 h d t 2 π ρ n λ 2 h 1 λ 2 h λ 2 x 0 dh dt 2 the viscous force in the droplet is the integration of the shear stress along the peripheral area 19 f x x 0 h μ d v n dt 2 π λ x d x by substituting the flow profiles into equation 19 the formula of viscous force becomes 20 f x 2 π λ 2 h ψ 1 h dh dt where function ψ1 x is defined to generally incorporate three different velocity profiles the form is presented in appendix a along the convergent wall surface there is also resisting pressure force due to axisymmetric geometry the radial component is cancelled out and only the longitudinal component acts on the droplet effectively this component of pressure force along the wall surface can be calculated by gauglitz and radke 1989 21 f p x 0 h p x 2 π λ x d λ x where p x is the pressure distribution in the droplet it can be calculated by 22 p x p nu x 0 x p n d x the pressure gradient in the nonwetting droplet p n is embedded in the total pressure gradient seen eq 15 combing eqs 16 and 22 the pressure distribution is 23 p x p nu λ 2 h dh dt ψ 2 x 0 x ρ n a t x x 0 where function ψ 2 x 0 x is defined differently from other functions and it is a finite integral this definition can largely simplify the expression of the final governing equation by substituting eq 23 into eq 21 the form of the pressure force along the wall is 24 f p π p nu λ 2

force in the fluid system biot 1956 therefore the oscillatory body force is 27 f a ρ n a t ψ 4 h for the entrance force pnuau and exit force pndad the pnu and pnd can firstly be calculated by the pressure relation 28 p nu l 1 x 0 p w d x p w 1 p c x 0 29 p nd h l 2 p w d x p w 2 p c h the integrations in eqs 28 and 29 can be calculated in the same way as eq 22 then the entrance and exit forces

the final governing equation is 32 ρ n h x 0 2 3 λ x 0 λ h d 2 h d t 2 ρ n 1 λ 2 h λ 2 x 0 dh dt 2 2 ψ 1 h dh dt p w 1 p w 2 p c h p c x 0 λ 2 h dh dt ψ 2 l 1 x 0 ψ 2 h l 2 2 dh dt ψ 3 h ρ n a t h x 0 ρ w a t x 0 l 1 l 2 h the specific forms of ψ 1 h ψ 2 l 1 x 0 ψ 2 x 0 h and ψ 2 h l 2 are given in the appendix a ψ 3 h refers to eq 25 it is noted that eq 32 is the dynamics of downstream meniscus subjected to the harmonic vibration by using three different velocity profiles the differences in three velocity profiles are implicit in the forms of ψ 1 h ψ 2 l 1 x 0 ψ 2 h l 2 ψ 2 x 0 h and ψ 3 h 3 4 numerical solution procedure the governing eq 32 is a second order nonlinear ordinary differential equation a fourth order runge kutta method was used to numerically solve this initial value problem the initial condition is from section 3 2 at initially stationary state the position of the downstream contact line can be determined by eq 12 because the upstream contact line is assumed to locate in the flat segment the position of the upstream contact line determines the initial length of the droplet therefore the initial conditions are given by 33 h 0 ε 34 x 0 0 δ 35 d h 0 dt 0 where δ and ε are initial positions of upstream and downstream contact lines respectively the dynamics of downstream position h can be calculated by solving eq 32 numerically the variation of upstream position x0 within the same time step was calculated by maintaining the volume conservation of the droplet the bisection method was used to find x0 in addition the adaptive scheme was used in the selection of time step to reduce computational time 4 comparison of theoretical models and cfd simulations the comparison of theoretical models with cfd simulations was performed to evaluate the effect of the velocity profile on the flow subjected to oscillation forcing the theoretical model has three variants corresponding to three velocity profiles the oscillatory displacement of the downstream meniscus is proportional to the acceleration amplitude of the excitation when the acceleration amplitude of the excitation is beyond a critical value at certain frequency the droplet can pass through the throat of the tube we defined this critical value of the amplitude of acceleration as the critical mobilization amplitude which was denoted as ac due to the nonlinear characteristic of the governing equation ac is a nonlinear function of fluid properties the dimensionless numbers α and β are also a function of fluid properties the comparison of theoretical models with cfd simulations was made on the critical mobilization amplitude firstly the cfd method we used was introduced then the comparison on ac was made 4 1 cfd simulations the finite volume method was used directly to solve the navier stokes equations for two phase flow by using the cfd software fluent for a comparison with the theoretical model guide 2011 the navier stokes equations were solved to describe dynamics of individual flow 36 ρ t v ρ v v p μ v v t f v 0 where v is the velocity vector ρ is the density of fluid μ is the viscosity of fluid p is the static pressure f is the body force the volume of fluid vof method was used to describe two phase flow based on the vof method the ρ and μ in 36 are the volume fraction averaged density and viscosity in each cell the body force in this study is the sum of volumetric surface force and oscillatory body force 37 f σ κ α n ρ a t where κ is the curvature of the interface αn is the volume fraction of the nonwetting phase because only volume fraction of secondary phase was solved in vof the nonwetting fluid was set as the secondary phase and marked as 1 in this simulation 4 2 comparison on the critical mobilization amplitude to make this comparison specific fluid properties and geometric parameters should be used the pore geometry and initial position of the trapped droplet are shown in fig 3 the rmax and rmin in the profile eq 8 are 2 mm and 0 5 mm respectively the half wavelength l is 10 mm for the constricted part the total length of the pore is l 2 l 1 40 mm the initial position of three phase contact lines at downstream and upstream are ε 0 5 mm and δ 15 mm respectively the fluid properties are σ 0 05 n m μn 0 01 pa s μw 0 001 pa s ρn 1000 kg m3 and ρw 1000 kg m3 the comparison was made at frequencies 0 hz 5 hz 10 hz 15 hz 20 hz 40 hz 50 hz and 100 hz the foregoing fluid properties and geometric parameters were used in both theoretical models and cfd simulations at each of these frequencies the critical mobilization amplitude can be obtained by increasing the acceleration amplitude gradually until the droplet became mobilized the accuracy of critical mobilization amplitude was in the order of 0 1 m s2 therefore by following this procedure it took long time in days to obtain one critical value at one frequency by conducting cfd simulations however it was much more efficient in minutes by using the theoretical model to calculate the critical mobilization amplitude it demonstrated the efficiency of theoretical models compared to cfd simulations even though sometimes the accuracy of the theoretical model had to be compromised the comparison on critical mobilization amplitudes at different excited frequencies is presented in fig 4 the theoretical model and cfd simulations have fairly good agreement before 50 hz and the error is less than 15 the difference is largest at 100 hz for the frequencies we considered in this study and the error is as large as 39 in addition ac calculated theoretically by using three velocity profiles has little difference as driving frequency increases and the maximum difference of ac is only 0 35 m s2 it is because the discrepancy of three velocity profiles is small in the specified range of frequencies with current fluid properties in the theoretical model with the velocity of the starting flow conservative diffusion time i e ts 1 2f was set and the dimensionless number β varied from 4 0 at 5 hz to 0 2 at 100 hz rmin was used in the calculation of β as it is shown in fig 1a the velocity profile of the starting flow has little difference from that of the poiseuille flow in this range of β similarly the case was the same for the velocity profile of the oscillatory flow as shown in fig 1b and the dimensionless number α varied from 0 9 at 5 hz to 3 9 at 100 hz rmin was used in the calculation of α therefore the difference between the theoretical model and experimental or numerical results was not necessarily attributed to the flow profile gauglitz and radke 1989 legait 1983 actually we observed that the menisci of the droplet in the cfd simulation was not strictly spherical while the spherical meniscus was assumed in the theoretical model deng and cardenas 2013 the error between the theoretical and experimental results as shown in fig 4 can be attributed to this discrepancy in the shape of the menisci the deformation of the menisci adds extra resistance of the flow when there is a rapid change of the momentum of the flow e g when haines jump occurs an adjustment of the constant contact angle into a dynamic contact angle can be used to compensate for this effect of the deformed menisci however to keep the problem focused we did not discuss the effect of the dynamic contact angle in details in this paper to evaluate the effect of velocity profiles on the flow in a more detailed way the dimensionless numbers α and β can be checked to estimate the difference made by the velocity profiles this difference of velocity profiles can be manifested in the transient displacement of the droplet by considering different frequencies of the seismic stimulation as shown in fig 5 fig 5 presents the response of the nonwetting droplet to the vibration of the constricted tube calculated by the theoretical model with three velocity profiles and cfd simulation at frequency 0 10 20 and 50 hz the droplet oscillates at the same frequency as the driving frequency the displacement of the droplet gradually accumulates usually for several periods of vibration before the droplet is finally dislodged as seen in fig 5 it takes longer time for the droplet to pass through the constriction with the increasing driving frequency for cfd simulations the nonwetting droplet does not oscillate in the case of 0 hz it is because the time at which the oscillatory fictitious force exerts on the droplet to help overcome the capillary resistance becomes shorter with increase of driving frequency when the downstream meniscus passes through a certain distance beyond the throat haines jump occurs in presentation of unsteady impulsive advance of the front of the nonwetting droplet morrow 1970 after the upstream meniscus passes through the throat there is a second jump in the end of curves in fig 5 the haines jump velocities in the theoretical model are larger than cfd simulation because the dynamic contact angle takes effect in the cfd simulation after the haines jump the flow becomes steady and agreement of velocities can be reached between the theoretical model and cfd simulations the use of the starting flow and the oscillatory flow can narrow down the discrepancy between the theoretical model based on poiseuille flow and cfd simulations overall the theoretical model with the velocity profile of the oscillatory flow has best agreement with cfd simulations in comparison with the velocity profile of the starting flow and poiseuille flow specifically for scenarios at 10 hz and 20 hz the theoretical result has the same number of vibration periods before haines jump by using the velocity profile of the oscillatory flow whereas it presents fewer number of vibration periods at 50 hz at this input frequency the dimensionless number α is approximately 2 8 which means that inertial effect becomes dominant in the motion of the droplet in summary the theoretical model was validated against cfd simulations in addition it shows that the velocity profile of the oscillatory flow is the most accurate among these three velocity profiles by comparing with cfd simulations in terms of the critical mobilization amplitude and the number of vibration periods before the mobilization of the droplet the difference in critical mobilization amplitudes is very small in low frequency range the values of dimensionless numbers were approximately identified to delimit this difference the explanation was based on the dimensionless numbers of the nonwetting phase when the viscosity of the nonwetting droplet is greater than that of the wetting liquid the difference in critical mobilization amplitudes is small in the frequency range from 0 hz to 50 hz to further examine the effect of dimensionless numbers on the mobilization systematically the viscosity ratio should also be considered furthermore due to the wide use of poiseuille flow profile in the theoretical study in the hydrology we analyzed the condition that poiseuille flow profile can approximate the oscillatory flow profile in the following section 5 sensitivity study 5 1 basic case based on the analysis in section 4 2 the critical mobilization amplitude calculated from the oscillatory velocity profile is more accurate compared to other two velocity profiles due to the expensive computational cost of cfd simulations only the theoretical model was run to examine the effect of dimensionless numbers and viscosity ratio graham and higdon 2000b presented that the mobilization amplitude depended on the droplet size in terms of volume viscosity ratio μw μn density ratio ρw ρn and aspect ratio rmax rmin in this study since the flow is two phase flow there are two groups of the dimensionless numbers α and β by using the properties of two fluids to keep it simple for our analysis of the effect of α and β both the density and viscosity ratios of two fluids were set as 1 in our study of the basic case therefore only one group of α and β needed to be calculated in the basic case in this basic case study the droplet size was set as 13 16 mm3 the external pressure drop across the inlet and outlet of the tube was 146 24 pa the aspect ratio of the constricted tube was set as 4 for all cases and the geometry was the same as in section 4 the only varied parameters were dimensionless numbers α and β the geometric parameters are rmax 2 mm rmin 0 5 mm l1 20 mm l2 20 mm and l 10 mm the fluid properties are σ 0 05 n m μn 0 001 pa s μw 0 001 pa s ρn 1000 kg m3 and ρw 1000 kg m3 thirteen excited frequencies were investigated from 0 1 hz to 260 hz in this frequency range the wide range of dimensionless numbers α and β can be covered eq 32 was run for three velocity profiles respectively to find the critical mobilization amplitude and number of vibration period before the mobilization of the droplet due to two variables α and β in the comparison the horizontal axis was set as number of points as given in table 1 titled point in fig 6 the comparison of critical mobilization amplitudes and number of vibration periods is presented in fig 6 from point 1 to point 13 the α increases and the β decreases as shown in table 1 fig 6a shows that the starting flow and oscillatory flow have good agreement in all selected frequency range the corresponding frequency can be found in table 1 with the maximum error in ac as 8 with relatively small α and large β the predicted critical mobilization amplitudes are identical for three velocity profiles but the discrepancy starts to occur at point 5 for the velocity profile of the poiseuille flow the α and β at this point 5 are 6 9 and 0 03 respectively the plug like central part of the velocity profile starts to expand at these values by referring to fig 1 therefore this difference in ac can be explained by the dimensionless numbers α and β in fig 6b the required number of vibration periods is proportional to α but inversely proportional to β this result is consistent with fig 5 therefore the velocity profile of the starting flow can be used as an appropriate approximation to the velocity profile of the oscillatory flow the velocity profile of the poiseuille flow can also be used as an approximation to other two velocity profiles when α is less than 6 9 and β is larger than 0 03 in the theoretical study of the flow subjected to the oscillation forcing 5 2 effect of viscosity ratio based on constant viscosity of nonwetting fluid as stated in section 4 2 the viscosity ratio of fluids also shows influence on the predicted ac besides the basic case with the viscosity ratio of 1 we also considered the varying viscosity of the wetting fluid by setting the viscosity ratio as 0 1 0 2 0 5 1 2 3 3 5 10 and 20 respectively and other fluid properties including the viscosity of the nonwetting fluid were kept the same as in the basic case here we analyzed the effect of the viscosity ratio on the mobilization of the nonwetting droplet the effect of viscosity ratio can be demonstrated in fig 7 the exact data of fig 7 is available in data file uploaded separately from fig 7 we observed that the predicted ac by using three velocity profiles had very good agreement with the error no more than 3 or the absolute discrepancy in ac no greater than 0 1 m s2 when the dimensionless number α was relatively small and β was relatively large the ranges of the critical value of α and β are for α it is 6 8 8 9 for β it is 0 02 0 033 when α is greater and β is smaller than these ranges the flow subjected to the oscillation forcing became more inertia dominated and the three corresponding curves in fig 7 start to diverge when the three curves start to diverge at low viscosity ratio such as μw μn 0 1 a good agreement can still be obtained between the poiseuille flow and starting flow and the prediction of ac by using these two velocity profiles is less than that by using the velocity profile of oscillatory flow with the increase of viscosity ratio the predicted ac generally increases at the same time the predicted ac by using the velocity profile of starting flow gradually shifts towards and eventually becomes greater than the predicted ac by using the velocity profile of oscillatory flow when the wetting fluid becomes more viscous than the nonwetting fluid the predicted ac by using the velocity profile of poiseuille flow also gradually shifts towards and eventually becomes greater than the predicted ac by using the velocity profile of oscillatory flow it was commonly believed that the flow rate was overestimated by using the poiseuille flow to approximate the dynamic flow and the ac should be underestimated however it is opposite when the wetting fluid is much more viscous than the nonwetting fluid as demonstrated in fig 7 with the very viscous wetting fluid the applied pressure gradient is much larger in the wetting fluid than in the nonwetting fluid the capillary force for the nonwetting droplet and the viscous force in the wetting fluid compete with each other to determine the flow rate because of this competition when we have the undeveloped velocity profiles such as starting flow or oscillatory flow the exerted the pressure drop within the wetting fluid is greater than that when we applied the poiseuille flow approximation this results in that the flow rate is underestimated when we applied the poiseuille flow approximation and the wetting fluid is more viscous than the nonwetting fluid therefore the predicted ac is overestimated which is in opposite to the case when the wetting fluid is less viscous than or equally viscous as the nonwetting fluid in addition the critical mobilization amplitudes with respect to α and β for the velocity profile of the oscillatory flow and starting flow are presented in fig 8 three viscosity ratios were analyzed the case of μw μn 0 1 indicates more pronounced inertia effect of the wetting fluid and smaller ac is required to mobilize the droplet compared to the case with the viscosity ratio of 1 the case of μw μn 10 indicates more pronounced viscous effect of the wetting fluid and larger ac is required to mobilize the droplet compared to the case with the viscosity ratio of 1 by using the velocity profile of the oscillatory flow the flow is viscous dominated when α is small and the flow is inertia dominated when α is large when the flow is viscous dominated making the wetting fluid less viscous than the nonwetting fluid will not change much of the ac but making the wetting fluid more viscous than the nonwetting fluid will result in larger ac when the flow becomes inertia dominated making the wetting fluid more viscous than the nonwetting fluid will not change much of the ac to mobilize the droplet but making the wetting fluid less viscous than the nonwetting fluid will result in smaller ac by using the velocity profile of the starting flow the flow is viscous dominated when the β is large and the flow is inertia dominated when the β is small when the flow is viscous dominated the ac is not sensitive to the viscosity ratio when the flow becomes inertia dominated ac constantly increases with the increase of the viscosity of the wetting fluid or vice versa for the viscosity of the nonwetting fluid 5 3 effect of viscosity of nonwetting fluid to investigate the viscosity effect in the use of different velocity profiles the less viscous nonwetting fluid was also used for the further study by setting μn 0 0003 pa s meanwhile other fluid properties and geometric parameters including the viscosity of the wetting fluid were kept the same as in the basic case the viscosity ratio in this case is also 3 3 as studied above but we made the nonwetting fluid less viscous in this case than that in the above case ac was calculated at the same driving frequencies and the correlation was displayed in fig 9 by incorporating the velocity profile of the poiseuille flow into the theoretical model the flow is overestimated and the droplet is easier to be mobilized compared to the use of other two velocity profiles for the theoretical calculation with the same acceleration amplitude the flow with parabolic profile moves longer distance and thus is more likely to be mobilized for the nonwetting droplet for the velocity profile of the oscillatory flow the dimensionless number α varies from 5 1 at 5 hz to 22 9 at 100 hz for the velocity profile of the starting flow the dimensionless number β varies from 0 12 at 5 hz to 0 006 at 100 hz the curves by using three different velocity profiles starts to diverge at 15 hz in fig 9 at this driving frequency the dimensionless numbers α 8 8 and β 0 02 which are very close to the divergence values of α and β in the above case with the same viscosity ratio but more viscous nonwetting fluid above this value of α or below this value of β the flow becomes inertia dominated for the nonwetting fluid and the central part of the velocity profile turns to be flat both the poiseuille flow and starting flow assumptions would cause pronounced error in the calculation the discrepancy between the poiseuille flow and the starting flow also starts at 15 hz beyond this driving frequency the dimensionless number β becomes greater than 0 03 at which the central part of the velocity profile turns to be flat and thus the inertia effect becomes dominant thus discrepancy amplifies although we reduced the viscosity of the nonwetting phase in this case the trend of the error between three velocity profiles is consistent with the above case with the more viscous nonwetting fluid but the same viscosity ratio as 3 3 6 summary and conclusions velocity profiles of the poiseuille flow starting flow and oscillatory flow were implemented in the theoretical model that can describe the response of the nonwetting droplet to the oscillation forcing the effect of velocity profiles was analyzed in the case of the mobilization of the nonwetting droplet and dimensionless numbers and viscosity of fluids were investigated to characterize their profile difference the critical mobilization amplitude was used to quantify the mobilization by using three velocity profiles the theoretical model with three velocity profiles can reach a good agreement with cfd simulation in the low frequency range in terms of the prediction of critical mobilization amplitudes this good agreement can be attributed to the small α and the large β for the flow case that we studied when we compared the temporal displacement of the droplet for its mobilization process the discrepancy by using three different velocity profiles becomes more significant with the increasing frequency compared to the prediction of critical mobilization amplitudes it took longer time i e more periods of vibration to dislodge the trapped droplet for the velocity profile of the oscillatory flow and starting flow than that of the poiseuille flow in the sensitivity study of the dimensionless number and viscosity ratio the dimensionless numbers α and β were identified to delimit the viscous dominated flow and the inertia dominated flow the critical dimensionless numbers α and β are near 8 0 and 0 02 respectively when the flow is viscous dominated α is less than 8 and β is larger than 0 02 the poiseuille flow can be used to approximate both the starting flow and oscillatory flow when the viscosity ratio of the wetting and nonwetting fluids changes the critical values of α and β to delimit the viscous dominated flow and the inertia dominated flow have slight change by calculating α and β for the theoretical study of the flow subjected to the oscillation forcing it can help us choose the appropriate velocity profile in the theoretical analysis of the hydrologic problems by considering both the accuracy and the easiness of implementation this study also assists in enhancing accuracy in macroscopic hydrodynamic analysis in porous media firstly dimensionless numbers α and β are calculated to determine whether the fully developed laminar flow profile is appropriate in the engineering context if α and β is in the range where fully developed laminar flow profile applies the flow follows poiseuille flow profile and darcy s law in macroscopic scale otherwise correction functions as function of α and β should be considered in the flow law this correction concept was used in biot s poroelasticity theory biot 1956 the correction functions are the terms in brackets in eqs 6 and 7 to obtain a simple form the asymptotic term can be obtained based on specific engineering context in this sense the correction function is added to compensate for the large difference made by different flow profiles declaration of competing

5758,poiseuille flow was widely assumed in the analysis of fluid flow in porous media due to its simple form it can describe the flow behavior at creeping flow conditions very well however errors were reported in the literature by the use of this parabolic velocity profile in some dynamic circumstances the effect of velocity profiles on the capillary flow was discussed in this study when oscillation forcing was applied to the flow an example of the response of nonwetting droplets to the oscillation forcing in a constricted capillary was analyzed the velocity profiles of poiseuille flow starting flow and oscillatory flow were used in this analysis for a comparison the easiness of implementing these velocity profiles in the theoretical analysis is in this order poiseuille flow starting flow and oscillatory flow but the accuracy is in the order oscillatory flow starting flow and poiseuille flow by using theoretical approach we quantified the dimensionless numbers at which the velocity profile of poiseuille flow profile can be used to approximate the velocity profiles of starting flow or oscillatory flow the sensitivity of the viscosity ratio was also discussed in this study when certain conditions of the dimensionless numbers are met the use of the velocity profile of poiseuille flow can be justified even though the flow is in a dynamic condition otherwise the approximation by using poiseuille flow could cause significant errors when the flow is subjected to oscillation forcing keywords oscillation forcing flow profiles poiseuille flow starting flow oscillatory flow two phase flow 1 introduction the velocity profile of flow is a key factor to quantify the flow and transport such as in the hydrogeology environmental remediation vadose zone ecology and oil recovery in current theoretical and numerical studies of the flow in porous media the poiseuille flow was widely assumed for its effectiveness and simple form fries and dreyer 2008 keller et al 2004 may et al 2012 moebius and or 2014a moebius and or 2014b quéré 1997 taherzadeh et al 2012 wang et al 2012 the underlying assumption of this parabolic velocity profile is that the flow is fully developed laminar flow this assumption however becomes invalid in some circumstances when the inertial force dominates the flow for example in the initial stage of the imbibition at the unsaturated condition the inertial force mainly controls the motion of invading fluids alava et al 2004 zhmud et al 2000 in addition when an invading fluid passes through the pore throat in porous media haines jumps morrow 1970 could occur and the pressure was observed to fluctuate rapidly due to the acceleration of invading fluid the parabolic profile of poiseuille flow is invalid in this circumstance moebius and or 2014a moebius and or 2014b oscillatory flow is ubiquitous in the subsurface porous media and very likely to be inertia dominated seismic waves induced by earthquake or volcanic eruption

of the flow in the subsurface naudascher and rockwell 1994 in all of these cases inertial force dominated the flow and thus the assumption of the parabolic profile could be inappropriate in the theoretical analysis among these oscillatory flow phenomena the dynamic motion of non wetting droplets in response to the oscillatory forcing was taken as an example in this paper for the analysis of the effect of the velocity profile compared to expensive computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations the theoretical method was generally preferred for the analysis of the generalized oscillatory motion of the droplet by taking the advantage of rapid computation and deep insight of the mechanism beresnev 2006 beresnev and deng 2010 deng and cardenas 2013 hilpert 2007 iassonov and beresnev 2008 the profile of poiseuille flow was generally used for developing the theoretical models for its simplicity but the suitability of using poiseuille flow as an approximation in the theoretical analysis were not quantitatively elaborated this paper aims to quantitatively investigate the effect of the flow profile on the flow subjected to oscillation forcing by implementing three different velocity profiles including the poiseuille flow starting flow and oscillatory flow into the physics based theoretical model and comparing theoretical results with the results of cfd simulation the starting flow is referred to the developing laminar flow in the tube the condition of using the appropriate velocity profile with suitable choice of corresponding dimensionless number will be clarified through the theoretical work by considering both the accuracy and the easiness of implementation of the velocity profile into the theoretical analysis of hydrologic problems this paper is organized as the following in section 2 the shape of three different velocity profiles with corresponding dimensionless numbers was compared in section 3 the theoretical model was derived to describe the response of the non wetting droplet to the oscillation forcing in a constricted tube in section 4 the theoretical results with implementation of three different velocity profiles in the model were compared with the results of cfd simulations in section 5 the effect of the absolute viscosity and the viscosity ratio of two phase fluids was taken into consideration of the comparison of the theoretical results by using three different velocity profiles in section 6 the main points of this study were summarized and potential applications for hydrological problems were discussed briefly 2 comparison of flow profiles in the theoretical and numerical analysis of pore scale fluid flow in porous media certain flow profiles could be assumed to simplify the analysis among these flow profiles the poiseuille flow profile was widely used in the analysis of laminar flow regime and such an assumption can have a good accuracy in most cases however when the flow has a rapid change of the velocity the flow rate can be significantly overestimated by assuming the parabolic velocity profile of poiseuille flow which is based on a fully developed laminar flow situation in the situation of the rapid change of the velocity the inertia effect in the flow profile cannot be neglected and the plug like velocity profile is more realistic than the parabolic velocity profile the error of theoretical analysis of the flow could be reduced by using more accurate flow profiles in this study three flow velocity profiles including poiseuille flow starting flow and oscillatory flow were compared and evaluated by applying these velocity profiles in the oscillatory flow analysis to generalize the various conditions of pressure gradient the pressure gradient imposed on the fluid was assumed to be in the form as follows 1 p p s i n 2 π f t φ where p is the amplitude of the oscillatory pressure gradient f is the frequency of the oscillatory pressure gradient and we assumed the frequency as zero when the pressure gradient was constant in this study φ is the phase of the oscillatory pressure gradient t is the oscillatory time of the driving pressure gradient the velocity profile of the poiseuille flow with oscillatory pressure gradient can be given by 2 v r t p s i n 2 π f t φ 4 μ r 2 r 2 where μ is the dynamic viscosity of fluid r is the radius of circular tube r is the radial distance from the centerline the velocity profile of the starting flow was also considered in this analysis the velocity profile in the starting flow regime in a circular tube is szymanski 1932 3 v r t p s i n 2 π f t

the dimensionless number controlling the shape of flow profile where ts is the time for the velocity to develop for the unsteady flow due to a suddenly imposed pressure gradient and ρ is the density of the fluid when β 0 the flow is inertia dominated when β the flow is viscous dominated the velocity profile of the oscillatory flow in circular tube under the oscillatory pressure gradient is

pressure gradient landau and lifshitz 1985 the operator real is to take the real part of a complex number α r ξ is a dimensionless number which is usually used to characterize the velocity profile of the oscillatory flow representing a ratio of inertial force to viscous force when α is small i e α 1 it means the frequency of the oscillation is sufficiently low that a parabolic velocity profile has time to develop during each oscillation cycle when α is large i e α 10 it means the frequency of oscillation is sufficiently high that the velocity profile is relatively flat or plug like in the central part of the cross section of the tube to better compare the velocity profile effect the normalized velocity as the ratio of transient velocity to mean velocity was used to show their difference the normalized velocity for the poiseuille flow is 5 v v 2 1 r 2 r 2 where the v is the mean velocity of the poiseuille flow the normalized velocity for the starting flow is 6 v v 2 1 r 2 r

normalized velocity profiles are shown in fig 1 fig 1a shows that the velocity profile gradually changes from a plug like shape to a parabolic shape as β increases for the starting flow as shown in eq 3 β characterizes the dimensionless time for the flow to fully develop the larger β is the velocity profile is more like parabolic shape plug like profile i e when β 0 01 in the central part of the tube indicates that the fluid at this stage is like an inertia mass which is not affected by the viscous force from the wall this profile shape change can also be observed for the oscillatory flow in fig 1b as α increases the central plug like region becomes wider correspondingly the viscous region is constrained to a small region near the wall and the shear stress at the wall increases the plug like velocity profile can cause larger viscous dissipation compared to the parabolic velocity profile at the same flow rate it is noted that we did not consider the effect of the time factor of the oscillatory pressure gradient i e p p s i n 2 π f t φ on the velocity profiles presented in fig 1 because the time factor in eqs 6 and 7 was cancelled out by the normalization the evolution of velocity profiles by incorporating the time factor of oscillatory pressure gradient is presented in fig 2 the ϕ 2πft φ represents the phase of the oscillatory pressure gradient which is a function of the time of the oscillation the phase of the oscillatory pressure gradient varies from 0 to 2π in one period the transient velocity profile in one period is presented fig 2 the blue curve in fig 2a 1 denotes the oscillatory pressure gradient in one period the velocity profiles of the poiseuille flow starting flow and oscillatory flow are displayed in the order in fig 2a 2 4 the velocity profiles were normalized by the maximum absolute value of the velocity of the poiseuille flow for all three graphs for a better comparison in this study the velocity profiles at positive pressure gradient head towards left and the velocity profile head towards right at negative pressure gradient the velocity profile of the poiseuille flow in fig 2a 2 is in phase with negative pressure gradient the velocity profile of the starting flow in fig 2a 3 has little difference from that of the poiseuille flow and the maximum magnitude of the velocity in the starting flow is less than that in the poiseuille flow which can be expected from fig 1a the change of the velocity profile for the starting flow keeps the same phase as the change of the pressure gradient for the velocity profile of the oscillatory flow the velocity at ϕ 0 is nonzero there is a bit of phase shift compared to other two velocity profiles it is noted that the velocity profiles in fig 2 do not start from the initial static state but from an arbitrary selected state of the oscillating flow the velocity profiles of the oscillatory flow with changing α are presented in fig 2b the velocity profiles at these three α were normalized by the maximum absolute value of the velocity for each α which was different from the velocity normalization by the maximum absolute value of the velocity of the poiseuille flow in fig 2a 2 4 with increasing α the inertial force becomes dominant in the central part of the flow while the viscous force is dominant at the wall boundary in fig 2b 2 4 it is noted that the direction of velocity at the wall could be different from the direction of velocity in the central part of the flow since the flow at the wall is viscous dominated the phase change of the velocity at the wall keeps the same as that of the oscillation forcing however since the flow in the central part is inertia dominated the phase change of the velocity in the central part of the flow has the phase lag compared to the oscillatory pressure gradient with the increase of α the velocity profile in the central part of the flow becomes flatter as it is shown in fig 2b 4 3 mobilization of the nonwetting droplet by wall vibration the mobilization of the nonwetting droplet by the seismic excitation can be a good example to analyze the effect of velocity profiles on the oscillatory flow in porous media the nonwetting droplets could be trapped at pore throats by the capillary force seismicity was demonstrated to be an efficient way to unplug trapped droplets and enhance the permeability of geologic formations the seismic excitation is equivalent to imposing an oscillatory body force on the fluid system by using the wall as a reference frame the parameters of the seismic excitation such as the acceleration amplitude and excited frequency are important to unplug the droplet specifically the effect of velocity profiles on the critical mobilization amplitude for the droplet mobilization at different exited frequencies was analyzed in following section the physics based theoretical model was preferred for this comparison and hence was established to implement this comparison in this section 3 1 model geometry a capillary trapped nonwetting droplet in an axisymmetric sinusoidally constricted tube was considered in this analysis fig 3 the radius of the tube profile follows the equation 8 λ x r max l 1 x l r min r max r min 1 2 1 r max r min 1 c o s π x l l x l r max l x l 2 where rmin and rmax are the minimum and the maximum radii of the tube respectively l 1 and l 2 are the entrance and exit of the tube respectively 2l is the spatial wavelength of the sinusoidally curved portion in fig 3 h and x 0 are axial positions at the downstream and upstream three phase contact line respectively pw 1 and pw 2 are the pressure exerted on the entrance and exit of the tube for the wetting fluid respectively the external pressure gradient in fig 3 is from left to the right therefore we defined the left side as upstream and right side as downstream we further defined the narrowest part of the tube as the throat such a simplified capillary tube model was commonly considered before beresnev and deng 2010 deng and cardenas 2013 gauglitz and radke 1989 graham and higdon 2000a 3 2 initially stationary state the droplet is trapped in the constriction as shown in fig 3 the flow in the tube is therefore blocked by the droplet the external pressure drop balances the capillary difference between two menisci of the droplet the capillary pressure across the interface of immiscible fluids can be calculated based on the young laplace equation in the calculation of the capillary pressure the perfect wetting of tube wall was assumed in this study to calculate the capillary pressure the radius of the curvature of the tube wall can be calculated by 9 λ w x λ x 1 λ 2 x the position of downstream contact line lies in the constricted segment of tube as shown in fig 3 when the droplet is long enough the upstream contact line can be located in the flat segment of the tube due to the perfect wetting assumption the capillary pressure at downstream and upstream menisci can be calculated respectively as 10 p c h 2 σ λ w h 11 p c x 0 2 σ λ w x 0 where σ is the interfacial tension between nonwetting and wetting fluids in this study then the force balance equation at initially stationary state is 12 p w 1 p w 2 p c h p c x 0 this equation only holds at the stationary state when the droplet is at the mobile state it cannot be used as seen in following analysis 3 3 transient state when the oscillatory forcing is excited the droplet starts to move the transient motion of the nonwetting droplet can be described by the macroscopic momentum balance equation the flow was assumed to be axisymmetric and have only longitudinal velocity component by using the lubrication approximation in this study the axial component of the momentum balance equation is 13 ρ n d dt v v n d v f x f p f a p nu a u p nd a d where the left hand side denotes the rate of the change of momentum within the control volume v ρn is the density of the nonwetting fluid and v n is the cross sectional mean velocity of the nonwetting droplet on the right hand side fx fp fa pnuau and pndad are viscous drag the pressure force along the tube wall the oscillatory fictitious force the entrance force due to pressure and the exit force due to pressure respectively pnu and pnd are the pressure at the upstream and downstream menisci of the nonwetting fluid and au and ad are the cross sectional areas at the three phase contact line for the upstream and downstream menisci of the nonwetting fluid in this model the acceleration of vibrating tube was assumed to be monochromatic 14 a t a s i n 2 π f t where t is the vibrating time a is the acceleration amplitude the viscous pressure gradient in the nonwetting phase and wetting phase are pk t k n w the overall pressure gradient on the nonwetting and wetting fluid is 15 p sin 2 π f t φ p k t ρ k a t where p is the amplitude of the overall pressure gradient k n denotes nonwetting fluid and k w denotes wetting fluid φ 0 holds in this scenario since the external body force and viscous pressure gradient are in phase in the derivation of the momentum balance equation three velocity profiles as shown in eqs 2 4 were used respectively as the transient velocity formula in the substitution the radius r was replaced by λ x at here the lubrication approximation was used for the velocity profile at the constricted part of the tube for the dimensionless numbers both α and β characterize the relative thickness of the viscous layer near the wall within which the flow is viscous dominated in the calculation of β the time t s for the flow to develop was needed as the input since the flow is oscillatory in this study the longest time for the flow to develop without change the direction of the velocity is one half of the vibration period which is 1 2 f in our study of the velocity profile of the starting flow we chose to set t s 1 2 f and develop the velocity profile of the starting flow as much as possible to track the motion of the oscillatory droplet the transient position of the downstream contact line h was used therefore all terms in eq 13 can be expressed as a function of h in the following derivation of force components on the droplet the velocity for three profiles in the derivation are symbolically represented by vk k n w when k n it denotes vk is the velocity of the nonwetting phase when k w it denotes vk is the velocity of the wetting phase the volumetric rate at axial position h is 16 q π λ 2 h dh dt where dh dt represents the mean velocity at the position of h the volumetric flow rate is the same at arbitrary cross section of the tube therefore the mean velocity can also be formulated as 17 v k x λ 2 h λ 2 x dh dt the control volume v of the droplet has three parts left semi spherical cap middle cylinder and right spherical cap see fig 1 eq 17 is used for integration to obtain the momentum of the nonwetting phase the rate change of momentum in the control volume v can be calculated as 18 ρ n d dt v v n d v π ρ n λ 2 h h x 0 2 3 λ x 0 λ h d 2 h d t 2 π ρ n λ 2 h 1 λ 2 h λ 2 x 0 dh dt 2 the viscous force in the droplet is the integration of the shear stress along the peripheral area 19 f x x 0 h μ d v n dt 2 π λ x d x by substituting the flow profiles into equation 19 the formula of viscous force becomes 20 f x 2 π λ 2 h ψ 1 h dh dt where function ψ1 x is defined to generally incorporate three different velocity profiles the form is presented in appendix a along the convergent wall surface there is also resisting pressure force due to axisymmetric geometry the radial component is cancelled out and only the longitudinal component acts on the droplet effectively this component of pressure force along the wall surface can be calculated by gauglitz and radke 1989 21 f p x 0 h p x 2 π λ x d λ x where p x is the pressure distribution in the droplet it can be calculated by 22 p x p nu x 0 x p n d x the pressure gradient in the nonwetting droplet p n is embedded in the total pressure gradient seen eq 15 combing eqs 16 and 22 the pressure distribution is 23 p x p nu λ 2 h dh dt ψ 2 x 0 x ρ n a t x x 0 where function ψ 2 x 0 x is defined differently from other functions and it is a finite integral this definition can largely simplify the expression of the final governing equation by substituting eq 23 into eq 21 the form of the pressure force along the wall is 24 f p π p nu λ 2

pressure relation 28 p nu l 1 x 0 p w d x p w 1 p c x 0 29 p nd h l 2 p w d x p w 2 p c h the integrations in eqs 28 and 29 can be calculated in the same way as eq 22 then the entrance and exit forces

ρ w a t x 0 l 1 l 2 h the specific forms of ψ 1 h ψ 2 l 1 x 0 ψ 2 x 0 h and ψ 2 h l 2 are given in the appendix a ψ 3 h refers to eq 25 it is noted that eq 32 is the dynamics of downstream meniscus subjected to the harmonic vibration by using three different velocity profiles the differences in three velocity profiles are implicit in the forms of ψ 1 h ψ 2 l 1 x 0 ψ 2 h l 2 ψ 2 x 0 h and ψ 3 h 3 4 numerical solution procedure the governing eq 32 is a second order nonlinear ordinary differential equation a fourth order runge kutta method was used to numerically solve this initial value problem the initial condition is from section 3 2 at initially stationary state the position of the downstream contact line can be determined by eq 12 because the upstream contact line is assumed to locate in the flat segment the position of the upstream contact line determines the initial length of the droplet therefore the initial conditions are given by 33 h 0 ε 34 x 0 0 δ 35 d h 0 dt 0 where δ and ε are initial positions of upstream and downstream contact lines respectively the dynamics of downstream position h can be calculated by solving eq 32 numerically the variation of upstream position x0 within the same time step was calculated by maintaining the volume conservation of the droplet the bisection method was used to find x0 in addition the adaptive scheme was used in the selection of time step to reduce computational time 4 comparison of theoretical models and cfd simulations the comparison of theoretical models with cfd simulations was performed to evaluate the effect of the velocity profile on the flow subjected to oscillation forcing the theoretical model has three variants corresponding to three velocity profiles the oscillatory displacement of the downstream meniscus is proportional to the acceleration amplitude of the excitation when the acceleration amplitude of the excitation is beyond a critical value at certain frequency the droplet can pass through the throat of the tube we defined this critical value of the amplitude of acceleration as the critical mobilization amplitude which was denoted as ac due to the nonlinear characteristic of the governing equation ac is a nonlinear function of fluid properties the dimensionless numbers α and β are also a function of fluid properties the comparison of theoretical models with cfd simulations was made on the critical mobilization amplitude firstly the cfd method we used was introduced then the comparison on ac was made 4 1 cfd simulations the finite volume method was used directly to solve the navier stokes equations for two phase flow by using the cfd software fluent for a comparison with the theoretical model guide 2011 the navier stokes equations were solved to describe dynamics of individual flow 36 ρ t v ρ v v p μ v v t f v 0 where v is the velocity vector ρ is the density of fluid μ is the viscosity of fluid p is the static pressure f is the body force the volume of fluid vof method was used to describe two phase flow based on the vof method the ρ and μ in 36 are the volume fraction averaged density and viscosity in each cell the body force in this study is the sum of volumetric surface force and oscillatory body force 37 f σ κ α n ρ a t where κ is the curvature of the interface αn is the volume fraction of the nonwetting phase because only volume fraction of secondary phase was solved in vof the nonwetting fluid was set as the secondary phase and marked as 1 in this simulation 4 2 comparison on the critical mobilization amplitude to make this comparison specific fluid properties and geometric parameters should be used the pore geometry and initial position of the trapped droplet are shown in fig 3 the rmax and rmin in the profile eq 8 are 2 mm and 0 5 mm respectively the half wavelength l is 10 mm for the constricted part the total length of the pore is l 2 l 1 40 mm the initial position of three phase contact lines at downstream and upstream are ε 0 5 mm and δ 15 mm respectively the fluid properties are σ 0 05 n m μn 0 01 pa s μw 0 001 pa s ρn 1000 kg m3 and ρw 1000 kg m3 the comparison was made at frequencies 0 hz 5 hz 10 hz 15 hz 20 hz 40 hz 50 hz and 100 hz the foregoing fluid properties and geometric parameters were used in both theoretical models and cfd simulations at each of these frequencies the critical mobilization amplitude can be obtained by increasing the acceleration amplitude gradually until the droplet became mobilized the accuracy of critical mobilization amplitude was in the order of 0 1 m s2 therefore by following this procedure it took long time in days to obtain one critical value at one frequency by conducting cfd simulations however it was much more efficient in minutes by using the theoretical model to calculate the critical mobilization amplitude it demonstrated the efficiency of theoretical models compared to cfd simulations even though sometimes the accuracy of the theoretical model had to be compromised the comparison on critical mobilization amplitudes at different excited frequencies is presented in fig 4 the theoretical model and cfd simulations have fairly good agreement before 50 hz and the error is less than 15 the difference is largest at 100 hz for the frequencies we considered in this study and the error is as large as 39 in addition ac calculated theoretically by using three velocity profiles has little difference as driving frequency increases and the maximum difference of ac is only 0 35 m s2 it is because the discrepancy of three velocity profiles is small in the specified range of frequencies with current fluid properties in the theoretical model with the velocity of the starting flow conservative diffusion time i e ts 1 2f was set and the dimensionless number β varied from 4 0 at 5 hz to 0 2 at 100 hz rmin was used in the calculation of β as it is shown in fig 1a the velocity profile of the starting flow has little difference from that of the poiseuille flow in this range of β similarly the case was the same for the velocity profile of the oscillatory flow as shown in fig 1b and the dimensionless number α varied from 0 9 at 5 hz to 3 9 at 100 hz rmin was used in the calculation of α therefore the difference between the theoretical model and experimental or numerical results was not necessarily attributed to the flow profile gauglitz and radke 1989 legait 1983 actually we observed that the menisci of the droplet in the cfd simulation was not strictly spherical while the spherical meniscus was assumed in the theoretical model deng and cardenas 2013 the error between the theoretical and experimental results as shown in fig 4 can be attributed to this discrepancy in the shape of the menisci the deformation of the menisci adds extra resistance of the flow when there is a rapid change of the momentum of the flow e g when haines jump occurs an adjustment of the constant contact angle into a dynamic contact angle can be used to compensate for this effect of the deformed menisci however to keep the problem focused we did not discuss the effect of the dynamic contact angle in details in this paper to evaluate the effect of velocity profiles on the flow in a more detailed way the dimensionless numbers α and β can be checked to estimate the difference made by the velocity profiles this difference of velocity profiles can be manifested in the transient displacement of the droplet by considering different frequencies of the seismic stimulation as shown in fig 5 fig 5 presents the response of the nonwetting droplet to the vibration of the constricted tube calculated by the theoretical model with three velocity profiles and cfd simulation at frequency 0 10 20 and 50 hz the droplet oscillates at the same frequency as the driving frequency the displacement of the droplet gradually accumulates usually for several periods of vibration before the droplet is finally dislodged as seen in fig 5 it takes longer time for the droplet to pass through the constriction with the increasing driving frequency for cfd simulations the nonwetting droplet does not oscillate in the case of 0 hz it is because the time at which the oscillatory fictitious force exerts on the droplet to help overcome the capillary resistance becomes shorter with increase of driving frequency when the downstream meniscus passes through a certain distance beyond the throat haines jump occurs in presentation of unsteady impulsive advance of the front of the nonwetting droplet morrow 1970 after the upstream meniscus passes through the throat there is a second jump in the end of curves in fig 5 the haines jump velocities in the theoretical model are larger than cfd simulation because the dynamic contact angle takes effect in the cfd simulation after the haines jump the flow becomes steady and agreement of velocities can be reached between the theoretical model and cfd simulations the use of the starting flow and the oscillatory flow can narrow down the discrepancy between the theoretical model based on poiseuille flow and cfd simulations overall the theoretical model with the velocity profile of the oscillatory flow has best agreement with cfd simulations in comparison with the velocity profile of the starting flow and poiseuille flow specifically for scenarios at 10 hz and 20 hz the theoretical result has the same number of vibration periods before haines jump by using the velocity profile of the oscillatory flow whereas it presents fewer number of vibration periods at 50 hz at this input frequency the dimensionless number α is approximately 2 8 which means that inertial effect becomes dominant in the motion of the droplet in summary the theoretical model was validated against cfd simulations in addition it shows that the velocity profile of the oscillatory flow is the most accurate among these three velocity profiles by comparing with cfd simulations in terms of the critical mobilization amplitude and the number of vibration periods before the mobilization of the droplet the difference in critical mobilization amplitudes is very small in low frequency range the values of dimensionless numbers were approximately identified to delimit this difference the explanation was based on the dimensionless numbers of the nonwetting phase when the viscosity of the nonwetting droplet is greater than that of the wetting liquid the difference in critical mobilization amplitudes is small in the frequency range from 0 hz to 50 hz to further examine the effect of dimensionless numbers on the mobilization systematically the viscosity ratio should also be considered furthermore due to the wide use of poiseuille flow profile in the theoretical study in the hydrology we analyzed the condition that poiseuille flow profile can approximate the oscillatory flow profile in the following section 5 sensitivity study 5 1 basic case based on the analysis in section 4 2 the critical mobilization amplitude calculated from the oscillatory velocity profile is more accurate compared to other two velocity profiles due to the expensive computational cost of cfd simulations only the theoretical model was run to examine the effect of dimensionless numbers and viscosity ratio graham and higdon 2000b presented that the mobilization amplitude depended on the droplet size in terms of volume viscosity ratio μw μn density ratio ρw ρn and aspect ratio rmax rmin in this study since the flow is two phase flow there are two groups of the dimensionless numbers α and β by using the properties of two fluids to keep it simple for our analysis of the effect of α and β both the density and viscosity ratios of two fluids were set as 1 in our study of the basic case therefore only one group of α and β needed to be calculated in the basic case in this basic case study the droplet size was set as 13 16 mm3 the external pressure drop across the inlet and outlet of the tube was 146 24 pa the aspect ratio of the constricted tube was set as 4 for all cases and the geometry was the same as in section 4 the only varied parameters were dimensionless numbers α and β the geometric parameters are rmax 2 mm rmin 0 5 mm l1 20 mm l2 20 mm and l 10 mm the fluid properties are σ 0 05 n m μn 0 001 pa s μw 0 001 pa s ρn 1000 kg m3 and ρw 1000 kg m3 thirteen excited frequencies were investigated from 0 1 hz to 260 hz in this frequency range the wide range of dimensionless numbers α and β can be covered eq 32 was run for three velocity profiles respectively to find the critical mobilization amplitude and number of vibration period before the mobilization of the droplet due to two variables α and β in the comparison the horizontal axis was set as number of points as given in table 1 titled point in fig 6 the comparison of critical mobilization amplitudes and number of vibration periods is presented in fig 6 from point 1 to point 13 the α increases and the β decreases as shown in table 1 fig 6a shows that the starting flow and oscillatory flow have good agreement in all selected frequency range the corresponding frequency can be found in table 1 with the maximum error in ac as 8 with relatively small α and large β the predicted critical mobilization amplitudes are identical for three velocity profiles but the discrepancy starts to occur at point 5 for the velocity profile of the poiseuille flow the α and β at this point 5 are 6 9 and 0 03 respectively the plug like central part of the velocity profile starts to expand at these values by referring to fig 1 therefore this difference in ac can be explained by the dimensionless numbers α and β in fig 6b the required number of vibration periods is proportional to α but inversely proportional to β this result is consistent with fig 5 therefore the velocity profile of the starting flow can be used as an appropriate approximation to the velocity profile of the oscillatory flow the velocity profile of the poiseuille flow can also be used as an approximation to other two velocity profiles when α is less than 6 9 and β is larger than 0 03 in the theoretical study of the flow subjected to the oscillation forcing 5 2 effect of viscosity ratio based on constant viscosity of nonwetting fluid as stated in section 4 2 the viscosity ratio of fluids also shows influence on the predicted ac besides the basic case with the viscosity ratio of 1 we also considered the varying viscosity of the wetting fluid by setting the viscosity ratio as 0 1 0 2 0 5 1 2 3 3 5 10 and 20 respectively and other fluid properties including the viscosity of the nonwetting fluid were kept the same as in the basic case here we analyzed the effect of the viscosity ratio on the mobilization of the nonwetting droplet the effect of viscosity ratio can be demonstrated in fig 7 the exact data of fig 7 is available in data file uploaded separately from fig 7 we observed that the predicted ac by using three velocity profiles had very good agreement with the error no more than 3 or the absolute discrepancy in ac no greater than 0 1 m s2 when the dimensionless number α was relatively small and β was relatively large the ranges of the critical value of α and β are for α it is 6 8 8 9 for β it is 0 02 0 033 when α is greater and β is smaller than these ranges the flow subjected to the oscillation forcing became more inertia dominated and the three corresponding curves in fig 7 start to diverge when the three curves start to diverge at low viscosity ratio such as μw μn 0 1 a good agreement can still be obtained between the poiseuille flow and starting flow and the prediction of ac by using these two velocity profiles is less than that by using the velocity profile of oscillatory flow with the increase of viscosity ratio the predicted ac generally increases at the same time the predicted ac by using the velocity profile of starting flow gradually shifts towards and eventually becomes greater than the predicted ac by using the velocity profile of oscillatory flow when the wetting fluid becomes more viscous than the nonwetting fluid the predicted ac by using the velocity profile of poiseuille flow also gradually shifts towards and eventually becomes greater than the predicted ac by using the velocity profile of oscillatory flow it was commonly believed that the flow rate was overestimated by using the poiseuille flow to approximate the dynamic flow and the ac should be underestimated however it is opposite when the wetting fluid is much more viscous than the nonwetting fluid as demonstrated in fig 7 with the very viscous wetting fluid the applied pressure gradient is much larger in the wetting fluid than in the nonwetting fluid the capillary force for the nonwetting droplet and the viscous force in the wetting fluid compete with each other to determine the flow rate because of this competition when we have the undeveloped velocity profiles such as starting flow or oscillatory flow the exerted the pressure drop within the wetting fluid is greater than that when we applied the poiseuille flow approximation this results in that the flow rate is underestimated when we applied the poiseuille flow approximation and the wetting fluid is more viscous than the nonwetting fluid therefore the predicted ac is overestimated which is in opposite to the case when the wetting fluid is less viscous than or equally viscous as the nonwetting fluid in addition the critical mobilization amplitudes with respect to α and β for the velocity profile of the oscillatory flow and starting flow are presented in fig 8 three viscosity ratios were analyzed the case of μw μn 0 1 indicates more pronounced inertia effect of the wetting fluid and smaller ac is required to mobilize the droplet compared to the case with the viscosity ratio of 1 the case of μw μn 10 indicates more pronounced viscous effect of the wetting fluid and larger ac is required to mobilize the droplet compared to the case with the viscosity ratio of 1 by using the velocity profile of the oscillatory flow the flow is viscous dominated when α is small and the flow is inertia dominated when α is large when the flow is viscous dominated making the wetting fluid less viscous than the nonwetting fluid will not change much of the ac but making the wetting fluid more viscous than the nonwetting fluid will result in larger ac when the flow becomes inertia dominated making the wetting fluid more viscous than the nonwetting fluid will not change much of the ac to mobilize the droplet but making the wetting fluid less viscous than the nonwetting fluid will result in smaller ac by using the velocity profile of the starting flow the flow is viscous dominated when the β is large and the flow is inertia dominated when the β is small when the flow is viscous dominated the ac is not sensitive to the viscosity ratio when the flow becomes inertia dominated ac constantly increases with the increase of the viscosity of the wetting fluid or vice versa for the viscosity of the nonwetting fluid 5 3 effect of viscosity of nonwetting fluid to investigate the viscosity effect in the use of different velocity profiles the less viscous nonwetting fluid was also used for the further study by setting μn 0 0003 pa s meanwhile other fluid properties and geometric parameters including the viscosity of the wetting fluid were kept the same as in the basic case the viscosity ratio in this case is also 3 3 as studied above but we made the nonwetting fluid less viscous in this case than that in the above case ac was calculated at the same driving frequencies and the correlation was displayed in fig 9 by incorporating the velocity profile of the poiseuille flow into the theoretical model the flow is overestimated and the droplet is easier to be mobilized compared to the use of other two velocity profiles for the theoretical calculation with the same acceleration amplitude the flow with parabolic profile moves longer distance and thus is more likely to be mobilized for the nonwetting droplet for the velocity profile of the oscillatory flow the dimensionless number α varies from 5 1 at 5 hz to 22 9 at 100 hz for the velocity profile of the starting flow the dimensionless number β varies from 0 12 at 5 hz to 0 006 at 100 hz the curves by using three different velocity profiles starts to diverge at 15 hz in fig 9 at this driving frequency the dimensionless numbers α 8 8 and β 0 02 which are very close to the divergence values of α and β in the above case with the same viscosity ratio but more viscous nonwetting fluid above this value of α or below this value of β the flow becomes inertia dominated for the nonwetting fluid and the central part of the velocity profile turns to be flat both the poiseuille flow and starting flow assumptions would cause pronounced error in the calculation the discrepancy between the poiseuille flow and the starting flow also starts at 15 hz beyond this driving frequency the dimensionless number β becomes greater than 0 03 at which the central part of the velocity profile turns to be flat and thus the inertia effect becomes dominant thus discrepancy amplifies although we reduced the viscosity of the nonwetting phase in this case the trend of the error between three velocity profiles is consistent with the above case with the more viscous nonwetting fluid but the same viscosity ratio as 3 3 6 summary and conclusions velocity profiles of the poiseuille flow starting flow and oscillatory flow were implemented in the theoretical model that can describe the response of the nonwetting droplet to the oscillation forcing the effect of velocity profiles was analyzed in the case of the mobilization of the nonwetting droplet and dimensionless numbers and viscosity of fluids were investigated to characterize their profile difference the critical mobilization amplitude was used to quantify the mobilization by using three velocity profiles the theoretical model with three velocity profiles can reach a good agreement with cfd simulation in the low frequency range in terms of the prediction of critical mobilization amplitudes this good agreement can be attributed to the small α and the large β for the flow case that we studied when we compared the temporal displacement of the droplet for its mobilization process the discrepancy by using three different velocity profiles becomes more significant with the increasing frequency compared to the prediction of critical mobilization amplitudes it took longer time i e more periods of vibration to dislodge the trapped droplet for the velocity profile of the oscillatory flow and starting flow than that of the poiseuille flow in the sensitivity study of the dimensionless number and viscosity ratio the dimensionless numbers α and β were identified to delimit the viscous dominated flow and the inertia dominated flow the critical dimensionless numbers α and β are near 8 0 and 0 02 respectively when the flow is viscous dominated α is less than 8 and β is larger than 0 02 the poiseuille flow can be used to approximate both the starting flow and oscillatory flow when the viscosity ratio of the wetting and nonwetting fluids changes the critical values of α and β to delimit the viscous dominated flow and the inertia dominated flow have slight change by calculating α and β for the theoretical study of the flow subjected to the oscillation forcing it can help us choose the appropriate velocity profile in the theoretical analysis of the hydrologic problems by considering both the accuracy and the easiness of implementation this study also assists in enhancing accuracy in macroscopic hydrodynamic analysis in porous media firstly dimensionless numbers α and β are calculated to determine whether the fully developed laminar flow profile is appropriate in the engineering context if α and β is in the range where fully developed laminar flow profile applies the flow follows poiseuille flow profile and darcy s law in macroscopic scale otherwise correction functions as function of α and β should be considered in the flow law this correction concept was used in biot s poroelasticity theory biot 1956 the correction functions are the terms in brackets in eqs 6 and 7 to obtain a simple form the asymptotic term can be obtained based on specific engineering context in this sense the correction function is added to compensate for the large difference made by different flow profiles declaration of competing

in reservoir management risk evaluation irrigation flood prevention disaster management and water planning and management liu et al 2015 a multitude of forecast models have been developed which can be divided into two categories process based models and data driven models he et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 process based models have an advantage that they are based on physical principles provide insights into physical processes zhang et al 2015 are subject to many simplifying assumptions and have large data requirements mehr et al 2013 one the other hand data driven models are empirical based on historical observations are simple and easy to apply and do not require information on physical processes liu et al 2015 currently statistical and machine learning methods are often employed to develop data driven models statistical data driven methods such as multiple linear regression and autoregressive moving average amra and its variants have been applied for hydrometeorological forecasting since the 1970 s studies have shown that statistical models produce satisfactory prediction when time series are linear or near linear but do not capture nonlinear and nonstationary patterns hidden in time series zhang et al 2016 however hydrometeorological time series are characterized by dynamic complexity and non stationarity nourani et al 2014 unnikrishnan and jothiprakash 2018 in recent years machine learning techniques have received considerable attention for their strong learning ability and suitability for modeling complex and nonlinear processes hence a variety of machine learning models such as artificial neural networks ann support vector regression svr genetic programming gp and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis have been developed and they have been found to produce satisfactory forecasts of nonlinear hydrological and meteorological processes chen et al 2018 aksoy and dahamsheh 2018 liang et al 2018 nourani et al 2014 shi et al 2015 yaseen et al 2015 recurrent neural network rnn is a kind of advanced ann that has been especially designed for understanding temporal dynamics by involving feedback connections in the architecture to remember previous information elman 1990 advances in the rnn architecture and their training have enables them to handle tasks that involve sequential inputs in various problem domains such as natural language processing machine translation and time series modeling lecun et al 2015 shen 2018 hence rnns are considered suitable for modeling complex hydrological and meteorological time series coulibaly and baldwin 2005 kumar et al 2004 however learning with vanilla recurrent networks can be challenging due to the difficulty of learning long range dependencies the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients occurs when back propagating errors flow across many time steps bengio et al 1994 hochreiter et al 2001 many solutions have been advanced to overcome this weakness of the vanilla rnn and one of the solutions is long short term memory lstm chung et al 2014 the central idea of the lstm architecture is a memory cell which can maintain its state over time and nonlinear gating units which regulate the information flow into and out of the cell greff et al 2017 lstm networks have subsequently been shown to be more effective than conventional rnns stimulated by the success of lstm in many domains related to sequential data a few studies have investigated the power of lstm for hydrological and meteorological problems and have reported promising results zhang et al 2018a b employed lstm to predict water table in agricultural areas compared it with feed forward neural network ffnn and showed that lstm outperformed ffnn zhang et al 2018a b built four different neural network models namely multilayer perceptron mlp wavelet neural network wnn lstm and gated recurrent unit gru a variant of lstm for predicting the water level of a combined sewage outflow structure comparison showed that lstm and gru were superior for multi step ahead time series prediction kratzert et al 2018 investigated the potential of lstm for modeling runoff from a number of catchments with meteorological observations results showed that lstm was able to predict runoff with accuracy comparable to the well established benchmark model shi et al 2015 proposed a convolutional lstm convlstm to do precipitation nowcasting using observed radar maps suitable data preprocessing improves the performance of data driven models wu et al 2009 coupling data preprocessing techniques with machine learning a number of studies have recently shown superior accuracy to corresponding single models for water resources and hydrology nourani et al 2014 ravansalar et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 the wavelet based model is one of the most popular hybrid models as it often leads to significant improvement in forecast accuracy based on wavelet filters and convolution operation wavelet transform wt can decompose a time series into separate sub series and provide a more coherent structure of the series to a data driven model and for this reason it has become a popular tool for hydrological and meteorological forecasting he et al 2015 quilty and adamowski 2018 quilty et al 2019 similar to wt convolutional neural networks cnns detect local conjunctions of features using discrete convolution operation based on a filter bank which refers to convolutional layer lecun et al 2015 liu et al 2017 cnns are designed to process data that come in the form of arrays such as signals sequences and images and local connections and shared weights enable cnns to make strong and mostly correct assumptions about the nature of signals stationarity of statistic and locality of dependencies krizhevsky et al 2012 lecun et al 2015 cnns can effectively extract invariant structures and hidden features in data which is the reason that it has been applied in various fields gu et al 2018 krizhevsky et al 2012 liu et al 2017 studies have mathematically analyzed wavelet transform based cnn for feature extraction exploring the inherent connection between wavelet transform and convolutional layers mallat 2012 wiatowski and bölcskei 2018 the objective of this study is to investigate the potential of lstm for forecasting streamflow and rainfall and develop two lstm based models to enhance forecast accuracy one model coupled lstm with wavelet transform hereafter termed wlstm and the wavelet transform was employed to decompose time series into simpler components the other model combined lstm with convolutional layers hereafter termed clstm applying cnn to extract temporal features to the best of our knowledge it is the first time that such models have been constructed for forecasting streamflow and rainfall two monthly streamflow volume data from cuntan and hankou and two monthly rainfall data from jinan and wenjiang chengdu were employed in this study additionally mlp was employed as benchmark model the remainder of this paper is organized as follows a general description of the methods and performance measures is provided in section 2 the architecture of developed models is illustrated in section 3 section 4 presents discussion of results and application finally section 5 concludes the paper 2 methodology this part gives a brief introduction to long short term memory lstm wavelet transform wt convolutional neural network cnn and performance measures 2 1 long short term memory lstm as lstm is a special kind of recurrent neural network rnn it is appropriate to revisit rnn different from traditional ann rnn has a recurrent hidden unit which forms a self looped cycle to implicitly maintain information about the history of all the past elements of the sequence see fig 1 a elman 1990 lecun et al 2015 lipton et al 2015 at time t the hidden state ht receives input from the current element xt and also from the previous hidden state ht 1 in this way an rnn can map an input sequence with elements xt into an output sequence with elements yt with each yt depending on all the previous xt for t t 1 h t f u h h t 1 w i x t b h 2 y t f w o h t b o where f is a non linear activation function wi uh and wo are the weights of layers and bh and bo are the bias parameters the dynamics of the network depicted in fig 1 a across time steps can be visualized by unfolding it in time as shown in fig 1 b given this picture rnn can be interpreted not as cyclic but rather as a very deep network with one layer per time step and shares the same weights across time steps the same parameters are used at each time step rnns are very powerful dynamic systems but training them has proved to be problematic because of the problem of vanishing exploding gradient this problem can be solved by the structure of lstm proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 a number of minor modifications to the original lstm have since been made we follow the notation of graves et al 2013 without peephole connections lstm replaces the ordinary recurrent hidden unit with a memory cell which cell acts like a gated leaky neuron it has a connection to itself at the next step that has a weight of one but this self connection is multiplicatively gated by another unit that learns to decide when to clear the content of the memory lecun et al 2015 an lstm unit can be seen in fig 2 the gates are a distinctive feature of lstm which control the information flow within the lstm cell the first gate introduced by gers et al 2000 is the forget gate to decide what information would be thrown away from the cell state a 1 represents completely keep the previous cell state while 0 represents completely get rid of it the next step is to decide what new information would be stored in the cell state this contains two parts one is input gate deciding which information is used to update the cell state the other is a tanh layer that creates a new candidate value that could be added to the state then the cell state ct is updated the third gate output gate controls the information of cell state that would be flown into the new hidden state finally the new hidden state is calculated 3

define the set of learnable weights 2 2 wavelet transform wt the wavelet transform is a tool that cuts data into different frequency components and then studies each component with a resolution matched to its scale its main property is that it provides a time scale localization of the process under consideration daubechies 1992 observed hydrological series in nature are usually discrete signals thus discrete wavelet transform dwt is usually preferred discrete wavelet transform can be calculated by a pyramid algorithm mallat 1989 which takes into count its representation at multiple resolutions of time and frequency through two sets of linear filters wavelet and scaling filters the wavelet and scaling coefficients are defined as percival and walden 2006 9 w j t l 0 l 1 h l v j 1 2 t 1 l mod n j 1 10 v j t l 0 l 1 g l v j 1 2 t 1 l mod n j 1 where wj t vj t is the j th level discrete wavelet scaling coefficient hl gl is the wavelet scaling filter l is the length of the wavelet scaling filter n is the number of samples mod refers to the modulo operator and nj n 2 j a typical dwt is a non redundant transform which is prone to variable sensitivity and is therefore an undesirable feature related to boundary conditions when applied to problems related to forecasting maheswaran and khosa 2012 this problem caused by boundary conditions can be overcame by a trous at wavelet transform shensa 1992 which promotes an understanding of the underlying process properties in terms of observation data corresponding to the original series x t smoother versions and detailed component can be derived as follows quilty and adamowski 2018 rathinasamy et al 2013 11 v 0 t x t 12 v j t l 0 l 1 g l v j 1 t 2 j 1 l mod n 13 w j t v j 1 t v j t the original signal x t may be reconstructed as 14 x t v j j 1 j w j 2 3 convolutional neural network cnn there are numerous variants of the cnn architecture in the literature however their basis components are very similar including two types of layers namely convolutional and pooling layers gu et al 2018 the convolutional layer aims to learn feature representations of inputs and is composed of several convolution kernels or filter banks the outputs of a convolutional layer are passed through a nonlinear activation function before being fed into the next layer when the input is a 1 d signal a convolutional layer h is constructed by means of series of k 1 nk small filters l 1 as ince et al 2016 laloy et al 2018 15 h i k f l 1 l w l k x i l b k where a common choice for f is the rectified linear unit relu 2 4 performance measures the following three performance measures were used to qualitatively evaluate the performance of the models developed root mean squared error rmse nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse and mean absolute relative error mare expressed respectively as 16 rmse 1 n i 1 n y pred y obs 2 17 nse 1 i 1 n y obs y pred 2 i 1 n y obs y obs 2 18 mare 1 n i 1 n y pred y obs y obs where n is the number of observations y pred represents the predicted flow y obs is the observed flow and y obs denotes the average of observed flow 3 two hybrid forecasting models the procedures of two long short term memory lstm based models for streamflow and rainfall forecasting are described as follows the first one is wavelet lstm model namely wlstm in hydrological and water resources wavelet based forecasting commonly adopted the mallat discrete wavelet transform algorithm where performing wt would send some amount of future information into forecasting this issue was discussed by karthikeyan and kumar 2013 further explored by zhang et al 2015 quilty and adamowski 2018 and fang et al 2019 this problem is usually addressed by iteratively applying an appending decomposing sampling ads operation to the testing dataset which is time consuming to overcome the future data issue and the high computational cost of ads operation in this study we applied a trous at algorithm to perform time series decomposition which does not require data from the future time t to calculate wavelet scaling coefficients at the present at t due to the property of at wt can be performed directly on the whole dataset instead of iteratively applying the ads operation the wlstm model first selects explanatory variables needed to be decomposed then employs at to divide the time series of selected explanatory and target variables into several more stable sub series then it removes the wavelet coefficients affected by the boundary condition at the beginning of series after that it divides the whole dataset into training set and testing set a network containing two layer lstm with a dense layer atop is trained to compute p step ahead forecast using q lagged records the steps of the wlstm forecasting approach are as follows 1 let y t 1 2 n denote the time series of target variable and x 1 x 2 xn t 1 2 n denote the time series of explanatory variables 2 decide the lag time q the number of previous time steps to use as inputs and the lead time p the number of the next time periods we want to predict to create a combination of inputs and outputs that is y t 1 y t 2 y t p f x i t x i t 1 x i t q 1 y t y t 1 y t q 1 i 1 n 3 select the wavelet function and decomposition level j and the explanatory variables needed to be decomposed 4 decompose and reconstruct the selected explanatory and target variables into j 1 sub series d 1 d 2 dj sj and remove boundary affected coefficients at the beginning 5 divide the time series into training and testing sets y train x train and y test y test respectively 6 use the training set to train the network containing two layer lstm and a dense layer atop for p step ahead forecast 7 use the testing set to obtain p step ahead forecast the second model coupled lstm with convolutional neural network cnn namely clstm in clstm a stack of convolutional layers is applied to capture temporal features of variables the features extracted by cnn are fed into a network containing two layer lstm with a dense layer atop then the whole clstm model is trained to compute p step ahead forecast using q lagged records the steps of the clstm forecasting model are similar to those of wlstm model 1 let y t 1 2 n denote the time series of target variable and x 1 x 2 xn t 1 2 n denote the time series of explanatory variables 2 decide the lag time q the number of previous time steps to use as inputs and the lead time 3 select the number and size of convolutional filters 4 divide the time series into training and testing sets y train x train and y test y test respectively 5 use the training set to train the clstm network for p step ahead forecast 6 use the testing set to obtain p step ahead forecast figs 3 and 4 show the flowcharts of wlstm and clstm forecasting models 4 applications in order to explore the potential of wlstm and clstm models two kinds of hydrological and meteorological series from four representative stations were used case 1 was to forecast streamflow at cuntan and hankou stations on yangtze river basin covering the period of 1959 2008 case 2 was to forecast monthly rainfall data at jinan 1951 2017 and wenjiang 1961 2017 located in chengdu stations fig 5 presents four stations in china in this study we investigated the potential use of wlstm and clstm models for 1 3 6 step ahead forecasting with inputs of 12 lagged records in the wlstm model the db4 was used as mother wavelet and the decomposition level was set 3 and 2 for streamflow and rainfall forecasting respectively in the clstm model the two layer convolutional layer was followed by the two layer lstm with a dense layer atop a three layer mlp was applied to compare the performance with lstm and wlstm all the hyper parameters of neural networks nns were set though a trial and error procedure a dropout method srivastava et al 2014 was applied to prevent overfitting the last 10 years of records were used as the testing data 4 1 case 1 monthly streamflow series from cuntan and hankou stations on yangtze river basin monthly streamflow volume data from cuntan and hankou stations on yangtze river basin china were selected for the application of the wlstm and clstm models the yangtze river with a length of 6280 km is the longer river in china and the third longest river in the world cuntan station is the inflow gauge point of the upper yangtze river while hankou station is located at the midstream of the yangtze river to improve the performance of nns the meteorological forcing data including precipitation temperature and humidity were used the rmse nse mare statistics of the wlstm clstm lstm mlp are given in table 1 the best error measures are highlighted in red the mare values were not calculated for rainfall forecasting as the rainfall contains zero the table points that the wlstm and clstm performed comparatively well in the case of cuntan the wlstm model had the best accuracy for 1 and 3 month ahead forecast in terms of rmse 81 6e 8 m3 85 22 e 8 m3 nse 0 84 0 82 mare 0 17 0 18 respectively while the clstm model outperformed all nns in the case of 6 step ahead forecast with rmse 93 35e 8 m3 as shown in table 1 the model forecast accuracy reduced as the forecast steps increased for 1 step ahead forecast all the nns showed satisfactory results with low rmse high nse and low mare when the forecast steps tuned into 3 and 6 the performance of mlp decreased rapidly compared to other lstm based models lstm performed better than did mlp as lstm improved the rmse by 4 6 10 0 and 13 3 improved the mare by 37 9 26 6 and 48 9 in comparison to mlp across different time steps in the case of cuntan although clstm got lower rmse mare and higher nse than did lstm it did not provide significantly improved forecast accuracy compared to wlstm wlstm outperformed lstm as it reduced the forecast rmse by nearly 10 relative to lstm in the case of hankou the results analyzed were similar to cuntan the mlp had the worst performance amongst other models the difference was that clstm had the best performance amongst all the nns and it outperformed lstm and mlp in terms of all the performance measures gaining the best rmse of 135 73 e 8 m3 150 97 e 8 m3 155 59 e 8 m3 nse of 0 82 0 77 0 77 and mare of 0 17 0 20 0 29 respectively clstm reduced the rmse by 10 0 14 1 and 18 4 and reduced mare by 26 1 28 6 and 35 5 across different time steps compared to mlp to further illustrate the performance of mlp lstm wlstm and clstm in a more intuitive way hydrographs of the observed versus 1 3 6 step ahead predicted streamflow in the testing sets were drawn as shown in fig 6 generally speaking it can be observed from the hydrographs that all four models had a good performance for forecasting monthly streamflow in the case of cuntan it showed that wlstm better forecasted the peak values while mlp showed the worst performance among all the nns especially mlp performed worst in dry seasons similar to cuntan in the case of hankou mlp overestimated streamflow in most of the dry seasons and the lstm overestimated peak values in 6 step ahead forecating wlstm and clstm performed better than did mlp and lstm as they better forecasted the sudden change of streamflow 4 2 case 2 monthly rainfall series from jinan and wenjiang stations the other application is using wlstm and clstm to predict monthly rainfall at jinan 1951 2017 and wenjiang 1961 2017 located in chengdu stations jinan the capital of shandong province is located in eastern china adjacent to the south of tai mountain and the north of yellow river the climate of jinan is a warm temperate continental monsoon climate with cold dry winters and hot wet summers wenjiang station is located in chengdu the capital of sichuan province located in western china chengdu is located on the eastern edge of the qinghan tibet plateau in the western part of the sichuan basin chengdu has a monsoon influenced humid subtropical climate with hot and humid summers and mild winters besides meteorological forcing variables including temperature and humidity based on the previous studies ouyang et al 2014 peng et al 2014 yang et al 2017 climate indices including pdo pacific decadal oscillation soi southern oscillation index and nino3 4 east central tropical pacific sea surface temperature 5 n 5s 170 120 w were chosen as explanatory variables for rainfall forecasting the performances of nns are given in table 2 in the case of rainfall forecasting results produced similar conclusions as for streamflow forecasting clstm got the best accuracy among all of the nns at both jinan and wenjiang stations with longer time steps the performance of mlp deteriorated rapidly while wlstm and clstm showed better stability for long term rainfall forecasting in the case of jinan clstm outperformed lstm and mlp in terms of all the performance measures gaining the best rmse of 43 29 mm 47 18 mm 49 40 mm and nse of 0 71 0 66 0 62 respectively clstm reduced the rmse by 23 5 21 6 and 25 1 and improved nse by 39 2 55 0 and 82 4 across different time steps compared to mlp in the case of wenjiang clstm showed the best accuracy among all of the models compared to mlp clstm reduced the rmse by 22 1 13 6 and 26 4 and improved nse by 18 9 26 0 and 59 0 across different time steps fig 7 presented the hydrographs of observed rainfall and forecasted rainfall in the testing sets fig 7 showed the 1 3 and 6 step ahead prediction of rainfall at jinan and wenjiang in the case of jinan clstm and wlstm outperformed mlp in predicting peak values mlp either underestimated the peak value or overestimated rainfall in dry seasons similar observations can also be found at wenjiang modeling and forecasting longer time steps might make the forecasts of mlp smoother not being able to capture the extremes of the data as can be seen from tables 1 and 2 and figs 6 and 7 lstm outperformed mlp while clstm and wlstm were superior to lstm in terms of all performance measures clstm got the best forecast accuracy in most cases with longer time steps mlp deteriorated continually while the lstm based models showed more stable performance especially clstm and wlstm better captured the peak values while mlp performed worst in forecasting peak value or rainfall in dry seasons it can be inferred from the results that wavelet transform and convolutional layers based feature extractor improved the prediction accuracy of lstm 4 3 discussion in this part further discussion is given the first thing is the difference between mlp and lstm for multi step ahead forecasting for mlp the lagged record was treated as a fixed sized input and the multi step ahead forecast was a fixed sized output this mode of processing was a one to one case in which all the temporal records were directly connected with each other though neuron weights while lstm processed differently compared to mlp as it was regarded as a sequence to sequence problem lstm processed an input sequence one element at a time and generated a sequence output in which the past temporal information was implicitly maintained by the memory cell similar to lstm clstm and wlstm processed the forecasting as a sequence to sequence problem fig 8 illustrates the processing of mlp and lstm the sequence to sequence processing fig 8 b looks more concise compared to inputting and outputting vectors altogether and it was more consistent with our understanding of multi step ahead forecasting by processing one element of sequence input at a time then generating output one by one combined with the results obtained one can see that lstm showed that an implicit processing was superior to mlp also indicating that lstm was applicable for multi step ahead forecasting the second is about the difference between clstm and wlstm both clstm and wlstm can be seen as data pre processing methods as they all apply the convolution operation to extract temporally local information of data wavelet transform extracts high and low frequency into different sub time series quilty and adamowski 2018 cnn encodes temporally local information at the level of one convolutional layer laloy et al 2018 however the filters of wlstm are pre specified structured filters while the filters of clstm are trained by data which are learnable moreover the outputs of convolutional layers are activated by non linear functions from the results of application it can be seen that the learnable and non linear clstm performed better than did wlstm in most cases though wlstm showed its superiority to lstm it is suggested that when the explanatory variables were small and the accurate forecast of peak values was more expected wlstm seemed a better alternative if no prior information was there about modeling clstm seemed a better choice as it performed well in most cases in this study we only applied two convolutional layers to construct clstm as the limit of insufficient data the more data are available to train clstm the more convolutional layers can be stacked also the larger the stacked convolutional layers the richer the representation of the input data and better forecast results can be expected 5 conclusions due to nonlinear and non stationary nature of streamflow traditional data driven models for streamflow forecasting require data pre processing techniques integrated with novel models to forecast streamflow long short term memory lstm is a popular neural network nn suitable for sequential data this paper investigated the potential use of lstm in streamflow and rainfall forecasting and proposed two lstm based models to perform multi step ahead forecasting one model wlstm applied a trous wavelet transform algorithm to do series decomposition the other model clstm coupled convolutional layers to extract temporal features the models were applied to predict monthly streamflow at cuntan and houkou stations on yangtze river and performed monthly rainfall forecasting at jinan and wenjiang stations results were compared with those of mlp and lstm the results obtained indicated that lstm was applicable for steamflow and rainfall forecasting and the wavelet transform and convolutional layers improved the forecast accuracy of lstm especially for longer time step ahead forecasting clstm and wlstm were superior

exploding gradients occurs when back propagating errors flow across many time steps bengio et al 1994 hochreiter et al 2001 many solutions have been advanced to overcome this weakness of the vanilla rnn and one of the solutions is long short term memory lstm chung et al 2014 the central idea of the lstm architecture is a memory cell which can maintain its state over time and nonlinear gating units which regulate the information flow into and out of the cell greff et al 2017 lstm networks have subsequently been shown to be more effective than conventional rnns stimulated by the success of lstm in many domains related to sequential data a few studies have investigated the power of lstm for hydrological and meteorological problems and have reported promising results zhang et al 2018a b employed lstm to predict water table in agricultural areas compared it with feed forward neural network ffnn and showed that lstm outperformed ffnn zhang et al 2018a b built four different neural network models namely multilayer perceptron mlp wavelet neural network wnn lstm and gated recurrent unit gru a variant of lstm for predicting the water level of a combined sewage outflow structure comparison showed that lstm and gru were superior for multi step ahead time series prediction kratzert et al 2018 investigated the potential of lstm for modeling runoff from a number of catchments with meteorological observations results showed that lstm was able to predict runoff with accuracy comparable to the well established benchmark model shi et al 2015 proposed a convolutional lstm convlstm to do precipitation nowcasting using observed radar maps suitable data preprocessing improves the performance of data driven models wu et al 2009 coupling data preprocessing techniques with machine learning a number of studies have recently shown superior accuracy to corresponding single models for water resources and hydrology nourani et al 2014 ravansalar et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 the wavelet based model is one of the most popular hybrid models as it often leads to significant improvement in forecast accuracy based on wavelet filters and convolution operation wavelet transform wt can decompose a time series into separate sub series and provide a more coherent structure of the series to a data driven model and for this reason it has become a popular tool for hydrological and meteorological forecasting he et al 2015 quilty and adamowski 2018 quilty et al 2019 similar to wt convolutional neural networks cnns detect local conjunctions of features using discrete convolution operation based on a filter bank which refers to convolutional layer lecun et al 2015 liu et al 2017 cnns are designed to process data that come in the form of arrays such as signals sequences and images and local connections and shared weights enable cnns to make strong and mostly correct assumptions about the nature of signals stationarity of statistic and locality of dependencies krizhevsky et al 2012 lecun et al 2015 cnns can effectively extract invariant structures and hidden features in data which is the reason that it has been applied in various fields gu et al 2018 krizhevsky et al 2012 liu et al 2017 studies have mathematically analyzed wavelet transform based cnn for feature extraction exploring the inherent connection between wavelet transform and convolutional layers mallat 2012 wiatowski and bölcskei 2018 the objective of this study is to investigate the potential of lstm for forecasting streamflow and rainfall and develop two lstm based models to enhance forecast accuracy one model coupled lstm with wavelet transform hereafter termed wlstm and the wavelet transform was employed to decompose time series into simpler components the other model combined lstm with convolutional layers hereafter termed clstm applying cnn to extract temporal features to the best of our knowledge it is the first time that such models have been constructed for forecasting streamflow and rainfall two monthly streamflow volume data from cuntan and hankou and two monthly rainfall data from jinan and wenjiang chengdu were employed in this study additionally mlp was employed as benchmark model the remainder of this paper is organized as follows a general description of the methods and performance measures is provided in section 2 the architecture of developed models is illustrated in section 3 section 4 presents discussion of results and application finally section 5 concludes the paper 2 methodology this part gives a brief introduction to long short term memory lstm wavelet transform wt convolutional neural network cnn and performance measures 2 1 long short term memory lstm as lstm is a special kind of recurrent neural network rnn it is appropriate to revisit rnn different from traditional ann rnn has a recurrent hidden unit which forms a self looped cycle to implicitly maintain information about the history of all the past elements of the sequence see fig 1 a elman 1990 lecun et al 2015 lipton et al 2015 at time t the hidden state ht receives input from the current element xt and also from the previous hidden state ht 1 in this way an rnn can map an input sequence with elements xt into an output sequence with elements yt with each yt depending on all the previous xt for t t 1 h t f u h h t 1 w i x t b h 2 y t f w o h t b o where f is a non linear activation function wi uh and wo are the weights of layers and bh and bo are the bias parameters the dynamics of the network depicted in fig 1 a across time steps can be visualized by unfolding it in time as shown in fig 1 b given this picture rnn can be interpreted not as cyclic but rather as a very deep network with one layer per time step and shares the same weights across time steps the same parameters are used at each time step rnns are very powerful dynamic systems but training them has proved to be problematic because of the problem of vanishing exploding gradient this problem can be solved by the structure of lstm proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 a number of minor modifications to the original lstm have since been made we follow the notation of graves et al 2013 without peephole connections lstm replaces the ordinary recurrent hidden unit with a memory cell which cell acts like a gated leaky neuron it has a connection to itself at the next step that has a weight of one but this self connection is multiplicatively gated by another unit that learns to decide when to clear the content of the memory lecun et al 2015 an lstm unit can be seen in fig 2 the gates are a distinctive feature of lstm which control the information flow within the lstm cell the first gate introduced by gers et al 2000 is the forget gate to decide what information would be thrown away from the cell state a 1 represents completely keep the previous cell state while 0 represents completely get rid of it the next step is to decide what new information would be stored in the cell state this contains two parts one is input gate deciding which information is used to update the cell state the other is a tanh layer that creates a new candidate value that could be added to the state then the cell state ct is updated the third gate output gate controls the information of cell state that would be flown into the new hidden state finally the new hidden state is calculated 3

define the set of learnable weights 2 2 wavelet transform wt the wavelet transform is a tool that cuts data into different frequency components and then studies each component with a resolution matched to its scale its main property is that it provides a time scale localization of the process under consideration daubechies 1992 observed hydrological series in nature are usually discrete signals thus discrete wavelet transform dwt is usually preferred discrete wavelet transform can be calculated by a pyramid algorithm mallat 1989 which takes into count its representation at multiple resolutions of time and frequency through two sets of linear filters wavelet and scaling filters the wavelet and scaling coefficients are defined as percival and walden 2006 9 w j t l 0 l 1 h l v j 1 2 t 1 l mod n j 1 10 v j t l 0 l 1 g l v j 1 2 t 1 l mod n j 1 where wj t vj t is the j th level discrete wavelet scaling coefficient hl gl is the wavelet scaling filter l is the length of the wavelet scaling filter n is the number of samples mod refers to the modulo operator and nj n 2 j a typical dwt is a non redundant transform which is prone to variable sensitivity and is therefore an undesirable feature related to boundary conditions when applied to problems related to forecasting maheswaran and khosa 2012 this problem caused by boundary conditions can be overcame by a trous at wavelet transform shensa 1992 which promotes an understanding of the underlying process properties in terms of observation data corresponding to the original series x t smoother versions and detailed component can be derived as follows quilty and adamowski 2018 rathinasamy et al 2013 11 v 0 t x t 12 v j t l 0 l 1 g l v j 1 t 2 j 1 l mod n 13 w j t v j 1 t v j t the original signal x t may be reconstructed as 14 x t v j j 1 j w j 2 3 convolutional neural network cnn there are numerous variants of the cnn architecture in the literature however their basis components are very similar including two types of layers namely convolutional and pooling layers gu et al 2018 the convolutional layer aims to learn feature representations of inputs and is composed of several convolution kernels or filter banks the outputs of a convolutional layer are passed through a nonlinear activation function before being fed into the next layer when the input is a 1 d signal a convolutional layer h is constructed by means of series of k 1 nk small filters l 1 as ince et al 2016 laloy et al 2018 15 h i k f l 1 l w l k x i l b k where a common choice for f is the rectified linear unit relu 2 4 performance measures the following three performance measures were used to qualitatively evaluate the performance of the models developed root mean squared error rmse nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse and mean absolute relative error mare expressed respectively as 16 rmse 1 n i 1 n y pred y obs 2 17 nse 1 i 1 n y obs y pred 2 i 1 n y obs y obs 2 18 mare 1 n i 1 n y pred y obs y obs where n is the number of observations y pred represents the predicted flow y obs is the observed flow and y obs denotes the average of observed flow 3 two hybrid forecasting models the procedures of two long short term memory lstm based models for streamflow and rainfall forecasting are described as follows the first one is wavelet lstm model namely wlstm in hydrological and water resources wavelet based forecasting commonly adopted the mallat discrete wavelet transform algorithm where performing wt would send some amount of future information into forecasting this issue was discussed by karthikeyan and kumar 2013 further explored by zhang et al 2015 quilty and adamowski 2018 and fang et al 2019 this problem is usually addressed by iteratively applying an appending decomposing sampling ads operation to the testing dataset which is time consuming to overcome the future data issue and the high computational cost of ads operation in this study we applied a trous at algorithm to perform time series decomposition which does not require data from the future time t to calculate wavelet scaling coefficients at the present at t due to the property of at wt can be performed directly on the whole dataset instead of iteratively applying the ads operation the wlstm model first selects explanatory variables needed to be decomposed then employs at to divide the time series of selected explanatory and target variables into several more stable sub series then it removes the wavelet coefficients affected by the boundary condition at the beginning of series after that it divides the whole dataset into training set and testing set a network containing two layer lstm with a dense layer atop is trained to compute p step ahead forecast using q lagged records the steps of the wlstm forecasting approach are as follows 1 let y t 1 2 n denote the time series of target variable and x 1 x 2 xn t 1 2 n denote the time series of explanatory variables 2 decide the lag time q the number of previous time steps to use as inputs and the lead time p the number of the next time periods we want to predict to create a combination of inputs and outputs that is y t 1 y t 2 y t p f x i t x i t 1 x i t q 1 y t y t 1 y t q 1 i 1 n 3 select the wavelet function and decomposition level j and the explanatory variables needed to be decomposed 4 decompose and reconstruct the selected explanatory and target variables into j 1 sub series d 1 d 2 dj sj and remove boundary affected coefficients at the beginning 5 divide the time series into training and testing sets y train x train and y test y test respectively 6 use the training set to train the network containing two layer lstm and a dense layer atop for p step ahead forecast 7 use the testing set to obtain p step ahead forecast the second model coupled lstm with convolutional neural network cnn namely clstm in clstm a stack of convolutional layers is applied to capture temporal features of variables the features extracted by cnn are fed into a network containing two layer lstm with a dense layer atop then the whole clstm model is trained to compute p step ahead forecast using q lagged records the steps of the clstm forecasting model are similar to those of wlstm model 1 let y t 1 2 n denote the time series of target variable and x 1 x 2 xn t 1 2 n denote the time series of explanatory variables 2 decide the lag time q the number of previous time steps to use as inputs and the lead time 3 select the number and size of convolutional filters 4 divide the time series into training and testing sets y train x train and y test y test respectively 5 use the training set to train the clstm network for p step ahead forecast 6 use the testing set to obtain p step ahead forecast figs 3 and 4 show the flowcharts of wlstm and clstm forecasting models 4 applications in order to explore the potential of wlstm and clstm models two kinds of hydrological and meteorological series from four representative stations were used case 1 was to forecast streamflow at cuntan and hankou stations on yangtze river basin covering the period of 1959 2008 case 2 was to forecast monthly rainfall data at jinan 1951 2017 and wenjiang 1961 2017 located in chengdu stations fig 5 presents four stations in china in this study we investigated the potential use of wlstm and clstm models for 1 3 6 step ahead forecasting with inputs of 12 lagged records in the wlstm model the db4 was used as mother wavelet and the decomposition level was set 3 and 2 for streamflow and rainfall forecasting respectively in the clstm model the two layer convolutional layer was followed by the two layer lstm with a dense layer atop a three layer mlp was applied to compare the performance with lstm and wlstm all the hyper parameters of neural networks nns were set though a trial and error procedure a dropout method srivastava et al 2014 was applied to prevent overfitting the last 10 years of records were used as the testing data 4 1 case 1 monthly streamflow series from cuntan and hankou stations on yangtze river basin monthly streamflow volume data from cuntan and hankou stations on yangtze river basin china were selected for the application of the wlstm and clstm models the yangtze river with a length of 6280 km is the longer river in china and the third longest river in the world cuntan station is the inflow gauge point of the upper yangtze river while hankou station is located at the midstream of the yangtze river to improve the performance of nns the meteorological forcing data including precipitation temperature and humidity were used the rmse nse mare statistics of the wlstm clstm lstm mlp are given in table 1 the best error measures are highlighted in red the mare values were not calculated for rainfall forecasting as the rainfall contains zero the table points that the wlstm and clstm performed comparatively well in the case of cuntan the wlstm model had the best accuracy for 1 and 3 month ahead forecast in terms of rmse 81 6e 8 m3 85 22 e 8 m3 nse 0 84 0 82 mare 0 17 0 18 respectively while the clstm model outperformed all nns in the case of 6 step ahead forecast with rmse 93 35e 8 m3 as shown in table 1 the model forecast accuracy reduced as the forecast steps increased for 1 step ahead forecast all the nns showed satisfactory results with low rmse high nse and low mare when the forecast steps tuned into 3 and 6 the performance of mlp decreased rapidly compared to other lstm based models lstm performed better than did mlp as lstm improved the rmse by 4 6 10 0 and 13 3 improved the mare by 37 9 26 6 and 48 9 in comparison to mlp across different time steps in the case of cuntan although clstm got lower rmse mare and higher nse than did lstm it did not provide significantly improved forecast accuracy compared to wlstm wlstm outperformed lstm as it reduced the forecast rmse by nearly 10 relative to lstm in the case of hankou the results analyzed were similar to cuntan the mlp had the worst performance amongst other models the difference was that clstm had the best performance amongst all the nns and it outperformed lstm and mlp in terms of all the performance measures gaining the best rmse of 135 73 e 8 m3 150 97 e 8 m3 155 59 e 8 m3 nse of 0 82 0 77 0 77 and mare of 0 17 0 20 0 29 respectively clstm reduced the rmse by 10 0 14 1 and 18 4 and reduced mare by 26 1 28 6 and 35 5 across different time steps compared to mlp to further illustrate the performance of mlp lstm wlstm and clstm in a more intuitive way hydrographs of the observed versus 1 3 6 step ahead predicted streamflow in the testing sets were drawn as shown in fig 6 generally speaking it can be observed from the hydrographs that all four models had a good performance for forecasting monthly streamflow in the case of cuntan it showed that wlstm better forecasted the peak values while mlp showed the worst performance among all the nns especially mlp performed worst in dry seasons similar to cuntan in the case of hankou mlp overestimated streamflow in most of the dry seasons and the lstm overestimated peak values in 6 step ahead forecating wlstm and clstm performed better than did mlp and lstm as they better forecasted the sudden change of streamflow 4 2 case 2 monthly rainfall series from jinan and wenjiang stations the other application is using wlstm and clstm to predict monthly rainfall at jinan 1951 2017 and wenjiang 1961 2017 located in chengdu stations jinan the capital of shandong province is located in eastern china adjacent to the south of tai mountain and the north of yellow river the climate of jinan is a warm temperate continental monsoon climate with cold dry winters and hot wet summers wenjiang station is located in chengdu the capital of sichuan province located in western china chengdu is located on the eastern edge of the qinghan tibet plateau in the western part of the sichuan basin chengdu has a monsoon influenced humid subtropical climate with hot and humid summers and mild winters besides meteorological forcing variables including temperature and humidity based on the previous studies ouyang et al 2014 peng et al 2014 yang et al 2017 climate indices including pdo pacific decadal oscillation soi southern oscillation index and nino3 4 east central tropical pacific sea surface temperature 5 n 5s 170 120 w were chosen as explanatory variables for rainfall forecasting the performances of nns are given in table 2 in the case of rainfall forecasting results produced similar conclusions as for streamflow forecasting clstm got the best accuracy among all of the nns at both jinan and wenjiang stations with longer time steps the performance of mlp deteriorated rapidly while wlstm and clstm showed better stability for long term rainfall forecasting in the case of jinan clstm outperformed lstm and mlp in terms of all the performance measures gaining the best rmse of 43 29 mm 47 18 mm 49 40 mm and nse of 0 71 0 66 0 62 respectively clstm reduced the rmse by 23 5 21 6 and 25 1 and improved nse by 39 2 55 0 and 82 4 across different time steps compared to mlp in the case of wenjiang clstm showed the best accuracy among all of the models compared to mlp clstm reduced the rmse by 22 1 13 6 and 26 4 and improved nse by 18 9 26 0 and 59 0 across different time steps fig 7 presented the hydrographs of observed rainfall and forecasted rainfall in the testing sets fig 7 showed the 1 3 and 6 step ahead prediction of rainfall at jinan and wenjiang in the case of jinan clstm and wlstm outperformed mlp in predicting peak values mlp either underestimated the peak value or overestimated rainfall in dry seasons similar observations can also be found at wenjiang modeling and forecasting longer time steps might make the forecasts of mlp smoother not being able to capture the extremes of the data as can be seen from tables 1 and 2 and figs 6 and 7 lstm outperformed mlp while clstm and wlstm were superior to lstm in terms of all performance measures clstm got the best forecast accuracy in most cases with longer time steps mlp deteriorated continually while the lstm based models showed more stable performance especially clstm and wlstm better captured the peak values while mlp performed worst in forecasting peak value or rainfall in dry seasons it can be inferred from the results that wavelet transform and convolutional layers based feature extractor improved the prediction accuracy of lstm 4 3 discussion in this part further discussion is given the first thing is the difference between mlp and lstm for multi step ahead forecasting for mlp the lagged record was treated as a fixed sized input and the multi step ahead forecast was a fixed sized output this mode of processing was a one to one case in which all the temporal records were directly connected with each other though neuron weights while lstm processed differently compared to mlp as it was regarded as a sequence to sequence problem lstm processed an input sequence one element at a time and generated a sequence output in which the past temporal information was implicitly maintained by the memory cell similar to lstm clstm and wlstm processed the forecasting as a sequence to sequence problem fig 8 illustrates the processing of mlp and lstm the sequence to sequence processing fig 8 b looks more concise compared to inputting and outputting vectors altogether and it was more consistent with our understanding of multi step ahead forecasting by processing one element of sequence input at a time then generating output one by one combined with the results obtained one can see that lstm showed that an implicit processing was superior to mlp also indicating that lstm was applicable for multi step ahead forecasting the second is about the difference between clstm and wlstm both clstm and wlstm can be seen as data pre processing methods as they all apply the convolution operation to extract temporally local information of data wavelet transform extracts high and low frequency into different sub time series quilty and adamowski 2018 cnn encodes temporally local information at the level of one convolutional layer laloy et al 2018 however the filters of wlstm are pre specified structured filters while the filters of clstm are trained by data which are learnable moreover the outputs of convolutional layers are activated by non linear functions from the results of application it can be seen that the learnable and non linear clstm performed better than did wlstm in most cases though wlstm showed its superiority to lstm it is suggested that when the explanatory variables were small and the accurate forecast of peak values was more expected wlstm seemed a better alternative if no prior information was there about modeling clstm seemed a better choice as it performed well in most cases in this study we only applied two convolutional layers to construct clstm as the limit of insufficient data the more data are available to train clstm the more convolutional layers can be stacked also the larger the stacked convolutional layers the richer the representation of the input data and better forecast results can be expected 5 conclusions due to nonlinear and non stationary nature of streamflow traditional data driven models for streamflow forecasting require data pre processing techniques integrated with novel models to forecast streamflow long short term memory lstm is a popular neural network nn suitable for sequential data this paper investigated the potential use of lstm in streamflow and rainfall forecasting and proposed two lstm based models to perform multi step ahead forecasting one model wlstm applied a trous wavelet transform algorithm to do series decomposition the other model clstm coupled convolutional layers to extract temporal features the models were applied to predict monthly streamflow at cuntan and houkou stations on yangtze river and performed monthly rainfall forecasting at jinan and wenjiang stations results were compared with those of mlp and lstm the results obtained indicated that lstm was applicable for steamflow and rainfall forecasting and the wavelet transform and convolutional layers improved the forecast accuracy of lstm especially for longer time step ahead forecasting clstm and wlstm were superior
