17630,the optimum operation strategy for a side stream external anaerobic self forming dynamic membrane bioreactor ansfdmbr was investigated by coupling such a system with an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor time based backwashing with different intervals and transmembrane pressure tmp based backwashing were compared as the operation strategies of the ansfdmbr the system performance extracellular polymeric substance eps accumulation in the dynamic layer and on the membrane mesh of the ansfdmbr and the physical properties of the dynamic layer were closely monitored both operation strategies achieved stable operation with effluent turbidity less than 5 nephelometric turbidity units with a slowly increasing tmp however with the time based backwashing strategy the eps accumulation rate in the dynamic layer was more than 20 times higher than that on the mesh indicating that frequent backwashing might have a negative impact on the ansfdmbr the impacts of eps accumulation on the membrane mesh were negligible considering the small amount of eps residual and the large pore size of the mesh on the contrary the eps accumulation in the dynamic layer changed the layer s physical properties and further impacted on the performance of the ansfdmbr the accumulation of polysaccharides in the dynamic layer was the main reason for the layer s compactness which was negatively correlated with the specific surface area and further led to the tmp increase the polysaccharides in the dynamic layer to sludge ratio increased to around 1 6 with only 5 days of time base operation with tmp based operation it took more than 10 days for polysaccharides in the dynamic layer to sludge ratio reaching 1 6 the low tmp increase rate high effluent quality and slow eps accumulation with tmp based backwashing indicated tmp based operation is applicable in the studied ansfdmbr nevertheless the correlation between tmp and the accumulation of polysaccharides should be further investigated to find the optimum tmp for backwashing graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic self forming dynamic membrane bioreactor dynamic layer polysaccharides

layer formed on a mesh membrane with a larger pore size around 50 µm for filtration has recently attracted broad attention fan and huang 2002 the sludge layer is also called the dynamic layer because it changes dynamically during operation after the sfdmbr membrane module is inserted into the bioreactor a dynamic layer is formed on the surface of the membrane i e mesh which helps retain the sludge in the reactor and the large mesh pore size allows the high flux with less fouling potential this approach reduces the overall cost of the system offers strong antifouling properties and achieves high fluxes hu et al 2018a the difference in membrane pore size between the sfdmbr and the conventional mbr leads to distinct mechanisms of clean effluent production optimum operation protocols and membrane fouling guan et al 2018b due to the high sludge concentration in anaerobic bioreactors incorporating sfdmbr technology into an anaerobic bioreactor to form the ansfdmbr combines the best of both worlds sfdmbr keeps the advantages such as quick start up self sufficient control of the solid retention times and hydraulic retention time low sludge production and small carbon footprint as anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr chan et al 2009 lin et al 2013 sfdmbr technology also provides additional benefits such as low capital and maintenance cost high treatment capacity with same filtration area and excellent antifouling performance hu et al 2018a wang et al 2015 the application of the ansfdmbr in an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor has only recently been investigated for municipal wastewater treatment hu et al 2018b yang et al 2020 ersahin et al 2017 generally the sfdmbr system operation should undergo three phases dynamic layer formation for start up stable operation and fouling for ansfdmbrs the formation of the dynamic layer and fouling control have been extensively investigated siddiqui et al 2019 yu et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 but research into the extension of the stable operation period with a proper operation strategy is lacking normally regular physical cleaning using methods such as biogas purging membrane relaxation brushing and backwashing with water is conducted to extend the lifetime of the membrane material before fouling hu et al 2018a backwashing is widely applied as the sfdmbr physical cleaning method which can largely remove the dynamic layer formed on the mesh of the sfdmbr and some of the inner pore foulants xie et al 2014 zhang et al 2011 up to now three different backwashing strategies have been reported time based transmembrane pressure tmp based and flux based backwashing yin et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 sun et al 2018 several conventional mbr studies have predominantly focused on optimizing the frequency and duration of backwashing in the time based backwashing strategy chung et al 2014 cui et al 2018 wu et al 2008 most of the ansfdmbr studies also use time based backwashing like in the conventional mbr to remove the dense and thick dynamic layer on the membrane material to allow tmp drop to a low level and reduce the membrane fouling potential zhang et al 2011 in other word the dynamic layer should be removed when it accumulated to a certain level tmp is a good indicator for the dynamic layer accumulation so it is more reasonable to apply tmp based backwashing in ansfdmbr system than time based operation moreover tmp based backwashing consumes less energy and water is easier to use and requires fewer cycles if less backwashing frequency can be achieved with tmp based backwashing zhang et al 2011 xie et al 2014 yu et al 2016 however studies on sfdmbrs barely applied the tmp based backwashing therefore an extensive comparison between time based and tmp based backwashing is deemed necessary in this study a uasb reactor was developed incorporating a pump driven side stream cross flow ansfdmbr to compare the time based and tmp based backwashing strategies frequent backwashing may result in the poor effluent quality during the formation period in the first several cycles of the backwashing siddiqui et al 2019 considering that the high effluent quality is always regarded as the most important parameter for all type of mbr system backwashing strategies are mainly compared in the initial operation period for the studied ansfdmbr the physical and chemical properties of the dynamic layer and their correlation were extensively investigated with the ansfdmbr operated for at least one operation cycle under different backwashing strategies this approach can give fundamental information about different backwashing strategies and the viability of operating the ansfdmbr 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operating conditions cross flow filtration experiments were carried out by incorporating a side stream filtration module into a uasb reactor as shown in fig 1 the uasb reactor and the side stream filtration module configurations have been described in detail in our previous work siddiqui et al 2019 the membrane material mesh was made from nylon 6 with a pore size about 61 µm the mesh in each module can provide an effective filtration area of 0 012 m2 the cross flow filtration module was operated at a constant cross flow velocity of 0 015 m s and a flux of 0 75 m3 m2 day the uasb reactor was inoculated from the full scale uasb reactor in a sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification and nitrification integrated process operated at the shatin sewage treatment works in hong kong wu et al 2016 indicating that the dominant bacteria in the seeding sludge are sulfate reducing bacteria which can use organic carbon to reduce sulfate to sulfide in saline domestic wastewater stock solution and the necessary trace metal solution were prepared which is same with our previous study siddiqui et al 2019 the stock solution was mixed with 20 seawater to form synthetic wastewater with the desired concentration chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia and sulfate at 315 mg cod l from glucose and sodium acetate 30 mg nh4 n l from ammonium chloride and 170 mg so4 2 s l from seawater the reactor was operated at ambient temperature the reactor performance is shown in fig s1 in supplementary information si the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solid mlss provided by the recirculation pump longer united states of america was stable at around 8125 250 mg l during the ansfdmbr operation a multichannel pump head masterflex l s usa and a peristaltic pump masterflex l s usa was used to constantly drain the effluent the initial flux was settled at 0 75 m3 m2 day by adjusting the rotate speed of the peristaltic pump at the beginning of the tests the rotate speed were not changed during the entire experiment the permeate flow rate was continuously monitored for flux calculation during all the experiments time based backwashing and tmp based operation tests were conducted separately after the uasb reactor was stable during all the tests the uasb reactor was steadily operated with consistent mlss concentration in the reactor and stable total organic carbon and sulfate removal efficiency considering that testing the tmp based operation took a long time the ansfdmbr was only operated for one cycle for system performance dynamic layer and mesh residual comparison 2 1 1 time based backwashing the tests were conducted for five days without and with backwashing at 8 12 and 24 hour intervals four new side stream filtration modules were connected to the uasb reactor in series before each backwashing interval tests the flux tmp and effluent turbidity of the first module were continuously monitored throughout the operation period 5 days the dynamic layer and mesh samples were taken at the end of 1 2 3 and 5 day of the operation by disconnecting one of the modules the detailed dynamic layer and mesh sampling methods are provided in section 2 2 and 2 3 2 1 2 tmp based backwashing the ansfdmbr was continuously operated with three side stream modules connected in series effluent turbidity tmp and flux were monitored throughout the operation period and one of the side stream modules was disconnected for sampling when the tmp reached 15 kpa 25 kpa and 35 kpa samples of the mesh and dynamic layer were taken carefully as described in time based backwashing and treated as described in section 2 2 and 2 3 for analysis 2 2 sampling method dynamic layer samples were directly taken before backwashing whereas mesh samples were obtained after backwashing following chu et al 2014 the mesh samples were gently sliced into 3 3 cm pieces with a scalpel soon after backwashing the extracellular polymeric substances eps from all the samples were extracted immediately after sampling moreover the dynamic layer on the mesh was pretreated soon after sampling for morphology examination using a scanning electron microscope sem system jsm 6390 jeol japan and a brunauer emmett teller bet analyzer sa 3100 beckman coulter usa at least three parallel dynamic layer and mesh samples were taken for physical and chemical properties measurement 2 3 analytical and pretreatment methods the filtration permeate and tmp were analyzed using a turbidity meter 2100p hach usa and a pressure meter mp 100 suke china connected to the permeate tube the filtration flux was calculated using a volumetric graduated cylinder coupled with a timer the mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss concentrations were measured according to standard methods apha 1999 samples for sem or bet examination were fixed according to miura et al 2007 and then dried in a freeze dryer the langmuir specific surface area was examined with a surface area analyzer with built in bet and barrett joyner halenda bjh equations yang et al 2016 the thickness of the dynamic layer was calculated according to siddiqui et al 2019 the sludge dynamic layer or mesh samples were dissolved in phosphate buffer saline samples were centrifuged at 4 c three times at 3 000 for 15 minutes to separate the soluble microbial products smp after smp separation eps in dynamic layer and mesh samples were extracted using the formaldehyde method liu and fang 2002 which is described in detail in si polysaccharides proteins and humic acid were chosen as the representative eps compounds for quantification proteins and humic acid were measured according to the modified lowry procedure frolund et al 1995 while polysaccharides were quantified using the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 total eps was simply calculated according to the sum of humic acid protein and polysaccharides smp samples were not collected for analysis due to the extremely low concentration in the studied ansfdmbr comparing to eps siddiqui et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 ansfdmbr performance 3 1 1 time based backwashing the variations in the tmp and effluent turbidity during five days of operation without and with backwashing at different intervals are presented in fig 2 decreasing the backwashing frequency resulted in a marginal increase in tmp as shown in fig 2a even with a backwashing interval of 24 hours tmp only reached 6 kpa at the end of the five days of operation however the initial tmp increased slightly after each cycle of backwashing suggesting that the removable foulants accumulated slowly on the mesh the increase in tmp with operation time was initially logarithmic but slowly became linear regardless of the backwashing interval indicating that the dynamic layer could be easily compacted after several cycles of backwashing as shown in fig 2 the effluent turbidity after dynamic layer formation was not considerably affected by the backwashing interval after each cycle of backwashing the initial effluent turbidity was higher than 50 nephelometric turbidity units ntu but it quickly dropped to less than 10 ntu in 15 to 30 minutes and remained stable thereafter however considerable amount of microorganisms from sludge would penetrate through the mesh and appear in the permeate in this 15 to 30 minutes after each backwashing to eliminate the effluent pollutant from the initial 15 to 30 minutes operation in each backwashing cycle continuous operation with less backwashing would be a good choice considering the slow and linear increase in tmp with time regardless of the backwashing interval the system was subsequently continuously operated without backwashing in this case tmp only reached 8 kpa at the end of five days and no flux decline was observed throughout the operation meanwhile the effluent turbidity was comparable to those with other operation strategies after operation for five days regular backwashing slightly reduced tmp accumulation but it resulted in 15 to 30 minutes of low effluent quality after each cycle of backwashing on the contrary the continuous operation without backwashing kept an excellent effluent quality in five days with a slow tmp increase therefore tmp based backwashing has the potential to be applied in this system to further evaluate the feasibility of using the tmp based operation strategy in the studied ansfdmbr during the stable operation period the system was continuously operated until the tmp reached three different levels and its performance was assessed 3 1 2 tmp based operation without backwashing the variations in tmp and effluent turbidity during tmp based operation are presented in fig 3 a no flux decline was observed throughout the operation tmp increased linearly with time consistent with the increasing tmp in the late stage of time based backwashing it took 13 20 and 30 days for the system to reach the tmp levels of 15 25 and 35 kpa respectively moreover the initial tmp could drop to less than 5 kpa after backwashing even when the tmp accumulated to 35 kpa in previous backwashing cycle within one hour of the formation of the dynamic layer effluent turbidity decreased sharply but thereafter was stable and remained below 5 ntu without significant variation as suggested in our previous formation study the effluent turbidity could be set as the main indicator of successful dynamic layer formation siddiqui et al 2019 if the tmp level could be set as an indirect indicator for both formation and backwashing it would help the operator make quick decisions about proper operation the correlation between tmp and effluent turbidity is summarized in fig 3d a tmp higher than 1 kpa would help guarantee an effluent turbidity less than 5 ntu in the studied ansfdmbr moreover the prolonged operation until tmp approaches 35 kpa would not affect the effluent quality during the stable operation therefore considering such slow tmp increase rate tmp based backwashing could be a better choice than time based operation because the former consumes less energy and water than the latter with much less backwashing frequency however eps and bacteria would easily accumulate on the mesh and reduce its lifetime when the tmp based backwashing strategy is adopted therefore the physical and chemical properties of the dynamic layer and residual compounds on the mesh after time based and tmp based operation were extensively compared 3 2 eps accumulation 3 2 1 eps accumulation in the dynamic layer the normalized eps accumulation in the dynamic layer during both time based and tmp based backwashing is summarized in fig 4 the ratios in figures were calculated based on the eps concentration in each gram of volatile solid in dynamic layer and sludge samples when the ratio of dynamic layer eps to sludge eps is over 1 eps will begin to accumulate in the dynamic layer for the time based operation strategy eps accumulation in the dynamic layer did not vary significantly across the three backwashing intervals the total eps did not accumulate in the dynamic layer in the first three days because the ratio of eps in the dynamic layer to eps in the sludge was less than or equal to 1 as shown in figs 4a to 4c the humic acid proteins and polysaccharides were tested as the typical eps compounds only polysaccharides accumulated in the dynamic layer from the beginning of operation as shown by a ratio higher than 1 the polysaccharides accumulated quickly in the dynamic layer during the five days of operation as indicated by the ratio of polysaccharides in the dynamic layer to polysaccharides in the sludge which was around 1 6 for all the backwashing intervals at the end of day 5 humic acid accumulated slowly and the normalized ratio exceeded 1 from days 3 to 5 depending on the backwashing interval the accumulation of humic acid showed the same trend as the accumulation of total eps because humic acid contributed around 50 of the total eps in the sludge in the ansfdmbr proteins accumulated in the dynamic layer only with frequent backwashing every 8 hours the distribution of the three typical eps compounds in the dynamic layer and sludge suggests that polysaccharides were the major eps transferred from the sludge to the dynamic layer and thus should be extensively investigated although the time based operation and tmp based backwashing were tested for different periods the tmp based backwashing strategy did not lead to a significantly enhanced eps accumulation in one operation cycle compared with the time based backwashing strategy after 13 days of operation without backwashing tmp reached 15 kpa and the total eps accumulation in the dynamic layer was 1 06 which was lower than the values associated with the time based backwashing strategy at day 5 moreover as tmp increased the total eps accumulation in the dynamic layer slightly decreased these phenomena indicate that tmp based backwashing would not lead to significant accumulation of eps the accumulation of both humic acid and proteins decreased appreciably with the increase in tmp and operation period however the accumulation of polysaccharides in the dynamic layer increased with the rising tmp hence it is reasonable to conjecture that the polysaccharide accumulation outside of the bacteria provided extra resistance to filtration and resulted in an increase in tmp 3 2 2 eps on the mesh the amount of eps residuals attached to every cm2 of the mesh after backwashing is shown in fig 5 the total eps residual on the mesh after backwashing slowly increased with time regardless of the operation strategy humic acid contributed around 90 of the total eps the sum of humic acid protein and polysaccharides residual on the mesh while 50 of the eps in the sludge and dynamic layer were humic acid indicating the extensive accumulation of humic acid on the mesh compared with the other two types of eps compounds although humic acid represented the majority of the eps deposited on the mesh regardless of the operation strategy and operation period the high concentration of humic acid in the dynamic layer and on mesh from the beginning of operation did not affect subsequent operation however the hydrophobic characteristic of humic acid could lead to its merging with other eps compounds through electrostatic interaction johir et al 2012 tang et al 2010 yuan and zydney 2000 which would lead to membrane fouling therefore the variation in polysaccharides and proteins on the mesh should be analyzed with time based backwashing the proportion of polysaccharides in the eps residual on the mesh was slightly higher than that of proteins polysaccharides and proteins accumulated on the mesh at different increasing rates after several cycles of backwashing for tmp based operation in the first cycle the polysaccharide concentration on the mesh was much lower than the protein concentration the polysaccharides could attach easily to the small pores of the dynamic layer but they were washed out of the dynamic layer and supporting mesh as time passed and local flux increased at high tmp because of their hydrophilicity comparing to proteins and humic acid moreover the protein concentration decreased slightly with increasing tmp in tmp based operation in time based operation the dynamic layer was removed frequently by backwashing and then new dynamic layer would be formed in the next backwashing cycle on the contrary the dynamic layer would be more stable in tmp based backwashing in 13 days of operation during long term operation without dynamic layer removal by backwashing microbes in dynamic layer preferentially chose proteins for food in the starvation stage especially those bacteria in the part of the dynamic layer that attached to the mesh so the accumulation of proteins on the mesh was not severe in tmp based backwashing which was less than 0 06 mg cm2 after 13 to 30 days of operation fig 5d however the proteins concentration on mesh in time based operation reached 0 08 mg cm2 at the end of fifth day it was found that the total eps concentrations on each unit area of the mesh were similar among the different operation strategies the total eps residual on the mesh after 13 days of operation without backwashing was only slightly higher than that after one day of operation with backwashing every 8 12 or 24 hours indicating that the eps accumulation on the mesh was not dynamically varied during the operation the total eps residual on the mesh at the end of the first day was positively related to the backwashing frequency figs 5a to 5c indicating that frequent backwashing could enhance the eps accumulation on the mesh given the same or close to the same level of tmp within short operation period after five days of time based backwashing operation the total eps residual on the mesh increased with backwashing interval which might be attributed to the higher tmp at a lower backwashing frequency this is consistent with the phenomenon that the total eps on the mesh increased with final tmp fig 5d therefore both high backwashing frequency and tmp would lead to the accumulation of eps on the mesh however the rate of total eps accumulation on the mesh was much lower during tmp based operation than during time based operation 3 2 3 comparison of protein to polysaccharide ratios in sludge dynamic layer and mesh eps in order to compare the transportation of hydrophilic and hydrophobic eps from the sludge to the dynamic layer and then to the mesh as a typical eps parameter for both aerobic and anaerobic sludge system studies the protein to polysaccharide ratios in the extracted eps from these three types of samples were compared the results are shown in fig 6 the protein to polysaccharide ratio in the sludge eps remained stable at 3 20 0 43 which is consistent with other similar studies broeck et al 2010 the ratio in the dynamic layer eps was significantly lower than that in the sludge eps although still higher than that in the mesh eps this indicates that the majority of the eps accumulated in the dynamic layer and on the mesh were polysaccharides and not proteins consistent with our previous study showing that the accumulation of polysaccharides is one of the major reasons for formation and fouling in sfdmbr systems guan et al 2018b siddiqui et al 2019 the protein to polysaccharide ratios were similar in the dynamic layer eps between the time based and tmp based operation strategies but they were significantly higher in the mesh eps with tmp based backwashing which was due to the low concentration of polysaccharide residuals on the mesh with this strategy fig 5 therefore the tmp based operation strategy might have the potential to prolong the lifetime of the mesh with less polysaccharide accumulation and a higher protein to polysaccharide ratio 3 2 4 discussion on the eps analysis results the analysis of the sludge dynamic layer and mesh eps shows that humic acid contributed more than 50 of the total eps in the sludge and only accumulated slightly in the dynamic layer with a humic acid in dynamic layer to sludge ratio of around 1 1 for both operation strategies therefore humic acid would not be severely accumulated and result in significant fouling on the contrary the accumulation of humic acid on the mesh fiber was more severe from the beginning of operation and contributed 90 of the mesh eps however the steady growth of tmp from the beginning in the tested ansfdmbr indicates that the accumulation of humic acid on the mesh would not lead to system fouling consistent with the conclusion drawn from other similar studies drews et al 2006 johir et al 2012 protein and polysaccharide residuals on the mesh were very low considering the pore size of the mesh a small amount of eps would not be an issue however the accumulation of polysaccharides in the dynamic layer was severe with a 1 6 times higher concentration than that in the sludge with the time based backwashing strategy the polysaccharides in the dynamic layer to sludge ratio rose from 1 20 to 1 55 over five days with a tmp less than 6 kpa with increasing tmp without backwashing the ratio only increased slightly from 1 61 to 1 67 when tmp rose from 15 kpa to 35 kpa therefore the polysaccharide accumulation in the dynamic layer was positively related to the tmp level sludge granulation and aerobic sfdmbr studies revealed that polysaccharides were mainly distributed on the outside of granules or the dynamic layer thereby helping to keep the structure of granules or dynamic layer cayetano et al 2020 guan et al 2018b due to the fact that foulants of the sfdmbr system were a mix of eps and bacteria guan et al 2018a the accumulation of polysaccharides in the dynamic layer could enhance the structure of the dynamic layer with increasing tmp therefore the physical properties of the dynamic layer and their correlation with eps accumulation were further investigated 3 3 physical properties of the dynamic layer and its correlation with eps accumulation the thickness and specific surface area of the dynamic layer samples obtained under different operation strategies are shown in fig 7 a the accumulation of sludge in the dynamic layer increased with time as can be seen from the sem images in fig s2 in si the deposition of sludge and eps accumulation were the main reason for the increased thickness and reduced specific surface area of the dynamic layer leading to the increase in tmp an increase in the backwashing interval did not significantly increase the thickness of the dynamic layer the operation period was the essential reason for the thickening dynamic layer regardless of the operation strategy this might be the reason for the substantially higher dynamic layer thickness with tmp based operation than time based backwashing the specific surface area of the dynamic layer decreased with time and tmp indicating the compactness of the dynamic layer during operation consistent with previous findings made in aerobic sfdmbrs guan et al 2018b based on the discussion above we speculate that the polysaccharide accumulation would decrease the porosity of the dynamic layer which can be proven by analyzing the correlation between the ratio of polysaccharides in the dynamic layer to polysaccharides in the sludge and the specific surface area of the dynamic layer to this end all the relevant data obtained in this study under both operation strategies were analyzed as presented in fig 7b the specific surface area was negatively and linearly related to the ratio of polysaccharides in the dynamic layer to polysaccharides in the sludge indicating that the polysaccharide accumulation was the main reason for the compactness of the dynamic layer the tmp jumped at a polysaccharides in the dynamic layer to sludge ratio of around 1 6 suggesting that a ratio of 1 6 could be a critical point for backwashing more sampling points would be required in tmp based operation to reveal the critical point of polysaccharide accumulation and the appropriate tmp level for backwashing 4 conclusions to investigate the optimum operation strategy of the ansfdmbr for longer term operation and lower resource consumption this study compared the relationship between eps accumulation in the dynamic layer in an ansfdmbr adopting time based backwashing and tmp based operation strategies the main findings from this study are as follows in the studied ansfdmbr both the time based and tmp based backwashing strategies could produce a stable effluent with a turbidity less than 5 ntu with a linear increase in tmp over time even though humic acid was the dominant eps compound in sludge and the dynamic layer and accumulated extensively on the mesh the direct impact of humic acid on operation was very limited the accumulation of polysaccharides in the dynamic layer was significant showing that it was the main reason for tmp increase in the ansfdmbr the negative linear relationship between the polysaccharides in the dynamic layer to sludge ratio and the surface area of the dynamic layer illustrates that the polysaccharide deposition in the dynamic layer was likely the main reason for the compacted dynamic layer and the jump in tmp in the studied ansfdmbr tmp based operation could run for the long term without significant eps accumulation the rate of polysaccharide accumulation in the dynamic layer was lower and the protein to polysaccharide ratio on the mesh was higher than in time based operation even though the feasibility of using tmp based backwashing for the studied ansfdmbr was proved in one cycle of test long term study is still required declaration of competing interest the

layer s physical properties and further impacted on the performance of the ansfdmbr the accumulation of polysaccharides in the dynamic layer was the main reason for the layer s compactness which was negatively correlated with the specific surface area and further led to the tmp increase the polysaccharides in the dynamic layer to sludge ratio increased to around 1 6 with only 5 days of time base

sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification and nitrification integrated process operated at the shatin sewage treatment works in hong kong wu et al 2016 indicating that the dominant bacteria in the seeding sludge are sulfate reducing bacteria which can use organic carbon to reduce sulfate to sulfide in saline domestic wastewater stock solution and the necessary trace metal solution were prepared which is same with our previous study siddiqui et al 2019 the stock solution was mixed with 20 seawater to form synthetic wastewater with the desired concentration chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia and sulfate at 315 mg cod l from glucose and sodium acetate 30 mg nh4 n l from ammonium chloride and 170 mg so4 2 s l from seawater the reactor was operated at ambient temperature the reactor performance is shown in fig s1 in supplementary information si the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solid mlss provided by the recirculation pump longer united states of america was stable at around 8125 250 mg l during the ansfdmbr operation a multichannel pump head masterflex l s usa and a peristaltic pump masterflex l s usa was used to constantly drain the effluent the initial flux was settled at 0 75 m3 m2 day by adjusting the rotate speed of the peristaltic pump at the beginning of the tests the rotate speed were not changed during the entire experiment the permeate flow rate was continuously monitored for flux calculation during all the experiments time based backwashing and tmp based operation tests were conducted separately after the uasb reactor was stable during all the tests the uasb reactor was steadily operated with consistent mlss concentration in the reactor and stable total organic carbon and sulfate removal efficiency considering that testing the tmp based operation took a long time the ansfdmbr was only operated for one cycle for system performance dynamic layer and mesh residual comparison 2 1 1 time based backwashing the tests were conducted for five days without and with backwashing at 8 12 and 24 hour intervals four new side stream filtration modules were connected to the uasb reactor in series before each backwashing interval tests the flux tmp and effluent turbidity of the first module were continuously monitored throughout the operation period 5 days the dynamic layer and mesh samples were taken at the end of 1 2 3 and 5 day of the operation by disconnecting one of the modules the detailed dynamic layer and mesh sampling methods are provided in section 2 2 and 2 3 2 1 2 tmp based backwashing the ansfdmbr was continuously operated with three side stream modules connected in series effluent turbidity tmp and flux were monitored throughout the operation period and one of the side stream modules was disconnected for sampling when the tmp reached 15 kpa 25 kpa and 35 kpa samples of the mesh and dynamic layer were taken carefully as described in time based backwashing and treated as described in section 2 2 and 2 3 for analysis 2 2 sampling method dynamic layer samples were directly taken before backwashing whereas mesh samples were obtained after backwashing following chu et al 2014 the mesh samples were gently sliced into 3 3 cm pieces with a scalpel soon after backwashing the extracellular polymeric substances eps from all the samples were extracted immediately after sampling moreover the dynamic layer on the mesh was pretreated soon after sampling for morphology examination using a scanning electron microscope sem system jsm 6390 jeol japan and a brunauer emmett teller bet analyzer sa 3100 beckman coulter usa at least three parallel dynamic layer and mesh samples were taken for physical and chemical properties measurement 2 3 analytical and pretreatment methods the filtration permeate and tmp were analyzed using a turbidity meter 2100p hach usa and a pressure meter mp 100 suke china connected to the permeate tube the filtration flux was calculated using a volumetric graduated cylinder coupled with a timer the mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss concentrations were measured according to standard methods apha 1999 samples for sem or bet examination were fixed according to miura et al 2007 and then dried in a freeze dryer the langmuir specific surface area was examined with a surface area analyzer with built in bet and barrett joyner halenda bjh equations yang et al 2016 the thickness of the dynamic layer was calculated according to siddiqui et al 2019 the sludge dynamic layer or mesh samples were dissolved in phosphate buffer saline samples were centrifuged at 4 c three times at 3 000 for 15 minutes to separate the soluble microbial products smp after smp separation eps in dynamic layer and mesh samples were extracted using the formaldehyde method liu and fang 2002 which is described in detail in si polysaccharides proteins and humic acid were chosen as the representative eps compounds for quantification proteins and humic acid were measured according to the modified lowry procedure frolund et al 1995 while polysaccharides were quantified using the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 total eps was simply calculated according to the sum of humic acid protein and polysaccharides smp samples were not collected for analysis due to the extremely low concentration in the studied ansfdmbr comparing to eps siddiqui et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 ansfdmbr performance 3 1 1 time based backwashing the variations in the tmp and effluent turbidity during five days of operation without and with backwashing at different intervals are presented in fig 2 decreasing the backwashing frequency resulted in a marginal increase in tmp as shown in fig 2a even with a backwashing interval of 24 hours tmp only reached 6 kpa at the end of the five days of operation however the initial tmp increased slightly after each cycle of backwashing suggesting that the removable foulants accumulated slowly on the mesh the increase in tmp with operation time was initially logarithmic but slowly became linear regardless of the backwashing interval indicating that the dynamic layer could be easily compacted after several cycles of backwashing as shown in fig 2 the effluent turbidity after dynamic layer formation was not considerably affected by the backwashing interval after each cycle of backwashing the initial effluent turbidity was higher than 50 nephelometric turbidity units ntu but it quickly dropped to less than 10 ntu in 15 to 30 minutes and remained stable thereafter however considerable amount of microorganisms from sludge would penetrate through the mesh and appear in the permeate in this 15 to 30 minutes after each backwashing to eliminate the effluent pollutant from the initial 15 to 30 minutes operation in each backwashing cycle continuous operation with less backwashing would be a good choice considering the slow and linear increase in tmp with time regardless of the backwashing interval the system was subsequently continuously operated without backwashing in this case tmp only reached 8 kpa at the end of five days and no flux decline was observed throughout the operation meanwhile the effluent turbidity was comparable to those with other operation strategies after operation for five days regular backwashing slightly reduced tmp accumulation but it resulted in 15 to 30 minutes of low effluent quality after each cycle of backwashing on the contrary the continuous operation without backwashing kept an excellent effluent quality in five days with a slow tmp increase therefore tmp based backwashing has the potential to be applied in this system to further evaluate the feasibility of using the tmp based operation strategy in the studied ansfdmbr during the stable operation period the system was continuously operated until the tmp reached three different levels and its performance was assessed 3 1 2 tmp based operation without backwashing the variations in tmp and effluent turbidity during tmp based operation are presented in fig 3 a no flux decline was observed throughout the operation tmp increased linearly with time consistent with the increasing tmp in the late stage of time based backwashing it took 13 20 and 30 days for the system to reach the tmp levels of 15 25 and 35 kpa respectively moreover the initial tmp could drop to less than 5 kpa after backwashing even when the tmp accumulated to 35 kpa in previous backwashing cycle within one hour of the formation of the dynamic layer effluent turbidity decreased sharply but thereafter was stable and remained below 5 ntu without significant variation as suggested in our previous formation study the effluent turbidity could be set as the main indicator of successful dynamic layer formation siddiqui et al 2019 if the tmp level could be set as an indirect indicator for both formation and backwashing it would help the operator make quick decisions about proper operation the correlation between tmp and effluent turbidity is summarized in fig 3d a tmp higher than 1 kpa would help guarantee an effluent turbidity less than 5 ntu in the studied ansfdmbr moreover the prolonged operation until tmp approaches 35 kpa would not affect the effluent quality during the stable operation therefore considering such slow tmp increase rate tmp based backwashing could be a better choice than time based operation because the former consumes less energy and water than the latter with much less backwashing frequency however eps and bacteria would easily accumulate on the mesh and reduce its lifetime when the tmp based backwashing strategy is adopted therefore the physical and chemical properties of the dynamic layer and residual compounds on the mesh after time based and tmp based operation were extensively compared 3 2 eps accumulation 3 2 1 eps accumulation in the dynamic layer the normalized eps accumulation in the dynamic layer during both time based and tmp based backwashing is summarized in fig 4 the ratios in figures were calculated based on the eps concentration in each gram of volatile solid in dynamic layer and sludge samples when the ratio of dynamic layer eps to sludge eps is over 1 eps will begin to accumulate in the dynamic layer for the time based operation strategy eps accumulation in the dynamic layer did not vary significantly across the three backwashing intervals the total eps did not accumulate in the dynamic layer in the first three days because the ratio of eps in the dynamic layer to eps in the sludge was less than or equal to 1 as shown in figs 4a to 4c the humic acid proteins and polysaccharides were tested as the typical eps compounds only polysaccharides accumulated in the dynamic layer from the beginning of operation as shown by a ratio higher than 1 the polysaccharides accumulated quickly in the dynamic layer during the five days of operation as indicated by the ratio of polysaccharides in the dynamic layer to polysaccharides in the sludge which was around 1 6 for all the backwashing intervals at the end of day 5 humic acid accumulated slowly and the normalized ratio exceeded 1 from days 3 to 5 depending on the backwashing interval the accumulation of humic acid showed the same trend as the accumulation of total eps because humic acid contributed around 50 of the total eps in the sludge in the ansfdmbr proteins accumulated in the dynamic layer only with frequent backwashing every 8 hours the distribution of the three typical eps compounds in the dynamic layer and sludge suggests that polysaccharides were the major eps transferred from the sludge to the dynamic layer and thus should be extensively investigated although the time based operation and tmp based backwashing were tested for different periods the tmp based backwashing strategy did not lead to a significantly enhanced eps accumulation in one operation cycle compared with the time based backwashing strategy after 13 days of operation without backwashing tmp reached 15 kpa and the total eps accumulation in the dynamic layer was 1 06 which was lower than the values associated with the time based backwashing strategy at day 5 moreover as tmp increased the total eps accumulation in the dynamic layer slightly decreased these phenomena indicate that tmp based backwashing would not lead to significant accumulation of eps the accumulation of both humic acid and proteins decreased appreciably with the increase in tmp and operation period however the accumulation of polysaccharides in the dynamic layer increased with the rising tmp hence it is reasonable to conjecture that the polysaccharide accumulation outside of the bacteria provided extra resistance to filtration and resulted in an increase in tmp 3 2 2 eps on the mesh the amount of eps residuals attached to every cm2 of the mesh after backwashing is shown in fig 5 the total eps residual on the mesh after backwashing slowly increased with time regardless of the operation strategy humic acid contributed around 90 of the total eps the sum of humic acid protein and polysaccharides residual on the mesh while 50 of the eps in the sludge and dynamic layer were humic acid indicating the extensive accumulation of humic acid on the mesh compared with the other two types of eps compounds although humic acid represented the majority of the eps deposited on the mesh regardless of the operation strategy and operation period the high concentration of humic acid in the dynamic layer and on mesh from the beginning of operation did not affect subsequent operation however the hydrophobic characteristic of humic acid could lead to its merging with other eps compounds through electrostatic interaction johir et al 2012 tang et al 2010 yuan and zydney 2000 which would lead to membrane fouling therefore the variation in polysaccharides and proteins on the mesh should be analyzed with time based backwashing the proportion of polysaccharides in the eps residual on the mesh was slightly higher than that of proteins polysaccharides and proteins accumulated on the mesh at different increasing rates after several cycles of backwashing for tmp based operation in the first cycle the polysaccharide concentration on the mesh was much lower than the protein concentration the polysaccharides could attach easily to the small pores of the dynamic layer but they were washed out of the dynamic layer and supporting mesh as time passed and local flux increased at high tmp because of their hydrophilicity comparing to proteins and humic acid moreover the protein concentration decreased slightly with increasing tmp in tmp based operation in time based operation the dynamic layer was removed frequently by backwashing and then new dynamic layer would be formed in the next backwashing cycle on the contrary the dynamic layer would be more stable in tmp based backwashing in 13 days of operation during long term operation without dynamic layer removal by backwashing microbes in dynamic layer preferentially chose proteins for food in the starvation stage especially those bacteria in the part of the dynamic layer that attached to the mesh so the accumulation of proteins on the mesh was not severe in tmp based backwashing which was less than 0 06 mg cm2 after 13 to 30 days of operation fig 5d however the proteins concentration on mesh in time based operation reached 0 08 mg cm2 at the end of fifth day it was found that the total eps concentrations on each unit area of the mesh were similar among the different operation strategies the total eps residual on the mesh after 13 days of operation without backwashing was only slightly higher than that after one day of operation with backwashing every 8 12 or 24 hours indicating that the eps accumulation on the mesh was not dynamically varied during the operation the total eps residual on the mesh at the end of the first day was positively related to the backwashing frequency figs 5a to 5c indicating that frequent backwashing could enhance the eps accumulation on the mesh given the same or close to the same level of tmp within short operation period after five days of time based backwashing operation the total eps residual on the mesh increased with backwashing interval which might be attributed to the higher tmp at a lower backwashing frequency this is consistent with the phenomenon that the total eps on the mesh increased with final tmp fig 5d therefore both high backwashing frequency and tmp would lead to the accumulation of eps on the mesh however the rate of total eps accumulation on the mesh was much lower during tmp based operation than during time based operation 3 2 3 comparison of protein to polysaccharide ratios in sludge dynamic layer and mesh eps in order to compare the transportation of hydrophilic and hydrophobic eps from the sludge to the dynamic layer and then to the mesh as a typical eps parameter for both aerobic and anaerobic sludge system studies the protein to polysaccharide ratios in the extracted eps from these three types of samples were compared the results are shown in fig 6 the protein to polysaccharide ratio in the sludge eps remained stable at 3 20 0 43 which is consistent with other similar studies broeck et al 2010 the ratio in the dynamic layer eps was significantly lower than that in the sludge eps although still higher than that in the mesh eps this indicates that the majority of the eps accumulated in the dynamic layer and on the mesh were polysaccharides and not proteins consistent with our previous study showing that the accumulation of polysaccharides is one of the major reasons for formation and fouling in sfdmbr systems guan et al 2018b siddiqui et al 2019 the protein to polysaccharide ratios were similar in the dynamic layer eps between the time based and tmp based operation strategies but they were significantly higher in the mesh eps with tmp based backwashing which was due to the low concentration of polysaccharide residuals on the mesh with this strategy fig 5 therefore the tmp based operation strategy might have the potential to prolong the lifetime of the mesh with less polysaccharide accumulation and a higher protein to polysaccharide ratio 3 2 4 discussion on the eps analysis results the analysis of the sludge dynamic layer and mesh eps shows that humic acid contributed more than 50 of the total eps in the sludge and only accumulated slightly in the dynamic layer with a humic acid in dynamic layer to sludge ratio of around 1 1 for both operation strategies therefore humic acid would not be severely accumulated and result in significant fouling on the contrary the accumulation of humic acid on the mesh fiber was more severe from the beginning of operation and contributed 90 of the mesh eps however the steady growth of tmp from the beginning in the tested ansfdmbr indicates that the accumulation of humic acid on the mesh would not lead to system fouling consistent with the conclusion drawn from other similar studies drews et al 2006 johir et al 2012 protein and polysaccharide residuals on the mesh were very low considering the pore size of the mesh a small amount of eps would not be an issue however the accumulation of polysaccharides in the dynamic layer was severe with a 1 6 times higher concentration than that in the sludge with the time based backwashing strategy the polysaccharides in the dynamic layer to sludge ratio rose from 1 20 to 1 55 over five days with a tmp less than 6 kpa with increasing tmp without backwashing the ratio only increased slightly from 1 61 to 1 67 when tmp rose from 15 kpa to 35 kpa therefore the polysaccharide accumulation in the dynamic layer was positively related to the tmp level sludge granulation and aerobic sfdmbr studies revealed that polysaccharides were mainly distributed on the outside of granules or the dynamic layer thereby helping to keep the structure of granules or dynamic layer cayetano et al 2020 guan et al 2018b due to the fact that foulants of the sfdmbr system were a mix of eps and bacteria guan et al 2018a the accumulation of polysaccharides in the dynamic layer could enhance the structure of the dynamic layer with increasing tmp therefore the physical properties of the dynamic layer and their correlation with eps accumulation were further investigated 3 3 physical properties of the dynamic layer and its correlation with eps accumulation the thickness and specific surface area of the dynamic layer samples obtained under different operation strategies are shown in fig 7 a the accumulation of sludge in the dynamic layer increased with time as can be seen from the sem images in fig s2 in si the deposition of sludge and eps accumulation were the main reason for the increased thickness and reduced specific surface area of the dynamic layer leading to the increase in tmp an increase in the backwashing interval did not significantly increase the thickness of the dynamic layer the operation period was the essential reason for the thickening dynamic layer regardless of the operation strategy this might be the reason for the substantially higher dynamic layer thickness with tmp based operation than time based backwashing the specific surface area of the dynamic layer decreased with time and tmp indicating the compactness of the dynamic layer during operation consistent with previous findings made in aerobic sfdmbrs guan et al 2018b based on the discussion above we speculate that the polysaccharide accumulation would decrease the porosity of the dynamic layer which can be proven by analyzing the correlation between the ratio of polysaccharides in the dynamic layer to polysaccharides in the sludge and the specific surface area of the dynamic layer to this end all the relevant data obtained in this study under both operation strategies were analyzed as presented in fig 7b the specific surface area was negatively and linearly related to the ratio of polysaccharides in the dynamic layer to polysaccharides in the sludge indicating that the polysaccharide accumulation was the main reason for the compactness of the dynamic layer the tmp jumped at a polysaccharides in the dynamic layer to sludge ratio of around 1 6 suggesting that a ratio of 1 6 could be a critical point for backwashing more sampling points would be required in tmp based operation to reveal the critical point of polysaccharide accumulation and the appropriate tmp level for backwashing 4 conclusions to investigate the optimum operation strategy of the ansfdmbr for longer term operation and lower resource consumption this study compared the relationship between eps accumulation in the dynamic layer in an ansfdmbr adopting time based backwashing and tmp based operation strategies the main findings from this study are as follows in the studied ansfdmbr both the time based and tmp based backwashing strategies could produce a stable effluent with a turbidity less than 5 ntu with a linear increase in tmp over time even though humic acid was the dominant eps compound in sludge and the dynamic layer and accumulated extensively on the mesh the direct impact of humic acid on operation was very limited the accumulation of polysaccharides in the dynamic layer was significant showing that it was the main reason for tmp increase in the ansfdmbr the negative linear relationship between the polysaccharides in the dynamic layer to sludge ratio and the surface area of the dynamic layer illustrates that the polysaccharide deposition in the dynamic layer was likely the main reason for the compacted dynamic layer and the jump in tmp in the studied ansfdmbr tmp based operation could run for the long term without significant eps accumulation the rate of polysaccharide accumulation in the dynamic layer was lower and the protein to polysaccharide ratio on the mesh was higher than in time based operation even though the feasibility of using tmp based backwashing for the studied ansfdmbr was proved in one cycle of test long term study is still required declaration of competing interest the

17631,many municipal wastewater treatment plants in china receive industrial wastewater that contains inhibitory organic chemicals such as chlorinated phenols for the common aerobic biological treatment nitrification is a key step but nitrifying bacteria are notably sensitive to inhibition by chlorinated phenols in this work normal activated sludge containing nitrifying biomass was acclimated to 2 4 6 trichlorophenol tcp the acclimated biomass had more than 2 fold faster nitrification kinetics than normal biomass when exposed to tcp and it also achieved effective tcp removal in parallel when suddenly exposed to tcp after as much as two months without tcp input the acclimated nitrifying biomass retained effective nitrification and tcp biodegradation the nitrification rate and tcp removal rate were 0 325 mm h and 0 049 mm h for the acclimated biomass compared to only 0 165 mm h and 0 001 mm h for normal biomass resistance to tcp inhibition also was retained for 5 generations of sub culturing without tcp exposure high throughput sequencing confirmed that the acclimated biomass contained nitrifying bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria capable of degrading tcp although the key genera changed during sub culturing graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords 2 4 6 trichlorophenol nitrifying bacteria acclimation inhibition resistance 1 introduction municipal wastewater is treated mainly by aerobic microbiological processes and nitrification in which nitrifying bacteria oxidize ammonium to nitrite and then nitrate is becoming an increasingly important step rittmann and mccarty 2020 nitrifying bacteria have a slow specific growth rate which means that the process requires a long solids retention time srt duan et al 2013 rittmann and mccarty 2020 in china most municipal wastewater treatment plants mwtps receive industrial wastewater discharged into the municipal sewers xiao et al 2013 chen et al 2014 luo et al 2017 qu et al 2019 although the industrial wastewaters must be pretreated to remove toxicity or inhibition to microorganisms zhang 2019 lyu et al 2020 failure of pretreatment equipment or accidental discharges still occur nitrification often is the process most sensitive to inhibition kassotaki et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 rittmann and mccarty 2020 and severe inhibition can lead to a washout of nitrifying bacteria and loss of nitrification chlorophenols common industrial raw materials used as intermediates for the production of medicines pesticides bactericides antiseptics and solvents for polyester fiber often are present in industrial wastewaters meng et al 2019 daswat and mukhopadhyay 2012 chlorophenols are relatively recalcitrant to biodegradation and they inhibit many microorganisms including nitrifiers müller et al 1998 pamukoglu et al 2008 mo et al 2006 liu et al 2008 studies of the response of nitrifying biomass to intermittent exposure to 2 chlorophenol 2 cp and continuous exposure to 2 4 6 trichlorophenol tcp nevalainen et al 1993 martínez hernández et al 2011 showed significantly reduced nitrification efficiency with the greater effect on ammonium oxidation exposing biomass carrying out simultaneous nitrification and denitrification to 2 4 6 tcp led to lower rates of ammonium removal and the inhibition increased with increasing of initial tcp concentration tong et al 2019 nitrification also was inhibited by less chlorinated phenols silva et al 2011 reported that normal nitrifying sludge was inhibited by 2 cp with ammonium consumption decreasing 93 compared with the control even though the 2 cp was consumed completely during the process martínez hernández et al 2011 also had similar results it is of practical value that nitrifying biomass acclimates to relieve toxicity of contaminants such as chlorinated phenols that can be discharged to municipal wastewater treatment nitrifying biomass can acclimate to phenol and chlorophenols for example 4 chlorophenol 4 cp and ammonium could be biodegraded simultaneously by nitrifying biomass that had been acclimated to 4 cp lim et al 2013 zou et al 2019 acclimated nitrifying biomass to phenol and achieved good simultaneous ammonium and phenol removal rates ammonium was removed by a combination of nitrification and synthesis into heterotrophic biomass nitrifying biomass can become resistant to toxicity of chlorophenols by selection of more resistant strains of nitrifiers by selection of heterotrophic bacteria able to biodegrade the chlorophenols or both together this issue was explored by hou et al 2018 with exposure to pyridine pyridine acclimated biomass resisted pyridine through a combination of enhanced pyridine biodegradation and selection of resistant nitrifying bacteria our interest is in intermittent exposure of nitrifying biomass to tcp will nitrifying biomass that has acclimated to tcp exposure maintain its ability to resist chlorophenol exposure if the exposure is absent for some time of relevance is the work of zou et al 2019 who showed that acclimated nitrifying biomass continued resisting phenol exposure with intermittent exposures to phenol however phenol inhibition to the nitrifying biomass was different from tcp inhibition phenol inhibited nh4 n oxidation by competing for o2 while tcp inhibits the nitrifying biomass due to its toxicity tcp acclimated biomass can relieve the inhibition by biodegrading the tcp when a high concentration of tcp enters a nitrification system and nitrifying biomass is inhibited bioaugmentation is not a practical response because the inhibition is sudden and unpredictable and having a large bioaugmentation culture on hand is not realistic more realistic is that the nitrifying biomass acclimates to tcp and retains that acclimation for an extended time here we explore the resilience of nitrifying biomass acclimated to tcp which presents stronger inhibition than phenol we tested whether or not nitrifying biomass enriched from aerobic activated sludge had the ability to develop and sustain resistance to tcp inhibition we evaluated this by testing tcp resistance with semi continuous bioreactors and with sub cultures propagated for up to five generations 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and preparation of stock solutions tcp and other all chemicals were analytical grade purity and were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china for preparation of the ammonium chloride stock solution 7 7 g ammonium chloride was dissolved in 1 l ultrapure deionized water from milli q purifier usa to get an nh4 n concentration of 143 mm to prepare a 2 mm tcp stock solution we first added 0 4 g tcp into a 1000 ml beaker and stirred it for one half hour the contents were moved into 1000 ml volumetric flask to adjust the volume to exactly 1000 ml this solution was further stirred on a magnetic stirrer for three days to ensure that the tcp was fully dissolved in water for preparing nahco3 and phosphate buffers we dissolve 40 g sodium bicarbonate 21 75 g of k2hpo4 4 26 g kh2po4 separately into 1 l of deionized water the trace element solution was prepared according to zou et al 2019 all stock solutions were kept in a refrigerator at 4 c during each experiment the stock solutions were diluted with tap water to get desired initial concentrations in addition 3 ml of the trace element solution was added per 1 l the tap water contributed small amounts of ammonium n nitrate n and nitrite n about 0 5 mg l 0 2 mg l and 0 06 mg l respectively 2 2 acclimation to ammonium and tcp we took activated sludge from the aeration tank of changqiao wwtp in shanghai and acclimated it initially for nitrification for each stage a 1 l cylinder contained the 300 ml sludge 0 6 g glucose ammonium n stock solution of 15 ml trace element of 6 ml phosphate buffer of 6 ml and sodium bicarbonate buffer of 6 ml tap water was then added to make up to a total volume of 1 l the initial nh4 n concentration was 2 1 mm the acclimations were operated at ph 7 5 30 c and with dissolved oxygen do held at 6 7 mg l by aeration using an aquarium air pump acclimation for nitrification lasted for one month in the first stage during which 700 ml supernatant was removed daily after settling of 30 min and replaced with the same volume of fresh medium after one month a stable nitrifying biomass was obtained an initial concentration of ammonium n of 2 1 mm could be removed completely within 6 h to enhance the culturing of nitrifying biomass we decreased the glucose concentration from 600 mg l to 200 mg l in the second stage and stock solutions of nh4 n sodium bicarbonate buffer were increased to 20 ml giving 2 86 mm and 9 ml 4 3 mm respectively with the trace element solution and phosphate buffer still at 6 ml the second stage also lasted one month in the third stage lasting for another month the four cylinders were divided to two groups each group having two cylinders the first group was fed the same solution used to enrich for a nitrifying community the second group gradually substituted phenol for glucose with the same cod in one month and then part phenol was substituted by tcp until the tcp reached 0 28 mm in another month which contributed about 49 mg cod l the remainder of the total cod was contributed by phenol acclimated sludge in the first group was designated normal biomass and the second group was designated acclimated biomass 2 3 comparison of normal biomass with tcp acclimated biomass normal and tcp acclimated biomass were compared for simultaneous nitrification and tcp biodegradation the experiments were performed in 1000 ml graduated cylinder at 30 c ph 7 5 and do concentration of 7 mg l during which 800 ml medium and 200 ml of biomass were fed in each cylinder to give 6 7 gdw l biomass concentration in each experiment the medium was prepared according to the need of the experiment by the following steps media 1 and 2 were prepared by adding 15 ml stock of ammonium chloride 9 ml stock of nahco3 9 ml buffer and 6 ml trace solution into cylinders then 0 05 g glucose was also added in the first cylinder and tap water was made up to 800 ml to get medium 1 for medium 2 the 0 05 g glucose was replaced with 138 ml tcp stock giving an initial tcp concentration of 0 28 mm the do was measured at the start middle and end of experiment the experiment followed a two step sequence 1 glucose nh4cl and nutrients were fed to the acclimated biomass with initial glucose and nh4 n concentrations respectively of 0 28 mm 50 mg l and 2 1 mm 30 mg l 2 nh4cl and nutrients were fed to the biomass but the glucose was replaced by the same cod concentration of tcp the do was 7 to 8 mg l in the experiments measured at the start middle and end of each experiment and each experiment had two replicates samples were taken at time intervals to measure the concentrations of ammonium n nitrate n nitrite n and tcp 2 4 intermittent exposure of nitrifying biomass to tcp to determine whether or not the acclimated nitrifying biomasses could retain its resistance to a sudden tcp exposure tcp was added to the medium after 1 week 2 weeks and 2 months similar to section 2 3 experiments were conducted in parallel with normal biomass for nh4 n removals and tcp biodegradation in the intervals without tcp addition the same cod concentration of glucose replaced tcp in semi continuous mode this set of experiments was carried out in graduated cylinder at 30 c ph 7 5 do concentration of 7 mg l and biomass concentration of 6 to 7 gdw l samples were taken at time intervals to measure their concentrations of ammonium n and tcp 2 5 sub culturing tcp acclimated biomass and the ability to sustain nitrification by exposing bacteria grown in semi continuous culture to tcp after different durations of no tcp exposure the experiments in section 2 4 mimicked a continuously operating system such as activated sludge having a global steady state in this section we utilized a sequence of batch cultivations in which the biomass experienced significant net synthesis in each generation a non steady state condition that required major net growth and created an even stronger test of the ability of the culture to retain its tcp resistance for that five 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks were used for sub culturing and 60 mg glucose 600 mg l 1 5 ml nh4 n stock solution 2 1 mm 1 ml phosphate buffer and 1 ml sodium bicarbonate buffer were added into every erlenmeyer flask tap water was added to make up the liquid volume to 100 ml the flask was autoclaved model ddhz 300 china for 20 min at 0 105 mpa and 121 c 2 ml of tcp acclimated sludge the first generation was inoculated into a cooled erlenmeyer flask and then the flask was put in table type oscillator ldzm 40kcs iii china for the sub culturing at 30 c 200 rpm and for three or four days daily the biomass was settled the supernatant was removed and fresh medium replaced the supernatant to obtain a second generation of nitrifying biomass finally sub cultured biomasses in the five flasks were gathered together in one flask the same processes were repeated for three more times to obtain the third to fifth generations of nitrifying biomass experiments investigated whether the sub cultures of the tcp acclimated biomass could resist sudden tcp exposure the first second third fourth and fifth generations of the sub cultures were exposed to tcp for each experiment 1 5 ml nh4 n stock solution 15 ml tcp stock solution 1 ml phosphate buffer and 1 ml sodium bicarbonate

1 comparison of normal and acclimated biomass to resist tcp the top two panels of fig 1 show that normal and acclimated biomass gave different nitrification rates when tcp was added the ammonium removal rate was 0 35 mm h for the acclimated biomass but only 0 15 mm h for normal biomass acclimated biomass had more than 2 fold faster nitrification than normal biomass with tcp added although the two biomasses gave similar nitrification rates without tcp exposure the result documents that the acclimated biomass could relieve inhibition from tcp compared with normal biomass no3 n was generated nearly stoichiometrically with nh4 n removal with hardly any nitrite generated middle panel thus almost all nh4 n removal was by complete nitrification for tcp removal bottom panel of fig 1 normal biomass hardly degraded tcp while the acclimated biomass gave a tcp removal rate of 0 034 mm h before 2 hours and the rate then increased to 0 065 mm h this trend suggests that tcp had an inhibitory effect on the heterotrophic bacteria but the effect was alleviated as the tcp concentration declined to evaluate whether or not acclimated biomass was statistically different from normal biomass for their nh4 n and tcp removal rates k values as well as no3 n generation rates we used the t test shi et al 2015 lu et al 2019 1 t x y n 1 1 s 1 n 1 2 n 2 1 s 2 n 2 2 n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 2 n 1 n 2 where x is average of k values of normal or acclimated biomass without tcp added control and y is average of k values for normal or acclimated biomass with tcp added s n 1 2 or s n 2 2 was obtained from 2 s n 2 1 n 1 i 1 n x i x 2 all calculated t values listed in tables s1 s3 of supplemental information si were larger than t 0 005 2 9 9248 in which 0 005 means a confidence interval of 99 5 and the 2 in brackets means two groups of repeated experiments thus the k values with tcp added were significantly different from the control experiments at the 0 5 significance level 3 2 ability of the acclimated biomass to retain resistance to tcp tcp was fed to systems containing normal and tcp acclimated biomass after intervals of one week two weeks and two months after the acclimation to tcp was completed during the intervals between tcp additions the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing ammonium n other nutrients and glucose but without tcp figs 2 and 3 show ammonium n and tcp removal rates respectively for both biomasses after tcp additions the tcp acclimated biomass seemed to have a memory of tcp and retained the same ammonium n and tcp removal rates as in fig 1 whether tcp was added after one week two weeks or two months post acclimation although the tcp removal rate decreased a small amount perhaps related to the interval of one week due to loss of gene expression in contrast the normal biomass had low ammonium and minimal tcp removal rates in every case similar to fig 1 tcp removal rates became faster after 2 hours thus the acclimated biomass kept its ability to remove tcp and ammonium n for up to two months when it was not exposed to tcp similarly we used the t test for the experiments of figs 2 and 3 and all calculated t values listed in tables s4 and s5 of si show that acclimated biomass was significantly different from normal biomass for nh4 n and tcp removal rates when tcp was added after one week two weeks and two months at the same 0 5 significance level 3 3 resistance after sub culturing the biomass acclimated to tcp the initial tcp acclimated nitrifying biomass is denoted the first generation 1st g and the biomass was further sub cultured to obtain subsequent biomass generations 2nd g 3rd g 4th g and 5th g the subsequent generations of biomass each at about 1 3 gdw l were used for simultaneous nitrification and tcp biodegradation in flasks and the results are shown in fig 4 all 5 generations of biomasses continued to biodegrade tcp and the trend of increasing tcp removal rate after about 2 h was retained since the nitrification rate only decreased slightly from the 1st g to the 5th g subsequent generations of biomasses still retained the ability to resist tcp inhibition despite having been sub cultured in media without tcp this implies that tcp degrading bacteria were not lost in the subsequent generations fig 4 shows that the sub cultured biomass did not generate nitrate stoichiometrically with the loss of ammonium n which means that nh4 n removal involved heterotrophic synthesis and nitrification together zou et al 2019 because minimal nitrite was generated during simultaneous nh4 n removals and tcp biodegradation the ratios of ammonium n loss for heterotrophic synthesis and nitrification were calculated based on k k h k n zou et al 2019 where k h k n and k are respectively the zero order removal rates for ammonium n removals by heterotrophic synthesis nitrification to nitrate and both processes together the percentages of k h and k n listed in table 1 support that heterotrophic synthesis became more important over time of sub culturing because the sub cultures involved daily growth with new medium a situation that favored the faster growing heterotrophs for the sub cultured acclimated biomass used for simultaneous nitrification and tcp biodegradation fig 4 to differentiate whether or not the 1st g biomass was different from the following 2nd g to 5th g biomasses for their nh4 n and tcp removal rates we compared the k value of 1st g biomass with the k values of the following 2nd g to 5th g biomasses by using the t test the t values are listed in table s6 and s7 of si and all t values were less than t 0 05 2 2 9200 for nh4 n removals and t 0 1 2 1 8856 for tcp removals which means that all 5 generations of biomass have not significant difference among them at the 5 and 10 significance level for nh4 n and tcp removal rates respectively thus the results supported that following generations of biomass still retained their acclimation to tcp for nitrate formation the 1st g biomass was different from the 2nd g to 5th g biomasses according to the t test and the data are listed in table s8 of si in which t values were larger than t 0 005 2 9 9248 when the 1st g biomass was compared with the 2nd g to 5th g biomasses this means that the 1st g biomass was different from the following generation biomasses in the nitrate formation at the 0 5 significance level however t values were less t 0 01 2 6 9646 when the 2nd g biomass was compared with the 3rd g to 5th g biomasses which means that the 2nd g through 5th g biomasses was did not have different rates of nitrate formation at the 1 significance level and the results were consistent the data in table 1 3 4 comparison of microbial communities for normal and acclimated biomasses the alpha diversity indices chao 1 s chao1 and shannon index h obs for richness and evenness respectively were computed from the sequencing results by 3 s chao 1 s obs n 1 n 1 1 2 n 2 1 4 h shannon i 1 s obs n i n ln n i n where n 1 and n 2 are respectively otus with only one read and otus with only two reads ni is number of otus with i sequences and n is number of total sequences fig 5 shows that the normal biomass and tcp acclimated biomasses 1st 3rd and 5th g had minimal differences in the chao1 values which indicated high community richness 1800 otus although all shannon indices were large the decline in the shannon index with generations indicates that biomass was becoming less even i e somewhat more dominated by a few species over time the normal and 1st g acclimated biomasses are compared by their relative abundances at the family level in fig 6 the 12 families with the highest number of reads accounted for more than 60 of the total reads in the two samples analyzed but the members of the top 12 differed between the two biomasses whereas saprospiraceae was the largest family of heterotrophs in the normal biomass rhodanobacteraceae was by far the dominant heterotroph in the tcp acclimated biomass which correlates to their known ability to biodegrade chlorophenolic compounds fang et al 2020 the tcp acclimated biomass had a dominant ammonium oxidizing family nitrosomonadaceae li et al 2016 but the normal biomass had a large population of the nitrite oxidizing nitrospiracea purkhold et al 2000 yuan et al 2016 the abundance of nitrosomonadaceae increased to 9 3 from 2 8 but the abundance of nitrospiraceae decreased to 0 9 from 7 3 while these trends might suggest that tcp adversely affected nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob but not ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob care should be taken to avoid over quantifying the results of dna sequencing sequencing is not a quantitative measure of a type of microorganism due to differences in gene number and extraction efficiency what is important here is that aob and nob were present in both samples which documents that they were present initially and persisted furthermore our documentation of full nitrification figs 1 and 4 also proves that aob an nob were present thus the structure sequencing and function nitrification activity results are complementary fig 7 shows that relative abundances for the 1st g 3rd g and 5th g biomasses at the genus level according to high throughput sequencing the twenty nine most abundant genera in the three samples accounted for more than 80 of the total reads in the three samples analyzed and the most prevalent genera overlapped for the three samples four of the most prevalent genera by number of reads were unidentified the unidentified otu shown in violet color in fig 7 belongs to the alpha proteobacteria whose average abundance in 1st g 3rd g and 5th g was 21 alpha proteobacteria which includes the nob was the most abundant phylum in anoxic oxic a o or anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o systems of full scale wastewater treatment plants that involved to nitrogen removals ali et al 2020 cao et al 2020 meanwhile thauera present at average 2 0 of total reads often exists in sludge together with aob and nob ma et al 2015 which supports that subsequent generations still biodegraded tcp among the identified genera paracoccus increased significantly from the 1st g to the 5th g paracoccus can biodegrade 4 cp and phenol song et al 2019 aridibacter which also increased was detected in activated sludge active in biodegradation of coal pyrolysis wastewater zheng et al 2019 and it has been associated with nitrogen removal song et al 2020 rhizobium which can biodegrade phenolics baek et al 2003 also increased from the 1st g to the 5th g the abundances of other dominant identified bacteria decreased from the 1st g to the 5th g thauera can play an important role in aromatic compound removals yang et al 2013 but its abundance decreased from 5 9 to 0 1 rhodococcus is known to biodegrade tcp or chlorophenolics apajaalahti et al 1986 briglia et al 1996 but it declined with sub culturing likewise the abundance of comamonas decreased from 3 6 to 0 7 although it can biodegrade 4 cp tobajas et al 2012 huang et al 2013 the genus level makeup of the communities changed from the 1st g to the 5th g but genera known to nitrify and to biodegrade compounds aligned with tcp biodegradation always were present the fact that all subsequent generations showed effective tcp removal further supports the persistence of genera of tcp degrading bacteria 4 conclusion nitrifying biomass acclimated to tcp was less inhibited by exposure to tcp in particular the nitrification rate was more than two fold faster for the acclimated biomass while the tcp biodegradation rate went from almost zero without acclimation to 0 065 mm h with acclimation because acclimated nitrifying biomass relieved tcp toxicity that adversely affected the normal biomass most important is that the acclimated biomass retained effective nitrification and tcp biodegradation when it was suddenly exposed to tcp even after two months during which it was not exposed to any tcp the same pattern of retained resistance to tcp inhibition was present for 5 generations of sub culturing without tcp exposure analysis of the community structure of the acclimated biomass documented that nitrifying bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria capable of degrading tcp always were present in the acclimated biomass although the key genera changed during sub culturing declaration of competing

17631,many municipal wastewater treatment plants in china receive industrial wastewater that contains inhibitory organic chemicals such as chlorinated phenols for the common aerobic biological treatment nitrification is a key step but nitrifying bacteria are notably sensitive to inhibition by chlorinated phenols in this work normal activated sludge containing nitrifying biomass was acclimated to 2 4 6 trichlorophenol tcp the acclimated biomass had more than 2 fold faster nitrification kinetics than normal biomass when exposed to tcp and it also achieved effective tcp removal in parallel when suddenly exposed to tcp after as much as two months without tcp input the acclimated nitrifying biomass retained effective nitrification and tcp biodegradation the nitrification rate and tcp removal rate were 0 325 mm h and 0 049 mm h for the acclimated biomass compared to only 0 165 mm h and 0 001 mm h for normal biomass resistance to tcp inhibition also was retained for 5 generations of sub culturing without tcp exposure high throughput sequencing confirmed that the acclimated biomass contained nitrifying bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria capable of degrading tcp although the key genera changed during sub culturing graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords 2 4 6 trichlorophenol nitrifying bacteria acclimation inhibition resistance 1 introduction municipal wastewater is treated mainly by aerobic microbiological processes and nitrification in which nitrifying bacteria oxidize ammonium to nitrite and then nitrate is becoming an increasingly important step rittmann and mccarty 2020 nitrifying bacteria have a slow specific growth rate which means that the process requires a long solids retention time srt duan et al 2013 rittmann and mccarty 2020 in china most municipal wastewater treatment plants mwtps receive industrial wastewater discharged into the municipal sewers xiao et al 2013 chen et al 2014 luo et al 2017 qu et al 2019 although the industrial wastewaters must be pretreated to remove toxicity or inhibition to microorganisms zhang 2019 lyu et al 2020 failure of pretreatment equipment or accidental discharges still occur nitrification often is the process most sensitive to inhibition kassotaki et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 rittmann and mccarty 2020 and severe inhibition can lead to a washout of nitrifying bacteria and loss of nitrification chlorophenols common industrial raw materials used as intermediates for the production of medicines pesticides bactericides antiseptics and solvents for polyester fiber often are present in industrial wastewaters meng et al 2019 daswat and mukhopadhyay 2012 chlorophenols are relatively recalcitrant to biodegradation and they inhibit many microorganisms including nitrifiers müller et al 1998 pamukoglu et al 2008 mo et al 2006 liu et al 2008 studies of the response of nitrifying biomass to intermittent exposure to 2 chlorophenol 2 cp and continuous exposure to 2 4 6 trichlorophenol tcp nevalainen et al 1993 martínez hernández et al 2011 showed significantly reduced nitrification efficiency with the greater effect on ammonium oxidation exposing biomass carrying out simultaneous nitrification and denitrification to 2 4 6 tcp led to lower rates of ammonium removal and the inhibition increased with increasing of initial tcp concentration tong et al 2019 nitrification also was inhibited by less chlorinated phenols silva et al 2011 reported that normal nitrifying sludge was inhibited by 2 cp with ammonium consumption decreasing 93 compared with the control even though the 2 cp was consumed completely during the process martínez hernández et al 2011 also had similar results it is of practical value that nitrifying biomass acclimates to relieve toxicity of contaminants such as chlorinated phenols that can be discharged to municipal wastewater treatment nitrifying biomass can acclimate to phenol and chlorophenols for example 4 chlorophenol 4 cp and ammonium could be biodegraded simultaneously by nitrifying biomass that had been acclimated to 4 cp lim et al 2013 zou et al 2019 acclimated nitrifying biomass to phenol and achieved good simultaneous ammonium and phenol removal rates ammonium was removed by a combination of nitrification and synthesis into heterotrophic biomass nitrifying biomass can become resistant to toxicity of chlorophenols by selection of more resistant strains of nitrifiers by selection of heterotrophic bacteria able to biodegrade the chlorophenols or both together this issue was explored by hou et al 2018 with exposure to pyridine pyridine acclimated biomass resisted pyridine through a combination of enhanced pyridine biodegradation and selection of resistant nitrifying bacteria our interest is in intermittent exposure of nitrifying biomass to tcp will nitrifying biomass that has acclimated to tcp exposure maintain its ability to resist chlorophenol exposure if the exposure is absent for some time of relevance is the work of zou et al 2019 who showed that acclimated nitrifying biomass continued resisting phenol exposure with intermittent exposures to phenol however phenol inhibition to the nitrifying biomass was different from tcp inhibition phenol inhibited nh4 n oxidation by competing for o2 while tcp inhibits the nitrifying biomass due to its toxicity tcp acclimated biomass can relieve the inhibition by biodegrading the tcp when a high concentration of tcp enters a nitrification system and nitrifying biomass is inhibited bioaugmentation is not a practical response because the inhibition is sudden and unpredictable and having a large bioaugmentation culture on hand is not realistic more realistic is that the nitrifying biomass acclimates to tcp and retains that acclimation for an extended time here we explore the resilience of nitrifying biomass acclimated to tcp which presents stronger inhibition than phenol we tested whether or not nitrifying biomass enriched from aerobic activated sludge had the ability to develop and sustain resistance to tcp inhibition we evaluated this by testing tcp resistance with semi continuous bioreactors and with sub cultures propagated for up to five generations 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and preparation of stock solutions tcp and other all chemicals were analytical grade purity and were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china for preparation of the ammonium chloride stock solution 7 7 g ammonium chloride was dissolved in 1 l ultrapure deionized water from milli q purifier usa to get an nh4 n concentration of 143 mm to prepare a 2 mm tcp stock solution we first added 0 4 g tcp into a 1000 ml beaker and stirred it for one half hour the contents were moved into 1000 ml volumetric flask to adjust the volume to exactly 1000 ml this solution was further stirred on a magnetic stirrer for three days to ensure that the tcp was fully dissolved in water for preparing nahco3 and phosphate buffers we dissolve 40 g sodium bicarbonate 21 75 g of k2hpo4 4 26 g kh2po4 separately into 1 l of deionized water the trace element solution was prepared according to zou et al 2019 all stock solutions were kept in a refrigerator at 4 c during each experiment the stock solutions were diluted with tap water to get desired initial concentrations in addition 3 ml of the trace element solution was added per 1 l the tap water contributed small amounts of ammonium n nitrate n and nitrite n about 0 5 mg l 0 2 mg l and 0 06 mg l respectively 2 2 acclimation to ammonium and tcp we took activated sludge from the aeration tank of changqiao wwtp in shanghai and acclimated it initially for nitrification for each stage a 1 l cylinder contained the 300 ml sludge 0 6 g glucose ammonium n stock solution of 15 ml trace element of 6 ml phosphate buffer of 6 ml and sodium bicarbonate buffer of 6 ml tap water was then added to make up to a total volume of 1 l the initial nh4 n concentration was 2 1 mm the acclimations were operated at ph 7 5 30 c and with dissolved oxygen do held at 6 7 mg l by aeration using an aquarium air pump acclimation for nitrification lasted for one month in the first stage during which 700 ml supernatant was removed daily after settling of 30 min and replaced with the same volume of fresh medium after one month a stable nitrifying biomass was obtained an initial concentration of ammonium n of 2 1 mm could be removed completely within 6 h to enhance the culturing of nitrifying biomass we decreased the glucose concentration from 600 mg l to 200 mg l in the second stage and stock solutions of nh4 n sodium bicarbonate buffer were increased to 20 ml giving 2 86 mm and 9 ml 4 3 mm respectively with the trace element solution and phosphate buffer still at 6 ml the second stage also lasted one month in the third stage lasting for another month the four cylinders were divided to two groups each group having two cylinders the first group was fed the same solution used to enrich for a nitrifying community the second group gradually substituted phenol for glucose with the same cod in one month and then part phenol was substituted by tcp until the tcp reached 0 28 mm in another month which contributed about 49 mg cod l the remainder of the total cod was contributed by phenol acclimated sludge in the first group was designated normal biomass and the second group was designated acclimated biomass 2 3 comparison of normal biomass with tcp acclimated biomass normal and tcp acclimated biomass were compared for simultaneous nitrification and tcp biodegradation the experiments were performed in 1000 ml graduated cylinder at 30 c ph 7 5 and do concentration of 7 mg l during which 800 ml medium and 200 ml of biomass were fed in each cylinder to give 6 7 gdw l biomass concentration in each experiment the medium was prepared according to the need of the experiment by the following steps media 1 and 2 were prepared by adding 15 ml stock of ammonium chloride 9 ml stock of nahco3 9 ml buffer and 6 ml trace solution into cylinders then 0 05 g glucose was also added in the first cylinder and tap water was made up to 800 ml to get medium 1 for medium 2 the 0 05 g glucose was replaced with 138 ml tcp stock giving an initial tcp concentration of 0 28 mm the do was measured at the start middle and end of experiment the experiment followed a two step sequence 1 glucose nh4cl and nutrients were fed to the acclimated biomass with initial glucose and nh4 n concentrations respectively of 0 28 mm 50 mg l and 2 1 mm 30 mg l 2 nh4cl and nutrients were fed to the biomass but the glucose was replaced by the same cod concentration of tcp the do was 7 to 8 mg l in the experiments measured at the start middle and end of each experiment and each experiment had two replicates samples were taken at time intervals to measure the concentrations of ammonium n nitrate n nitrite n and tcp 2 4 intermittent exposure of nitrifying biomass to tcp to determine whether or not the acclimated nitrifying biomasses could retain its resistance to a sudden tcp exposure tcp was added to the medium after 1 week 2 weeks and 2 months similar to section 2 3 experiments were conducted in parallel with normal biomass for nh4 n removals and tcp biodegradation in the intervals without tcp addition the same cod concentration of glucose replaced tcp in semi continuous mode this set of experiments was carried out in graduated cylinder at 30 c ph 7 5 do concentration of 7 mg l and biomass concentration of 6 to 7 gdw l samples were taken at time intervals to measure their concentrations of ammonium n and tcp 2 5 sub culturing tcp acclimated biomass and the ability to sustain nitrification by exposing bacteria grown in semi continuous culture to tcp after different durations of no tcp exposure the experiments in section 2 4 mimicked a continuously operating system such as activated sludge having a global steady state in this section we utilized a sequence of batch cultivations in which the biomass experienced significant net synthesis in each generation a non steady state condition that required major net growth and created an even stronger test of the ability of the culture to retain its tcp resistance for that five 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks were used for sub culturing and 60 mg glucose 600 mg l 1 5 ml nh4 n stock solution 2 1 mm 1 ml phosphate buffer and 1 ml sodium bicarbonate buffer were added into every erlenmeyer flask tap water was added to make up the liquid volume to 100 ml the flask was autoclaved model ddhz 300 china for 20 min at 0 105 mpa and 121 c 2 ml of tcp acclimated sludge the first generation was inoculated into a cooled erlenmeyer flask and then the flask was put in table type oscillator ldzm 40kcs iii china for the sub culturing at 30 c 200 rpm and for three or four days daily the biomass was settled the supernatant was removed and fresh medium replaced the supernatant to obtain a second generation of nitrifying biomass finally sub cultured biomasses in the five flasks were gathered together in one flask the same processes were repeated for three more times to obtain the third to fifth generations of nitrifying biomass experiments investigated whether the sub cultures of the tcp acclimated biomass could resist sudden tcp exposure the first second third fourth and fifth generations of the sub cultures were exposed to tcp for each experiment 1 5 ml nh4 n stock solution 15 ml tcp stock solution 1 ml phosphate buffer and 1 ml sodium bicarbonate buffer as well as acclimated biomass were fed in 250 ml flask which was made up to 100 ml biomass was about 1 3 gdw l the flasks were put in thermostatic oscillator at 200 rpm and 30 c for simultaneous nitrification and tcp biodegradation similar to the sections above all experiments had two replicate runs and samples were taken at time intervals to measure their ammonium n nitrate n nitrite n and tcp 2 6 high throughput sequencing of the acclimated sludge samples of normal biomass as well as the first third and fifth generations of sub cultures of the acclimated biomass were sent

1 comparison of normal and acclimated biomass to resist tcp the top two panels of fig 1 show that normal and acclimated biomass gave different nitrification rates when tcp was added the ammonium removal rate was 0 35 mm h for the acclimated biomass but only 0 15 mm h for normal biomass acclimated biomass had more than 2 fold faster nitrification than normal biomass with tcp added although the two biomasses gave similar nitrification rates without tcp exposure the result documents that the acclimated biomass could relieve inhibition from tcp compared with normal biomass no3 n was generated nearly stoichiometrically with nh4 n removal with hardly any nitrite generated middle panel thus almost all nh4 n removal was by complete nitrification for tcp removal bottom panel of fig 1 normal biomass hardly degraded tcp while the acclimated biomass gave a tcp removal rate of 0 034 mm h before 2 hours and the rate then increased to 0 065 mm h this trend suggests that tcp had an inhibitory effect on the heterotrophic bacteria but the effect was alleviated as the tcp concentration declined to evaluate whether or not acclimated biomass was statistically different from normal biomass for their nh4 n and tcp removal rates k values as well as no3 n generation rates we used the t test shi et al 2015 lu et al 2019 1 t x y n 1 1 s 1 n 1 2 n 2 1 s 2 n 2 2 n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 2 n 1 n 2 where x is average of k values of normal or acclimated biomass without tcp added control and y is average of k values for normal or acclimated biomass with tcp added s n 1 2 or s n 2 2 was obtained from 2 s n 2 1 n 1 i 1 n x i x 2 all calculated t values listed in tables s1 s3 of supplemental information si were larger than t 0 005 2 9 9248 in which 0 005 means a confidence interval of 99 5 and the 2 in brackets means two groups of repeated experiments thus the k values with tcp added were significantly different from the control experiments at the 0 5 significance level 3 2 ability of the acclimated biomass to retain resistance to tcp tcp was fed to systems containing normal and tcp acclimated biomass after intervals of one week two weeks and two months after the acclimation to tcp was completed during the intervals between tcp additions the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing ammonium n other nutrients and glucose but without tcp figs 2 and 3 show ammonium n and tcp removal rates respectively for both biomasses after tcp additions the tcp acclimated biomass seemed to have a memory of tcp and retained the same ammonium n and tcp removal rates as in fig 1 whether tcp was added after one week two weeks or two months post acclimation although the tcp removal rate decreased a small amount perhaps related to the interval of one week due to loss of gene expression in contrast the normal biomass had low ammonium and minimal tcp removal rates in every case similar to fig 1 tcp removal rates became faster after 2 hours thus the acclimated biomass kept its ability to remove tcp and ammonium n for up to two months when it was not exposed to tcp similarly we used the t test for the experiments of figs 2 and 3 and all calculated t values listed in tables s4 and s5 of si show that acclimated biomass was significantly different from normal biomass for nh4 n and tcp removal rates when tcp was added after one week two weeks and two months at the same 0 5 significance level 3 3 resistance after sub culturing the biomass acclimated to tcp the initial tcp acclimated nitrifying biomass is denoted the first generation 1st g and the biomass was further sub cultured to obtain subsequent biomass generations 2nd g 3rd g 4th g and 5th g the subsequent generations of biomass each at about 1 3 gdw l were used for simultaneous nitrification and tcp biodegradation in flasks and the results are shown in fig 4 all 5 generations of biomasses continued to biodegrade tcp and the trend of increasing tcp removal rate after about 2 h was retained since the nitrification rate only decreased slightly from the 1st g to the 5th g subsequent generations of biomasses still retained the ability to resist tcp inhibition despite having been sub cultured in media without tcp this implies that tcp degrading bacteria were not lost in the subsequent generations fig 4 shows that the sub cultured biomass did not generate nitrate stoichiometrically with the loss of ammonium n which means that nh4 n removal involved heterotrophic synthesis and nitrification together zou et al 2019 because minimal nitrite was generated during simultaneous nh4 n removals and tcp biodegradation the ratios of ammonium n loss for heterotrophic synthesis and nitrification were calculated based on k k h k n zou et al 2019 where k h k n and k are respectively the zero order removal rates for ammonium n removals by heterotrophic synthesis nitrification to nitrate and both processes together the percentages of k h and k n listed in table 1 support that heterotrophic synthesis became more important over time of sub culturing because the sub cultures involved daily growth with new medium a situation that favored the faster growing heterotrophs for the sub cultured acclimated biomass used for simultaneous nitrification and tcp biodegradation fig 4 to differentiate whether or not the 1st g biomass was different from the following 2nd g to 5th g biomasses for their nh4 n and tcp removal rates we compared the k value of 1st g biomass with the k values of the following 2nd g to 5th g biomasses by using the t test the t values are listed in table s6 and s7 of si and all t values were less than t 0 05 2 2 9200 for nh4 n removals and t 0 1 2 1 8856 for tcp removals which means that all 5 generations of biomass have not significant difference among them at the 5 and 10 significance level for nh4 n and tcp removal rates respectively thus the results supported that following generations of biomass still retained their acclimation to tcp for nitrate formation the 1st g biomass was different from the 2nd g to 5th g biomasses according to the t test and the data are listed in table s8 of si in which t values were larger than t 0 005 2 9 9248 when the 1st g biomass was compared with the 2nd g to 5th g biomasses this means that the 1st g biomass was different from the following generation biomasses in the nitrate formation at the 0 5 significance level however t values were less t 0 01 2 6 9646 when the 2nd g biomass was compared with the 3rd g to 5th g biomasses which means that the 2nd g through 5th g biomasses was did not have different rates of nitrate formation at the 1 significance level and the results were consistent the data in table 1 3 4 comparison of microbial communities for normal and acclimated biomasses the alpha diversity indices chao 1 s chao1 and shannon index h obs for richness and evenness respectively were computed from the sequencing results by 3 s chao 1 s obs n 1 n 1 1 2 n 2 1 4 h shannon i 1 s obs n i n ln n i n where n 1 and n 2 are respectively otus with only one read and otus with only two reads ni is number of otus with i sequences and n is number of total sequences fig 5 shows that the normal biomass and tcp acclimated biomasses 1st 3rd and 5th g had minimal differences in the chao1 values which indicated high community richness 1800 otus although all shannon indices were large the decline in the shannon index with generations indicates that biomass was becoming less even i e somewhat more dominated by a few species over time the normal and 1st g acclimated biomasses are compared by their relative abundances at the family level in fig 6 the 12 families with the highest number of reads accounted for more than 60 of the total reads in the two samples analyzed but the members of the top 12 differed between the two biomasses whereas saprospiraceae was the largest family of heterotrophs in the normal biomass rhodanobacteraceae was by far the dominant heterotroph in the tcp acclimated biomass which correlates to their known ability to biodegrade chlorophenolic compounds fang et al 2020 the tcp acclimated biomass had a dominant ammonium oxidizing family nitrosomonadaceae li et al 2016 but the normal biomass had a large population of the nitrite oxidizing nitrospiracea purkhold et al 2000 yuan et al 2016 the abundance of nitrosomonadaceae increased to 9 3 from 2 8 but the abundance of nitrospiraceae decreased to 0 9 from 7 3 while these trends might suggest that tcp adversely affected nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob but not ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob care should be taken to avoid over quantifying the results of dna sequencing sequencing is not a quantitative measure of a type of microorganism due to differences in gene number and extraction efficiency what is important here is that aob and nob were present in both samples which documents that they were present initially and persisted furthermore our documentation of full nitrification figs 1 and 4 also proves that aob an nob were present thus the structure sequencing and function nitrification activity results are complementary fig 7 shows that relative abundances for the 1st g 3rd g and 5th g biomasses at the genus level according to high throughput sequencing the twenty nine most abundant genera in the three samples accounted for more than 80 of the total reads in the three samples analyzed and the most prevalent genera overlapped for the three samples four of the most prevalent genera by number of reads were unidentified the unidentified otu shown in violet color in fig 7 belongs to the alpha proteobacteria whose average abundance in 1st g 3rd g and 5th g was 21 alpha proteobacteria which includes the nob was the most abundant phylum in anoxic oxic a o or anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o systems of full scale wastewater treatment plants that involved to nitrogen removals ali et al 2020 cao et al 2020 meanwhile thauera present at average 2 0 of total reads often exists in sludge together with aob and nob ma et al 2015 which supports that subsequent generations still biodegraded tcp among the identified genera paracoccus increased significantly from the 1st g to the 5th g paracoccus can biodegrade 4 cp and phenol song et al 2019 aridibacter which also increased was detected in activated sludge active in biodegradation of coal pyrolysis wastewater zheng et al 2019 and it has been associated with nitrogen removal song et al 2020 rhizobium which can biodegrade phenolics baek et al 2003 also increased from the 1st g to the 5th g the abundances of other dominant identified bacteria decreased from the 1st g to the 5th g thauera can play an important role in aromatic compound removals yang et al 2013 but its abundance decreased from 5 9 to 0 1 rhodococcus is known to biodegrade tcp or chlorophenolics apajaalahti et al 1986 briglia et al 1996 but it declined with sub culturing likewise the abundance of comamonas decreased from 3 6 to 0 7 although it can biodegrade 4 cp tobajas et al 2012 huang et al 2013 the genus level makeup of the communities changed from the 1st g to the 5th g but genera known to nitrify and to biodegrade compounds aligned with tcp biodegradation always were present the fact that all subsequent generations showed effective tcp removal further supports the persistence of genera of tcp degrading bacteria 4 conclusion nitrifying biomass acclimated to tcp was less inhibited by exposure to tcp in particular the nitrification rate was more than two fold faster for the acclimated biomass while the tcp biodegradation rate went from almost zero without acclimation to 0 065 mm h with acclimation because acclimated nitrifying biomass relieved tcp toxicity that adversely affected the normal biomass most important is that the acclimated biomass retained effective nitrification and tcp biodegradation when it was suddenly exposed to tcp even after two months during which it was not exposed to any tcp the same pattern of retained resistance to tcp inhibition was present for 5 generations of sub culturing without tcp exposure analysis of the community structure of the acclimated biomass documented that nitrifying bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria capable of degrading tcp always were present in the acclimated biomass although the key genera changed during sub culturing declaration of competing

17632,membrane fouling restricts the wide applications of membrane technology and therefore it is essential to develop novel analytical techniques to characterize membrane fouling and to further understand the mechanism behind it in this work we demonstrate a capability of high resolution large scale 3d visualization and quantification of the foulants on in membranes during fouling process based on light sheet fluorescence microscopy as a noninvasive reproducible optical approach the adsorption processes of dextran dex on in two polyvinylidene fluoride membranes with similar pore structure but distinct surface hydrophilicity were clearly observed for a hydrophilic polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane the diffusion and adsorption of the dex in membrane matrix were much slower compared to that for a hydrophobic membrane a concentrated foulant layer was observed in the superficial potion of the hydrophilic membrane matrix while the foulants were observed quickly penetrating across the overall hydrophobic pvdf membrane during a short adsorption process both the inner concentrated fouling layer in membrane superficial portion and the foulant penetration in membrane asymmetric structure presented correlations with membrane fouling irreversibility which could elucidate the microscopic events of hydrophilic membrane in resisting fouling in addition the imaging results could be correlated with the xdlvo analysis suggesting how the membrane foulant and foulant foulant interfacial interactions resulted in a time dependent membrane fouling process this work provides a fast highly sensitive and noninvasive imaging platform for in situ characterization of membrane fouling evolution and should be useful for a wide range of membrane based process explorations graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane fouling mechanism foulant depth distribution in situ characterization light sheet fluorescence microscopy 1 introduction membrane based water purification process has received increasing attention in the past decades due to its excellent sieving capability compact occupation and automatic operation however one of the major limitations for its widespread implementations is membrane fouling an attachment accumulation or adsorption of various foulants onto membrane surfaces and or inside membrane pores fouling results in a rapid decrease in membrane permeability and lifetime as well as in an increase in operating membrane replacement cost chew et al 2017 polyakov and zydney 2013 in whether membrane based drinking water plant or waste water treatment process organic foulants are considered to be the main foulants for membrane fouling including polysaccharides proteins humic substances etc among these soluble polysaccharides as key components of dissolved organic matter dom are recognized as crucial fouling precursors for most water treatment scenarios taking membrane bioreactor mbr for example polysaccharide like substance features a complex mixture of soluble microbial products smp and flocs embedded in a polymeric network of extracellular polymeric substances eps once filtered they create highly hydrated gel particles or layers providing a significant resistance to permeate flow during membrane process the high fouling propensity of polysaccharide attribute not only to its electroneutrality and small molecular dimension but also to its interfacial intermolecular properties meng et al 2018 more importantly small electroneutral polysaccharide substances have been proposed as a main factor for membrane irreversible fouling because they could form a non covalent network with membrane or other organic matters fu et al 2018 neemann et al 2013 wang et al 2013 xiao et al 2013 yamamura et al 2008 a number of recent studies xiao et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 have evidenced that polysaccharides were abundant on the membrane foulant interface due to its hydroxyl rich character suggesting that they were preferably adsorbed by polymeric membranes the studies have also demonstrated that the investigation of static adsorption contributed substantially to the understanding of initial fouling process li et at investigated the static adsorption of polysaccharide and its hybrids on modified membranes with different surface hydrophilicity and demonstrated that inner adsorption and pore blocking were the major aspects of fouling creation of polysaccharide like substance in membrane process li et al 2018 however adsorptive fouling is a complex process that can be affected by a number of factors such as membrane surface physicochemical properties foulant chemistry and water chemistry it remains unclear how the essential microscopic mesoscopic events control internal fouling on a hydrophilic membrane especially for polysaccharide fouling the studies related to membrane surface modifications have unfortunately led to conflicting results showing that the fouling indexes of polysaccharides were not obviously different despite the significantly improved membrane wettability banti et al 2018 matar et al 2016 neemann et al 2013 moreover it remains challenging for existing fouling models and theories to thoroughly interpret membrane fouling behaviors due to the lack of considerations on the membrane configurable pore diameter asymmetric structure etc effects in fouling progress it was evidenced that the adsorption isotherms and thermodynamics had no apparent correlation with membrane fouling resistance suggesting that the extent of fouling was mainly determined by the major fouling mechanism instead of the mass of foulants yu et al 2019 therefore there is a demand to explore new perspectives about membrane adsorptive mechanism with electroneutral matters and consequently it is of great interest to monitor and quantify the adsorptive behaviors of a highly asymmetric and porous polymer matrix in addition to conventional methods e g flux decline semi empirical models and direct observation to obtain information on the evolution of permeate flux and trans membrane pressure over time a number of new analytical techniques have been developed and applied to investigate membrane fouling chen et al 2018 ferrando et al 2005 fortunato et al 2017 kiefer et al 2014 li et al 2016 luo et al 2018 meng and li 2019 sim et al 2013 tang et al 2020 valencia et al 2013 among them optical and spectroscopic techniques have been extensively used to provide chemical compositions of foulants as highly sensitive and noninvasive imaging tools for example laser induced microscopy lim has been recently applied to achieve in situ visualization of concentration polarization during membrane ultrafiltration based on fluorescence contrast although its simplified optical setup provides limited 2d spatial information meng and li 2019 surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers and stimulated raman scattering srs microscopy have been successfully applied to differentiate the chemical compositions of membrane foulants for fouling study without labeling they have a great potential for online monitoring of membrane fouling evolution although at the present stage the 3d spatial chemical distribution measurements of the membrane are undertaken after the filtration and the sample was clamped by slides chen et al 2017 cui et al 2011 confocal scanning laser microscopy cslm has been widely used to explore the characterization of membrane structure and fouling behavior by providing high resolution 3d fluorescence profiles nevertheless the penetration depth of cslm has been limited to a few tens of μm and the measurements have been undertaken after the fouling process in current published work ferrando et al 2005 zator et al 2007 it is also noted that the acquisition of millimeter scale sample volumes for clsm is prohibitively slow e g a few to tens of minutes for mm3 region due to its point scanning process in recent years light sheet fluorescence microscopy lsfm has been developed as a cost effective and relatively rapid means to acquire high resolution 3d images of intact samples on relatively large scale e g mm cm with fluorescence huisken et al 2004 keller et al 2008 it is a wide field form of optical sectioning imaging technique in which a sheet of light with a well defined thickness is used for illumination and the illumination and detection are performed through two distinct orthogonal optical paths compared with clsm lsfm can provide 3d visualization with comparable high spatial resolution but much higher time resolution e g a few to tens of seconds for mm3 region in addition it can be easily adapted to image relatively large samples making it extensively attractive for real time noninvasive on line membrane fouling monitoring nevertheless to the best of our knowledge the lsfm technique has not been used to investigate the membrane structure and fouling process in this paper a noninvasive fast and highly sensitive membrane fouling imaging platform based on lsfm technique is established and applied for the first time for high resolution large scale 3d visualization of the foulants in membranes fouling process the labeled dextran dex is selected as the surrogate of polysaccharide like substance to perform membrane fouling due to its uniform molecular weight mw distribution and stable chemistry chen et al 2017 the 3d distributions of dex over the entire membrane are directly observed at a high spatial and time resolution and further quantified by imaging processing and analysis moreover to unravel the microscopic events of membrane hydrophilicity in resisting fouling the adsorption behaviors of two polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes with similar pore structure but distinct surface hydrophilicity are thoroughly compared and the relationship among membrane physicochemical properties fouling depth profile and fouling reversibility is discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals pvdf solvay chemicals co china non solvent additives of pluronic f127 and poly ethylene glycol peg mw 12 000 milliporesigma usa and solvent of n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp benchmark chemical china were used in membrane preparation nacl and isopropanol ipa were purchased from the guangfu fine chemical research institute tianjin china peg aladdin china and poly ethylene oxide peo aladdin china with different molecular weight were used to evaluate membrane selectivity dextran fluorescein fitc dex 70 kda milliporesigma usa was used as model foulant to investigate membrane adsorption fouling in which the solution concentration was 25 mg l deionized di water used in this work was purified by using merck millipore system millipore co billerica ma 2 2 membrane fabrication two kinds of pvdf membranes with similar pore structure and selectivity but different hydrophilicity i e the hydrophilic hil and the hydrophobic hob were fabricated by using the phase inversion method as described previously zhang et al 2019 in order to tailor the hydrophilicity and pore structure of the prepared membranes the copolymers and nacl solutions were employed as the pore forming agent and coagulation bath respectively generally the casting solution was prepared by mixing polymer pvdf and copolymers f127 or peg with solvent nmp in sequence the solution was then heated to approximately 60 c under the atmosphere of nitrogen and stirred at 600 rpm to achieve a homogeneous mixture after that the degassed solution was casted on an optical mirror using a film applicator paul n gardner company inc pompano beach fl usa with a casting thickness setting of 200 μm the casted solution was then immediately immersed in coagulation to perform solidification moreover the hydrophobic pvdf membranes were obtained by immersing in a 50 wt ipa solution for 4 h where the residual hydrophilic copolymers that entangled in membrane matrix could be removed table 1 lists the compositions of casting solutions corresponding to different bath conditions and post treatment protocols 2 3 membrane characterization the superficial atomic composition of the prepared membranes was analyzed by a k alpha xps thermo fisher scientific west palm beach fl usa the water contact angles on each membrane surface were measured by using a dsa 25s micro drop shape analyzer krűss gmbh hamburg germany with the sessile drop method a water drop of 1 μl for each membrane the averaged values from five random locations were used the porosity of prepared membranes was calculated by 1 porosity w w w d ρ v where ww and wd were the weights of the wet membranes and dry membranes respectively ρ the density of di water and v the volume of the dry membranes membrane performance and fouling behaviors were evaluated by using a cross flow filtration device with an effective filtration area of 3 4 cm2 the velocity of the retentate was calculated by a flow meter to indicate the cross flow rate a me2002t balance mettler toledo llc columbus oh usa was used to collect and weight the permeate briefly membranes were pressurized at 0 1 mpa in di water for at least 30 min until the stable original flux was reached membrane permeability was evaluated by di water flux with the tmp of 0 07 mpa 10 psi the constant flux j l m2 h was given by eq 2 where v was the permeate volume l a the effective filtration area m2 and t the filtration time h 2 j v a t membrane selectivity was evaluated through molecular weight cut off mwco analyses a series of filtration experiments were sequentially carried out with solutions containing 1 g l of peg peo of increasing mws 10 20 35 100 200 300 400 and 600 kda with the tmp of 0 07 mpa 10 psi where the cross flow velocity cfv was set at ca 1 m s to minimize the effect of concentration polarization on membrane apparent sieving ability mehta and zydney 2005 for each filtration run the initial 2 g of effluent was discarded to avoid interference from previous filtration the mwco of the membrane was determined as the lowest mw where 95 peg peo was retained the rejection r was given by 3 r 1 c p c f 100 where cp was the permeate concentration in mg l and cf was the feed concentration mg l both of them were measured by a total organic carbon toc analyzer shimadzu co kyoto japan the reported results of membrane performances and surface physicochemical parameters were the mean values from three independent samples unless otherwise specified 2 4 membrane fouling test the membrane critical fluxes jc were determined by increasing tmp step by step since it is difficult to control the tmp at low enough values in critical flux measurements for uf membranes and dilute feeds wu et al 1999 the cfv was fixed at ca 1 m s to minimize experimental errors the step height was 0 01 mpa before and after the critical point in each step tmp was increased at a fixed time interval of 30 min and the steady flux js within each interval was recorded the feed solutions were di water and dex solution 25 mg l respectively the first point deviating from the linearity in the flux increasing curve was corresponding to the critical flux in fouling experiments the membrane irreversible fouling was characterized by static single side adsorption see next section and dynamic filtration respectively in which a 25 mg l dex solution was used as feed solution before fouling all membranes were pressurized at 0 1 mpa in di water for at least 30 min until stable original flux j0 was reached for dynamic filtration the fouling was performed at a given tmp cfv couple that corresponded to membrane sustainable conditions at the end of each fouling stage the di water flux of the fouled membrane was determined and recorded as jf for each fouled membrane physical cleaning tmp 0 mpa was performed in the cross flow cell with di water for 5 min in which the cross flow rate was controlled at ca 2 m s by adjusting the valves and the di water flux of the cleaned membrane was recorded as jc as a result the membrane irreversible fouling was given as eq 4 three separated samples for each hil and hob membrane were used in both the dynamic fouling and the static single side adsorption experiments 4 ir 1 j c j f j 0 j f 100 the membrane adsorption capacity qe mg g was calculated from isothermal

concentration mg l of dex solution after adsorption and m g is the mass of the pulverized membrane sample before adsorption 5 q e c 0 c e v m 2 5 3d imaging system based on lsfm the conventional method for obtaining 3d fluorescence information is through the use of cslm which provides the optical sectioning by using the confocal aperture to reject the out of focus fluorescent photons it is inherently based on scanning and thus prohibitively slow the excitation light illuminates not just the small volume of interest but a cone of the sample above and below the volume resulting in a waste of valuable fluorophores to address the challenge of visualizing larger samples with high spatial temporal resolution while preserving the sample under low irradiation levels lsfm has been developed with a rapid growth in last decades lsfm is a noninvasive fast and highly sensitive optical method for relatively large scale 3d visualization it is a fluorescence imaging technique that uses a focused light sheet e g optically confining light to a single slice to selectively illuminate the sample from the side at the focal plane of the detection optical path which is arranged orthogonal to the illumination path the light sheet restricts the excitation to the plane of interest and consequently fluorescence is excited only in the desired plane forming wide field optical sectioning the entire plane without out of focus light can be projected to 2d light detectors i e camera based detection which is equivalent to the image obtained with lscm but without the need for confocal aperture and the scanning this highly efficient excitation collection scheme provides rapid acquisition and minimal light dose making lsfm a powerful non invasive tool to observe dynamic processes for longer periods of time the general principles are illustrated in fig 1 a generally a lsfm system consists of four essential units including illumination detection movement and control in illumination unit it is of importance to generate an appropriate light sheet with the optimized properties of thickness uniformity and penetration ability for various applications since the visible light is used in lsfm diffraction limits the dimensions of the light sheet and the achievable thickness depends on the field of view fov it illuminates generally the lateral spatial resolution is equivalent to that in a wide field microscope given by the numerical aperture na of the detection optics the wavelength of the fluorescence and the sampling resolution i e calculated from the pixel size of the detection device and the magnification of the system the axial resolution is determined by the light sheet thickness in most systems there are two main approaches to generate light sheets as illustrated in fig 1 b a static light sheet can be produced by collimating a beam in one dimension and focusing it in another dimension using the combination of cylindrical optics and the objective lens alternatively a virtual light sheet can be generated by focusing a laser beam to a single line and then rapidly scanning it vertically in lsfm illumination and detection are performed through two distinct and orthogonal optical paths to obtain 3d image stacks the sample can be quickly moved over the desired axis typically along the optical axis of the detection system using the translation stage when the optical arrangement is fixed alternatively in order to improve the acquisition speed 3d image stacks can be acquired by simultaneously moving the light sheet and the focal plane using scanning optics and locked in electronics signals when the sample is fixed practical realizations of lsfm can be adapted to the samples of interest in various applications the experimental setup was consisted of a lsfm system and a water chamber of 30 30 30 mm3 as illustrated in fig 2 the chamber was made of quartz for optical transparency in lsfm a spectrally filtered 472 40 nm ultrafast fiber laser pumped super continuum source wl sc 400 4 fianium ltd with the power of 20 mw was used for excitation a virtual light sheet was generated in the membrane sample through a digital scanning system gvs212 thorlabs in the focal plane of the illumination objective 10 na 0 25 olympus lmplanfln in the detection path fluorescence images were collected by a scoms camera 95b photometrics 1200 1200 11 μm pixel size through the detection objective 10 na 0 25 olympus lmplanfln and the corresponding tube lens with a yfp filter 525 39 nm the detection objective was mounted on a focus drive objective scanner p73 z coremorrow and synchronized with the digital scanning system in the illumination path providing a fast and large scale acquisition prior to adsorption each fresh membrane was immersed in ultrapure water overnight a 25 mg l dex solution was used to carry out the static single sided adsorption fouling experiment the membranes were fixed to the bottom of the chamber with a 30 angle to allow a direct laser illumination from the side of the chamber to the window of observation during each adsorption experiment the same membrane area was imaged at 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 4 h 6 h and 8 h in each acquisition lsfm images were recorded in 3 μm step along the detection axis 100 frames with the integration time of 0 05 s were recorded for membrane samples resulting in the total acquisition time at 9 s all the acquisition setting and hardware control were written by labview software the theoretical spatial resolution of the developed lsfm system with 10 illumination detection objectives and 11 μm pixel size scmos camera was 2 2 μm lateral and 7 μm axial with the effective fov of 1 2 mm this resolution can be easily improved to sub μm lateral and 2 4 μm axial by using objectives with higher magnification and nas but at the cost of a reduced fov this fov limitation can be further addressed by stitching over multiple acquisitions in lsfm there are also other sophisticated approaches for lsfm which can provide faster imaging and superior resolution e g lattice light sheet chen et al 2014 airy beam vettenburg et al 2014 and so on mahou et al 2014 planchon et al 2011 2 6 imaging data processing the image processes were performed using imagej software u s national institute of health and 3d rendering of the volumetric data was produced using imaris for direct visualization comparison the same parameters were used for the display of each image stack at different adsorption time points 2 7 interfacial energy calculation membrane surface wettability was evaluated by calculating the surface area corrected solid liquid interfacial free energy δ g m l here the liquid refers to water which was determined from a modified young dupré equations wenzel 1949 6 δ g m l 1 cos θ γ l where θ is the measured water contact angle that modified by roughness area ratio parameter i e the ratio of actual membrane surface area to the geometric area and γl the surface tension of pure water the subscripts m and l correspond to membrane and liquid respectively furthermore by measuring the contact angles of two polar liquids water and glycerol and one apolar liquid diiodomethane with known surface tension the membrane surface tension including lifshitz van der waals γlw and lewis acid base γab components comprising electron donor γ and electron acceptor γ can be calculated by solving extended young dupré equations 7 1 cos θ γ l 2 γ m l w γ l l w γ m γ l γ m γ l here the γlm γ and γ represent lw electron acceptor and electron donor component of the solid surface tension

of hydrophilic membranes in resist fouling two porous pvdf membranes showing similar pore structure but distinct surface hydrophilicity were intentionally prepared i e the hydrophilic hil membrane and the hydrophobic hob one fig 3 a shows the performances and the physicochemical parameters of both pvdf membranes the membrane permeability porosity and averaged pore diameter were evaluated through the measurements of water flux wet dry method and hagen poiseuille equation respectively the membrane selectivity was characterized by measuring the mwco as shown in the results both membranes exhibited similar water flux and obtained 95 rejection of peo at 180 200 kda i e mwco of 180 200 kda fig 3 b suggesting that they possessed similar pore structures the red dotted lines in fig 3 b showed that the rejection rate of the hil and the hob membrane for dex were about 75 and 72 respectively revealing that the dex could enter into the membrane pores and result in inner adsorption membrane surface wettability and hydrophilicity were evaluated by using the solid liquid interfacial free energy δ g m l and the interfacial free energy of cohesion δ g m w m t o t respectively hurwitz et al 2010 liang et al 2013 providing fundamental insights into membrane surface properties due to the description of surface energy and morphology as shown in fig 3 c the interfacial free energy of hil δ g m l 127 4 mj m2 and hob δ g m l 73 1 mj m2 membrane were positive revealing that both of them could be wetted by water in filtration process it is also noted that the hil membrane exhibited positive free energy of cohesion δ g m w m t o t 19 2 mj m2 at contact between two membrane surfaces while the hob membrane exhibited negative value δ g m w m t o t 42 1 mj m2 this suggests that only the hil membrane should be considered non cohesive when immersed in water i e hydrophilic as shown in fig 3 d the enhanced surface hydrophilicity of the hil membrane could partially attribute to its higher oxygen content i e 10 7 at which was a result of the segregation of the amphipathic f127 during membrane formation process in contrast the low oxygen content i e 1 9 at detected on the hob membrane surface was in line with its hydrophobicity demonstrating that most of the hydrophilic peg had been removed by ipa post treatment loh and wang 2013 3 2 membrane fouling behaviors in sustainable condition to make this study closer to industrial process the membrane critical flux was measured and afterwards their corresponding fouling behavior in a sustainable condition was investigated fig 4 a and b show the membrane flux as a function of tmps for dex solution and di water it is clear that both the hil and the hob membranes belong to the weak form of critical flux since the dex solution flux started to deviate from the pure water line at the very beginning bacchin et al 2006 suggesting that the dex fouling was noticeable even at a very low tmp in addition according to the basic concept of critical flux i e a shift point of polarized concentration transformed to deposition the corresponding pressure of critical flux of the hil membrane and the hob membrane was no more than 0 05 mpa and 0 04 mpa respectively critical flux is a concept of significance to optimize filtration productivity and in industry water treatment often operates at an upper limit of critical or sustainable fluxes as it allows a higher permeability throughout a run bacchin et al 2006 therefore for both theoretical and practical purposes the sustainable condition field and pearce 2011 corresponding to a tmp at which the flux can fulfill the filtration capacity of each membrane was selected to further evaluate the membrane fouling behavior i e 0 05 mpa for the hil membrane and 0 04 mpa for the hob membrane fig 4 c shows the membrane irreversible fouling irc that measured at a sustainable condition indicating that the irreversible fouling for both membranes was increased as the operation time increased and then reached to a steady state after 6 h filtration in addition the relatively lower fouling propensity of the hil membrane demonstrated that the hil membrane possessed enhanced antifouling performance compared with the hob membrane in order to unravel the roles of static adsorption in membrane fouling process the adsorption fouling index i ira irc was designed and calculated as illustrated in fig 4 d in which the higher the i value the greater the contribution of adsorption fouling for overall fouling as shown in such sustainable condition for whether the hil membrane or the hob membrane the i value was 0 8 and there was no substantial fluctuation during 8 hour operations this revealed that adsorption was the main fouling mechanism of dex especially for the operation of membrane process with a sustainable flux moreover previous study has evidenced that the investigation of static adsorption contributes to the comprehensive understanding of the initial fouling process which significantly affects membrane fouling and antifouling behavior li et al 2018 therefore compared with other fouling mechanisms it is of importance to obtain an effective thorough observation and profound understanding of adsorption fouling which is essential to develop fouling mitigation strategies and antifouling materials 3 3 3d visualization and quantification of the adsorption process since lsfm is a wide field form of optical sectioning imaging performed through two orthogonal paths and long working distance objectives were employed in both the illumination and the detection path in our system there was no necessity for extra sample preparations as in previous publications e g cutting applying removing embedding medium and clapping down allowing noninvasive repeatable high resolution large scale 3d imaging acquired at different time points during the membrane fouling experiment 1 2 1 2 0 3 mm3 of each hob and hil membrane were imaged at 0 5 1 2 4 6 and 8 h during the static single sided adsorption process in this study the performed static single side adsorption was believed more closer to practical single side membrane filtration process than the conventional isothermal adsorption process commonly performed by pulverized membrane samples as in the later process foulant can easily entered into membrane from the large voids that located in membrane bottom surface and eventually resulted in extra fouling the display images were cropped for zoom in details fig 5 shows the volumetric 3d reconstructions of hob and hil membranes fouled by dex during the static single side adsorption fig 5 b e show the horizontal sectioned views of both membranes at different depths and f shows the cross sectioned views of fouled membranes at different time points in which xz represents the cross sections of membrane and xy represents horizontal sections of membrane at different depth from the surface in the hob fouling profiles the fluorescence intensity increased quickly towards the inner supporting structure along with the adsorption time and the dex was not concentrated at the dense surface it is noted that the images were in accord with the micro structure of membrane matrix with the accumulated or adsorbed dex in the membrane for example the pore diameter of the hob membrane increased from its top surface fig 5 b to the supporting layer fig 5 d and a typical finger like structure was shown in the cross section images fig 5 f in the hil fouling profiles although the overall fluorescence intensity increased along with the adsorption time the intensity of the surface and the superficial portion of the membrane within 30 μm beneath the surface were much higher than that of the deeper membranes this kind of straightforward noninvasive large scale 3d visualization directly shows the dex adsorption fouling evolution process on in the hob and hil membranes illustrating the distinct dex adsorption behaviors with the hydrophilicity of the membrane fig 6 a and b show the comparison of the overall fluorescence intensity in the same sized areas and the adsorption capacity qe at each time points during the static single side adsorption in the hob and the hil membrane the fouling stage of 0 8 h was employed to illustrate the fouling differences between the hob and the hil membrane the dex fouled hob membrane exhibited a higher fluorescence intensity than the hil membrane illustrating more serious membrane fouling caused by dex in hob membrane than hil membrane it is clear that the increase of the fluorescence intensity shows the same trend with the increase of the adsorption capacity with the adsorption time in addition the ratio of adsorption capacity of hil membrane to hob membrane is 0 4 0 48 0 54 0 58 0 55 and 0 73 at the time point of 0 5 1 2 4 6 and 8 h respectively the data of fluorescence intensity shows the similar proportions fig 6 a at each time point demonstrating that this high resolution large scale fluorescence imaging technique can be used to characterize the adsorption fouling behavior of the highly asymmetric and porous membranes to further evaluate the dynamic foulant distributions between two kinds of membranes the fluorescence intensity distributions at different depths in the dextran fouled hob and hil membrane after 0 5 1 2 4 6 and 8 h adsorption were calculated at every 5 μm depth range using computerized image analysis as shown in fig 7 although both of the dex fouled membranes exhibited a relatively lower intensity in deeper areas the fluorescence intensity of the fouled hob membrane increased much rapidly with the increase of the depth as compared to the fouled hil membrane illustrating a quick and deep adsorption of dex in the hob membrane as shown in fig 7 d the adsorbed dex in the hob membrane had already reached up to 180 μm after just 4 h adsorption i e within the first 4 h in the next 4 h i e 4 8 hour adsorption although there was an increase of the fluorescence intensity in each depth range the overall depth profiling of the fouled hob membrane maintained the similar shape in contrast the penetration of adsorbed dex in the hil membrane increased much slowly in the overall 8 hour adsorption process and the fluorescence intensity at the increased depth range was much lower than that of the hob membrane it is also noted that although there was a peak around the depth of 30 50 μm in the hob distribution profiling the general distributions were relatively uniform in the hob membranes however as shown in fig 7 f there was a sharp peak at the depth of 10 30 μm in the hil distribution profiling indicating that the adsorbed dex in hil membrane were mainly distributed within the superficial portion it is noted that for both the hil and the hob membrane the dex distribution peaks indicate that the dex tended to accumulate inside the membranes other than at the membrane surfaces this is in accord with the weak sieving ability of the prepared membranes for dex suggesting that dex can easily enter into pores during adsorption process similar phenomena have also been observed in previous studies especially for the hydrophilic foulant during filtration hao et al 2013 hughes et al 2006 these quantification results agree well with the visualization impressions from the above 3d images using lsfm we were able to obtain information about not only the morphology of the dex fouling on the surface or superficial layer of the membrane but more importantly the overall depth profiling of the fouled membrane 150 μm without moving cutting clapping overcoming the previous limitations for fluorescence imaging studies including the depth of penetration limitation and the sample preparation limitation collaborating table 2 with fig 7 it is proposed that the time dependent evolution of foulant distribution and irreversible fouling in membrane matrix i e from imaging quantification could correlate with the foulant membrane and foulant foulant interactions in terms of the initial stage i e 0 4 h here the quick penetration of dex all over the hob membrane matrix 180 μm led a severe irreversible fouling which could attribute to the attractive interactions i e negative total interactive energy as shown in fig 8 a between dex and the hob membrane in contrast the interactions between dex and the hil membrane were repulsive i e positive total interactive energy as shown in fig 8 b and therefore both δira and δi of the hil membrane were slower than those of the hob membrane in the following stage however we propose that the foulant foulant interactions dominated the membrane adsorption and fouling behaviors after 6 h adsorption the pore walls of the hob membrane had been covered by dex and thus making the following bonding i e following dex molecules bonding to the fouled hob membrane harder due to the strong repulsive intermolecular interactions between dexs as shown in fig 8 c as a result although the dex molecules can further accumulate in membrane matrix and lead to a considerable δi it could be difficult for them to irreversibly bond to membrane hence the δira of the hob membrane declined significantly 3 4 proposed fouling mechanism and outlook in this study the noninvasive lsfm technique was successfully applied to achieve fast highly sensitive and large scale 3d visualizations during membrane fouling process especially for the depth profiling of the foulant distribution in membrane matrix considering the similar porosity and perm selectivity between the hil and the hob membrane the membrane physical geometry would not make much of a contribution to the distinct adsorption behaviors between them fallahianbijan et al 2019 nazem bokaee et al 2018 in turn their distinct adsorption and fouling behaviors suggest a strong relationship among membrane physicochemical properties foulant distribution and even the fouling resistance in the initial fouling stage the enhanced antifouling performance of the hil membrane could be verified by its faint fluorescence signal indicating that the adsorption tendency of hydrophilic dex towards to hydrophilic surface i e hil membrane was weaker compared with that to hydrophobic surface i e hob membrane the accumulation of dex in the superficial portion of the hil membrane was obvious this is in accord with the enhanced energy barrier that between dex and hil xdlvo interaction curves fig 8 moreover it brings the first photographic evidence that how the hydrophilic membrane achieved enhanced antifouling performance as the deepening of fouling it is reasonable to propose that the observed concentrated dex layer in the superficial portion of hil membrane has strong effects on membrane fouling process on one hand as evidenced by the forward osmosis process this concentrated dex layer may act as the internal concentration polarization to have dex back diffused into bulk solution and thus preventing the further accumulation or adsorption of dex on the other hand this concentrated layer can also promote the inside diffusion of dex as the bottom parts of the hil membrane matrix started glowing after 6 hour adsorption fig 5 as evidenced by both lsfm images and fouling experiments the membrane fouling behavior or reversibility exhibited a strong correlation with the foulant depth profiling in membrane matrix for the hil membrane the majority of the adsorbed dex was concentrated in membrane superficial portion based on this we propose that the concentrated dex can be easily dissolved and removed by the laminar flow that generated by surface rinsing and thus eventually resulting in enhanced antifouling performance i e reversible fouling however for the hob membrane the physical cleaning and the laminar flow can hardly act on the deep section due to the significant resistance of membrane making the fouling to be irreversible therefore this study not only provides a novel noninvasive highly sensitive volumetric imaging technique to achieve 3d visualization and quantification of membrane fouling progress but also presents the microscopic events of hydrophilic membrane in resisting fouling especially for the act of inner concentrated layer the relationship between fouling depth and fouling irreversibility emphasized that the further membrane fouling investigations should extend from the surface scenario to the inner asymmetric structures additionally although this study mainly investigates the internal adsorption fouling irreversible fouling lead by other mechanisms e g cake layer fouling or pore clogging was also non negligible as noted in the adsorption indexes shown in fig 4 d it is also noted that a vigorous cfv was employed in this study to minimize experimental errors in the critical flux measurements and the fouling experiments since the cfv has been demonstrated exhibiting limit influences on the internal fouling of porous membrane ye et al 2005 however it could possibly weaken the contribution of surface fouling for fouling irreversibility to comprehensively elucidate the membrane long term fouling behavior the applicability of lsfm for practical water treatment operations could be further improved with diverse adaptations e g in optical arrangements and in filtration devices which could also be used for on line monitoring to explore the transformation mechanism in complex membrane fouling evolutions moreover considering real water resource with complex compositions lsfm could also be extended to incorporate the spectroscopic techniques chen et al 2017 chen et al 2018 yu et al 2019 to differentiate the chemical compositions of membrane foulants and detect their 3d distributions on in the membrane in a label free manner which would be useful to understand heterogeneous mechanism 4 conclusion in this study a noninvasive membrane fouling imaging platform based on lsfm technique has been established and successfully applied to realize 3d distributions of dex over the entire membrane during static adsorption fouling process with a high resolution the dex static adsorption behavior on two different kinds of membranes with similar pore structure but distinct hydrophilicity was thoroughly investigated both lsfm imaging and the fouling irreversibility exhibited a strong relationship with the foulant depth profiling in membrane matrix presenting the microscopic events of hydrophilic membrane in resisting fouling it was proposed that the membrane inner adsorption could play an important role in irreversible fouling and the fouling investigations could extend from the surface scenario to the inner asymmetric structures in addition the results suggested that the optimization of pore structures and pore wall hydrophilization could be beneficial to the development of antifouling strategies and the design of antifouling membranes we believe that lsfm can be an important complementary technique to investigate membrane fouling and facilitate profound understanding in fouling mechanism at multiple levels thereby improving the sustainability of uf membrane in water

17632,membrane fouling restricts the wide applications of membrane technology and therefore it is essential to develop novel analytical techniques to characterize membrane fouling and to further understand the mechanism behind it in this work we demonstrate a capability of high resolution large scale 3d visualization and quantification of the foulants on in membranes during fouling process based on light sheet fluorescence microscopy as a noninvasive reproducible optical approach the adsorption processes of dextran dex on in two polyvinylidene fluoride membranes with similar pore structure but distinct surface hydrophilicity were clearly observed for a hydrophilic polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane the diffusion and adsorption of the dex in membrane matrix were much slower compared to that for a hydrophobic membrane a concentrated foulant layer was observed in the superficial potion of the hydrophilic membrane matrix while the foulants were observed quickly penetrating across the overall hydrophobic pvdf membrane during a short adsorption process both the inner concentrated fouling layer in membrane superficial portion and the foulant penetration in membrane asymmetric structure presented correlations with membrane fouling irreversibility which could elucidate the microscopic events of hydrophilic membrane in resisting fouling in addition the imaging results could be correlated with the xdlvo analysis suggesting how the membrane foulant and foulant foulant interfacial interactions resulted in a time dependent membrane fouling process this work provides a fast highly sensitive and noninvasive imaging platform for in situ characterization of membrane fouling evolution and should be useful for a wide range of membrane based process explorations graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane fouling mechanism foulant depth distribution in situ characterization light sheet fluorescence microscopy 1 introduction membrane based water purification process has received increasing attention in the past decades due to its excellent sieving capability compact occupation and automatic operation however one of the major limitations for its widespread implementations is membrane fouling an attachment accumulation or adsorption of various foulants onto membrane surfaces and or inside membrane pores fouling results in a rapid decrease in membrane permeability and lifetime as well as in an increase in operating membrane replacement cost chew et al 2017 polyakov and zydney 2013 in whether membrane based drinking water plant or waste water treatment process organic foulants are considered to be the main foulants for membrane fouling including polysaccharides proteins humic substances etc among these soluble polysaccharides as key components of dissolved organic matter dom are recognized as crucial fouling precursors for most water treatment scenarios taking membrane bioreactor mbr for example polysaccharide like substance features a complex mixture of soluble microbial products smp and flocs embedded in a polymeric network of extracellular polymeric substances eps once filtered they create highly hydrated gel particles or layers providing a significant resistance to permeate flow during membrane process the high fouling propensity of polysaccharide attribute not only to its electroneutrality and small molecular dimension but also to its interfacial intermolecular properties meng et al 2018 more importantly small electroneutral polysaccharide substances have been proposed as a main factor for membrane irreversible fouling because they could form a non covalent network with membrane or other organic matters fu et al 2018 neemann et al 2013 wang et al 2013 xiao et al 2013 yamamura et al 2008 a number of recent studies xiao et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 have evidenced that polysaccharides were abundant on the membrane foulant interface due to its hydroxyl rich character suggesting that they were preferably adsorbed by polymeric membranes the studies have also demonstrated that the investigation of static adsorption contributed substantially to the understanding of initial fouling process li et at investigated the static adsorption of polysaccharide and its hybrids on modified membranes with different surface hydrophilicity and demonstrated that inner adsorption and pore blocking were the major aspects of fouling creation of polysaccharide like substance in membrane process li et al 2018 however adsorptive fouling is a complex process that can be affected by a number of factors such as membrane surface physicochemical properties foulant chemistry and water chemistry it remains unclear how the essential microscopic mesoscopic events control internal fouling on a hydrophilic membrane especially for polysaccharide fouling the studies related to membrane surface modifications have unfortunately led to conflicting results showing that the fouling indexes of polysaccharides were not obviously different despite the significantly improved membrane wettability banti et al 2018 matar et al 2016 neemann et al 2013 moreover it remains challenging for existing fouling models and theories to thoroughly interpret membrane fouling behaviors due to the lack of considerations on the membrane configurable pore diameter asymmetric structure etc effects in fouling progress it was evidenced that the adsorption isotherms and thermodynamics had no apparent correlation with membrane fouling resistance suggesting that the extent of fouling was mainly determined by the major fouling mechanism instead of the mass of foulants yu et al 2019 therefore there is a demand to explore new perspectives about membrane adsorptive mechanism with electroneutral matters and consequently it is of great interest to monitor and quantify the adsorptive behaviors of a highly asymmetric and porous polymer matrix in addition to conventional methods e g flux decline semi empirical models and direct observation to obtain information on the evolution of permeate flux and trans membrane pressure over time a number of new analytical techniques have been developed and applied to investigate membrane fouling chen et al 2018 ferrando et al 2005 fortunato et al 2017 kiefer et al 2014 li et al 2016 luo et al 2018 meng and li 2019 sim et al 2013 tang et al 2020 valencia et al 2013 among them optical and spectroscopic techniques have been extensively used to provide chemical compositions of foulants as highly sensitive and noninvasive imaging tools for example laser induced microscopy lim has been recently applied to achieve in situ visualization of concentration polarization during membrane ultrafiltration based on fluorescence contrast although its simplified optical setup provides limited 2d spatial information meng and li 2019 surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers and stimulated raman scattering srs microscopy have been successfully applied to differentiate the chemical compositions of membrane foulants for fouling study without labeling they have a great potential for online monitoring of membrane fouling evolution although at the present stage the 3d spatial chemical distribution measurements of the membrane are undertaken after the filtration and the sample was clamped by slides chen et al 2017 cui et al 2011 confocal scanning laser microscopy cslm has been widely used to explore the characterization of membrane structure and fouling behavior by providing high resolution 3d fluorescence profiles nevertheless the penetration depth of cslm has been limited to a few tens of μm and the measurements have been undertaken after the fouling process in current published work ferrando et al 2005 zator et al 2007 it is also noted that the acquisition of millimeter scale sample volumes for clsm is prohibitively slow e g a few to tens of minutes for mm3 region due to its point scanning process in recent years light sheet fluorescence microscopy lsfm has been developed as a cost effective and relatively rapid means to acquire high resolution 3d images of intact samples on relatively large scale e g mm cm with fluorescence huisken et al 2004 keller et al 2008 it is a wide field form of optical sectioning imaging technique in which a sheet of light with a well defined thickness is used for illumination and the illumination and detection are performed through two distinct orthogonal optical paths compared with clsm lsfm can provide 3d visualization with comparable high spatial resolution but much higher time resolution e g a few to tens of seconds for mm3 region in addition it can be easily adapted to image relatively large samples making it extensively attractive for real time noninvasive on line membrane fouling monitoring nevertheless to the best of our knowledge the lsfm technique has not been used to investigate the membrane structure and fouling process in this paper a noninvasive fast and highly sensitive membrane fouling imaging platform based on lsfm technique is established and applied for the first time for high resolution large scale 3d visualization of the foulants in membranes fouling process the labeled dextran dex is selected as the surrogate of polysaccharide like substance to perform membrane fouling due to its uniform molecular weight mw distribution and stable chemistry chen et al 2017 the 3d distributions of dex over the entire membrane are directly observed at a high spatial and time resolution and further quantified by imaging processing and analysis moreover to unravel the microscopic events of membrane hydrophilicity in resisting fouling the adsorption behaviors of two polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes with similar pore structure but distinct surface hydrophilicity are thoroughly compared and the relationship among membrane physicochemical properties fouling depth profile and fouling reversibility is discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals pvdf solvay chemicals co china non solvent additives of pluronic f127 and poly ethylene glycol peg mw 12 000 milliporesigma usa and

co billerica ma 2 2 membrane fabrication two kinds of pvdf membranes with similar pore structure and selectivity but different hydrophilicity i e the hydrophilic hil and the hydrophobic hob were fabricated by using the phase inversion method as described previously zhang et al 2019 in order to tailor the hydrophilicity and pore structure of the prepared membranes the copolymers and nacl solutions were employed as the pore forming agent and coagulation bath respectively generally the casting solution was prepared by mixing polymer pvdf and copolymers f127 or peg with solvent nmp in sequence the solution was then heated to approximately 60 c under the atmosphere of nitrogen and stirred at 600 rpm to achieve a homogeneous mixture after that the degassed solution was casted on an optical mirror using a film applicator paul n gardner company inc pompano beach fl usa with a casting thickness setting of 200 μm the casted solution was then immediately immersed in coagulation to perform solidification moreover the hydrophobic pvdf membranes were obtained by immersing in a 50 wt ipa solution for 4 h where the residual hydrophilic copolymers that entangled in membrane matrix could be removed table 1 lists the compositions of casting solutions corresponding to different bath conditions and post treatment protocols 2 3 membrane characterization the superficial atomic composition of the prepared membranes was analyzed by a k alpha xps thermo fisher scientific west palm beach fl usa the water contact angles on each membrane surface were measured by using a dsa 25s micro drop shape analyzer krűss gmbh hamburg germany with the sessile drop method a water drop of 1 μl for each membrane the averaged values from five random locations were used the porosity of prepared membranes was calculated by 1 porosity w w w d ρ v where ww and wd were the weights of the wet membranes and dry membranes respectively ρ the density of di water and v the volume of the dry membranes membrane performance and fouling behaviors were evaluated by using a cross flow filtration device with an effective filtration area of 3 4 cm2 the velocity of the retentate was calculated by a flow meter to indicate the cross flow rate a me2002t balance mettler toledo llc columbus oh usa was used to collect and weight the permeate briefly membranes were pressurized at 0 1 mpa in di water for at least 30 min until the stable original flux was reached membrane permeability was evaluated by di water flux with the tmp of 0 07 mpa 10 psi the constant flux j l m2 h was given by eq 2 where v was the permeate volume l a the effective filtration area m2 and t the filtration time h 2 j v a t membrane selectivity was evaluated through molecular weight cut off mwco analyses a series of filtration experiments were sequentially carried out with solutions containing 1 g l of peg peo of increasing mws 10 20 35 100 200 300 400 and 600 kda with the tmp of 0 07 mpa 10 psi where the cross flow velocity cfv was set at ca 1 m s to minimize the effect of concentration polarization on membrane apparent sieving ability mehta and zydney 2005 for each filtration run the initial 2 g of effluent was discarded to avoid interference from previous filtration the mwco of the membrane was determined as the lowest mw where 95 peg peo was retained the rejection r was given by 3 r 1 c p c f 100 where cp was the permeate concentration in mg l and cf was the feed concentration mg l both of them were measured by a total organic carbon toc analyzer shimadzu co kyoto japan the reported results of membrane performances and surface physicochemical parameters were the mean values from three independent samples unless otherwise specified 2 4 membrane fouling test the membrane critical fluxes jc were determined by increasing tmp step by step since it is difficult to control the tmp at low enough values in critical flux measurements for uf membranes and dilute feeds wu et al 1999 the cfv was fixed at ca 1 m s to minimize experimental errors the step height was 0 01 mpa before and after the critical point in each step tmp was increased at a fixed time interval of 30 min and the steady flux js within each interval was recorded the feed solutions were di water and dex solution 25 mg l respectively the first point deviating from the linearity in the flux increasing curve was corresponding to the critical flux in fouling experiments the membrane irreversible fouling was characterized by static single side adsorption see next section and dynamic filtration respectively in which a 25 mg l dex solution was used as feed solution before fouling all membranes were pressurized at 0 1 mpa in di water for at least 30 min until stable original flux j0 was reached for dynamic filtration the fouling was performed at a given tmp cfv couple that corresponded to membrane sustainable conditions at the end of each fouling stage the di water flux of the fouled membrane was determined and recorded as jf for each fouled membrane physical cleaning tmp 0 mpa was performed in the cross flow cell with di water for 5 min in which the cross flow rate was controlled at ca 2 m s by adjusting the valves and the di water flux of the cleaned membrane was recorded as jc as a result the membrane irreversible fouling was given as eq 4 three separated samples for each hil and hob membrane were used in both the dynamic fouling and the static single side adsorption experiments 4 ir 1 j c j f j 0 j f 100 the membrane adsorption capacity qe mg g was calculated from isothermal

method for obtaining 3d fluorescence information is through the use of cslm which provides the optical sectioning by using the confocal aperture to reject the out of focus fluorescent photons it is inherently based on scanning and thus prohibitively slow the excitation light illuminates not just the small volume of interest but a cone of the sample above and below the volume resulting in a waste of valuable fluorophores to address the challenge of visualizing larger samples with high spatial temporal resolution while preserving the sample under low irradiation levels lsfm has been developed with a rapid growth in last decades lsfm is a noninvasive fast and highly sensitive optical method for relatively large scale 3d visualization it is a fluorescence imaging technique that uses a focused light sheet e g optically confining light to a single slice to selectively illuminate the sample from the side at the focal plane of the detection optical path which is arranged orthogonal to the illumination path the light sheet restricts the excitation to the plane of interest and consequently fluorescence is excited only in the desired plane forming wide field optical sectioning the entire plane without out of focus light can be projected to 2d light detectors i e camera based detection which is equivalent to the image obtained with lscm but without the need for confocal aperture and the scanning this highly efficient excitation collection scheme provides rapid acquisition and minimal light dose making lsfm a powerful non invasive tool to observe dynamic processes for longer periods of time the general principles are illustrated in fig 1 a generally a lsfm system consists of four essential units including illumination detection movement and control in illumination unit it is of importance to generate an appropriate light sheet with the optimized properties of thickness uniformity and penetration ability for various applications since the visible light is used in lsfm diffraction limits the dimensions of the light sheet and the achievable thickness depends on the field of view fov it illuminates generally the lateral spatial resolution is equivalent to that in a wide field microscope given by the numerical aperture na of the detection optics the wavelength of the fluorescence and the sampling resolution i e calculated from the pixel size of the detection device and the magnification of the system the axial resolution is determined by the light sheet thickness in most systems there are two main approaches to generate light sheets as illustrated in fig 1 b a static light sheet can be produced by collimating a beam in one dimension and focusing it in another dimension using the combination of cylindrical optics and the objective lens alternatively a virtual light sheet can be generated by focusing a laser beam to a single line and then rapidly scanning it vertically in lsfm illumination and detection are performed through two distinct and orthogonal optical paths to obtain 3d image stacks the sample can be quickly moved over the desired axis typically along the optical axis of the detection system using the translation stage when the optical arrangement is fixed alternatively in order to improve the acquisition speed 3d image stacks can be acquired by simultaneously moving the light sheet and the focal plane using scanning optics and locked in electronics signals when the sample is fixed practical realizations of lsfm can be adapted to the samples of interest in various applications the experimental setup was consisted of a lsfm system and a water chamber of 30 30 30 mm3 as illustrated in fig 2 the chamber was made of quartz for optical transparency in lsfm a spectrally filtered 472 40 nm ultrafast fiber laser pumped super continuum source wl sc 400 4 fianium ltd with the power of 20 mw was used for excitation a virtual light sheet was generated in the membrane sample through a digital scanning system gvs212

z coremorrow and synchronized with the digital scanning system in the illumination path providing a fast and large scale acquisition prior to adsorption each fresh membrane was immersed in ultrapure water overnight a 25 mg l dex solution was used to carry out the static single sided adsorption fouling experiment the membranes were fixed to the bottom of the chamber with a 30 angle to allow a direct laser illumination from the side of the chamber to the window of observation during each adsorption experiment the same membrane area was imaged at 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 4 h 6 h and 8 h in each acquisition lsfm images were recorded in 3 μm step along the detection axis 100 frames with the integration time of 0 05 s were recorded for membrane samples resulting in the total acquisition time at 9 s all the acquisition setting and hardware control were written by labview software the theoretical spatial resolution of the developed lsfm system with 10 illumination detection objectives and 11 μm pixel size scmos camera was 2 2 μm lateral and 7 μm axial with the effective fov of 1 2 mm this resolution can be easily improved to sub μm lateral and 2 4 μm axial by using objectives with higher magnification and nas but at the cost of a reduced fov this fov limitation can be further addressed by stitching over multiple acquisitions in lsfm there are also other sophisticated approaches for lsfm which can provide faster imaging and superior resolution e g lattice light sheet chen et al 2014 airy beam vettenburg et al 2014 and so on mahou et al 2014 planchon et al 2011 2 6 imaging data processing the image processes were performed using imagej software u s national institute of health and 3d rendering of the volumetric data was produced using imaris for direct visualization comparison the same parameters were used for the display of each image stack at different adsorption time points 2 7 interfacial energy calculation membrane surface wettability was evaluated by calculating the surface area corrected solid liquid interfacial free energy δ g m l here the liquid refers to water which was determined from a modified young dupré equations wenzel 1949 6 δ g m l 1 cos θ γ l where θ is the measured water contact angle that modified by roughness area ratio parameter i e the ratio of actual membrane surface area to the geometric area and γl the surface tension of pure water the subscripts m and l correspond to membrane and liquid respectively furthermore by measuring the contact angles of two polar liquids water and glycerol and one apolar liquid diiodomethane with known surface tension the membrane surface tension including lifshitz van der waals γlw and lewis acid base γab components comprising electron donor γ and electron acceptor γ can be calculated by solving extended young dupré equations 7 1 cos θ γ l 2 γ m l w γ l l w γ m γ l γ m γ l here the γlm γ and γ represent lw electron acceptor and electron donor component of the solid surface tension respectively using the surface tension components of membrane and water the interfacial free energy of cohesion of membrane interfaces immersed in water δ g m w m t o t commonly named as hydrophilicity can be calculated according to hurwitz et al 2010 8 δ g m w m t o t δ g m w m l w δ g m w m a b the xdlvo theory describes the total interaction energy or adhesion energy between a

of hydrophilic membranes in resist fouling two porous pvdf membranes showing similar pore structure but distinct surface hydrophilicity were intentionally prepared i e the hydrophilic hil membrane and the hydrophobic hob one fig 3 a shows the performances and the physicochemical parameters of both pvdf membranes the membrane permeability porosity and averaged pore diameter were evaluated through the measurements of water flux wet dry method and hagen poiseuille equation respectively the membrane selectivity was characterized by measuring the mwco as shown in the results both membranes exhibited similar water flux and obtained 95 rejection of peo at 180 200 kda i e mwco of 180 200 kda fig 3 b suggesting that they possessed similar pore structures the red dotted lines in fig 3 b showed that the rejection rate of the hil and the hob membrane for dex were about 75 and 72 respectively revealing that the dex could enter into the membrane pores and result in inner adsorption membrane surface wettability and hydrophilicity were evaluated by using the solid liquid interfacial free energy δ g m l and the interfacial free energy of cohesion δ g m w m t o t respectively hurwitz et al 2010 liang et al 2013 providing fundamental insights into membrane surface properties due to the description of surface energy and morphology as shown in fig 3 c the interfacial free energy of hil δ g m l 127 4 mj m2 and hob δ g m l 73 1 mj m2 membrane were positive revealing that both of them could be wetted by water in filtration process it is also noted that the hil membrane exhibited positive free energy of cohesion δ g m w m t o t 19 2 mj m2 at contact between two membrane surfaces while the hob membrane exhibited negative value δ g m w m t o t 42 1 mj m2 this suggests that only the hil membrane should be considered non cohesive when immersed in water i e hydrophilic as shown in fig 3 d the enhanced surface hydrophilicity of the hil membrane could partially attribute to its higher oxygen content i e 10 7 at which was a result of the segregation of the amphipathic f127 during membrane formation process in contrast the low oxygen content i e 1 9 at detected on the hob membrane surface was in line with its hydrophobicity demonstrating that most of the hydrophilic peg had been removed by ipa post treatment loh and wang 2013 3 2 membrane fouling behaviors in sustainable condition to make this study closer to industrial process the membrane critical flux was measured and afterwards their corresponding fouling behavior in a sustainable condition was investigated fig 4 a and b show the membrane flux as a function of tmps for dex solution and di water it is clear that both the hil and the hob membranes belong to the weak form of critical flux since the dex solution flux started to deviate from the pure water line at the very beginning bacchin et al 2006 suggesting that the dex fouling was noticeable even at a very low tmp in addition according to the basic concept of critical flux i e a shift point of polarized concentration transformed to deposition the corresponding pressure of critical flux of the hil membrane and the hob membrane was no more than 0 05 mpa and 0 04 mpa respectively critical flux is a concept of significance to optimize filtration productivity and in industry water treatment often operates at an upper limit of critical or sustainable fluxes as it allows a higher permeability throughout a run bacchin et al 2006 therefore for both theoretical and practical purposes the sustainable condition field and pearce 2011 corresponding to a tmp at which the flux can fulfill the filtration capacity of each membrane was selected to further evaluate the membrane fouling behavior i e 0 05 mpa for the hil membrane and 0 04 mpa for the hob membrane fig 4 c shows the membrane irreversible fouling irc that measured at a sustainable condition indicating that the irreversible fouling for both membranes was increased as the operation time increased and then reached to a steady state after 6 h filtration in addition the relatively lower fouling propensity of the hil membrane demonstrated that the hil membrane possessed enhanced antifouling performance compared with the hob membrane in order to unravel the roles of static adsorption in membrane fouling process the adsorption fouling index i ira irc was designed and calculated as illustrated in fig 4 d in which the higher the i value the greater the contribution of adsorption fouling for overall fouling as shown in such sustainable condition for whether the hil membrane or the hob membrane the i value was 0 8 and there was no substantial fluctuation during 8 hour operations this revealed that adsorption was the main fouling mechanism of dex especially for the operation of membrane process with a sustainable flux moreover previous study has evidenced that the investigation of static adsorption contributes to the comprehensive understanding of the initial fouling process which significantly affects membrane fouling and antifouling behavior li et al 2018 therefore compared with other fouling mechanisms it is of importance to obtain an effective thorough observation and profound understanding of adsorption fouling which is essential to develop fouling mitigation strategies and antifouling materials 3 3 3d visualization and quantification of the adsorption process since lsfm is a wide field form of optical sectioning imaging performed through two orthogonal paths and long working distance objectives were employed in both the illumination and the detection path in our system there was no necessity for extra sample preparations as in previous publications e g cutting applying removing embedding medium and clapping down allowing noninvasive repeatable high resolution large scale 3d imaging acquired at different time points during the membrane fouling experiment 1 2 1 2 0 3 mm3 of each hob and hil membrane were imaged at 0 5 1 2 4 6 and 8 h during the static single sided adsorption process in this study the performed static single side adsorption was believed more closer to practical single side membrane filtration process than the conventional isothermal adsorption process commonly performed by pulverized membrane samples as in the later process foulant can easily entered into membrane from the large voids that located in membrane bottom surface and eventually resulted in extra fouling the display images were cropped for zoom in details fig 5 shows the volumetric 3d reconstructions of hob and hil membranes fouled by dex during the static single side adsorption fig 5 b e show the horizontal sectioned views of both membranes at different depths and f shows the cross sectioned views of fouled membranes at different time points in which xz represents the cross sections of membrane and xy represents horizontal sections of membrane at different depth from the surface in the hob fouling profiles the fluorescence intensity increased quickly towards the inner supporting structure along with the adsorption time and the dex was not concentrated at the dense surface it is noted that the images were in accord with the micro structure of membrane matrix with the accumulated or adsorbed dex in the membrane for example the pore diameter of the hob membrane increased from its top surface fig 5 b to the supporting layer fig 5 d and a typical finger like structure was shown in the cross section images fig 5 f in the hil fouling profiles although the overall fluorescence intensity increased along with the adsorption time the intensity of the surface and the superficial portion of the membrane within 30 μm beneath the surface were much higher than that of the deeper membranes this kind of straightforward noninvasive large scale 3d visualization directly shows the dex adsorption fouling evolution process on in the hob and hil membranes illustrating the distinct dex adsorption behaviors with the hydrophilicity of the membrane fig 6 a and b show the comparison of the overall fluorescence intensity in the same sized areas and the adsorption capacity qe at each time points during the static single side adsorption in the hob and the hil membrane the fouling stage of 0 8 h was employed to illustrate the fouling differences between the hob and the hil membrane the dex fouled hob membrane exhibited a higher fluorescence intensity than the hil membrane illustrating more serious membrane fouling caused by dex in hob membrane than hil membrane it is clear that the increase of the fluorescence intensity shows the same trend with the increase of the adsorption capacity with the adsorption time in addition the ratio of adsorption capacity of hil membrane to hob membrane is 0 4 0 48 0 54 0 58 0 55 and 0 73 at the time point of 0 5 1 2 4 6 and 8 h respectively the data of fluorescence intensity shows the similar proportions fig 6 a at each time point demonstrating that this high resolution large scale fluorescence imaging technique can be used to characterize the adsorption fouling behavior of the highly asymmetric and porous membranes to further evaluate the dynamic foulant distributions between two kinds of membranes the fluorescence intensity distributions at different depths in the dextran fouled hob and hil membrane after 0 5 1 2 4 6 and 8 h adsorption were calculated at every 5 μm depth range using computerized image analysis as shown in fig 7 although both of the dex fouled membranes exhibited a relatively lower intensity in deeper areas the fluorescence intensity of the fouled hob membrane increased much rapidly with the increase of the depth as compared to the fouled hil membrane illustrating a quick and deep adsorption of dex in the hob membrane as shown in fig 7 d the adsorbed dex in the hob membrane had already reached up to 180 μm after just 4 h adsorption i e within the first 4 h in the next 4 h i e 4 8 hour adsorption although there was an increase of the fluorescence intensity in each depth range the overall depth profiling of the fouled hob membrane maintained the similar shape in contrast the penetration of adsorbed dex in the hil membrane increased much slowly in the overall 8 hour adsorption process and the fluorescence intensity at the increased depth range was much lower than that of the hob membrane it is also noted that although there was a peak around the depth of 30 50 μm in the hob distribution profiling the general distributions were relatively uniform in the hob membranes however as shown in fig 7 f there was a sharp peak at the depth of 10 30 μm in the hil distribution profiling indicating that the adsorbed dex in hil membrane were mainly distributed within the superficial portion it is noted that for both the hil and the hob membrane the dex distribution peaks indicate that the dex tended to accumulate inside the membranes other than at the membrane surfaces this is in accord with the weak sieving ability of the prepared membranes for dex suggesting that dex can easily enter into pores during adsorption process similar phenomena have also been observed in previous studies especially for the hydrophilic foulant during filtration hao et al 2013 hughes et al 2006 these quantification results agree well with the visualization impressions from the above 3d images using lsfm we were able to obtain information about not only the morphology of the dex fouling on the surface or superficial layer of the membrane but more importantly the overall depth profiling of the fouled membrane 150 μm without moving cutting clapping overcoming the previous limitations for fluorescence imaging studies including the depth of penetration limitation and the sample preparation limitation collaborating table 2 with fig 7 it is proposed that the time dependent evolution of foulant distribution and irreversible fouling in membrane matrix i e from imaging quantification could correlate with the foulant membrane and foulant foulant interactions in terms of the initial stage i e 0 4 h here the quick penetration of dex all over the hob membrane matrix 180 μm led a severe irreversible fouling which could attribute to the attractive interactions i e negative total interactive energy as shown in fig 8 a between dex and the hob membrane in contrast the interactions between dex and the hil membrane were repulsive i e positive total interactive energy as shown in fig 8 b and therefore both δira and δi of the hil membrane were slower than those of the hob membrane in the following stage however we propose that the foulant foulant interactions dominated the membrane adsorption and fouling behaviors after 6 h adsorption the pore walls of the hob membrane had been covered by dex and thus making the following bonding i e following dex molecules bonding to the fouled hob membrane harder due to the strong repulsive intermolecular interactions between dexs as shown in fig 8 c as a result although the dex molecules can further accumulate in membrane matrix and lead to a considerable δi it could be difficult for them to irreversibly bond to membrane hence the δira of the hob membrane declined significantly 3 4 proposed fouling mechanism and outlook in this study the noninvasive lsfm technique was successfully applied to achieve fast highly sensitive and large scale 3d visualizations during membrane fouling process especially for the depth profiling of the foulant distribution in membrane matrix considering the similar porosity and perm selectivity between the hil and the hob membrane the membrane physical geometry would not make much of a contribution to the distinct adsorption behaviors between them fallahianbijan et al 2019 nazem bokaee et al 2018 in turn their distinct adsorption and fouling behaviors suggest a strong relationship among membrane physicochemical properties foulant distribution and even the fouling resistance in the initial fouling stage the enhanced antifouling performance of the hil membrane could be verified by its faint fluorescence signal indicating that the adsorption tendency of hydrophilic dex towards to hydrophilic surface i e hil membrane was weaker compared with that to hydrophobic surface i e hob membrane the accumulation of dex in the superficial portion of the hil membrane was obvious this is in accord with the enhanced energy barrier that between dex and hil xdlvo interaction curves fig 8 moreover it brings the first photographic evidence that how the hydrophilic membrane achieved enhanced antifouling performance as the deepening of fouling it is reasonable to propose that the observed concentrated dex layer in the superficial portion of hil membrane has strong effects on membrane fouling process on one hand as evidenced by the forward osmosis process this concentrated dex layer may act as the internal concentration polarization to have dex back diffused into bulk solution and thus preventing the further accumulation or adsorption of dex on the other hand this concentrated layer can also promote the inside diffusion of dex as the bottom parts of the hil membrane matrix started glowing after 6 hour adsorption fig 5 as evidenced by both lsfm images and fouling experiments the membrane fouling behavior or reversibility exhibited a strong correlation with the foulant depth profiling in membrane matrix for the hil membrane the majority of the adsorbed dex was concentrated in membrane superficial portion based on this we propose that the concentrated dex can be easily dissolved and removed by the laminar flow that generated by surface rinsing and thus eventually resulting in enhanced antifouling performance i e reversible fouling however for the hob membrane the physical cleaning and the laminar flow can hardly act on the deep section due to the significant resistance of membrane making the fouling to be irreversible therefore this study not only provides a novel noninvasive highly sensitive volumetric imaging technique to achieve 3d visualization and quantification of membrane fouling progress but also presents the microscopic events of hydrophilic membrane in resisting fouling especially for the act of inner concentrated layer the relationship between fouling depth and fouling irreversibility emphasized that the further membrane fouling investigations should extend from the surface scenario to the inner asymmetric structures additionally although this study mainly investigates the internal adsorption fouling irreversible fouling lead by other mechanisms e g cake layer fouling or pore clogging was also non negligible as noted in the adsorption indexes shown in fig 4 d it is also noted that a vigorous cfv was employed in this study to minimize experimental errors in the critical flux measurements and the fouling experiments since the cfv has been demonstrated exhibiting limit influences on the internal fouling of porous membrane ye et al 2005 however it could possibly weaken the contribution of surface fouling for fouling irreversibility to comprehensively elucidate the membrane long term fouling behavior the applicability of lsfm for practical water treatment operations could be further improved with diverse adaptations e g in optical arrangements and in filtration devices which could also be used for on line monitoring to explore the transformation mechanism in complex membrane fouling evolutions moreover considering real water resource with complex compositions lsfm could also be extended to incorporate the spectroscopic techniques chen et al 2017 chen et al 2018 yu et al 2019 to differentiate the chemical compositions of membrane foulants and detect their 3d distributions on in the membrane in a label free manner which would be useful to understand heterogeneous mechanism 4 conclusion in this study a noninvasive membrane fouling imaging platform based on lsfm technique has been established and successfully applied to realize 3d distributions of dex over the entire membrane during static adsorption fouling process with a high resolution the dex static adsorption behavior on two different kinds of membranes with similar pore structure but distinct hydrophilicity was thoroughly investigated both lsfm imaging and the fouling irreversibility exhibited a strong relationship with the foulant depth profiling in membrane matrix presenting the microscopic events of hydrophilic membrane in resisting fouling it was proposed that the membrane inner adsorption could play an important role in irreversible fouling and the fouling investigations could extend from the surface scenario to the inner asymmetric structures in addition the results suggested that the optimization of pore structures and pore wall hydrophilization could be beneficial to the development of antifouling strategies and the design of antifouling membranes we believe that lsfm can be an important complementary technique to investigate membrane fouling and facilitate profound understanding in fouling mechanism at multiple levels thereby improving the sustainability of uf membrane in water

than a decade in ac amendment trials and in passive sampling monitoring cho et al 2012 gschwend et al 2011 janssen et al 2010 oen et al 2011 zimmerman et al 2005 effective reduction of porewater and bioaccumulation during in situ sediment treatment with pure ac particles has also been documented in multiple studies worldwide hilber and bucheli 2010 patmont et al 2015 reible and lampert 2014 accurate placement of ac in aquatic systems is challenging and ac losses are likely to occur in tidal or other dynamic areas abel and akkanen 2018 consequently ac is more often deposited as a

table s1 it is unclear however whether such reductions are feasible after placement of composite materials to the surface of the sediments in open systems subject to tides and storm events where complex processes and factors such as advective transport play a role it is also uncertain whether reductions in porewater concentrations are equally reflected in reduced bioaccumulation of hocs in benthic organisms in situ and to what extent accurate predictions can be achieved through in situ porewater measurements it is also unclear how well ex situ passive sampling can be used to indicate in

cm segments was insufficient to quantify pcbs trifold increase in pdms volume during subsequent monitoring events did not improve pcb detection ex situ approximate ex situ porewater concentrations were estimated by using the correction ratio between in situ and ex situ under baseline conditions under the assumption that this better reflects the kinetics of surficial exchange with the kinetics of sediment contaminant desorption in defining porewater concentrations 2 5 in situ and ex situ bioaccumulation exposures bent nose clams macoma nasuta were used in field deployments to evaluate bioaccumulation of pcbs in both ac placement areas with the exception of baseline monitoring where white sand clams macoma secta were applied high mortality of these clams limited data recovery and the switch to macoma nasuta led to increased recovery at each sampling location 5 clams were exposed to sediment for 28 days inside 15 cm diameter pvc in situ bioaccumulation chambers based on the design described by cho et al 2007 the chambers were pressed firmly 15 cm into the sediment and attached to surface deployed markers fig s4 in situ bioaccumulation was measured at 10 locations in each ac treatment area at 2 reference locations and in duplicate during each monitoring event laboratory ex situ exposures were performed at pacific ecorisk fairfield ca concurrent with field exposures during each monitoring event bioaccumulation was measured over 28 days in sediments collected from the upper 15 cm at 5 locations from each treatment area 2 reference area locations and in duplicate ten clams were exposed to each sample in these laboratory exposures at the end of exposures the surviving clams were placed inside a 500 milliliter wide mouth amber glass jar with unbleached paper towels that were wet with site surface water and maintained in a cooler at field temperature 16 c for 24 h to depurate astm 2010 after depuration whole clams were wrapped in baked out aluminum foil placed in re sealable plastic bags and shipped to the analytical laboratory vista lab el dorado hills california where they were frozen prior to chemical analysis unexposed tissue from clams maintained at the bioassay laboratory during the field deployment was also sent for laboratory analysis after each monitoring event as a tissue source blank 3 results and discussion 3 1 toc analysis and correlation with ac dosage the average thicknesses of the aquagate and sedimite layers were found to be 5 5 0 4 cm and 2 5 0 3 cm respectively these observed thicknesses were slightly greater than the actual effective placement thicknesses of 4 3 cm and 1 8 cm determined based on the mass of amendment deployed the total organic carbon toc in the post amendment sediments compared to the toc during baseline sampling was used to estimate the amount of ac in the sediment samples in the baseline study the sediment samples had an average toc of 1 4 0 08 wt the averaged toc content in surficial sediment 10 15 cm at 8 months after placement of the composite materials increased substantially to 11 7 7 1 and 13 8 8 8 wt in aquagate pac and sedimite areas respectively fig s5 the larger variations in toc content may be explained by the non uniform placement of ac across the site and or differences in the rate of ac vertical mixing ac represented 9 of sediment in the aquagate pac amendment and 10 in the sedimite treated area the difference between the post amendment toc value toc p and the toc percentage at baseline toc b was used to estimate the ac amount added in both amendments higher toc content and corresponding ac dosage after 8 months compared to targeted masses of ac reflect the higher concentration in the surficial layer prior to intermixing over the design depth sampling after 26 months showed that the toc was reduced to 4 and 5 in the 10 15 cm depth fig s5 due to both intermixing into the sediments and potentially some ac loss 3 2 in situ pcb porewater concentrations the in situ porewater concentrations of target pcbs during baseline monitoring were measured in june 2015 in total 78 pcb congeners were detected and the pcb porewater concentration during baseline monitoring averaged 2 6 and 2 3 ng l in the aquagate pac and sedimite areas respectively fig 2 corrections for temperature and salinity were not applied to the cpw data the cpw across both amendment areas and all depths averaged 2 4 ng l with a low standard deviation sd of 0 2 ng l the pcb congener concentration ng l of at 21 26 cm depth was 2 8 0 6 ng l and generally higher than at 1 6 cm and 11 16 cm where cpw was 2 2 0 2 ng l 8 months after amendment application the in situ pcb porewater concentration was reduced by 81 10 in aquagate pac treatment plot and 73 10 reduction in the sedimite amendment area fig 2 as expected the effect of the amendment on cpw at surface layer 1 6 cm was greater than in deeper layers 21 26 cm passive sampling monitoring at 14 months and 26 months generally showed a similar or slightly lower cpw in the near surface samples fig s6 although the average amount of sorbent in the surficial sediments declined due to intermixing with depth or due to loss ac treatment resulted in a relatively rapid cpw reduction in the first 8 months and sustained that reduction throughout sampling the measured average pcb porewater concentrations 26 months after ac placement at the surface 1 6 cm was 0 24 0 08 ng l 89 reduction in the aquagate pac treatment and 0 19 0 09 ng l 91 reduction in the sedimite amendment fig s6 at both ac amendment areas the largest concentration reductions were observed in the low molecular weight pcb homologs mono di tri which is consistent with earlier ac treatment studies hale et al 2010 kupryianchyk et al 2012 rakowska et al 2014 the lower decrease of high molecular weight pcbs in the porewater compared to low molecular weight congeners fig s7 can be explained by slow desorption from the solid matrix slow transfer of the former compounds onto the ac surface and or pore blocking by dissolved organic matter dom fouling oen et al 2011 in the baseline study the mean concentration weighted congener in the porewater defined by i ci ci was pcb 66 at baseline sampling and pcbs 98 104 after ac treatment depending upon treatment and time the pcbs in the porewater shifted towards a heavy molecular weight compound in the post treatment sampling events due to the more rapid sorption of the low molecular weight congeners to ac and the relatively slow sorption of higher molecular weight congeners the pcb congeners were grouped into homologs for comparison to bioaccumulation data approximately 99 of monochloro pcbs were removed from the porewater by the ac after 8 months while a 70 decline was observed for heptachloro pcbs after 26 months the distribution of pcb homologs at the surface 1 6 cm and deeper layer 21 26 cm at aquagate pac and sedimite plots are shown in fig s7 smaller but significant reductions in porewater concentrations were also noted at the deeper intervals an 83 reduction of pcb porewater concentration was ultimately observed at 26 months between 21 and 26 cm below sediment surface in the aquagate pac plot while sedimite treatment led to approximately 85 decrease of pcb cpw at the same depth 3 3 ex situ porewater measurements in general baseline monitoring with passive samplers showed that cpw determined ex situ was 2 5 times higher compared to cpw determined in situ fig s8 similar observations were reported for in situ and ex situ cpw measurements using passive samplers at five locations in lower duwamish waterway apell and gschwend 2016 the in situ cpw of pcbs were consistently lower within a factor of two than the ex situ cpw measured in the 0 10 cm sediment depth apell and gschwend 2016 in a study conducted in boston harbor ex situ pah concentrations determined by passive samplers were typically higher compared to in situ cpw fernandez et al 2009a b the higher porewater concentrations ex situ are likely related to the absence of dilution effects as a result of bioirrigation tidal pumping and hyporheic exchange ex situ samplers would be expected to be more reflective of true equilibrium between the sediment particles and surrounding media fernandez et al 2009a b lampert et al 2013 lick 2006 work et al 2002 differences were also observed between the cumulative cpw per homolog group in the in situ and ex situ measurements during the baseline assessment tetrachlorobiphenyls cpw 1 2 ng l were the dominant homolog in ex situ porewater measurements while trichlorobiphenyls cpw 0 6 ng l were dominant in situ cpw low chlorine number congeners like monochloro and dichloro showed greater differences between in situ and ex situ compared to heavier molecular weight compounds fig s8 which may reflect larger loss of the lower molecular weight congeners from sediments in the more dynamic in situ environment due to flushing the ratio of ex situ to in situ concentration obtained during baseline monitoring was further used to characterize the dilution associated with in situ hyporheic exchange processes during post amendment sampling events sediment samples collected for ex situ analysis were taken from the surficial layer which contained more ac than even shallow buried sediments the mass of pdms employed in the ex situ samples did not compensate for the high ac content and resulted in cpw measurements below quantification limits 3 4 the effect of composite materials on bioaccumulation reduction during baseline monitoring tissue bioaccumulation was conducted with white sand clam macoma secta that were collected at a nearby reference location exposures of the white sand clams in the field and laboratory resulted in poor recoveries 20 and baseline tissue concentration data represent a composite of the surviving organisms from in situ exposures the white sand clams locally sourced by the contract lab were not as tolerant of testing conditions as bent nosed clams therefore bioaccumulation of pcbs after ac placement was monitored with bent nose clams macoma nasuta both species have similar feeding preferences and reside in mid to low intertidal zones macoma nasuta has been applied successfully for assessing ac efficiency in earlier field trials janssen et al 2011b post amendment monitoring with bent nose clams 90 survival found 75 to 80 reductions of in situ pcb tissue concentration after 8 months and 84 87 after 14 months relative to the reference locations fig 3 a the ex situ bioaccumulation monitoring showed higher reduction than in situ which agrees with previous studies at the former hpns table s1 tissue pcbs declined by approximately 85 following 8 months post treatment in the 28 d laboratory exposures and the reductions remained unchanged throughout the entire monitoring period fig 3b thus the overall reduction in organism bioaccumulation of pcbs was mirrored by the reductions in porewater concentrations the dynamics were somewhat different depending upon whether the bioaccumulation occurred during laboratory exposures or in situ likely as a result of the dynamics of hyporheic exchange and ac mixing over the near surface sediment column in situ 3 5 conceptual model of contaminant availability the above discussion focused on overall pcb reductions in porewater and bioaccumulation the porewater concentrations and bioaccumulation were explored further to evaluate the effects of in situ and ex situ measurements and the influence of different homolog groups because in situ porewater is lower in pcb concentration than ex situ fig s8 due to hyporheic exchange and other mixing processes the differences between ex situ and in situ porewater values can be used to obtain information about the disequilibrium between the porewater sediment and or biota the exposure of deposit feeding organisms would be governed by cfree as an indication of the available contaminants in the sediment we hypothesize that the bioaccumulation in sediment ingesting organisms is likely related to the equilibrium availability of sediment contaminants and thus better reflected by ex situ porewater measurements of cfree for filter feeding organisms however exposure occurs directly through the water phase and in situ measurements of cfree perhaps influenced by hyporheic exchange and other mixing processes likely better reflects that exposure the concentration in the organism via bioaccumulation can be written as 1 w b f l b a f c w b a f w s l k s w where wb is the pcb concentration in biota ng kg fl is the fraction of lipids and wb l is the lipid normalized concentration of contaminant in the organism ng kg lipids baf is a biota water accumulation factor baf l kg lipids expressed by 2 b a f w b l c p w the magnitude of the baf is expected to be of the order of the octanol water partition coefficient kow for deposit

in instances of disequilibrium between the porewater and labile concentration of contaminants on the solid particles e g due to hyporheic exchange and flushing of the pore space the exposure of filter feeding organisms accumulating contaminants directly from the water is expected to be given by the in situ measured cpw in inclusion of the volumetric flushing rate q m3 s in eq 5 gives an estimate of

situ porewater measurement obtained with passive samplers will be smaller than equilibrium porewater concentration and lower than ex situ porewater concentration measursement and the difference primarily dependent on the ratio of characteristic times τs τw note that typically τw τs given our hypothesis that deposit feeding organisms will equilibrate with solids and will not be influenced by porewater flushing the bioaccumulation of a deposit feeding organism will be underestimated by the in situ porewater concentration by the ratio 9 w b l k o w c p w i n k s w ϕ w τ s ρ s τ w k s w 1 ϕ w τ s k s w ρ s τ w and the slope of the correlation between wb and kowcpw for deposit feeders would be greater than unity during ex situ passive sampling τw and the correlation should have slope near unity eq 4 these relationships were tested using the measured porewater concentrations and the bioaccumulation data note however that the ratio between the porewater and overlying water in the field is likely controlled by the exchange between the sediment organic carbon and porewater due to the slower dynamics of the ac thus the ratio of the in situ to ex situ in the baseline pre ac addition may be a better indicator of the ratio between equilibrium with the sediment and the porewater sediment disequilibrium caused by hyporheic exchange in addition the effect of the temperature change relative to the field may have influenced kinetics of ac uptake such that greater apparent uptake occurred at the higher laboratory temperatures 3 6 correlation of bioaccumulation with cpw post amendment monitoring of cpw ex situ resulted in non detects in passive sampler extracts due to the use of insufficient mass of pdms for quantitation to better understand the importance of in situ and ex situ porewater in bioaccumulation predictions we applied the ratio of ex situ cpw and in situ cpw obtained from baseline measurements table s4 as an estimate of post treatment ex situ porewater concentrations for the reasons identified above we assumed that the ratio of in situ to ex situ for each homolog group was approximately constant and applied this ratio by each homolog group the biota lipid concentrations were plotted against biota concentrations predicted from equilibrium partitioning using the octanol water partitioning coefficient as a bioaccumulation factor lu et al 2011 the ratio of lipid normalized biota accumulation to estimated ex situ porewater concentration divided by the octanol water partition coefficient for each homolog varied from 1 to 5 with excellent correlations r2 by location ranging from 0 898 0 998 the average results for 1 16 cm depth by homolog group are summarized in table 1 porewater concentrations of mono di and trichlorobiphenyls as well as octochlorobiphenyls were very low and the ratios deviated substantially from unity although perhaps simply due to uncertainty in those concentrations the ratios for the remaining homologs were in the range of 1 3 suggesting that the octanol water partition coefficient multiplied by the estimated equilibrium porewater concentration kowcpw eq provided a good estimate of the lipid normalized bioaccumulation in the deposit feeding clam the correlation of kowcpw eq with lipid normalized bioaccumulation for locations containing aquagate pac stn 5 and sedimite stn 36 is provided in fig 4 a and 4b respectively each homolog group at each depth is shown on the figure which illustrates that the porewater concentration at the 1 6 cm depth tends to be more variable than other depths but that the slope effectively the ratio as defined above was near unity for all depths particularly immediately below the surface layer 4 conclusions the results from the activated carbon post treatment analysis at the former hpns demonstrated high performance of aquagate pac and sedimite in reducing risks in pcb contaminated sediment effective reduction in cpw 83 7 85 6 was noted in the first 8 months following amendment and these strong reductions continued throughout the remainder of the study period the decline of low molecular weight pcbs mono di and tri in the porewater was most prominent in both activated carbon placement scenarios largest reductions of available pcbs were observed in the surficial layer 1 6 cm depth which implies lower flux to the overlying water column and lower availability to benthic organisms smaller but significant reductions in porewater concentrations were also noted at the deeper intervals up to 26 cm particularly at later sampling periods due to intermixing of the ac downward ex situ measured porewater concentrations were 2 5 times larger than in situ during baseline sampling due to the greater hyporheic exchange in situ the reduction of pcb bioaccumulation in bent nose clams was approximately 75 80 during the in situ pilot study 8 months after activated carbon addition the effectiveness of ac in reducing bioaccumulation did not change during the monitoring period including 26 months after ac deployment a conceptual model was built based on the in situ and ex situ results to assess bioaccumulation in biota exposed in ac treatment period by using the octanol water partition coefficient as the estimated bioaccumulation factor the model hypothesizes that ex situ passive sampling would better indicate bioavailability and bioaccumulation in deposit feeding organisms such as the bent nose clams applied here the use of ex situ porewater concentrations estimated from the observed ratio of ex situ to in situ porewater concentrations for specific homolog groups appeared to better predict bioaccumulation if the bioaccumulation factor is assumed to be the octanol water partition coefficient of pcbs overall this study demonstrates the significant pcb reductions and shows the feasibility of deploying activated carbon materials for pcb contaminated sediment management and remediation these results suggest the activated carbon treatment can be effective and that ac can be retained at the sediment surface in an open water tidal environment until it has mixed relatively deeply into the sediments the effectiveness of the ac is therefore likely to continue well beyond the 26 months of the monitoring supporting information additional information on the steady state fraction analysis placed activated

cm were reduced 89 and 91 in the aquagate pac and sedimite areas during final sampling ex situ passive sampling showed porewater concentrations 2 5 times larger than in situ measurements due to the absence of hyporheic exchange in laboratory measurements and near equilibration between sediment and porewater estimated post placement ex situ porewater concentrations were more consistent with a

environmental security technology certification programs serdp estcp cho et al 2012 2009 luthy et al 2009 these early pilot studies were conducted in shallow intertidal areas of hpns and were supported by parallel laboratory assessments janssen et al 2011a tomaszewski and luthy 2008 zimmerman et al 2004 cumulatively hpns is one of the most extensively studied areas with research of more than a decade in ac amendment trials and in passive sampling monitoring cho et al 2012 gschwend et al 2011 janssen et al 2010 oen et al 2011 zimmerman et al 2005 effective reduction of porewater and bioaccumulation during in situ sediment treatment with pure ac particles has also been documented in multiple studies worldwide hilber and bucheli 2010 patmont et al 2015 reible and lampert 2014 accurate placement of ac in aquatic systems is challenging and ac losses are likely to occur in tidal or other dynamic areas abel and akkanen 2018 consequently ac is more often deposited as a composite material to aid in settling and retention at the sediment surface natural processes such as bioturbation are expected to incorporate carbon into the sediment ghosh et al 2011 kupryianchyk et al 2015 rakowska et al 2012 although the addition of composite material is more practical especially in difficult areas kirtay et al 2018 it is uncertain to what extent surficial placement of ac effectively reduces exposure concentrations in deeper sediment layers and whether the performance of different ac composite materials can be sustained throughout the mixing depth over longer periods

table s1 it is unclear however whether such reductions are feasible after placement of composite materials to the surface of the sediments in open systems subject to tides and storm events where complex processes and factors such as advective transport play a role it is also uncertain whether reductions in porewater concentrations are equally reflected in reduced bioaccumulation of hocs in benthic organisms in situ and to what extent accurate predictions can be achieved through in situ porewater measurements it is also unclear how well ex situ passive sampling can be used to indicate in

specific objectives of this study were i evaluate the effectiveness of the two activated carbon in situ treatment remedies by employing passive sampling methods to determine pcb porewater concentration over time and depth ii evaluate the effect of two commercially available composite materials on pcb bioaccumulation in clams and iii assess bioaccumulation in biota exposed in ac amended

grade aluminum foil and transported to hpns in sterile and cold conditions during deployment three steel rods with pdms loaded were attached to a triangular frame and placed into the sediments at 20 locations to a depth of 30 cm the samplers were placed adjacent to bioaccumulation chambers at each sampling location fig s4 all tripods were connected via nylon cords to surface deployed floats marked with station numbers the triangular frame provided 30 cm spacing between replicates and allowed the evaluation of spatial variability at each station and between stations details of the statistical analysis will be discussed in a separate study passive sampling devices were retrieved after 28 days pdms fibers were carefully removed from the steel rods wiped with damp lint free tissue

sampling of baseline sediments 5 cm pdms segments were washed and preloaded with prcs as described in the supporting information sediment grab samples collected from 10 to 15 cm depth from each location were initially dosed with sodium azide nan3 at a concentration of 100 mg l to prevent biological activity and homogenized approximately 40 42 g of wet sediment subsamples from individual locations were weighed into 40 ml vials in triplicate for measurement of cpw ex situ the cleaned and prc loaded spme fibers were introduced to the individual vials containing sediment subsamples and tightly closed sediment was exposed with pdms vertically for 28 days at 20ºc with gentle motion on a shaker table for ex situ samples obtained after 8 months ac placement the volume of pdms in the 5 cm segments was insufficient to quantify pcbs trifold increase in pdms volume during subsequent monitoring events did not improve pcb detection ex situ approximate ex situ porewater concentrations were estimated by using the correction ratio between in situ and ex situ under baseline conditions under the assumption that this better reflects the kinetics of surficial exchange with the kinetics of sediment contaminant desorption in defining porewater concentrations 2 5 in situ and ex situ bioaccumulation exposures bent nose clams macoma nasuta were used in field deployments to evaluate bioaccumulation of pcbs in both ac placement areas with the exception of baseline monitoring where white sand clams macoma secta were applied high mortality of these clams limited data recovery and the switch to macoma nasuta led to increased recovery at each sampling location 5 clams were exposed to sediment for 28 days inside 15 cm diameter pvc in situ bioaccumulation chambers based on the design described by cho et al 2007 the chambers were pressed firmly 15 cm into the sediment and attached to surface deployed markers fig s4 in situ bioaccumulation was measured at 10 locations in each ac treatment area at 2 reference locations and in duplicate during each monitoring event laboratory ex situ exposures were performed at pacific ecorisk fairfield ca concurrent with field exposures during each monitoring event bioaccumulation was measured over 28 days in sediments collected from the upper 15 cm at 5 locations from each treatment area 2 reference area locations and in duplicate ten clams were exposed to each sample in these laboratory exposures at the end of exposures the surviving clams were placed inside a 500 milliliter wide mouth amber glass jar with unbleached paper towels that were wet with site surface water and maintained in a cooler at field temperature 16 c for 24 h to depurate astm 2010 after depuration whole clams were wrapped in baked out aluminum foil

maintained at the bioassay laboratory during the field deployment was also sent for laboratory analysis after each monitoring event as a tissue source blank 3 results and discussion 3 1 toc analysis and correlation with ac dosage the average thicknesses of the aquagate and sedimite layers were found to be 5 5 0 4 cm and 2 5 0 3 cm respectively these observed thicknesses were slightly greater than the actual effective placement thicknesses of 4 3 cm and 1 8 cm determined based on the mass of amendment deployed the total organic carbon toc in the post amendment sediments compared to the toc during baseline sampling was used to estimate the amount of ac in the sediment samples in the baseline study the sediment samples had an average toc of 1 4 0 08 wt the averaged toc content in surficial sediment 10 15 cm at 8 months after placement of the composite materials increased substantially to 11 7 7 1 and 13 8 8 8 wt in aquagate pac and sedimite areas respectively fig s5 the larger variations in toc content may be explained by the non uniform placement of ac across the site and or differences in the rate of ac vertical mixing ac represented 9 of sediment in the aquagate pac amendment and 10 in the sedimite treated area the difference between the post amendment toc value toc p and the toc percentage at baseline toc b was used to estimate the ac amount added in both amendments higher toc content and corresponding ac dosage after 8 months compared to targeted masses of ac reflect the higher concentration in the surficial layer prior to intermixing over the design depth sampling after 26 months showed that the toc was reduced to 4 and 5 in the 10 15 cm depth fig s5 due to both intermixing into the sediments and potentially some ac loss 3 2 in situ pcb porewater concentrations the in situ porewater concentrations of target pcbs during baseline monitoring were measured in june 2015 in total 78 pcb congeners were detected and the pcb porewater concentration during baseline monitoring averaged 2 6 and 2 3 ng l in the aquagate pac and sedimite areas respectively fig 2 corrections for temperature and salinity were not applied to the cpw data the cpw across both amendment areas and all depths averaged 2 4 ng l with a low standard deviation sd of 0 2 ng l the pcb congener concentration ng l of at 21 26 cm depth was 2 8 0 6 ng l and generally higher than at 1 6 cm and 11 16 cm where cpw was 2 2 0 2 ng l 8 months after amendment application the in situ pcb porewater concentration was reduced by 81 10 in aquagate pac treatment plot and 73 10 reduction in the sedimite amendment area fig 2 as expected the effect of the amendment on cpw at surface layer 1 6 cm was greater than in deeper layers 21 26 cm passive sampling monitoring at 14 months and 26 months generally showed a similar or slightly lower cpw in the near surface samples fig s6 although the average amount of sorbent in the surficial sediments declined due to intermixing with depth or due to loss ac treatment resulted in a relatively rapid cpw reduction in the first 8 months and sustained that reduction throughout sampling the measured average pcb porewater concentrations 26 months after ac placement at the surface 1 6 cm was 0 24 0 08 ng l 89 reduction in the aquagate pac treatment and 0 19 0 09 ng l 91 reduction in the sedimite amendment fig s6 at both ac amendment areas the largest concentration reductions were observed in the low molecular weight pcb homologs mono di tri which is consistent with earlier ac treatment studies hale et al 2010 kupryianchyk et al 2012 rakowska et al 2014 the lower decrease of high molecular weight pcbs in the porewater compared to low molecular weight congeners fig s7 can be explained by slow desorption from the solid matrix slow transfer of the former compounds onto the ac surface and or pore blocking by dissolved organic matter dom fouling oen et al 2011 in the baseline study the mean concentration weighted congener in the porewater defined by i ci ci was pcb 66 at baseline sampling and pcbs 98 104 after ac treatment depending upon treatment and time the pcbs in the porewater shifted towards a heavy molecular weight compound in the post treatment sampling events due to the more rapid sorption of the low molecular weight congeners to ac and the relatively slow sorption of higher molecular weight congeners the pcb congeners were grouped into homologs for comparison to bioaccumulation data approximately 99 of monochloro pcbs were removed from the porewater by the ac after 8 months while a 70 decline was observed for heptachloro pcbs after 26 months the distribution of pcb homologs at the surface 1 6 cm and deeper layer 21 26 cm at aquagate pac and sedimite plots are shown in fig s7 smaller but significant reductions in porewater concentrations were also noted at the deeper intervals an 83 reduction of pcb porewater concentration was ultimately observed at 26 months between 21 and 26 cm below sediment surface in the aquagate pac plot while sedimite treatment led to approximately 85 decrease of pcb cpw at the same depth 3 3 ex situ porewater measurements in general baseline monitoring with passive samplers showed that cpw determined ex situ was 2 5 times higher compared to cpw determined in situ fig s8 similar observations were reported for in situ and ex situ cpw measurements using passive samplers at five locations in lower duwamish waterway apell and gschwend 2016 the in situ cpw of pcbs were consistently lower within a factor of two than the ex situ cpw measured in the 0 10 cm sediment depth apell and gschwend 2016 in a study conducted in boston harbor ex situ pah concentrations determined by passive samplers were typically higher compared to in situ cpw fernandez et al 2009a b the higher porewater concentrations ex situ are likely related to the absence of dilution effects as a result of bioirrigation tidal pumping and hyporheic exchange ex situ samplers would be expected to be more reflective of true equilibrium between the sediment particles and surrounding media fernandez et al 2009a b lampert et al 2013 lick 2006 work et al 2002 differences were also observed between the cumulative cpw per homolog group in the in situ and ex situ measurements during the baseline assessment tetrachlorobiphenyls cpw 1 2 ng l were the dominant homolog in ex situ porewater measurements while trichlorobiphenyls cpw 0 6 ng l were dominant in situ cpw low chlorine number congeners like monochloro and dichloro showed greater differences between in situ and ex situ compared to heavier molecular weight compounds fig s8 which may reflect larger loss of the lower molecular weight congeners from sediments in the more dynamic in situ environment due to flushing the ratio of ex situ to in situ concentration obtained during baseline monitoring was further used to characterize the dilution associated with in situ hyporheic exchange processes during post amendment sampling events sediment samples collected for ex situ analysis were taken from the surficial layer which contained more ac than even shallow buried sediments the mass of pdms employed in the ex situ samples did not compensate for the high ac content and resulted in cpw measurements below quantification limits 3 4 the effect of composite materials on bioaccumulation reduction during baseline monitoring tissue bioaccumulation was conducted with white sand clam macoma secta that were collected at a nearby reference location exposures of the white sand clams in the field and laboratory resulted in poor recoveries 20 and baseline tissue concentration data represent a composite of the surviving organisms from in situ exposures the white sand clams locally sourced by the contract lab were not as tolerant of testing conditions as bent nosed clams therefore bioaccumulation of pcbs after ac placement was monitored with bent nose clams macoma nasuta both species have similar feeding preferences and reside in mid to low intertidal zones macoma nasuta has been applied successfully for assessing ac efficiency in earlier field trials janssen et al 2011b post amendment monitoring with bent nose clams 90 survival found 75 to 80 reductions of in situ pcb tissue concentration after 8 months and 84 87 after 14 months relative to the reference locations fig 3 a the ex situ bioaccumulation monitoring showed higher reduction than in situ which agrees with previous studies at the former hpns table s1 tissue pcbs declined by approximately 85 following 8 months post treatment in the 28 d laboratory exposures and the reductions remained unchanged throughout the entire monitoring period fig 3b thus the overall reduction in organism bioaccumulation of pcbs was mirrored by the reductions in porewater concentrations the dynamics were somewhat different depending upon whether the bioaccumulation occurred during laboratory exposures or in situ likely as a result of the dynamics of hyporheic exchange and ac mixing over the near surface sediment column in situ 3 5 conceptual model of contaminant availability the above discussion focused on overall pcb reductions in porewater and bioaccumulation the porewater concentrations and bioaccumulation were explored further to evaluate the effects of in situ and ex situ measurements and the influence of different homolog groups because in situ porewater is lower in pcb concentration than ex situ fig s8 due to hyporheic exchange and other mixing processes the differences between ex situ and in situ porewater values can be used to obtain information about the disequilibrium between the porewater sediment and or biota the exposure of deposit feeding organisms would be governed by cfree as an indication of the available contaminants in the sediment we hypothesize that the bioaccumulation in sediment ingesting organisms is likely related to the equilibrium availability of sediment contaminants and thus better reflected by ex situ porewater measurements of cfree for filter feeding organisms however exposure occurs directly through the water phase and in situ measurements of cfree perhaps influenced by hyporheic exchange and other mixing processes likely better reflects that exposure the concentration in the organism via bioaccumulation can be written as 1 w b f l b a f c w b a f w s l k s w where wb is the pcb concentration in biota ng kg fl is the fraction of lipids and wb l is the lipid normalized concentration of contaminant in the organism ng kg lipids baf is a biota water accumulation factor baf l kg lipids expressed by 2 b a f w b l c p w the magnitude of the baf is expected to be of the order of the octanol water partition coefficient kow for deposit feeding organism ex situ concentrations cpw eq in water reflect equilibrium with the solid 3 c p w e q w s l k s w where ksw is the equilibrium partition coefficient l kg and ws l is the labile concentration of contaminant in the solids ng kg assuming that this concentration defines bioaccumulation in deposit feeders and using kow as an estimate of the approximate bioaccumulation factor 4 w b l k o w c p w e q 1 under ex situ passive sampling conditions the porewater is in equilibrium with the labile fraction of the solids as long as the characteristic time for sorption desorption is smaller than characteristic time for passive sampling τps the release of contaminants from the solids to the ex situ porewater in such a scenario cpw eq can be described by the equation 5 d v w c p w e q d t k s a s w s l k s w c p w e q ρ s where the intrinsic rate constant ksas the product of a mass transfer coefficient length time and an sorption area per unit volume 1 length represents the inverse of the characteristic time for sorption desorption 1 τs to or from the labile fraction of the sediment ρs representing the dry bulk density of the sediment solids g cm3 and vw water volume cm3 in instances of disequilibrium between the porewater and labile concentration of contaminants on the solid particles e g due to hyporheic exchange and flushing of the pore space the exposure of filter feeding organisms accumulating contaminants directly from the water is expected to be given by the in situ measured cpw in inclusion of the volumetric flushing rate q m3 s in eq 5 gives an estimate of cpw in 6 d v w c p w i n d t k s a s w s ℓ k s w c p w i n ρ s v q c p w i n which under quasi steady conditions can be written in terms of a characteristic time for water exchange τw as 7 0 k s a s w s ℓ k s w c p w i n ρ s v v w q v w c p w i n 1 ϕ w τ s w s ℓ k s w c p w i n ρ s 1 τ w c p w i n and the in situ porewater concentration is 8 c p w i n w s ℓ k s w ϕ w τ s ρ s τ w as a result the in situ porewater measurement obtained with passive samplers will be smaller than equilibrium porewater concentration and lower than ex situ porewater concentration measursement and the difference primarily dependent on the ratio of characteristic times τs τw note that typically τw τs given our hypothesis that deposit feeding organisms will equilibrate with solids and will not be influenced by porewater flushing the bioaccumulation of a deposit feeding organism will be underestimated by the in situ porewater concentration by the ratio 9 w b l k o w c p w i n k s w ϕ w τ s ρ s τ w k s w 1 ϕ w τ s k s w ρ s τ w and the slope of the correlation between wb and kowcpw for deposit feeders would be greater than unity during ex situ passive sampling τw and the correlation should have slope near unity eq 4 these relationships were tested using the measured porewater concentrations and the bioaccumulation data note however that the ratio between the porewater and overlying water in the field is likely controlled by the exchange between the sediment organic carbon and porewater due to the slower dynamics of the ac thus the ratio of the in situ to ex situ in the baseline pre ac addition may be a better indicator of the ratio between equilibrium with the sediment and the porewater sediment disequilibrium caused by hyporheic exchange in addition the effect of the temperature change relative to the field may have influenced kinetics of ac uptake such that greater apparent uptake occurred at the higher laboratory temperatures 3 6 correlation of bioaccumulation with cpw post amendment monitoring of cpw ex situ resulted in non detects in passive sampler extracts due to the use of insufficient mass of pdms for quantitation to better understand the importance of in situ and ex situ porewater in bioaccumulation predictions we applied the ratio of ex situ cpw and in situ cpw obtained from baseline measurements table s4 as an estimate of post treatment ex situ porewater concentrations for the reasons identified above we assumed that the ratio of in situ to ex situ for each homolog group was approximately constant and applied this ratio by each homolog group the biota lipid concentrations were plotted against biota concentrations predicted from equilibrium partitioning using the octanol water partitioning coefficient as a bioaccumulation factor lu et al 2011 the ratio of lipid normalized biota accumulation to estimated ex situ porewater concentration divided by the octanol water partition coefficient for each homolog varied from 1 to 5 with excellent correlations r2 by location ranging from 0 898 0 998 the average results for 1 16 cm depth by homolog group are summarized in table 1 porewater concentrations of mono di and trichlorobiphenyls as well as octochlorobiphenyls were very low and the ratios deviated substantially from unity although perhaps simply due to uncertainty in those concentrations the ratios for the remaining homologs were in the range of 1 3 suggesting that the octanol water partition coefficient multiplied by the estimated equilibrium porewater concentration kowcpw eq provided a good estimate of the lipid normalized bioaccumulation in the deposit feeding clam the correlation of kowcpw eq with lipid normalized bioaccumulation for locations containing aquagate pac stn 5 and sedimite stn 36 is provided in fig 4 a and 4b respectively each homolog group at each depth is shown on the figure which illustrates that the porewater concentration at the 1 6 cm depth tends to be more variable than other depths but that the slope effectively the ratio as defined above was near unity for all depths particularly immediately below the surface layer 4 conclusions the results from the activated carbon post treatment analysis at the former hpns demonstrated high performance of aquagate pac and sedimite in reducing risks in pcb contaminated sediment effective reduction in cpw 83 7 85 6 was noted in the first 8 months following amendment and these strong reductions continued throughout the remainder of the study period the decline of low molecular weight pcbs mono di and tri in the porewater was most prominent in both activated carbon placement scenarios largest reductions of available pcbs were observed in the surficial layer 1 6 cm depth which implies lower flux to the overlying water column and lower availability to benthic organisms smaller but significant reductions in porewater concentrations were also noted at the deeper intervals up to 26 cm particularly at later sampling periods due to intermixing of the ac downward ex situ measured porewater concentrations were 2 5 times larger than in situ during baseline sampling due to the greater hyporheic exchange in situ the reduction of pcb bioaccumulation in bent nose clams was approximately 75 80 during the in situ pilot study 8 months after activated carbon addition the effectiveness of ac in reducing bioaccumulation did not change during the monitoring period including 26 months after ac deployment a conceptual model was built based on the in situ and ex situ results to assess bioaccumulation in biota exposed in ac treatment period by using the octanol water partition coefficient as the estimated bioaccumulation factor the model hypothesizes that ex situ passive sampling would better indicate bioavailability and bioaccumulation in deposit feeding organisms such as the bent nose clams applied here the use of ex situ porewater concentrations estimated from the observed ratio of ex situ to in situ porewater concentrations for specific homolog groups appeared to better predict bioaccumulation if the bioaccumulation factor is assumed to be the octanol water partition coefficient of pcbs overall this study demonstrates the significant pcb reductions and shows the feasibility of deploying activated carbon materials for pcb contaminated sediment management and remediation these results suggest the activated carbon treatment can be effective and that ac can be retained at the sediment surface in an open water tidal environment until it has mixed relatively deeply into the sediments the effectiveness of the ac is therefore likely to continue well beyond the 26 months of the monitoring supporting information additional information on the steady state fraction analysis placed activated

17634,for much of the world s urban population centralized treatment plants and pipe networks built in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries provide homes with water and a means of disposing of the resulting wastewater due to the real or perceived inability of existing systems to deliver safe and palatable water many users apply additional treatment prior to consumption where piped water supply is lacking drinking water is obtained through water vendors at considerable cost despite economic inefficiencies and public health risks inherent in these two water supply systems the high sunk costs of existing water infrastructure along with low returns on investment and the inflexible nature of the institutions involved in water provision have slowed down the diffusion of alternative approaches that may prove to be less expensive more adaptable and safer than the current system we advocate a third complementary route household based personalized water systems initially relatively affluent people expecting more functionality and sustainability from water systems will invest in personalized water systems that allow them to tailor their water to their personal preferences this approach will tap into the tremendous creativity base of individual users and entrepreneurs facilitating the type of co creation that accelerated the rapid development of consumer electronics competition among manufacturers and economies of scale that accrue as these systems become more popular will lead to rapid innovation that drives down costs improves performance and expands access these solutions complement emerging approaches for sanitation and resource recovery that do not rely upon sewers for the management of human waste graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water innovation decentralization water supply sunk cost effect sustainability 1 introduction 1 1 centralized water systems cannot keep up with modern challenges over the next three decades urban migration aquifer depletion and climate change induced droughts will affect more cities worldwide damania et al 2017 while efforts to make existing water systems more efficient e g reduction in water losses in water distribution networks water recycling will reduce water stress cities in middle income and rapidly developing countries will need to invest in new infrastructure if they hope to attain water security as defined in the sustainable development goals particularly goal 6 regarding availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation larsen et al 2016 in addition to the public health benefits of these investments there is a strong economic incentive for better water management a recent assessment from the oecd indicates that there is a compelling business case for investing in urban water systems investments in water and sanitation systems in developing nations have a 7 to 1 benefit cost ratio oecd 2011 to meet the future needs for water supply and sanitation it has been estimated that 6 6 trillion will be needed by 2030 and 22 6 trillion by 2050 winpenny 2015 despite the recognized need for investments available options are unattractive both from a logistic and economic perspective this creates an opportunity for alternative approaches in places where centralized water treatment systems are either absent bill and melinda gates foundation 2020 or where substantial investments would be needed to achieve the level of performance necessary for the protection of public health for example hybrid systems consisting of centralized water supply systems that provide water that is unsuitable for consumption coupled with household reverse osmosis systems are meeting the daily needs of millions of middle income residents in india the under the sink water purifier market in india which usually consists of small reverse osmosis units is expected to increase from 1 1 billion in 2015 to 4 1 billion by 2024 transparency market research 2019 this approach however does not solve the challenges associated with centralized water supply such as the high costs of maintaining and repairing the water distribution network and the associated costs of water loss due to pipe leakage in other places networks of trucks and water storage tanks are being used to meet household water needs for example over a quarter of the 20 million people who live in new delhi s underserved neighborhoods rely on trucked water in a market that has little if any governmental control sethi 2015 in addition to being expensive trucked water is also energy intensive in kisumu kenya water delivered by truck requires about 9 7 kwh m³ compared to 0 3 0 6 kwh m³ for tap water sima et al 2013 if the trends of the past three decades continue it is likely that hybrid systems or systems relying upon movement of large volumes of water by road will consume vast amounts of wealth and energy in rapidly developing cities the inadequacy of existing urban water systems is also evident in wealthy countries droughts in australia and the american southwest coupled with the lack of suitable sites for new surface water storage projects have driven billions of dollars investments in seawater desalination and centralized potable water reuse e g over 15 billion was invested in seawater desalination plants in australia over the past decade iwa 2016 even in locations where the water supply is still adequate centralized drinking water systems are challenged by a changing climate awwa 2014 and the need to replace aging water distribution networks folkman 2018 despite worldwide investment in building maintaining and operating centralized water systems fewer people are drinking water directly from the tap hu et al 2011 the detection of contaminants including lead allaire et al 2018 hu et al 2016 per and poly fluorinated alkyl substances pfas and legionella in drinking water has reduced consumer confidence in industrialized countries furthermore the reliance of many centralized water utilities on water that has unappealing aesthetic qualities due to high concentrations of salts or odorous compounds released by algae or fungi in the water distribution system has helped drive a bottled water industry gleick 2010a in the united states an estimated 5 65 billion of the 15 billion bottled water market is attributable to consumers who perceive that their tap water is unsafe javidi and pierce 2018 many challenges also exist for municipal wastewater systems in developed nations substantial investments are needed to address aging infrastructure and increasingly stringent effluent requirements in developing nations massive investments are needed to ensure adequate sanitation bank 2011 progress is being made through investments tied to meeting sustainable development goals but even the most innovative sanitation concepts face financial challenges larsen et al 2016 as a result alternative approaches that don t rely upon centralized sewer systems are gaining traction for example the swachh bharat mission in india addresses the challenge of building among others 120 million toilets in a timeframe of less than five years ministry of jal shakti 2017 in a manner analogous to these new approaches to sanitation the combination of expensive and increasingly unreliable centralized water supply and the perception that the quality of tap water is inadequate opens up opportunities for innovative water supply solutions this opportunity is unlikely to be a temporary situation the water sector is operated by conservative institutions that require decades to respond to the development of new technologies kiparsky et al 2013 for example one of the most significant achievements of the water sector the application of the reverse osmosis process for seawater desalination required about four decades of development and cost reduction to reach a point where it is competitive with alternative sources of water in developed countries much of the failure of innovative technologies can be attributed to institutional momentum long life cycles of equipment and a lack of competition among service providers when engineers advance ideas for making centralized treatment systems more efficient they tend to focus on incremental improvements over long time periods rather than disruptive innovation in part this is due to the risks associated with any large scale failure this behavior is in accordance with the sunk cost effect a state of mind that affects people charged with designing new technologies researchers and engineers tend to generate ideas with lower novelty and variety if they have already invested significant amounts of time money or effort in support of an existing path viswanathan and linsey 2013 as a result when environmental engineers finally attempt to improve the sustainability and economic viability of centralized urban water systems they tend to direct their efforts to aspects such as the treatment plant s energy efficiency utilities are supportive of energy savings which improve their overall financial situation but when one considers life cycle costs the energy needed to move water through the distribution systems and labor required to maintain and repair pipes are more expensive and consume more energy than treatment plants epri and wrf 2013 developing nations are still building their urban water infrastructure the world bank currently has a portfolio of some 35 billion in water investments the world bank 2020 much of which is related to water provision in rapidly growing but water stressed cities 1 2 learning from other infrastructure transitions given the challenge of advancing alternatives to the existing centralized system it may be worthwhile to look to other sectors for examples on how to successfully transition infrastructure in particular the diffusion of power generation at the household level may have some relevance to urban water systems for example to catalyze the adoption of solar energy at the household scale germany gradually increased the size and complexity of their trials from a single rooftop solar based energy independent house in 1983 erge et al 2001 to 1 000 homes in 1990 and 100 000 homes in 1998 with each successive step the unit cost of the installations decreased which allowed the government to decrease the subsidy from a state funded demonstration project to clusters of subsidized homes and finally low interest loans in early 2000 an additional guaranteed payment of 0 5 per kwh for pv generated electricity was added to the subsidies the cohort of consumers who installed the systems around 1990 were willing to spend more than 1 05 per kwh 300 per gj for the peace of mind of knowing that they were supporting an energy system that could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions as a result of the growth of the industry and the associated innovation from investors who perceived an opportunity for profits between 1977 and 1999 the cost of rooftop solar decreased over tenfold as over thousands of solar panels were installed after 2000 rapid development due to growth in the number of installed units brought the system cost down to 0 05 per kwh in 2017 lazard inc 2017 eliminating the need for subsidies in many places the rapidly growing household and industrial market drove advances in technology and fostered a diverse innovation ecosystem the success of distributed photovoltaic electricity generation came with some drawbacks related to the fact that many rooftop solar users benefit from the reliability of the power grid without providing enough funds to support its operation and upkeep but this success also led to new developments such as home based power storage to dampen fluctuations in power production over the course of the day and the spread of electric vehicles thus the opportunity to create sustainable electric power at the individual household level became the key driver for a rapidly innovating sector in time surpassing the conventional sector from an economic standpoint and bringing along secondary applications relative to power small scale water storage is less problematic because buffer tanks are cheap and effective still key observations from the photovoltaic power revolution could be applicable for water technology first the cost of household photovoltaic systems decreased by over two orders of magnitude as the number of installed units and the associated market grew second mass consumer uptake enhanced the rate of innovation and accelerated the rate at which the technology was adopted third the existence of the centralized system made it easier for decentralized systems to provide reliable service taking the developments in distributed power generation as a model we believe that centralized urban water systems will co exist with decentralized systems during a transition phase eventually centralized systems will lose their viability in some areas with low population densities and be replaced by fully household or building scale systems in locations where decentralized systems offer substantial advantages these systems will predominantly address in house water needs rather than e g large scale irrigation needs but evidently they can directly or indirectly contribute to them 1 3 a water sector in transition when considering the diffusion of distributed treatment in the water sector it is important to acknowledge some key differences between water and electricity generation first whereas the sun rises every morning to produce electricity with pv installations extended periods of drought pose severe challenges to distributed water suppliers second inadequacies in the pv sector would not pose major public health concerns whereas the potential for disease transmission or illness must be considered in any effort to alter water supplies third many cities rely upon pressurized piped water for fighting fires finally unlike electricity the quality of treated water determines its use water used for landscape irrigation or washing clothes does not require the same level of pathogen removal or inactivation as drinking water much like the roof based solar panels of the 1970s the components of home based water systems are already advancing in a piecemeal manner rainwater capture and greywater reuse are being used for non potable water purposes national academies of sciences 2016 and even as drinking water supplies at the household scale campisano et al 2017 sojka et al 2016 membrane bioreactors mbrs are being employed table s 1 and table s 2 to treat sewage and greywater at the building scale with advances in membrane technology small scale ultraviolet lamps and household reverse osmosis systems it should be possible to turn roof water greywater shallow groundwater or even treated sewage into any type of water needed within the home including drinking water the technology has arrived but the relatively low cost of existing water services in most places which is often related to government subsidies coupled with the challenges of assuring safe and reliable operations when new technologies are deployed at scale is slowing diffusion of decentralized solutions nonetheless with current technological advances off the grid household systems can take care of both water supply and sanitation through a combination of water use efficiency rainwater collection and water reuse 1 4 the personalized water system today it is possible to build a safe reliable modular system that can provide water at home or building scale for a price that is affordable to wealthy homeowners personalized water systems could be attractive to these early adopters because they value independence from municipal water systems that they believe are unreliable or unsafe in addition they appreciate the ability of such systems to tailor their water to their personal preferences decentralized water systems employing reverse osmosis ion exchange and other established technologies can already adjust the properties of water for specific purposes softened water for showers and clothes washing nutrient amended water for landscape irrigation and mineral water of different types for drinking and cooking in light of the availability of these technologies and their potential appeal to users of the systems we argue that in a manner analogous to the development of rooftop solar the technology will find its first substantial application with affluent customers who will drive technological innovation eventually reducing the costs of the technology which will lead to further innovation and application in developing nations this stands in contrast to efforts like the slingshot water system foster 2014 which attempted to provide a revolutionary decentralized water treatment system to consumers in rapidly developing countries without first taking advantage of the opportunities to drive down costs in a market where consumers were less sensitive to costs to assess the potential of personalized water systems to provide water for a household disconnected from the potable water grid scenario simulations were performed that considered rainwater capture and use and greywater treatment and reuse blackwater reuse was excluded from these simulations 2 methods 2 1 general assumptions an average flemish flanders belgium household of 2 3 inhabitant equivalents was assumed with an average daily water consumption per person of 109 l and a rainwater capture surface of 100 m² outline in fig 1 a rainwater tank of 10 m³ a potable water storage tank of 2 m³ a purified greywater storage tank of 6 m³ and a blackwater tank of 10 m³ were assumed the water recovery of the mbr and ro were assumed to be 90 and 80 respectively the following water flows were distinguished greywater purified greywater rainwater potable water and blackwater purified or treated greywater was defined as water applicable for direct non potable reuse potable water originating from rainwater was considered suitable for human consumption blackwater or toilet wastewater was stored separately and was not considered for reuse in this scenario rainfall data of ghent belgium from 2012 2017 was used which included a dry year in 2015 the volume of rainwater harvested equals the rainfall l m² multiplied by roof surface a correction factor for roof losses 0 9 and filter losses 0 9 to prevent accumulation of deposited pollutants on the rooftop material during a prolonged drought a first flush diversion can be applied in which about 1 2 mm of precipitation is diverted away from the rainwater tank forster 1999 two scenarios were evaluated one favoring rainwater reuse and one favoring greywater reuse fig 2 in the increased rainwater reuse scenario instead of reusing as much of the greywater as possible the maximum possible amount of rainwater was directed to the mbr for non potable reuse 2 2 model construction scenarios were evaluated on a montly basis defined as 1 12th of a year and thus daily fluctuations were neglected for simplicity the volume of water in a tank was calculated as the sum of all the flows during that month and consequently represented the volume of water present in a tank on the last day of the month every scenario spanned a period of 5 years details are summarized in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 scenario evaluation the increased rainwater reuse scenario resulted in a significant share of the produced greywater being directed to the septic tank requiring emptying of the septic tank six times per year overall during the 5 year time interval an adequate water supply was obtained without the need for a supplemented water supply figure s 3 if greywater reuse was increased the rainwater tank would be full most of the time figure s 4 emptying the septic tank was necessary every three months in this scenario simulating increased greywater reuse also did not require water supplementation figure s 4 these simulations infer that off the grid water management can provide sufficient water for an average household when the rainwater tank was full excess rainwater was infiltrated into the surroundings it is evident that when greywater is optimally reused more rainwater is diverted towards infiltration compared to the case where rainwater is optimally used figure s 5 the city of ghent however has a steady rainfall throughout the year with only short periods of drought four other regions were evaluated namely cape town south africa new delhi india hyderabad pakistan and los angeles united states climate information and precipitation data was obtained harris and jones 2017 köppen and geiger 1930 tu dresden n d while other parameters were assumed equal to those in the above described scenario in cape town warm dry summers and mild wet winters are typical of the mediterranean climate new delhi s climate is a monsoon influenced humid subtropical climate bordering a hot semi arid climate large weather variations between summer and winter occur both in terms of precipitation and temperature hyderabad experiences an arid climate with monsoon rains in the summer although with much less precipitation than the monsoon rains in new delhi the seasonal variation in precipitation in cape town new delhi and hyderabad increased stress on the rainwater tank during the dry period compared to the ghent scenario figure s 6 s 7 and s 8 for both cape town and new delhi the rainwater tank required one external refill over the simulated five year period for hyderabad the necessity of refilling the rainwater tank over the simulated time interval was 7 times a bigger surface for rainwater collection could be implemented to compensate or water saving measures could be applied to lower the water use of the household or blackwater reuse could be investigated to elevate the reuse percentage for the case in los angeles where rainfall is relatively sparse a rainwater tank or bladder of 20m³ was used in the simulation this tank had to be refilled 5 times over the course of 5 years due to extensive periods of drought figure s 9 a roof surface area of 300m² instead of 100m² could solve this issue meaning the rainwater tank 20m³ would suffice to avoid a need for supplemental water overall greywater and rainwater can provide enough water for an average household in areas with stable rainfall whereas supplemental water supply or blackwater treatment will be needed in areas where this is less stable many scenarios could be developed with various levels of integration however independent of the scenario or the technology for local water production and purification water efficiency will come closer to the consumer to assess the barriers to these advances we have performed a preliminary force field analysis table s 3 which brings many of the addressed aspects in this study together with possible mitigation approaches 3 2 towards a consumer driven market in the water sector a critical factor that differentiates personalized water systems from other water systems is the ability of the consumer to control the quality of water delivered the consequence of this attribute is that water technology would function as a consumer good with components that have much shorter lifetimes than existing water systems this provides an impetus for companies to bring new technologies to the market that either provide new functionalities or to produce modules that are easier and cheaper to operate to assure the maintenance of public health and fire protection the present day utility might maintain the remaining legacy water system likely reduced to a backbone or coupled to the local water storage tanks depending on the local situation an entity such as a utility or a new type of organization would need to assure that water produced by the system remains in compliance with public health objectives via remote monitoring with wireless communication in addition to economies of scale that would lower costs the functionality of the new systems would continue to improve because the system allows water users to directly interact with water technology the water user drives the market demanding new functionalities such as lower energy use decreased maintenance and better control of water quality in a process referred to as consumer co creation prahalad and ramaswamy 2004 as the market develops we anticipate that the interface of the devices will become more user friendly to meet the needs of users who have little knowledge about water quality or treatment the rate at which new treatment modules are introduced will increase as the size of the market increases new functions that meet the needs of specific groups of consumers e g water quality tailored to the needs of infants and young families will become available accompanying a continued decrease in cost due to mass production of components and higher user awareness we anticipate decreased overall water usage due to direct awareness of the implications of water consumption coupled to increased popularity of the systems by builders and architects as their contribution to environmental sustainability increases additional financial incentives such as subsidies may be relevant as personalized water systems decrease the need for cities to expand their water supplies and wastewater treatment systems as population grows or as climate change reduces water availability the need for water buffering at home level also creates a local supply of treated grey and or rainwater that could be deployed for firefighting if needed 3 3 more than a pv revolution with personalized water systems in place the user can make choices about the properties of the water in their home as first example it is well known that human need for calcium changes over time with a higher dietary need among rapidly growing children and senior citizens world health organization 2005 therefore a personalized water system can produce potable water based on temporary needs sawka et al 2005 second water flavor is a personal issue and devices can be designed to create water with different ionic compositions tailored to consumer preference e g a consumer may prefer water with a modest amount of dissolved salts when brewing coffee but might prefer a mineral rich water to complement a meal finally the rapid evolution in prebiotics and probiotics has also entered the bottled water market i e probiotic water such healthy microbes could be cultured and dispensed in tap water or bathing water ensuring digestive health or safeguarding the microbial community on the skin a steerable community grice and segre 2011 today consumers can only change their water by purchasing bottled water or adding supplements to tap water 3 4 a preliminary business case in the first stage of the development of the technology early adopters i e affluent consumers who want to control their water systems will be drawn to the distinctive features of the personalized system key features for these consumers likely include personalization of the water quality and taste in house and the ability to generate the electricity needed to run the system using pv power at home at an energy cost of 2 kwh m3 water produced in house and for a need of 220 m3 per year for an average family 600l per day an energy investment of 440 kwh per year is needed which can be delivered by 3 m2 of photovoltaic panels the water can be stored temporarily becoming a contributor to storage of renewable power for less affluent users e g the resident of a new housing development in a wealthy country the purchase of a pws offers benefits similar to the pv systems that underwent rapid adoption in the early 2000s an example of willingness to pay for water service is point of use water filters which deliver water that is perceived as better than tap water but requiring regular purchase of filters the cost of the additional water treatment this way is about 0 25 0 30 per liter barnaby et al 2017 a second example is the purchase of bottled water at a price at least 300 times dearer than tap water gleick 2010b and an energy cost of 5 6 10 2 mj l 1 as much as 2000 times the energy cost of producing tap water gleick and cooley 2009 similar to photovoltaics the economy of scale realized at the household level will lead to the required cost decreases quality increases and the growth of consumer trust similar to consumer electronics the user will add new features such as a preference to capture an adequate quantity of rainwater for use as potable water source linking water systems to anticipated local weather patterns and the user s personal schedule e g presence absence although they have obvious appeal the first generation of pwss will only succeed if they are affordable to the target audience considering the system depicted in box 1 and assuming current off the shelf components we roughly estimate the cost for the hardware components in a developed country at approximately 11 000 see supplementary information section s 3 for a rough estimate this evidently does not include installation piping extensive online monitoring and automation which may vary substantially depending on the location and wishes of the client turnkey systems are already on the market that enable greywater treatment for reuse as flushing water or for washing e g the hydraloop system hydraloop systems 2020 if such systems achieve a similar cost reduction as pv over time installed systems will costs less than 10 000 thus including installation costs comparisons with current water costs are complex due to subsidies and variations in water service charges among countries a family of 4 using 110l of water per person per day has a water bill at the level of some 500 1000 per year in the antwerp region belgium de watergroep 2020 in other places the cost to the consumer can be substantially lower because the full cost of water is not directly charged to the user in any case at such comparable costs system payback times would be at the same level of home based heat pumps i e around 10 years the business case for personalized water will thus vary among locations for example cities facing water scarcity may find the approach to be more attractive than cities with ample water resources and static or declining populations and will thus be more inclined to provide incentives likewise densely populated portions of cities e g manhattan where space for storage tanks are not readily available will be less likely to find the approach to be attractive relative to a city with many low density suburbs e g the suburbs surrounding new york city 4 co creation of second generation pwss after early adopters install the first generation pwss we envision a period of 5 to 10 years in which users and small businesses create new modules new means of running pwss and new business models the act of relying upon outside entities to adapt the system functionality is similar to the way in which the micro electronics industry advanced the early smartphone into the current generation of wireless communication devices via consumer driven innovation for example from a mere 800 apps at the launch of the apple store in 2008 the number had grown to 2 2 million by may 2017 lifewire 2020 with the android platform being even larger performance and functionality of consumer electronics thus continues to improve as the user interfaces directly with the technology and assists in the development the innovation pace drives developers to match the pace setting clear innovation goals and deadlines with a cross sectoral impact such a development will enable the pws to develop into a second generation that appeals to people other than the early adopters interesting early examples of such developments for water are apps that enable online prepayment of water to provide more financial guarantees to water operators e g citytaps 2019 or that monitor household water consumption in relation to their own behaviors e g buoy 2019 5 diffusion of pwss to underserved communities during the first two decades of their development solar photovoltaics and cellular telephones were unaffordable to over three quarters of the world s population as the economy of scale and advances in manufacturing drove down costs the technology spread to people with lower incomes barnaby et al 2017 following the drop of pv prices emerging nations rapidly adopted the technology increasing the rate of installation from 3 gw in 2011 to 34 gw in 2016 including more than 1 5 million solar home systems in africa installed between 2015 and 2016 climatescope 2018 green tech media 2020 these new users contributed to the evolution of these technologies by adapting them to their specific needs for example the roll out of mobile phones in india drives the development of modular solar power systems including storage to provide the necessary electricity water is a universal need and a human right and controversy may arise when technologies that deliver better water are initially available to those who can afford it however personal water systems do not have to be the privilege of the wealthy these systems should not decrease overall water quality on the contrary they should provide better water for a lower price than alternatives like water from vendors second similar to pv the investments made by early movers should enable the necessary cost reduction to catalyze the broader market introduction which may happen in rapidly developing nations as fast as in wealthy nations utilities will still need to monitor performance of water systems and the income for this service can be used to support the less affluent water users finally the personalized water concept could be applied in developing countries in the form of personalized water kiosks for example where instead of tap water water produced to match a personalized taste or a desired use is sold 6 is it safe finally the question of safety and reliability is critical to the diffusion of personalized water systems currently failures of centralized drinking water and wastewater systems are rare in developed countries in the us for example a total of 780 outbreaks of waterborne diseases associated with contaminated drinking water occurred between 1971 and 2006 22 outbreaks per year resulting in 577 094 cases of illness and 93 deaths craun et al 2010 however most of the cases of illness 403 000 were linked to a single cryptosporidiosis outbreak in milwaukee as technology develops failures will occur failure can have a huge impact on product acceptance of a new technology harris lovett et al 2015 current under the sink ro systems require frequent monthly quarterly of semi annual after sale service visits for control and replacement o connor 2016 we believe that pwss will need to be monitored by utilities or other trusted entities which will constitute a key new role for these entities home building and other types of distributed water systems can be safeguarded against tampering similar to natural gas and electricity supplies which bring potentially lethal products into the home likewise they can be monitored in real time for the more advanced applications such as addition of prebiotics and probiotics a common framework will be needed to assure safety the development of this common framework will need to see cross sectoral collaboration including the development of robust sensor systems operating within cloud based applications and clear iso type standards enabling expansion the latter can follow an approach as used for civil aviation where a rigorous set of standards and certificates is applied to make aviation safe while the user can choose the quality of the experience depending on the fare and air service provider the former requires a major effort to define sensor requirements up to the level where not only major water constituents are measured but also microbial communities and trace contaminants 7 conclusions radical innovation was possible in the power and telecommunications sector through the emergence and mass production of personalized small scale systems the same is possible in the water sector if we are willing to consider alternatives to the existing centralized large scale infrastructure with piped and trucked water we can create a third route involving extremely decentralized household level systems which we term personal water systems pws our scenario analysis demonstrates that in many cases houses and buildings can become water independent or can deliver water with occasional supplementation beyond the basic opportunities to innovate the technology and to achieve greater sustainability and resilience pwss have the potential to create new avenues to improve water as a

17634,for much of the world s urban population centralized treatment plants and pipe networks built in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries provide homes with water and a means of disposing of the resulting wastewater due to the real or perceived inability of existing systems to deliver safe and palatable water many users apply additional treatment prior to consumption where piped water supply is lacking drinking water is obtained through water vendors at considerable cost despite economic inefficiencies and public health risks inherent in these two water supply systems the high sunk costs of existing water infrastructure along with low returns on investment and the inflexible nature of the institutions involved in water provision have slowed down the diffusion of alternative approaches that may prove to be less expensive more adaptable and safer than the current system we advocate a third complementary route household based personalized water systems initially relatively affluent people expecting more functionality and sustainability from water systems will invest in personalized water systems that allow them to tailor their water to their personal preferences this approach will tap into the tremendous creativity base of individual users and entrepreneurs facilitating the type of co creation that accelerated the rapid development of consumer electronics competition among manufacturers and economies of scale that accrue as these systems become more popular will lead to rapid innovation that drives down costs improves performance and expands access these solutions complement emerging approaches for sanitation and resource recovery that do not rely upon sewers for the management of human waste graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water innovation decentralization water supply sunk cost effect sustainability 1 introduction 1 1 centralized water systems cannot keep up with modern challenges over the next three decades urban migration aquifer depletion and climate change induced droughts will affect more cities worldwide damania et al 2017 while efforts to make existing water systems more efficient e g reduction in water losses in water distribution networks water recycling will reduce water stress cities in middle income and rapidly developing countries will need to invest in new infrastructure if they hope to attain water security as defined in the sustainable development goals particularly goal 6 regarding availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation larsen et al 2016 in addition to the public health benefits of these investments there is a strong economic incentive for better water management a recent assessment from the oecd indicates that there is a compelling business case for investing in urban water systems investments in water and sanitation systems in developing nations have a 7 to 1 benefit cost ratio oecd 2011 to meet the future needs for water supply and sanitation it has been estimated that 6 6 trillion will be needed by 2030 and 22 6 trillion by 2050 winpenny 2015 despite the recognized need for investments available options are unattractive both from a logistic and economic perspective this creates an opportunity for alternative approaches in places where centralized water treatment systems are either absent bill and melinda gates foundation 2020 or where substantial investments would be needed to achieve the level of performance necessary for the protection of public health for example hybrid systems consisting of centralized water supply systems that provide water that is unsuitable for consumption coupled with household reverse osmosis systems are meeting the daily needs of millions of middle income residents in india the under the sink water purifier market in india which usually consists of small reverse osmosis units is expected to increase from 1 1 billion in 2015 to 4 1 billion by 2024 transparency market research 2019 this approach however does not solve the challenges associated with centralized water supply such as the high costs of maintaining and repairing the water distribution network and the associated costs of water loss due to pipe leakage in other places networks of trucks and water storage tanks are being used to meet household water needs for example over a quarter of the 20 million people who live in new delhi s underserved neighborhoods rely on trucked water in a market that has little if any governmental control sethi 2015 in addition to being expensive trucked water is also energy intensive in kisumu kenya water delivered by truck requires about 9 7 kwh m³ compared to 0 3 0 6 kwh m³ for tap water sima et al 2013 if the trends of the past three decades continue it is likely that hybrid systems or systems relying upon movement of large volumes of water by road will consume vast amounts of wealth and energy in rapidly developing cities the inadequacy of existing urban water systems is also evident in wealthy countries droughts in australia and the american southwest coupled with the lack of suitable sites for new surface water storage projects have driven billions of dollars investments in seawater desalination and centralized potable water reuse e g over 15 billion was invested in seawater desalination plants in australia over the past decade iwa 2016 even in locations where the water supply is still adequate centralized drinking water systems are challenged by a changing climate awwa 2014 and the need to replace aging water distribution networks folkman 2018 despite worldwide investment in building maintaining and operating centralized water systems fewer people are drinking water directly from the tap hu et al 2011 the detection of contaminants including lead allaire et al 2018 hu et al 2016 per and poly fluorinated alkyl substances pfas and legionella in drinking water has reduced consumer confidence in industrialized countries furthermore the reliance of many centralized water utilities on water that has unappealing aesthetic qualities due to high concentrations of salts or odorous compounds released by algae or fungi in the water distribution system has helped drive a bottled water industry gleick 2010a in the united states an estimated 5 65 billion of the 15 billion bottled water market is attributable to consumers who perceive that their tap water is unsafe javidi and pierce 2018 many challenges also exist for municipal wastewater systems in developed nations substantial investments are needed to address aging infrastructure and increasingly stringent effluent requirements in developing nations massive investments are needed to ensure adequate sanitation bank 2011 progress is being made through investments tied to meeting sustainable development goals but even the most innovative sanitation concepts face financial challenges larsen et al 2016 as a result alternative approaches that don t rely upon centralized sewer systems are gaining traction for example the swachh bharat mission in india addresses the challenge of building among others 120 million toilets in a timeframe of less than five years ministry of jal shakti 2017 in a manner analogous to these new approaches to sanitation the combination of expensive and increasingly unreliable centralized water supply and the perception that the quality of tap water is inadequate opens up opportunities for innovative water supply solutions this opportunity is unlikely to be a temporary situation the water sector is operated by conservative institutions that require decades to respond to the development of new technologies kiparsky et al 2013 for example one of the most significant achievements of the water sector the application of the reverse osmosis process for seawater desalination required about four decades of development and cost reduction to reach a point where it is competitive with alternative sources of water in developed countries much of the failure of innovative technologies can be attributed to institutional momentum long life cycles of equipment and a lack of competition among service providers when engineers advance ideas for making centralized treatment systems more efficient they tend to focus on incremental improvements over long time periods rather than disruptive innovation in part this is due to the risks associated with any large scale failure this behavior is in accordance with the sunk cost effect a state of mind that affects people charged with designing new technologies researchers and engineers tend to generate ideas with lower novelty and variety if they have already invested significant amounts of time money or effort in support of an existing path viswanathan and linsey 2013 as a result when environmental engineers finally attempt to improve the sustainability and economic viability of centralized urban water systems they tend to direct their efforts to aspects such as the treatment plant s energy efficiency utilities are supportive of energy savings which improve their overall financial situation but when one considers life cycle costs the energy needed to move water through the distribution systems and labor required to maintain and repair pipes are more expensive and consume more energy than treatment plants epri and wrf 2013 developing nations are still building their urban water infrastructure the world bank currently has a portfolio of some 35 billion in water investments the world bank 2020 much of which is related to water provision in rapidly growing but water stressed cities 1 2 learning from other infrastructure transitions given the challenge of advancing alternatives to the existing centralized system it may be worthwhile to look to other sectors for examples on how to successfully transition infrastructure in particular the diffusion of power generation at the household level may have some relevance to urban water systems for example to catalyze the adoption of solar energy at the household scale germany gradually increased the size and complexity of their trials from a single rooftop solar based energy independent house in 1983 erge et al 2001 to 1 000 homes in 1990 and 100 000 homes in 1998 with each successive step the unit cost of the installations decreased which allowed the government to decrease the subsidy from a state funded demonstration project to clusters of subsidized homes and finally low interest loans in early 2000 an additional guaranteed payment of 0 5 per kwh for pv generated electricity was added to the subsidies the cohort of consumers who installed the systems around 1990 were willing to spend more than 1 05 per kwh 300 per gj for the peace of mind of knowing that they were supporting an energy system that could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions as a result of the growth of the industry and the associated innovation from investors who perceived an opportunity for profits between 1977 and 1999 the cost of rooftop solar decreased over tenfold as over thousands of solar panels were installed after 2000 rapid development due to growth in the number of installed units brought the system cost down to 0 05 per kwh in 2017 lazard inc 2017 eliminating the need for subsidies in many places the rapidly growing household and industrial market drove advances in technology and fostered a diverse innovation ecosystem the success of distributed photovoltaic electricity generation came with some drawbacks related to the fact that many rooftop solar users benefit from the reliability of the power grid without providing enough funds to support its operation and upkeep but this success also led to new developments such as home based power storage to dampen fluctuations in power production over the course of the day and the spread of electric vehicles thus the opportunity to create sustainable electric power at the individual household level became the key driver for a rapidly innovating sector in time surpassing the conventional sector from an economic standpoint and bringing along secondary applications relative to power small scale water storage is less problematic because buffer tanks are cheap and effective still key observations from the photovoltaic power revolution could be applicable for water technology first the cost of household photovoltaic systems decreased by over two orders of magnitude as the number of installed units and the associated market grew second mass consumer uptake enhanced the rate of innovation and accelerated the rate at which the technology was adopted third the existence of the centralized system made it easier for decentralized systems to provide reliable service taking the developments in distributed power generation as a model we believe that centralized urban water systems will co exist with decentralized systems during a transition phase eventually centralized systems will lose their viability in some areas with low population densities and be replaced by fully household or building scale systems in locations where decentralized systems offer substantial advantages these systems will predominantly address in house water needs rather than e g large scale irrigation needs but evidently they can directly or indirectly contribute to them 1 3 a water sector in transition when considering the diffusion of distributed treatment in the water sector it is important to acknowledge some key differences between water and electricity generation first whereas the sun rises every morning to produce electricity with pv installations extended periods of drought pose severe challenges to distributed water suppliers second inadequacies in the pv sector would not pose major public health concerns whereas the potential for disease transmission or illness must be considered in any effort to alter water supplies third many cities rely upon pressurized piped water for fighting fires finally unlike electricity the quality of treated water determines its use water used for landscape irrigation or washing clothes does not require the same level of pathogen removal or inactivation as drinking water much like the roof based solar panels of the 1970s the components of home based water systems are already advancing in a piecemeal manner rainwater capture and greywater reuse are being used for non potable water purposes national academies of sciences 2016 and even as drinking water supplies at the household scale campisano et al 2017 sojka et al 2016 membrane bioreactors mbrs are being employed table s 1 and table s 2 to treat sewage and greywater at the building scale with advances in membrane technology small scale ultraviolet lamps and household reverse osmosis systems it should be possible to turn roof water greywater shallow groundwater or even treated sewage into any type of water needed within the home including drinking water the technology has arrived but the relatively low cost of existing water services in most places which is often related to government subsidies coupled with the challenges of assuring safe and reliable operations when new technologies are deployed at scale is slowing diffusion of decentralized solutions nonetheless with current technological advances off the grid household systems can take care of both water supply and sanitation through a combination of water use efficiency rainwater collection and water reuse 1 4 the personalized water system today it is possible to build a safe reliable modular system that can provide water at home or building scale for a price that is affordable to wealthy homeowners personalized water systems could be attractive to these early adopters because they value independence from municipal water systems that they believe are unreliable or unsafe in addition they appreciate the ability of such systems to tailor their water to their personal preferences decentralized water systems employing reverse osmosis ion exchange and other established technologies can already adjust the properties of water for specific purposes softened water for showers and clothes washing nutrient amended water for landscape irrigation and mineral water of different types for drinking and cooking in light of the availability of these technologies and their potential appeal to users of the systems we argue that in a manner analogous to the development of rooftop solar the technology will find its first substantial application with affluent customers who will drive technological innovation eventually reducing the costs of the technology which will lead to further innovation and application in developing nations this stands in contrast to efforts like the slingshot water system foster 2014 which attempted to provide a revolutionary decentralized water treatment system to consumers in rapidly developing countries without first taking advantage of the opportunities to drive down costs in a market where consumers were less sensitive to costs to assess the potential of personalized water systems to provide water for a household disconnected from the potable water grid scenario simulations were performed that considered rainwater capture and use and greywater treatment and reuse blackwater reuse was excluded from these simulations 2 methods 2 1 general assumptions an average flemish flanders belgium household of 2 3 inhabitant equivalents was assumed with an average daily water consumption per person of 109 l and a rainwater capture surface of 100 m² outline in fig 1 a rainwater tank of 10 m³ a potable water storage tank of 2 m³ a purified greywater storage tank of 6 m³ and a blackwater tank of 10 m³ were assumed the water recovery of the mbr and ro were assumed to be 90 and 80 respectively the following water flows were distinguished greywater purified greywater rainwater potable water and blackwater purified or treated greywater was defined as water applicable for direct non potable reuse potable water originating from rainwater was considered suitable for human consumption blackwater or toilet wastewater was stored separately and was not considered for reuse in this scenario rainfall data of ghent belgium from 2012 2017 was used which included a dry year in 2015 the volume of rainwater harvested equals the rainfall l m² multiplied by roof surface a correction factor for roof losses 0 9 and filter losses 0 9 to prevent accumulation of deposited pollutants on the rooftop material during a prolonged drought a first flush diversion can be applied in which about 1 2 mm of precipitation is diverted away from the rainwater tank forster 1999 two scenarios were evaluated one favoring rainwater reuse and one favoring greywater reuse fig 2 in the increased rainwater reuse scenario instead of reusing as much of the greywater as possible the maximum possible amount of rainwater was directed to the mbr for non potable reuse 2 2 model construction scenarios were evaluated on a montly basis defined as 1 12th of a year and thus daily fluctuations were neglected for simplicity the volume of water in a tank was calculated as the sum of all the flows during that month and consequently represented the volume of water present in a tank on the last day of the month every scenario spanned a period of 5 years details are summarized in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 scenario evaluation the increased rainwater reuse scenario resulted in a significant share of the produced greywater being directed to the septic tank requiring emptying of the septic tank six times per year overall during the 5 year time interval an adequate water supply was obtained without the need for a supplemented water supply figure s 3 if greywater reuse was increased the rainwater tank would be full most of the time figure s 4 emptying the septic tank was necessary every three months in this scenario simulating increased greywater reuse also did not require water supplementation figure s 4 these simulations infer that off the grid water management can provide sufficient water for an average household when the rainwater tank was full excess rainwater was infiltrated into the surroundings it is evident that when greywater is optimally reused more rainwater is diverted towards infiltration compared to the case where rainwater is optimally used figure s 5 the city of ghent however has a steady rainfall throughout the year with only short periods of drought four other regions were evaluated namely cape town south africa new delhi india hyderabad pakistan and los angeles united states climate information and precipitation data was obtained harris and jones 2017 köppen and geiger 1930 tu dresden n d while other parameters were assumed equal to those in the above described scenario in cape town warm dry summers and mild wet winters are typical of the mediterranean climate new delhi s climate is a monsoon influenced humid subtropical climate bordering a hot semi arid climate large weather variations between summer and winter occur both in terms of precipitation and temperature hyderabad experiences an arid climate with monsoon rains in the summer although with much less precipitation than the monsoon rains in new delhi the seasonal variation in precipitation in cape town new delhi and hyderabad increased stress on the rainwater tank during the dry period compared to the ghent scenario figure s 6 s 7 and s 8 for both cape town and new delhi the rainwater tank required one external refill over the simulated five year period for hyderabad the necessity of refilling the rainwater tank over the simulated time interval was 7 times a bigger surface for rainwater collection could be implemented to compensate or water saving measures could be applied to lower the water use of the household or blackwater reuse could be investigated to elevate the reuse percentage for the case in los angeles where rainfall is relatively sparse a rainwater tank or bladder of 20m³ was used in the simulation this tank had to be refilled 5 times over the course of 5 years due to extensive periods of drought figure s 9 a roof surface area of 300m² instead of 100m² could solve this issue meaning the rainwater tank 20m³ would suffice to avoid a need for supplemental water overall greywater and rainwater can provide enough water for an average household in areas with stable rainfall whereas supplemental water supply or blackwater treatment will be needed in areas where this is less stable many scenarios could be developed with various levels of integration however independent of the scenario or the technology for local water production and purification water efficiency will come closer to the consumer to assess the barriers to these advances we have performed a preliminary force field analysis table s 3 which brings many of the addressed aspects in this study together with possible mitigation approaches 3 2 towards a consumer driven market in the water sector a critical factor that differentiates personalized water systems from other water systems is the ability of the consumer to control the quality of water delivered the consequence of this attribute is that water technology would function as a consumer good with components that have much shorter lifetimes than existing water systems this provides an impetus for companies to bring new technologies to the market that either provide new functionalities or to produce modules that are easier and cheaper to operate to assure the maintenance of public health and fire protection the present day utility might maintain the remaining legacy water system likely reduced to a backbone or coupled to the local water storage tanks depending on the local situation an entity such as a utility or a new type of organization would need to assure that water produced by the system remains in compliance with public health objectives via remote monitoring with wireless communication in addition to economies of scale that would lower costs the functionality of the new systems would continue to improve because the system allows water users to directly interact with water technology the water user drives the market demanding new functionalities such as lower energy use decreased maintenance and better control of water quality in a process referred to as consumer co creation prahalad and ramaswamy 2004 as the market develops we anticipate that the interface of the devices will become more user friendly to meet the needs of users who have little knowledge about water quality or treatment the rate at which new treatment modules are introduced will increase as the size of the market increases new functions that meet the needs of specific groups of consumers e g water quality tailored to the needs of infants and young families will become available accompanying a continued decrease in cost due to mass production of components and higher user awareness we anticipate decreased overall water usage due to direct awareness of the implications of water consumption coupled to increased popularity of the systems by builders and architects as their contribution to environmental sustainability increases additional financial incentives such as subsidies may be relevant as personalized water systems decrease the need for cities to expand their water supplies and wastewater treatment systems as population grows or as climate change reduces water availability the need for water buffering at home level also creates a local supply of treated grey and or rainwater that could be deployed for firefighting if needed 3 3 more than a pv revolution with personalized water systems in place the user can make choices about the properties of the water in their home as first example it is well known that human need for calcium changes over time with a higher dietary need among rapidly growing children and senior citizens world health organization 2005 therefore a personalized water system can produce potable water based on temporary needs sawka et al 2005 second water flavor is a personal issue and devices can be designed to create water with different ionic compositions tailored to consumer preference e g a consumer may prefer water with a modest amount of dissolved salts when brewing coffee but might prefer a mineral rich water to complement a meal finally the rapid evolution in prebiotics and probiotics has also entered the bottled water market i e probiotic water such healthy microbes could be cultured and dispensed in tap water or bathing water ensuring digestive health or safeguarding the microbial community on the skin a steerable community grice and segre 2011 today consumers can only change their water by purchasing bottled water or adding supplements to tap water 3 4 a preliminary business case in the first stage of the development of the technology early adopters i e affluent consumers who want to control their water systems will be drawn to the distinctive features of the personalized system key features for these consumers likely include personalization of the water quality and taste in house and the ability to generate the electricity needed to run the system using pv power at home at an energy cost of 2 kwh m3 water produced in house and for a need of 220 m3 per year for an average family 600l per day an energy investment of 440 kwh per year is needed which can be delivered by 3 m2 of photovoltaic panels the water can be stored temporarily becoming a contributor to storage of renewable power for less affluent users e g the resident of a new housing development in a wealthy country the purchase of a pws offers benefits similar to the pv systems that underwent rapid adoption in the early 2000s an example of willingness to pay for water service is point of use water filters which deliver water that is perceived as better than tap water but requiring regular purchase of filters the cost of the additional water treatment this way is about 0 25 0 30 per liter barnaby et al 2017 a second example is the purchase of bottled water at a price at least 300 times dearer than tap water gleick 2010b and an energy cost of 5 6 10 2 mj l 1 as much as 2000 times the energy cost of producing tap water gleick and cooley 2009 similar to photovoltaics the economy of scale realized at the household level will lead to the required cost decreases quality increases and the growth of consumer trust similar to consumer electronics the user will add new features such as a preference to capture an adequate quantity of rainwater for use as potable water source linking water systems to anticipated local weather patterns and the user s personal schedule e g presence absence although they have obvious appeal the first generation of pwss will only succeed if they are affordable to the target audience considering the system depicted in box 1 and assuming current off the shelf components we roughly estimate the cost for the hardware components in a developed country at approximately 11 000 see supplementary information section s 3 for a rough estimate this evidently does not include installation piping extensive online monitoring and automation which may vary substantially depending on the location and wishes of the client turnkey systems are already on the market that enable greywater treatment for reuse as flushing water or for washing e g the hydraloop system hydraloop systems 2020 if such systems achieve a similar cost reduction as pv over time installed systems will costs less than 10 000 thus including installation costs comparisons with current water costs are complex due to subsidies and variations in water service charges among countries a family of 4 using 110l of water per person per day has a water bill at the level of some 500 1000 per year in the antwerp region belgium de watergroep 2020 in other places the cost to the consumer can be substantially lower because the full cost of water is not directly charged to the user in any case at such comparable costs system payback times would be at the same level of home based heat pumps i e around 10 years the business case for personalized water will thus vary among locations for example cities facing water scarcity may find the approach to be more attractive than cities with ample water resources and static or declining populations and will thus be more inclined to provide incentives likewise densely populated portions of cities e g manhattan where space for storage tanks are not readily available will be less likely to find the approach to be attractive relative to a city with many low density suburbs e g the suburbs surrounding new york city 4 co creation of second generation pwss after early adopters install the first generation pwss we envision a period of 5 to 10 years in which users and small businesses create new modules new means of running pwss and new business models the act of relying upon outside entities to adapt the system functionality is similar to the way in which the micro electronics industry advanced the early smartphone into the current generation of wireless communication devices via consumer driven innovation for example from a mere 800 apps at the launch of the apple store in 2008 the number had grown to 2 2 million by may 2017 lifewire 2020 with the android platform being even larger performance and functionality of consumer electronics thus continues to improve as the user interfaces directly with the technology and assists in the development the innovation pace drives developers to match the pace setting clear innovation goals and deadlines with a cross sectoral impact such a development will enable the pws to develop into a second generation that appeals to people other than the early adopters interesting early examples of such developments for water are apps that enable online prepayment of water to provide more financial guarantees to water operators e g citytaps 2019 or that monitor household water consumption in relation to their own behaviors e g buoy 2019 5 diffusion of pwss to underserved communities during the first two decades of their development solar photovoltaics and cellular telephones were unaffordable to over three quarters of the world s population as the economy of scale and advances in manufacturing drove down costs the technology spread to people with lower incomes barnaby et al 2017 following the drop of pv prices emerging nations rapidly adopted the technology increasing the rate of installation from 3 gw in 2011 to 34 gw in 2016 including more than 1 5 million solar home systems in africa installed between 2015 and 2016 climatescope 2018 green tech media 2020 these new users contributed to the evolution of these technologies by adapting them to their specific needs for example the roll out of mobile phones in india drives the development of modular solar power systems including storage to provide the necessary electricity water is a universal need and a human right and controversy may arise when technologies that deliver better water are initially available to those who can afford it however personal water systems do not have to be the privilege of the wealthy these systems should not decrease overall water quality on the contrary they should provide better water for a lower price than alternatives like water from vendors second similar to pv the investments made by early movers should enable the necessary cost reduction to catalyze the broader market introduction which may happen in rapidly developing nations as fast as in wealthy nations utilities will still need to monitor performance of water systems and the income for this service can be used to support the less affluent water users finally the personalized water concept could be applied in developing countries in the form of personalized water kiosks for example where instead of tap water water produced to match a personalized taste or a desired use is sold 6 is it safe finally the question of safety and reliability is critical to the diffusion of personalized water systems currently failures of centralized drinking water and wastewater systems are rare in developed countries in the us for example a total of 780 outbreaks of waterborne diseases associated with contaminated drinking water occurred between 1971 and 2006 22 outbreaks per year resulting in 577 094 cases of illness and 93 deaths craun et al 2010 however most of the cases of illness 403 000 were linked to a single cryptosporidiosis outbreak in milwaukee as technology develops failures will occur failure can have a huge impact on product acceptance of a new technology harris lovett et al 2015 current under the sink ro systems require frequent monthly quarterly of semi annual after sale service visits for control and replacement o connor 2016 we believe that pwss will need to be monitored by utilities or other trusted entities which will constitute a key new role for these entities home building and other types of distributed water systems can be safeguarded against tampering similar to natural gas and electricity supplies which bring potentially lethal products into the home likewise they can be monitored in real time for the more advanced applications such as addition of prebiotics and probiotics a common framework will be needed to assure safety the development of this common framework will need to see cross sectoral collaboration including the development of robust sensor systems operating within cloud based applications and clear iso type standards enabling expansion the latter can follow an approach as used for civil aviation where a rigorous set of standards and certificates is applied to make aviation safe while the user can choose the quality of the experience depending on the fare and air service provider the former requires a major effort to define sensor requirements up to the level where not only major water constituents are measured but also microbial communities and trace contaminants 7 conclusions radical innovation was possible in the power and telecommunications sector through the emergence and mass production of personalized small scale systems the same is possible in the water sector if we are willing to consider alternatives to the existing centralized large scale infrastructure with piped and trucked water we can create a third route involving extremely decentralized household level systems which we term personal water systems pws our scenario analysis demonstrates that in many cases houses and buildings can become water independent or can deliver water with occasional supplementation beyond the basic opportunities to innovate the technology and to achieve greater sustainability and resilience pwss have the potential to create new avenues to improve water as a health or personal comfort promoting ingredient of life declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could
