water is known as the desalination process brackish water containing dissolved salts with an exceptional salty taste brackish water is ordinarily not utilized and fit for drinking reasons anon 2006 methods which regularly utilized for desalination of ocean water are given below as a tree structure fig 1 the conventional methods involve evaporation reverse osmosis ro and electrodialysis ed subramani and jacangelo 2015 at present two most technologies utilized for desalination of seawater or brackish water thermal phase change process and membrane process multistage flash distillation msf multi effect distillation med and vapor compression desalination vcd are the thermal phase change processes the membrane processes are sub categorize as reverse osmosis ro and electrodialysis ed thermal or phase change process basically requires both heat for evaporation and a restricted amount of electrical energy for the electronic controls for transport of feed and fresh water through pump in the framework the membrene procedure require electrical energy to supply the mechanical energy for membrane separation pre and post treatment to drive the entire system al karaghouli and kazmerski 2013 table 1 reported the energy consumption for different desalination processes expressed in kwh m3 with size capacity of units in m3 day abdelkareem et al 2018 from this table 1 it could be inferred that thermal processes msf med mvc tvc consume higher energy for the production of freshwater the total specific energy requirement for msf is 20 28 kwh m3 whereas med requires 15 22 kwh m3 energy which supplies product quality approximately 10 ppm also this table 1 shows that seawater ro swro and brackish water ro bwro consume 4 6 kwh m3 and 1 5 2 5 kwh m3 electrical energy and produce freshwater with product quality of 400 500 ppm and 200 500 ppm respectively r gemma raluy et al 2005 in most of the cases both the thermal and membrane processes are operated by burning of conventional energy sources such as oil and coal it produces significant amounts of airborne emissions ultimately which impact on atmosphere r gemma raluy et al 2005 data in table 2 shows the airborne emission produced by different desalination processes along all their life cycle r g raluy et al 2005 from table 2 the highest emission shown by msf and med to the atmosphere per m3 of freshwater production emissions from ro 2 3 and 4 kwh m3 is less as compared to both msf and med r gemma raluy et al 2005 thus reducing the emission of various gases possible by utilizing environmentally friendly energy production system it could be possible to integrate the desalination unit with renewable energy sources as shown in the next section table 3 demonstrate the idea about different characteristics of thermal membrane and hybrid desalination processes for freshwater production 2 1 membrane desalination process in this process membrane is one of the most important components zhani et al 2016 seawater is purifying by passing through the membrane at high pressure different types of membranes used for the desalination of saline water membrane based desalination process used mainly for the household and domestic purposes eltawil et al 2009 further it could be divided into two sub categories as follows 2 1 1 electrodialysis ed 2 1 1 1 reverse osmosis ro the thermal procedure based desalination technology is costly for the generation of a small quantity of fresh water morin 1993 on the other hand the thermal desalination msf med technique is an effect on the environment as shown in table 2 whereas membrane processes are available for the treatment of ocean water for example microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf and nanofiltration nf those processes utilized for the pre treatment of ocean water in membrane based desalination plants ali et al 2011a b different industrial membrane processes and their applications are given in table 4 after a year of 2000 approximately 9 10 annual growth observed in membrane based desalination plants while just 5 6 annual growth observed for msf based distillation plants ali et al 2011a b al enezi and fawzi 2003 discusses that the membrane desalination technology utilized a relatively permeable membrane for the production of freshwater this membrane is a thin film of porous material that allows the passing of water molecules through it at the same time it does not allows to pass the larger and undesirable ions and molecules like metal bacteria and salts membrane used for freshwater production it could be natural or synthetic different types of materials used for the manufacturing of membrane polymeric or non polymeric such as acetate cellulose ceramics metals etc al enezi and fawzi 2003 most commonly two types of membrane utilized for desalination processes are as follows cellulose acetate membrane manufactured from a blend of cellulose diacetate and triacetate cellulose acetate membrane has an asymmetric structure with a dense surface layer of about 0 1 0 2 μm strathmann 1981 composite polyamide membrane made of two layers a porous polysulfone support and a semi permeable layer of amine and carboxylic acid chloride functional groups composite polyamide membrane has higher specific water flax and lower salt passage compare to the cellulose acetate membrane strathmann 1981 one of the important configurations is module design in membrane based processes the basic function of the module is to control the feed flow at the surface of the membrane table 5 gives different characteristics of module designs from table 5 the tubular type module has higher both the investment and operation cost also the lower ratio of membrane surface area to system volume so flow control is good and it requires less time for cleaning compared to other module designs the spiral wound module is more commonly utilized in reverse osmosis ro processes eltawil et al 2009 2 1 2 electrodialysis ed electrodialysis is a technology where the sodium iron na hauled out of saltwater ocean water by passing direct current with the help of electrodes and thin inflexible plastic membrane pair this process occurs in atmospheric pressure the primary segments of these procedures are pre treatment process membrane pair pump direct current power framework and post treatment system toward the end fig 2 shows a line diagram for desalination by electrodialysis eltawil et al 2009 abdelkareem et al 2018 discusses that at the point when the direct current passes through the ocean water the sodium ions na and chloride iron cl moving towards the negative pole cathode and the positive pole anode through the membrane separately as the time will build the saltwater concentration will be drop in meddle compartment while it expanding in two side compartments desalinated brackish water pulled back from the central compartment now and again premise while of different sides concentrated saltwater will be replaced by fresh saline solution ocean water abdelkareem et al 2018 progressively efficient separation for the most part ions selective membranes more significant in ion selective membranes has porousness for just a single explicit particles ions charge for instance an anion selective membrane is penetrable to anions as it were since the nearness of positive charge fixed inside the membrane as a functional group i e r4na cl and dismiss cations similarly the cation selective membrane has negatively charge fixed functional groups i e rso3 rcoo kuroda et al 1987 2 1 3 reverse osmosis ro when two solutions with different concentrations separated by a semi permeable membrane due to the impact of osmosis a stream of dissolvable occurs from the weaken to the concentrated side al enezi and fawzi 2003 when the hydrostatic pressure is to some degree higher than the osmotic pressure on the concentrated side the dissolvable streams switch i e dissolvable move from concentrated side to weaken side through the membrane in this way pure water isolated from pollutes as opposed to the expelling contaminants from the water in reverse osmosis ro technology shaffer et al 2012 the common parts of the ro desalination system are pump semi permeable membrane and pre and post treatment systems fig 3 is represent the outline of reverse osmosis applied on the brackish or seawater the membranes used for this filtration could be natural or synthetic the design of the membrane is one of the most important tasks that yield of pure water is about 500 ppm and for which we understand the different configurations of membrane module types table 5 limit of reverse osmosis ro is running from 0 1 m3 day for household application to 395 000 m3 day for commercial applications bermudez contreras et al 2008 libert and maurel 1981 discusses that ro desalination technology is one of the leading technologies for freshwater production because it consumes lower energy and produced water cost compare to thermal desalination technology seawater ro swro and brackish water ro bwro are two reverse osmosis ro based desalination process for freshwater production the energy requirement for those plants is significantly dependent on desalination capacity integrated forward osmosis fo and reverse osmosis ro process can have the potential to improve product water quality like boron and salt rejection from seawater shaffer et al 2012 this process consumes less energy compared to a conventional seawater ro swro libert and maurel 1981 2 2 thermal desalination process phase change thermal desalination processes are much comparative as the regular procedure of creating precipitation in which the saline water heated at a temperature to change over in water vapor than it condenses to distilled water onishi et al 2017 the thermal desalination process incorporates multi stage flash msf multiple effect distillation med vapor compression vc and low temperature evaporation lte these technologies are costly and energy intensive procedure which requires both the thermal and electrical energy the traditional energy sources petroleum products used for the drive of those systems they essentially creating poisonous gases which expanding contaminations level al karaghouli rt al 2010 ghaffour et al 2015 discuss that about 70 80 of the world s desalination plants are working with two technologies multi stage flash msf and reverse osmosis ro multi stage flash msf units are broadly utilized in the middle east nations for example kuwait saudi arabia the united arab emirates uae and about 40 of desalination plant produces pure water employing multi stage flash msf msf and med procedures are comprising an arrangement of stage at progressively diminishing pressure and temperature 2 2 1 multi stage flash msf process multi stage flash msf involves both thermal and electrical energy the basic principle of multi stage flash distillation is to heat the ocean water around 90 120 c utilizing thermal energy and the vapor generated from the saline water due to flash sudden reducing in pressure when seawater enters to a vacuum chamber morin 1993 this procedure required medium pressure steam for the ejectors to make vacuum inside the arrangement of units condensed this vapor and recovered as pure water msf is most preferable when the feed seawater is highly contaminated by suspended solids heavy metals oil gases cod bod ghaffour et al 2015 electrical energy required for driving the different pump in the framework for example cooling water pump distillate pump recycle pump etc fig 4 is represent the basic outline of the multi stage flash desalination process the main components of msf are flash chamber ejector brine heater demister multi stage flash msf desalination process is divided into three sections as follows brine heating section flash chamber section and heat recovery section eltawil et al 2009 morin 1993 discusses that multi stage flash is consisting sets of stages ranging from usually 2 to 40 also it required external medium pressure steam for the ejectors to make vacuum inside arrangement of units that maintain the temperature and pressure flash evaporation of the hot saline water then it condensed to form freshwater as we see in fig 4 brine heater or heat exchanger provided through which the feed seawater moves it will help to reduce the thermal energy load warmed brackish water is traveling through the first stage that held at progressively lower pressure at this stage smallest quantity of water flashes convert into vapor in each stage at that point the rest of the saltwater followed through the insulated pipe in next stage for further flashing until it at last discharged the vapor delivered in each stage is gone through the demisters the vapor from the last stage condensed in definite condenser where ocean water utilized as coolant new freshwater is consistently collecting in the tank by using a pump morin 1993 a small scale model for desalinating ocean water from the sea operated by utilizing the msf procedure at kisr kuwait scientific institute research center in 1985 aliewi et al 2017 this plant was kept running with the utilization of sustainable power source and had a limit of 10 m3 day plant is consisting of three fundamental systems which are heat accumulation thermal capacity and msf desalination units the system is additionally equipped with a pre de aerator anti scaling substance post treatment and dosing units msf procedure consisting of 12 stages the performance of this desalination unit verifies by measuring the thermal energy required for the production of specific freshwater this is the particular use of heat characterized by heat expressed in kj kg of water the plant accomplished a scope of 380 490 kj kg for explicit warmth utilization and gain output ratio gor somewhere in the range of 6 5 and 8 ghaffour et al 2015 2 2 2 multiple effect distillation med process the multiple effect distillation med system is the most generally utilized and it is the most established desalination process piacentino and cardona 2010 med is a thermodynamically more effective process than other processes of thermal desalination the multiple effect distillation process is comprising around 2 to 20 arrangement of evaporators called effect bamufleh et al 2017 the effect worked at high temperature with the goal that the vapor produced in each effect can use as the heat sources in the following stages each effect is working under the progressively lower pressure and temperature the essential standard of med is that diminishing the pressure in an arrangement of effects or we can say that the vapor produced in med because of the absorption of the warm energy by the saline water al karaghouli and kazmerski 2013 fig 5 is representing the diagram of multiple effect distillation desalination system ghaffour et al 2015 discusses that the principal effect heated at a temperature around 70 to 90 c which helps to change over into vapor this vapor goes through the insulated pipe into the second effect where it utilized as a heating medium for heating of fluid inside the section vapor created in the second effect is followed through condenser will give the freshwater also the water vapor delivered from the subsequent stage moved inside a cylinder to the following stage for heating extra saline water hot vapor from the second effect utilized in the third effect as a heating medium which produces the vapor in the third effect the vapor delivered in each stage is gone through the demisters ghaffour et al 2015 the vapor from the end stage condensed in the last condenser where ocean water utilized as a cooling medium freshwater is continually collected in the tank using a pump generally the capacity of the multi effect distillation plant is ranging from 300 to 35000 m3 day in the earliest desalination plant used multi effect distillation med because the cost of msf is lower and lesser tendency to scaling problem with msf ghaffour et al 2015 the performance of multiple effect distillation med plants could be improved by introducing a vapor compressor it might be a mechanical vapor compressor mvc or thermal vapor compressor tvc is utilized for some explicit condition karagiannis and soldatos 2008 shatat worall and riffat 2013a discusses that among all desalination technology med has significant job because of certain focal points over the other desalination technology for example low temperature activity low grade heat and waste sheat usage low cooling water necessity and lower energy utilization likewise it gives higher heat transfer coefficient higher product quality and decreased the pre treatment process el dessouky et al 1998 proposed a broad mathematical model for parallel feed mee tvc this model incorporated with mass and energy balance equations it incorporates the steam jet ejector they investigate form this examination thermal vapor compressor desalination framework is more financially savvy than the msf desalination framework this model was excluding the heat transfer in the evaporators and the distillate flashing boxes moreover this model assumed negligible pressure losses inside the framework parts the results indicated that the heat transfer area for mee tvc is less than the msf framework besides the result shows a pr for four effect mee tvc framework about 7 65 likewise the estimation of gor of four effect mee tvc is almost near that of eleven effects and twenty stages mee and msf framework respectively bin amer 2009 built up a steady state mathematical model for the mee tvc framework for desalination to examine the system performance a matlab program was likewise produced for optimum design and operating conditions of the mee tvc desalination framework they compare the simulation data with the commercial data for model approval they utilized two strategies in matlab program 1 smart exhaustive search method and 2 sequential quadratic programming to get the maximum gor value the outcomes indicated that the capacity of mee tvc desalination framework expanded by coordinating with conventional multi effect system 2 2 3 cost analysis of thermal and membrane desalination processes hamed 2005 discusses that desalination cost varies with different desalination technologies and feed water conditions generally water desalination costs expressed in per unit cost liter or a cubic meter m3 of freshwater mostly thermal desalination plants operated by utilizing fossil fuel sources thus the total per unit cost of desalinated water is high hamed 2005 shatat et al 2013a from table 6 when the multiple effect distillation med plant worked with a higher capacity of greater than 91 000 m3 day desalination water cost per unit of m3 is ranges between 0 52 m3 to 1 01 m3 for medium med plant with the daily production from 12 000 m3 day to 50 000 m3 day water cost ranges between 0 95 m3 to 1 5 m3 and for small scale med plant less than 100 m3 day of capacity water cost per unit of m3 is around 2 to 10 m3 in the case of multi stage flash msf the cost for a system with a daily production from 23 000 528 000 m3 day ranges between 0 56 and 1 75 m3 desalination of brackish water or seawater carried out by ro or ed the desalinated water production cost per unit m3 is given in table 7 the highlighting feature of the paper presented by hamed 2005 includes desalination of brackish water by utilizing reverse osmosis ro is most economical due to the various improvements in ro desalination process such as proper membrane material pumping system and energy recovery system etc it reduced the energy requirement in ro hamed 2005 hamed et al 2016 see table 8 karagiannis and soldatos 2008 discuss that the total dissolved solids tds in brackish water vary from 2000 ppm to 10 000 ppm which affects the water production cost in jordan brackish water with 2300 ppm water cost is around 0 26 m3 while in florida water cost for 5000 ppm brackish water was 0 27 m3 so for different volumes of tds water cost with two similar systems is different 3 renewable energy

photovoltaic with desalination framework holds huge assurance for improving the consumable water supplies in dry districts gude et al 2010 there are two approaches for the production of freshwater by renewable energy sources first distillation procedures driven by heat delivered employing sustainable power sources while the second includes membrane and distillation procedures driven by electrical power or mechanical energy by utilizing renewable energy sources res loutatidou and arafat 2015 fig 6 the vast majority of desalination plants are coupling with sustainable power sources it might be

desalinated water creating by using sun based and geothermal energy is dependable and most proficient than different sources sun oriented stills are one of the technologies for the production of freshwater by utilizing direct sunbeams ali et al 2011a b one of the desalination methods dependents on the sun is a multi effect still mes ali et al 2011a b with an expanding number of stages which builds the production of freshwater and it will improve the efficiency of the desalination system a key part for improving thermal efficiency is the need to pick up a superior comprehension of the thermodynamic behind the various use of the latent heat of condensation buildup inside a multi effect humidification dehumidification sunlight based still ali et al 2011a b when we selecting the desalination system we keep in mind that both efficiency and the economic aspects marı et al 2007 a large part of the research continues on the effectiveness of various design parameters on the general implementation of sun based desalination processes for example solar powered still multi effect still ahead various desalination plants with glass protected solar stills have been developed in many countries in the late 1960 s shatat et al 2013b there is no compelling reason to require thermal storage when the desalination process depends on the geothermal energy the energy yield of the geothermal system is commonly steady contrasted with other sustainable power source assets for example sun powered and wind control shatat worall and riffat 2013c 3 1 solar desalination system in the semi dry and desert areas sunlight based energy is accessible in abundance with a typical sun powered illumination of 2200 to 2400 kwh m3every year eltawil et al 2009 utilization of sunlight based energy for water desalination used to convert sun energy into high temperature this high temperature is then used for steam generation or some other reason solar energy could be utilized to drive the desalination system through a pv cell which harness solar radiation shatat et al 2013b sun based heat utilized by solar collectors either focusing such as parabolic mirrors or non focusing like sun oriented lakes solar ponds which powering evaporation system in desalination process eltawil et al 2009 there are two processes by which we can use solar energy for desalination framework indirect

remain high various countries can t hold up under the expense of these advances as a freshwater resource abdelkareem et al 2018 one of the best approaches to diminish the expense of desalination technology is that to use the sustainable power source assets for driving the conventional desalination units as we know there are really three geothermal sunlight based wind reasonable energy sources that could be utilized for controlling the desalination framework among of all sun oriented and geothermal based desalination plant is increasingly basic on the earth however the establishment cost of sun based collector or plate is high and the heat energy isn t steady where in geothermal energy based desalination are not all the more but rather it will give consistent heat flux the major

play in many developing nations that areas of recently encountering water shortage and not approach adequate regular energy assets to execute desalination framework the choice of the proper sustainable power source is one of the challenging tasks however the relevance of those sustainable energy source based desalination frameworks has relied upon the nearby accessibility of assets and the nature of feed water sunlight based and wind arranged desalination framework is most encouraging yet those sources are principally reliant on whether condition and furthermore the heat flux from sun powered and wind isn t consistent the utilization of geothermal energy is one alternative for the power desalination framework as it gives consistent heat flux compare with other sustainable energy sources geothermal desalination plants are now inactivity and they produce high caliber of freshwater the real downside or challenge in the use of geothermal energy in powering desalination plants is that accessibility of geothermal heat limited in area at last geothermal energy has the incredible potential on the earth it could be given suitable energy to control both seawater or

membrane desalination technology utilized a relatively permeable membrane for the production of freshwater this membrane is a thin film of porous material that allows the passing of water molecules through it at the same time it does not allows to pass the larger and undesirable ions and molecules like metal bacteria and salts membrane used for freshwater production it could be natural or synthetic different types of materials used for the manufacturing of membrane polymeric or non polymeric such as acetate cellulose ceramics metals etc al enezi and fawzi 2003 most commonly two types of membrane utilized for desalination processes are as follows cellulose acetate membrane manufactured from a blend of cellulose diacetate and triacetate cellulose acetate membrane has an asymmetric structure with a dense surface layer of about 0 1 0 2 μm strathmann 1981 composite polyamide membrane made of two layers a porous polysulfone support and a semi permeable layer of amine and carboxylic acid chloride functional groups composite polyamide membrane has higher specific water flax and lower salt passage compare to the cellulose acetate membrane strathmann 1981 one of the important configurations is module design in membrane based processes the basic function of the module is to control the feed flow at the surface of the membrane table 5 gives different characteristics of module designs from table 5 the tubular type module has higher both the investment and operation cost also the lower ratio of membrane surface area to system volume so flow control is good and it requires less time for cleaning compared to other module designs the spiral wound module is more commonly utilized in reverse osmosis ro processes eltawil et al 2009 2 1 2 electrodialysis ed electrodialysis is a technology where the sodium iron na hauled out of saltwater ocean water by passing direct current with the help of electrodes and thin inflexible plastic membrane pair this

na and chloride iron cl moving towards the negative pole cathode and the positive pole anode through the membrane separately as the time will build the saltwater concentration will be drop in meddle compartment while it expanding in two side compartments desalinated brackish water pulled back from the central compartment now and again premise while of different sides concentrated saltwater will be replaced by fresh saline solution ocean water abdelkareem et al 2018 progressively efficient separation for the most part ions selective membranes more significant in ion selective membranes has porousness for just a single explicit particles ions charge for instance an anion selective membrane is penetrable to anions as it were since the nearness of positive charge fixed inside the membrane as a functional group i e r4na cl and dismiss cations similarly the cation selective membrane has negatively charge fixed functional groups i e rso3 rcoo kuroda et al 1987 2 1 3 reverse osmosis ro when two solutions with different concentrations separated by a semi permeable membrane due to the impact of osmosis a stream of dissolvable occurs from the weaken to the concentrated side al enezi and fawzi 2003 when the hydrostatic pressure is to some degree higher than the osmotic pressure on the concentrated side the dissolvable streams switch i e dissolvable move from concentrated side to weaken side through the membrane in this way pure water isolated from pollutes as opposed to the expelling contaminants from the water in reverse osmosis ro technology shaffer et al 2012 the common parts of the ro desalination system are pump semi permeable membrane and pre and post treatment systems fig 3 is represent the outline of reverse osmosis applied on the brackish or seawater the membranes used for this filtration could be natural or synthetic the design of the membrane is one of the most important tasks that yield of pure water is about 500 ppm and for which we understand the different configurations of membrane module types table 5 limit of reverse osmosis ro is running from 0 1 m3 day for household application to 395 000 m3 day for commercial applications bermudez contreras et al 2008 libert and maurel 1981 discusses that ro desalination technology is one of the leading technologies for freshwater production because it consumes lower energy and produced water cost compare to thermal desalination technology seawater ro swro and brackish water ro bwro are two reverse osmosis ro based desalination process for freshwater production the energy requirement for those plants is significantly dependent on desalination capacity integrated forward osmosis fo and reverse osmosis ro process can have the potential to improve product water quality like boron and

about 40 of desalination plant produces pure water employing multi stage flash msf msf and med procedures are comprising an arrangement of stage at progressively diminishing pressure and temperature 2 2 1 multi stage flash msf process multi stage flash msf involves both thermal and electrical energy the basic principle of multi stage flash distillation is to heat the ocean water around 90 120 c utilizing thermal energy and the vapor generated from the saline water due to flash sudden reducing in pressure when seawater enters to a vacuum chamber morin 1993 this procedure required medium pressure steam for the ejectors to make vacuum inside the arrangement of units condensed this vapor and recovered as pure water msf is most preferable when the feed seawater is highly contaminated by suspended solids heavy metals oil gases cod bod ghaffour et al 2015 electrical energy required for driving the different pump in the framework for example cooling water pump distillate pump recycle pump etc fig 4 is represent the basic outline of the multi stage flash desalination process the main components of msf are flash chamber ejector brine heater demister multi stage flash msf desalination process is divided into three sections as follows brine heating section flash chamber section and heat recovery section eltawil et al 2009 morin 1993 discusses that multi stage flash is consisting sets of stages ranging from usually 2 to 40 also it required external medium pressure steam for the ejectors to make vacuum inside arrangement of units that maintain the temperature and pressure flash evaporation of the hot saline water then it condensed to form freshwater as we see in fig 4 brine heater or heat exchanger provided through which the feed seawater moves it will help to reduce the thermal energy load warmed brackish water is traveling through the first stage that held at progressively lower pressure at this stage smallest quantity of water flashes convert into vapor in each stage at that point the rest of the saltwater followed through the insulated pipe in next stage for further flashing until it at last discharged the vapor delivered in each stage is gone through the demisters the vapor from the last stage condensed in definite condenser where ocean water utilized as coolant new freshwater is consistently collecting in the tank by using a pump morin 1993 a small scale model for desalinating ocean water from the sea operated by utilizing the msf procedure at kisr kuwait scientific institute research center in 1985 aliewi et al 2017 this plant was kept running with the utilization of sustainable power source and had a limit of 10 m3 day plant is consisting of three fundamental systems which are heat accumulation thermal capacity and msf desalination units the system is additionally equipped with a pre de aerator anti scaling substance post treatment and dosing units msf procedure consisting of 12 stages the performance of this desalination unit verifies by measuring the thermal energy required for the production of specific freshwater this is the particular use of heat characterized by heat expressed in kj kg of water the plant accomplished a scope of 380 490 kj kg for explicit warmth utilization and gain output ratio gor somewhere in the range of 6 5 and 8 ghaffour et al 2015 2 2 2 multiple effect distillation med process the multiple effect distillation med system is the most generally utilized and it is the most established desalination process piacentino and cardona 2010 med is a thermodynamically more effective process than other processes of thermal desalination the multiple effect distillation process is comprising around 2 to 20 arrangement of evaporators called effect bamufleh et al 2017 the effect worked at high temperature with the goal that the vapor produced in each effect can use as the heat sources in the following stages each effect is working under the progressively lower pressure and temperature the essential standard of med is that diminishing the pressure in an arrangement of effects or we can say that the vapor produced in med because of the absorption of the warm energy by the saline water al karaghouli and kazmerski 2013 fig 5 is representing the diagram of multiple effect distillation desalination system ghaffour et al 2015 discusses that the principal effect heated at a temperature around 70 to 90 c which helps to change over into vapor this vapor goes through the insulated pipe into the second effect where it utilized as a heating medium for heating of fluid inside the section vapor created in the second effect is followed through condenser will give the freshwater also the water vapor delivered from the subsequent stage moved inside a cylinder to the following stage for heating extra saline water hot vapor from the second effect utilized in the third effect as a heating medium which produces the vapor in the third effect the vapor delivered in each stage is gone through the demisters ghaffour et al 2015 the vapor from the end stage condensed in the last condenser where ocean water utilized as a cooling medium freshwater is continually collected in the tank using a pump generally the capacity of the multi effect distillation plant is ranging from 300 to 35000 m3 day in the earliest desalination plant used multi effect distillation med because the cost of msf is lower and lesser tendency to scaling problem with msf ghaffour et al 2015 the performance of multiple effect distillation med plants could be improved by introducing a vapor compressor it might be a mechanical vapor compressor mvc or thermal vapor compressor tvc is utilized for some explicit condition karagiannis and soldatos 2008 shatat worall and riffat 2013a discusses that among all desalination technology med has significant job because of certain focal points over the other desalination technology for example low temperature activity low grade heat and waste sheat usage low cooling water necessity and lower energy utilization likewise it gives higher heat transfer coefficient higher product quality and decreased the pre treatment process el dessouky et al 1998 proposed a broad mathematical model for parallel feed mee tvc this model incorporated with mass and energy balance equations it incorporates the steam jet ejector they investigate form this examination thermal vapor compressor desalination framework is more financially savvy than the msf desalination framework this model was excluding the heat transfer in the evaporators and the distillate flashing boxes moreover this model assumed negligible pressure losses inside the framework parts the results indicated that the heat transfer area for mee tvc is less than the msf framework besides the result shows a pr for four effect mee tvc framework about 7 65 likewise the estimation of gor of four effect mee tvc is almost near that of eleven effects and twenty stages mee and msf framework respectively bin amer 2009 built up a steady state mathematical model for the mee tvc framework for desalination to examine the system performance a matlab program was likewise produced for optimum design and operating conditions of the mee tvc desalination framework they compare the simulation data with the commercial data for model approval they utilized two strategies in matlab program 1 smart exhaustive search method and 2 sequential quadratic programming to get the maximum gor value the outcomes indicated that the capacity of mee tvc desalination framework expanded by coordinating with conventional multi effect system 2 2 3 cost analysis of thermal and membrane desalination processes hamed 2005 discusses that desalination cost varies with different desalination technologies and feed water conditions generally water desalination costs expressed in per unit cost liter or a cubic meter m3 of freshwater mostly thermal desalination plants operated by utilizing

ranges between 0 95 m3 to 1 5 m3 and for small scale med plant less than 100 m3 day of capacity water cost per unit of m3 is around 2 to 10 m3 in the case of multi stage flash msf the cost for a system with a daily production from 23 000 528 000 m3 day ranges between 0 56 and 1 75 m3 desalination of brackish water or seawater carried out by ro or ed the desalinated water production cost per unit m3 is given in table 7 the highlighting feature of the paper presented by hamed 2005 includes desalination of brackish water by utilizing reverse osmosis ro is most economical due to the various improvements in ro desalination process such as proper membrane material pumping system and energy recovery system etc it reduced the energy requirement in ro hamed 2005 hamed et al 2016 see table 8 karagiannis and soldatos 2008 discuss that the total dissolved solids tds in brackish water vary from 2000 ppm to 10 000 ppm which affects the water production cost in jordan brackish water with 2300 ppm water cost is around 0 26 m3 while in florida water cost for 5000 ppm brackish water was 0 27 m3 so for different volumes of tds water cost with two similar systems is different 3 renewable energy

remain high various countries can t hold up under the expense of these advances as a freshwater resource abdelkareem et al 2018 one of the best approaches to diminish the expense of desalination technology is that to use the sustainable power source assets for driving the conventional desalination units as we know there are really three geothermal sunlight based wind reasonable energy sources that could be utilized for controlling the desalination framework among of all sun oriented and geothermal based desalination plant is increasingly basic on the earth however the establishment cost of sun based collector or plate is high and the heat energy isn t steady where in geothermal energy based desalination are not all the more but rather it will give consistent heat flux the major challenge in utilizing geothermal energy in controlling the desalination plant is its limitation by the geological area where there is an overabundance of accessible heat abdelkareem et al 2018 there are different topics that are there to do innovative work in particularly in desalination advancements some of them listed below for decreasing the expense of power generation utilize economic energy

control methodology for the plant task and keep up the pc observing control framework for constant information logging in case possible by then the plant worked through computerization automation control 6 conclusion with the expanding worldwide water demand will also raise the water decontamination of freshwater generation from seawater brackish groundwater water contaminated by different inorganic or organic pollutants or wastewater there are various technologies for the treatment of saline water simultaneously the power use for the driving of the desalination unit is very high a few options have been made to address the worldwide worry of water and energy supportability those choices including the accompanying sustainable power source assets growing new incorporated systems growing new hybrid procedures use low grade or waste heat sources and so forth this paper reviews the feasibility or suitability to utilized or to accept the conventional thermal based water desalination technologies that driven via the use of fossil fuel combustion or any other renewable energy sources therefore the freshwater delivery by using sustainable sources is one of the key jobs play in many developing nations that areas of recently encountering water shortage and not approach adequate regular energy assets to execute desalination framework the choice of the proper sustainable power source is one of the challenging tasks however the relevance of those sustainable energy source based desalination frameworks has relied upon the nearby accessibility of assets and the nature of feed water sunlight based and wind arranged desalination framework is most encouraging yet those sources are principally reliant on whether condition and furthermore the heat flux from sun powered and wind isn t consistent the utilization of geothermal energy is one alternative for the power desalination framework as it gives consistent heat flux compare with other sustainable energy sources geothermal desalination plants are now inactivity and they produce high caliber of freshwater the real downside or challenge in the use of geothermal energy in powering desalination plants is that accessibility of geothermal heat limited in area at last geothermal energy has the incredible potential on the earth it could be given suitable energy to control both seawater or brackish water desalination system at long last it might be noticed that the solution for the world s water deficiency isn t just to deliver more water yet additionally to do it in an environmentally

such as desalinated water and treated wastewater in order to augment the freshwater resources better water management planning with suitable assessment tools is necessary the use of stable and radioactive environmental isotopes has proven to be a powerful assessment tool in many hydrological problems combination of previous isotopic and hydrological studies of the arabian peninsula could provide an insight on the dynamics of natural processes affecting this water scarce region this paper groups many of these studies into various categories based on their objectives including identification of recharge areas assessment of groundwater dynamics and estimation of groundwater age and residence time results of previous isotope studies in the gcc countries are put together to identify the sources of precipitation and estimate rates of evaporation which is the major cause of water loss in these countries mediterranean sea is the major source of vapor for all gcc countries local moisture in the uae is derived from the arabian sea and the indian ocean whereas in saudi arabia it either originates from the atlantic ocean the arabian sea or the indian ocean evaporation alters the isotopic composition of groundwater which is mainly controlled by relative humidity that varies between 20 and 90 in the gcc countries the slope of the evaporation line compared to local meteoric water lines lmwls for bahrain kuwait and northern oman indicates a moderate rate of evaporation due to rapid infiltration of storm water in contrast the evaporation line slope for qatar southern oman and saudi arabia are higher than the slopes of the lmwls showing a relatively low rate of evaporation the uae groundwater slope is smaller than that of lmwl indicating high evaporation

evaporation the gcc countries include bahrain kuwait oman qatar saudi arabia and united arab emirates uae fig 1 according to united nations all gcc countries except oman fall in the category of acute water scarcity raouf 2009 mohamed and almualla 2010a b this is due to the low rainfall intensity 70 130 mm yr and high rate of evaporation more than 2000 mm year raouf 2009 in the arabian gulf region 90 of rainfall occurs between october and march and 10 occurs between april and september elmahdy and mohamed 2015 mohamed et al 2020 al maamary et al 2017 sometimes it can be dry for long periods of time and some of the rainfall events develop flash floods as they are of heavy intensity and short duration in 2002 annual groundwater recharge in gcc countries was about 4875 mm3 whereas abstraction was about 14 697 mm3 dawoud 2005 over exploitation of freshwater resources has resulted in groundwater depletion in many of these countries undp 2013 al zubari 2017 this situation amplifies the importance of the use of isotopes in gcc countries for better understanding of hydrological processes to achieve sustainable development identifying sources and rates of groundwater recharge rates of evaporation groundwater dynamics and quality of groundwater would certainly improve water management practices in these countries this study combines all the known isotopic data of the gcc region for groundwater recharge hydrochemistry and evaporation studies furthermore hydrochemical data are used in combination with isotopic data to understand the origin of groundwater generally the isotope data are expressed in delta δ relative to the prevalent stable isotope e g 1h and 16o and in units of per mil with respect to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow typically regression lines for plots of δ2h vs δ18o for surface water and groundwater are compared against lines for precipitation the linear relationship δd 8δ18o 10 is known as the global meteoric water line gmwl which is based on the δ18o and δd values of precipitation from locations around the globe craig 1961 yurtsever and gat 1981 the regional mediterranean meteoric water line mmwl is δd 8δ18o 22 murad and krishnamurthy 2008 on the other hand the local meteoric water line lmwl is derived from precipitation collected from a single site or set of local sites in this paper plots of δd vs δ18o were developed for all gcc countries along with the mmwl the lmwl of the respective region and gmwl these graphs are used to identify the source of moisture for the precipitation and the rate of evaporation in the gcc countries the degree of evaporation is also understood based on the deuterium excess defined as d excess δd 8 δ18o merlivat and jouzel 1979 the d excess is defined as a second order parameter that reflects non equilibrium fractionation during initial evaporation from the ocean re evaporation at the land surface or re evaporation and or mixing along the water mass trajectory merlivat and jouzel 1979 2 isotope studies in gcc countries 2 1 meteorology of the region groundwater recharge takes place from direct rainfall runoff and recharge from surface water bodies the contributions of groundwater recharge from saudi arabia oman and other parts of the gcc countries are 76 15 and 9 respectively aleisa and al zubari 2017 isotopic signatures of the groundwater are used to understand the origin and relative timing of groundwater recharge for example if the isotopic signatures of the groundwater samples are depleted relative to local rainfall it indicates that the groundwater of the region is most likely to have originated at high altitude as observed by tang et al 2001 for the eastern part of uae in northeastern kuwait isotopes were depleted in heavier isotopes even in low altitude areas indicating meteoric origin with no effects of surface evaporation robinson and ruwaih 1985 hadi and al ruwaih 2008 isotopes of groundwater samples of saudi arabia plot around the lmwl indicating that the aquifer was recharged by rainwater without significant evaporation bazuhair et al 1990 subyani 2004 al harbi et al 2006 isotopes of groundwater samples that fall well below the relevant lmwl indicate recharge from a different climatic regime bazuhair et al 1990 al katheeri et al 2009 certain parts of gcc countries receive rainfall from two monsoon seasons al harbi et al 2006 compared the isotopes of two monsoon rains and indicated that groundwater recharge among the monsoons depends upon the intensity and duration unusual isotopic signatures such as greater 18o enrichment 2 to 6 and large negative d excess 15 to 28 in abu dhabi indicated that paleo groundwater originated from holocene moisture sources of previously evaporated continental waters wood 2011 the heavy stable isotope content in rainwater increases with atmospheric temperature which reflects the effect of evaporation during precipitation ali et al 2015 murad et al 2011 the heavy stable isotope content of rainfall decreases with increase in altitude because of decreased temperature and progressive rainout rayleigh distillation process ali et al 2015 alyamani 2001 temperatures ranged from as high as 50 c during summer apr sep in desert areas to as low as 12 c during winter nov mar in mountainous areas of arabian peninsula al maamary et al 2017 patlakas et al 2019 previous groundwater recharge studies table 1 indicated recharge from high altitude recent precipitation in eastern uae meteoric origin without evaporation in northeastern kuwait and western saudi arabia and paleoclimatic origin in abu dhabi uae groundwater dynamics studies reveal preferential flow and mixing of groundwater through faults and fractures in oman groundwater and seawater mixing were identified in al khiran sabkha region of kuwait mixing between groundwater and geothermal waters and oxygen exchange between groundwater and hot rocks were identified in northern uae studies on groundwater age and residence time table 1 indicated old 6000 years before present bp wood 2011 to modern recharge post 1950 in the uae recent ages of groundwater have been measured in saudi arabia and northern oman 2 2 hydrogeology geology land use and land cover play major roles in groundwater flow main tectonic units of gcc countries include the precambrian shield igneous and metamorphic rocks of western saudi arabia stable shelf of eastern saudi arabia uae qatar bahrain and kuwait unstable shelf cover of northeast kuwait and the tethyan geosyncline in the oman mountain belt mukhopadhyay et al 1996 al rashed and sherif 2000 the umm er radhuma dammam aquifer system extends from the gulf coast in the north and oman mountains in the southeast toward saudi arabia yemen and uae fig 1 this system is divided into the upper aquifer rus formation middle aquifer umm er radhuma formation and aruma group and lower aquifer wasia biyadh complex powers et al 1966 christian 1997 al mashaikhi et al 2012 indicated that similar isotopic signatures were identified in groundwater samples collected from two different inter connected aquifers in oman this indicates interaction of groundwater within these aquifers connected by faults and fractures in general groundwater present near coastal regions is slightly enriched in heavier isotopes when compared with groundwater of inland regions isotopic signature of groundwater of oman coastal plains was depleted indicating fresh groundwater preferential flow between jabal akhdar mountain and batinah coastal region weyhenmeyer et al 2002 apart from water isotopes δ18o and δd sr isotopes 37cl and 13c were also used in groundwater dynamics studies sr isotopes of groundwater samples were used to identify the interaction of groundwater with eocene and neogene aquifer rocks in rub al khali aquifer system of saudi arabia sultan et al 2008 duane et al 2004 attempted to identify the groundwater and seawater mixing zones in al khiran sabkha in kuwait this study suggested that a combination of wind deposition and diffusion probably explains the observed δ37cl values but not the seawater intrusion duane et al 2004 recommended vertical sampling of wells in this region to clearly understand the groundwater and seawater mixing zones as groundwater flows through the aquifer medium the isotopic characteristics of the groundwater can change due to processes such as mixing and water rock interaction such as ion exchange and leaching the range of δ13c observed in the gravel plain aquifer and ophiolite aquifer in the eastern uae suggests c 3 sunflower carrot potato pepper mango watermelon and strawberry and c 4 plants tomato sugarcane and cactus control the dissolved inorganic carbon dic in groundwater murad and krishnamurthy 2008 mixing between groundwater and geothermal water in northern part of jabal hafit uae was identified due to enriched δ18o and low d excess murad and mirghni 2012 carbonate rocks are one of the important lithologies in gcc countries and carbonate dissolution during groundwater movement is very common enrichment in δ18o of groundwater samples from carbonate aquifer in jabal hafit uae indicated oxygen exchange between groundwater and host rocks at elevated temperature murad and mirghni 2012 2 3 groundwater recharge groundwater age is defined as the mean residence time of water since it was recharged kazemi et al 2006 generally tritium 3h radiocarbon 14c and chlorine 36 36cl with half lives of 12 28 years 5700 30 years and 3 105 years respectively are used to identify the age of the groundwater tritium values of less than 1 tritium unit tu in water are considered to represent water recharged prior to 1952 when atmospheric nuclear testing began trabelsi et al 2019 high tritium content up to 18 tu indicated pronounced contribution of recent rainfall in western saudi arabia bazuhair et al 1990 tritium value of up to 13 tritium units tu from coastal groundwater of northern oman associated with the active runoff network indicated recent groundwater with the age less than 5 years clark et al 1989 a tritium value of 2 8 tu was attributed to modern recharge in abu dhabi uae with short mean residence times al katheeri et al 2009 high altitude groundwater is essentially modern in origin because of high 3h value in halfayn alluvial aquifer oman 5 10 tu matter et al 2006 groundwater sampled from deep wells in abu dhabi uae is mostly 3h free indicating that no modern recharge component contributes to these waters mckenzie et al 1980 the 14c data indicated that it takes several hundred to a few thousand years for the groundwater to move 50 km between the jabal akhdar mountains and batinah coastal region of oman weyhenmeyer et al 2002 using 14c ages of lacustrine deposits in the southern rub al khali of saudi arabia wood and imes 2003 identified a late pleistocene to early holocene paleoclimate with two wet periods one between 6000 and 9000 y bp and the other between 21 000 and 30 000 y bp travertine deposits in the oman mountains bordering the southern rub al khali have 14c dates indicating wet periods between 6500 and 12 500 y bp and between 19 000 and 33 000 y bp dating of speleothems in northern oman indicates a wet period between 6200 and 9200 y bp wood and imes 2003 in the eastern uae 36cl data indicated that groundwater is modern post 1950 murad and krishnamurthy 2004 apart from 3h and 36cl values murad 2010 used similarity in the regression lines of δd vs δ18o of groundwater samples to identify modern day recharge in the northern uae 2 4 groundwater salinity ambient hydrochemistry of groundwater mostly depends on long term water rock interaction during flow through pores and fractures khan et al 2019 groundwater contamination in gcc countries is often associated with salinization which can occur for various reasons including evaporation return flow from irrigation water seawater intrusion and disposal of produced water from the oil and gas industry mohamed et al 2010a 2010b sherif et al 2011a elmahdy and mohamed 2012 2013 2014 different methods of analyses were used to identify the sources of salinization the higher electrical conductivity ec values indicate higher salinity table 2 shows the average values of hydrochemical parameters from studies conducted in gcc countries generally the salinity of the groundwater in coastal aquifers is associated with seawater intrusion yet the narrow range of δ18o and δd values and high divergence from the isotopic value of seawater indicated that seawater is not the main source of salinity in eastern part of uae murad and krishnamurthy 2004 and rub al khali in southern saudi arabia sultan et al 2008 in bahrain groundwater samples the deflection of δ18o and δd from mmwl indicate that factors other than seawater intrusion influence the groundwater chemistry zubari 2005 indicated that seawater intrusion occurs in groundwater of eastern bahrain whereas brackish water flows upward in north central and western bahrain comparison of groundwater geochemistry with isotopes helped to clearly distinguish the reason for salinization in the eastern coastal aquifer the absence of positive correlation between isotopic composition δ18o δd and chloride indicated that evaporation alone is not the cause for salinity in eastern region of uae murad and krishnamurthy 2008 murad et al 2012 in contrast in the northern part of uae the positive correlation between isotopic composition δ18o δd and chloride clearly suggested that the groundwater salinity is due to the recharge of evaporated raindrops or recharge from evaporated surface waters murad et al 2011 the high chloride and heavily enriched δ18o in water samples indicated that salinity is mainly due to seawater intrusion but groundwater in the mid east of uae is mainly influenced by irrigation return flow khan et al 2019 the correlation of na ca cl and hco3 with tds suggest that the groundwater is fresh to brackish in western saudi arabia which is due to rock weathering and evaporation al ahmadi 2013 the d excess in kuwait groundwater shows that it is of meteoric origin hadi and al ruwaih 2008 the salinity in most of the sabkha water samples represents an apparent evaporation trend with a characteristic increase in heavier isotopes as trend line has a slope less than 5 in kuwait duane et al 2004 3 precipitation and evaporation the origin of vapor sources for the precipitation can be identified based on characteristic weather systems in the region alsharhan et al 2001 indicated that cyclonic depressions and summer monsoons affect the climate in the arabian peninsula the depressions of bahrain kuwait qatar saudi arabia and uae originate from the mediterranean sea murad et al 2011 the vapor source for northern oman is from the mediterranean sea and vapor for southern oman is from the indian ocean weyhenmeyer et al 2002 strauch et al 2014 fig 2 indicates that the lmwls of kuwait bhandary et al 2013 qatar wagner 2011 and uae sherif et al 2011b murad and krishnamurthy 2004 are situated close to the mmwl this indicates that precipitation in these regions originates from the mediterranean sea arabian sea and indian ocean application of isotopes in groundwater studies indicated that the mediterranean sea is the major source of vapor for all gcc countries because of the enriched δd of groundwater which is close to the d excess of 20 21 of mmwl the higher d excess for the mediterranean sea is due to the interaction of cold air from surrounding continents with the warm mediterranean seawater thereby enhancing isotopic fractionation during evaporation juhlke et al 2019 the value of d excess for local precipitation will be greater than 15 if precipitation assimilates recycled surface moisture and will be less than 10 if raindrop evaporation occurs froehlich et al 2008 peng et al 2010 the decreased δd value of 8 indicates that local precipitation occurs in uae from the moisture derived from the arabian sea murad et al 2011 shamal summer fall monsoon rains which are the main source of water in uae coastal sabkha wood et al 2002 are strongly evaporated which causes a decrease in the δ18o δd slope an increase in δ18o and a decrease in d excess of up to 24 wood 2011 the unusually low d excess of 15 in bu hasa area in abu dhabi indicates that the moisture is derived from indian ocean alyammani 2001 recorded d excess values around 10 in the western province of saudi arabia where the source of moisture cannot be mediterranean sea d excess 22 thus rainfall over western saudi arabia may originate either from the atlantic during winter or from the arabian sea and indian ocean during autumn monsoon alyamani 2001 tropical southern depressions that originate from the arabian sea indian ocean and bay of bengal d excess 3 06 in oman do not reach inland regions due to an atmospheric inversion where the monsoonal air masses are blocked by the dhofar mountains southern moisture source in oman is estimated to occur once every 5 10 years clark et al 1987 weyhenmeyer et al 2002 fleitmann et al 2004 matter et al 2006 al mashaikhi et al 2012 strauch et al 2014 evaporation is the major cause of changes in isotopic composition of groundwater in arid and semi arid regions the effect of evaporation on the isotopes depends on the temperature and geology of the aquifer relative humidity is the main factor determining the slope of the evaporation line gonfiantini 1978 rozanski et al 1993 and relative humidity of gcc countries varies from 20 to 90 al maamary et al 2017 patlakas et al 2019 deviation in the isotopic compositions of groundwater with respect to lmwl could help in identifying the sources of precipitation and rate of evaporation fig 2 shows the relationship between δ18o and δd isotopes of groundwater samples collected from previous studies table 1 the calculated slopes obtained using the data of bahrain kuwait and northern oman tables 3 and 4 are slightly lower than the slopes of lmwls of the region fig 2 this suggests a moderate rate of evaporation due to rapid infiltration of storm water which is in agreement with conclusions of clark et al 1987 the isotopic signatures of western kuwait are slightly enriched in heavier isotopes fig 2 which could be due to recharge by partly evaporated water accumulated in the depressions and the hydraulic connection between the dammam aquifer and overlying kuwait aquifer the moderate rate of evaporation in northern kuwait indicates that the source of precipitation studied from groundwater samples is not from local moisture bhandary et al 2013 the slopes of the groundwater samples of qatar southern oman and saudi arabia in fig 2 are higher than the slope of the lmwl of those respective regions indicating a relatively low rate of evaporation table 4 this reflects high altitude recharge in southern oman the narrow range of isotope signatures for groundwater from western saudi arabia indicates that these samples are from recent recharge and rapid infiltration through fractured rocks alyamani 2001 groundwater samples from central and southern saudi arabia are enriched in δ18o which may be due to evaporation the slope of groundwater samples of uae fig 2 f is very small compared against the slope of lmwl of uae this low slope indicates high rate of evaporation of surface water prior to infiltration table 4 the process affecting the isotopic composition of the groundwater of gcc countries can also be explained by the relationship between δ18o and d excess fig 3 the range of d excess and the coefficient of determination r2 for each of the gcc countries are given in table 4 positive d excess values indicate low evaporation while negative d excess indicate high evaporation fig 3 shows very low correlation values and more positive d excess for bahrain kuwait oman northern and southern qatar and western saudi arabia it is evident that evaporation is not a predominant factor altering the isotopic signatures of this region this may be attributed to low or medium rate of evaporation high elevation recharge and rapid infiltration of storm water through fractured rocks in these countries alyamani 2001 the plot of δ18o vs d excess from the groundwater samples of qatar indicates slightly positive correlation all other gcc countries show negative correlation of δ18o vs d excess which suggests different degrees of evaporation the relationship of δ18o vs d excess of groundwater samples of uae shows high negative correlation r2 0 88 groundwater samples from liwa and bu hasa regions of uae show more negative d excess values which may be related to high evaporation rates groundwater samples from northern and eastern uae are depleted in δd and δ18o and have more positive d excess values consistent with recharge from high altitude rainfall a plot of δd vs δ18o for groundwater in all gcc countries shows that samples fall along and below the gmwl fig 4 a low d excess values on table 4 and fig 4 b indicate other sources of precipitation including the bay of bengal in southern oman and red sea in saudi arabia the low slope and y intercept of the groundwater regression line show that groundwater samples have undergone evaporation prior to recharge the majority of groundwater samples from uae are enriched in heavier isotopes which indicates that moisture traveled over long distances before reaching the arabian gulf area fig 4 b shows that samples from the southwestern uae liwa and bu hasa are enriched in δ18o and exhibit low d excess whereas eastern and northern regions of uae show positive d excess saudi arabia has low d excess which is due to partial evaporation during recharge the d excess values of other regions are between 10 and 21 where low d excess values indicate regional water source like bay of bengal in southern oman meteoric origin water in northeastern kuwait seawater intrusion in eastern coast of bahrain and higher d excess values are compatible with the major source of precipitation from mediterranean sea 4 summary and conclusions this paper has reviewed the use of isotopes particularly δ18o and δd in hydrological studies in the gcc countries of the arabian peninsula the lmwls of the gcc countries are comparable to the mmwl indicating that the arabian sea the indian ocean and the mediterranean sea are the major sources of precipitation in the region relatively depleted δ18o and δd values of groundwater in oman saudi arabia and uae indicate that recharge occurs in the mountains reflecting decreased temperature and progressive rainout during the process of evaporation enrichment of heavier isotopes takes place and the value of d excess decreases the isotopic composition of rainfall in uae is altered by high rate of evaporation whereas other parts of the arabian peninsula do not show good correlation between d excess and δ18o relatively rapid infiltration and groundwater flow occur within fractured and carbonate aquifers tritium 14c and 36cl have been used to date groundwater in a few studies radioisotopes indicate that the age of groundwater in the gulf countries varies from late pleistocene and early holocene to recent hydrochemical data suggest groundwater contamination due to salinization which occurs due to evaporation irrigation return flow and along the eastern coast of bahrain seawater intrusion isotopic studies should be coupled with point source investigations such as water level monitoring pan evaporation infiltration rain gauge measurements and tracer tests to understand local scale groundwater movement more analyses of groundwater chemistry and geochemical modeling would help to identify the sources of high tds in these gcc countries such studies are

12021,the gulf cooperation council gcc countries which consist of bahrain kuwait oman qatar saudi arabia and united arab emirates possess abundant oil resources but scarce water resources low rainfall and high evaporation rates threaten sustainable development in this region currently water demands for domestic and industrial sectors in these countries are mostly met by non conventional resources such as desalinated water and treated wastewater in order to augment the freshwater resources better water management planning with suitable assessment tools is necessary the use of stable and radioactive environmental isotopes has proven to be a powerful assessment tool in many hydrological problems combination of previous isotopic and hydrological studies of the arabian peninsula could provide an insight on the dynamics of natural processes affecting this water scarce region this paper groups many of these studies into various categories based on their objectives including identification of recharge areas assessment of groundwater dynamics and estimation of groundwater age and residence time results of previous isotope studies in the gcc countries are put together to identify the sources of precipitation and estimate rates of evaporation which is the major cause of water loss in these countries mediterranean sea is the major source of vapor for all gcc countries local moisture in the uae is derived from the arabian sea and the indian ocean whereas in saudi arabia it either originates from the atlantic ocean the arabian sea or the indian ocean evaporation alters the isotopic composition of groundwater which is mainly controlled by relative humidity that varies between 20 and 90 in the gcc countries the slope of the evaporation line compared to local meteoric water lines lmwls for bahrain kuwait and northern oman indicates a moderate rate of evaporation due to rapid infiltration of storm water in contrast the evaporation line slope for qatar southern oman and saudi arabia are higher than the slopes of the lmwls showing a relatively low rate of evaporation the uae groundwater slope is smaller than that of lmwl indicating high evaporation

rub al khali aquifer system of saudi arabia sultan et al 2008 duane et al 2004 attempted to identify the groundwater and seawater mixing zones in al khiran sabkha in kuwait this study suggested that a combination of wind deposition and diffusion probably explains the observed δ37cl values but not the seawater intrusion duane et al 2004 recommended vertical sampling of wells in this region to clearly understand the groundwater and seawater mixing zones as groundwater flows through the aquifer medium the isotopic characteristics of the groundwater can change due to processes such as mixing and water rock interaction such as ion exchange and leaching the range of δ13c observed in the gravel plain aquifer and ophiolite aquifer in the eastern uae suggests c 3 sunflower carrot potato pepper mango watermelon and strawberry and c 4 plants tomato sugarcane and cactus control the dissolved inorganic carbon dic in groundwater murad and krishnamurthy 2008 mixing between groundwater and geothermal water in northern part of jabal hafit uae was identified due to enriched δ18o and low d excess murad and mirghni 2012 carbonate rocks are one of the important lithologies in gcc countries and carbonate dissolution during groundwater movement is very common enrichment in δ18o of groundwater samples from carbonate aquifer in jabal hafit uae indicated oxygen exchange between groundwater and host rocks at elevated temperature murad and mirghni 2012 2 3 groundwater recharge groundwater age is defined as the mean residence time of water since it was recharged kazemi et al 2006 generally tritium 3h radiocarbon 14c and chlorine 36 36cl with half lives of 12 28 years 5700 30 years and 3 105 years respectively are used to identify the age of the groundwater tritium values of less than 1 tritium unit tu in water are considered to represent water recharged prior to 1952 when atmospheric nuclear testing began trabelsi et al 2019 high tritium content up to 18 tu indicated pronounced contribution of recent rainfall in western saudi arabia bazuhair et al 1990 tritium value of up to 13 tritium units tu from coastal groundwater of northern oman associated with the active runoff network indicated recent groundwater with the age less than 5 years clark et al 1989 a tritium value of 2 8 tu was attributed to modern recharge in abu dhabi uae with short mean residence times al katheeri et al 2009 high altitude groundwater is essentially modern in origin because of high 3h value in halfayn alluvial aquifer oman 5 10 tu matter et al 2006 groundwater sampled from deep wells in abu dhabi uae is mostly 3h free indicating that no modern recharge component contributes to these waters mckenzie et al 1980 the 14c data indicated that it takes several hundred to a few thousand years for the groundwater to move 50 km between the jabal akhdar mountains and batinah coastal region of oman weyhenmeyer et al 2002 using 14c ages of lacustrine deposits in the southern rub al khali of saudi arabia wood and imes 2003 identified a late pleistocene to early holocene paleoclimate with two wet periods one between 6000 and 9000 y bp and the other between 21 000 and 30 000 y bp travertine deposits in the oman mountains bordering the southern rub al khali have 14c dates indicating wet periods between 6500 and 12 500 y bp and between 19 000 and 33 000 y bp dating of speleothems in northern oman indicates a wet period between 6200 and 9200 y bp wood and imes 2003 in the eastern uae 36cl data indicated that groundwater is modern post 1950 murad and krishnamurthy 2004 apart from 3h and 36cl values murad 2010 used similarity in the regression lines of δd vs δ18o of groundwater samples to identify modern day recharge in the northern uae 2 4 groundwater salinity ambient hydrochemistry of groundwater mostly depends on long term water rock interaction during flow through pores and fractures khan et al 2019 groundwater contamination in gcc countries is often associated with salinization which can occur for various reasons including evaporation return flow from irrigation water seawater intrusion and disposal of produced water from the oil and gas industry mohamed et al 2010a 2010b sherif et al 2011a elmahdy and mohamed 2012 2013 2014 different methods of analyses were used to identify the sources of salinization the higher electrical conductivity ec values indicate higher salinity table 2 shows the average values of hydrochemical parameters from studies conducted in gcc countries generally the salinity of the groundwater in coastal aquifers is associated with seawater intrusion yet the narrow range of δ18o and δd values and high divergence from the isotopic value of seawater indicated that seawater is not the main source of salinity in eastern part of uae murad and krishnamurthy 2004 and rub al khali in southern saudi arabia sultan et al 2008 in bahrain groundwater samples the deflection of δ18o and δd from mmwl indicate that factors other than seawater intrusion influence the groundwater chemistry zubari 2005 indicated that seawater intrusion occurs in groundwater of eastern bahrain whereas brackish water flows upward in north central and western bahrain comparison of groundwater geochemistry with isotopes helped to clearly distinguish the reason for salinization in the eastern coastal aquifer the absence of positive correlation between isotopic composition δ18o δd and chloride indicated that evaporation alone is not the cause for salinity in eastern region of uae murad and krishnamurthy 2008 murad et al 2012 in contrast in the northern part of uae the positive correlation between isotopic composition δ18o δd and chloride clearly suggested that the groundwater salinity is due to the recharge of evaporated raindrops or recharge from evaporated surface waters murad et al 2011 the high chloride and heavily enriched δ18o in water samples indicated that salinity is mainly due to seawater intrusion but groundwater in the mid east of uae is mainly influenced by irrigation return flow khan et al 2019 the correlation of na ca cl and hco3 with tds suggest that the groundwater is fresh to brackish in western saudi arabia which is due to rock weathering and evaporation al ahmadi 2013 the d excess in kuwait groundwater shows that it is of meteoric origin hadi and al ruwaih 2008 the salinity in most of the sabkha water samples represents an apparent evaporation trend with a characteristic increase in heavier isotopes as trend line has a slope less than 5 in kuwait duane et al 2004 3 precipitation and evaporation the origin of vapor sources for the precipitation can be identified based on characteristic weather systems in the region alsharhan et al 2001 indicated that cyclonic depressions and summer monsoons affect the climate in the arabian peninsula the depressions of bahrain kuwait qatar saudi arabia and uae originate from the mediterranean sea murad et al 2011 the vapor source for northern oman is from the mediterranean sea and vapor for southern oman is from the indian ocean weyhenmeyer et al 2002 strauch et al 2014 fig 2 indicates that the lmwls of kuwait bhandary et al 2013 qatar wagner 2011 and uae sherif et al 2011b murad and krishnamurthy 2004 are situated close to the mmwl this indicates that precipitation in these regions originates from the mediterranean sea arabian sea and indian ocean application of isotopes in groundwater studies indicated that the mediterranean sea is the major source of vapor for all gcc countries because of the enriched δd of groundwater which is close to the d excess of 20 21 of mmwl the higher d excess for the mediterranean sea is due to the interaction of cold air from surrounding continents with the warm mediterranean seawater thereby enhancing isotopic fractionation during evaporation juhlke et al 2019 the value of d excess for local precipitation will be greater than 15 if precipitation assimilates recycled surface moisture and will be less than 10 if raindrop evaporation occurs froehlich et al 2008 peng et al 2010 the decreased δd value of 8 indicates that local precipitation occurs in uae from the moisture derived from the arabian sea murad et al 2011 shamal summer fall monsoon rains which are the main source of water in uae coastal sabkha wood et al 2002 are strongly evaporated which causes a decrease in the δ18o δd slope an increase in δ18o and a decrease in d excess of up to 24 wood 2011 the unusually low d excess of 15 in bu hasa area in abu dhabi indicates that the moisture is derived from indian ocean alyammani 2001 recorded d excess values around 10 in the western province of saudi arabia where the source of moisture cannot be mediterranean sea d excess 22 thus rainfall over western saudi arabia may originate either from the atlantic during winter or from the arabian sea and indian ocean during autumn monsoon alyamani 2001 tropical southern depressions that originate from the arabian sea indian ocean and bay of bengal d excess 3 06 in oman do not reach inland regions due to an atmospheric inversion where the monsoonal air masses are blocked by the dhofar mountains southern moisture source in oman is estimated to occur once every 5 10 years clark et al 1987 weyhenmeyer et al 2002 fleitmann et al 2004 matter et al 2006 al mashaikhi et al 2012 strauch et al 2014 evaporation is the major cause of changes in isotopic composition of groundwater in arid and semi arid regions the effect of evaporation on the isotopes depends on the temperature and geology of the aquifer relative humidity is the main factor determining the slope of the evaporation line gonfiantini 1978 rozanski et al 1993 and relative humidity of gcc countries varies from 20 to 90 al maamary et al 2017 patlakas et al 2019 deviation in the isotopic compositions of groundwater with respect to lmwl could help in identifying the sources of precipitation and rate of evaporation fig 2 shows the relationship between δ18o and δd isotopes of groundwater samples collected from previous studies table 1 the calculated slopes obtained using the data of bahrain kuwait and northern oman tables 3 and 4 are slightly lower than the slopes of lmwls of the region fig 2 this suggests a moderate rate of evaporation due to rapid infiltration of storm water which is in agreement with conclusions of clark et al 1987 the isotopic signatures of western kuwait are slightly enriched in heavier isotopes fig 2 which could be due to recharge by partly evaporated water accumulated in the depressions and the hydraulic connection between the dammam aquifer and overlying kuwait aquifer the moderate rate of evaporation in northern kuwait indicates that the source of precipitation studied from groundwater samples is not from local moisture bhandary et al 2013 the slopes of the groundwater samples of qatar southern oman and saudi arabia in fig 2 are higher than the slope of the lmwl of those respective regions indicating a relatively low rate of evaporation table 4 this reflects high altitude recharge in southern oman the narrow range of isotope signatures for groundwater from western saudi arabia indicates that these samples are from recent recharge and rapid infiltration through fractured rocks alyamani 2001 groundwater samples from central and southern saudi arabia are enriched in δ18o which may be due to evaporation the slope of groundwater samples of uae fig 2 f is very small compared against the slope of lmwl of uae this low slope indicates high rate of evaporation of surface water prior to infiltration table 4 the process affecting the isotopic composition of the groundwater of gcc countries can also be explained by the relationship between δ18o and d excess fig 3 the range of d excess and the coefficient of determination r2 for each of the gcc countries are given in table 4 positive d excess values indicate low evaporation while negative d excess indicate high evaporation fig 3 shows very low correlation values and more positive d excess for bahrain kuwait oman northern and southern qatar and western saudi arabia it is evident that evaporation is not a predominant factor altering the isotopic signatures of this region this may be attributed to low or medium rate of evaporation high elevation recharge and rapid infiltration of storm water through fractured rocks in these countries alyamani 2001 the plot of δ18o vs d excess from the groundwater samples of qatar indicates slightly positive correlation all other gcc countries show negative correlation of δ18o vs d excess which suggests different degrees of evaporation the relationship of δ18o vs d excess of groundwater samples of uae shows high negative correlation r2 0 88 groundwater samples from liwa and bu hasa regions of uae show more negative d excess values which may be related to high evaporation rates groundwater samples from northern and eastern uae are depleted in δd and δ18o and have more positive d excess values consistent with recharge from high altitude rainfall a plot of δd vs δ18o for groundwater in all gcc countries shows that samples fall along and below the gmwl fig 4 a low d excess values on table 4 and fig 4 b indicate other sources of precipitation including the bay of bengal in southern oman and red sea in saudi arabia the low slope and y intercept of the groundwater regression line show that groundwater samples have undergone evaporation prior to recharge the majority of groundwater samples from uae are enriched in heavier isotopes which indicates that moisture traveled over long distances before reaching the arabian gulf area fig 4 b shows that samples from the southwestern uae liwa and bu hasa are enriched in δ18o and exhibit low d excess whereas eastern and northern regions of uae show positive d excess saudi arabia has low d excess which is due to partial evaporation during recharge the d excess values of other regions are between 10 and 21 where low d excess values indicate regional water source like bay of bengal in southern oman meteoric origin water in northeastern kuwait seawater intrusion in eastern coast of bahrain and higher d excess values are compatible with the major source of precipitation from mediterranean sea 4 summary and conclusions this paper has reviewed the use of isotopes particularly δ18o and δd in hydrological studies in the gcc countries of the arabian peninsula the lmwls of the gcc countries are comparable to the mmwl indicating that the arabian sea the indian ocean and the mediterranean sea are the major sources of precipitation in the region relatively depleted δ18o and δd values of groundwater in oman saudi arabia and uae indicate that recharge occurs in the mountains reflecting decreased temperature and progressive rainout during the process of evaporation enrichment of heavier isotopes takes place and the value of d excess decreases the isotopic composition of rainfall in uae is altered by high rate of evaporation whereas other parts of the arabian peninsula do not show good correlation between d excess and δ18o relatively rapid infiltration and groundwater flow occur within fractured and carbonate aquifers tritium 14c and 36cl have been used to date groundwater in a few studies radioisotopes indicate that the age of groundwater in the gulf countries varies from late pleistocene and early holocene to recent hydrochemical data suggest groundwater contamination due to salinization which occurs due to evaporation irrigation return flow and along the eastern coast of bahrain seawater intrusion isotopic studies should be coupled with point source investigations such as water level monitoring pan evaporation infiltration rain gauge measurements and tracer tests to understand local scale groundwater movement more analyses of groundwater chemistry and geochemical modeling would help to identify the sources of high tds in these gcc countries such studies are important for decision makers to present sustainable measures to avoid further deterioration of the only available natural freshwater that is groundwater in this arid region declaration of competing

12022,in recent years the occurrence of several unwanted compounds from industrial processes as well as domestic activities is increasing the concentration of different pollutants in effluents which is becoming a serious threat to our environment among various conventional technologies of water treatment membrane separation process has shown promising results against treatment or recovery of various contaminants several pieces of literature show that mainly polymeric membranes are more promising for water and wastewater treatment however there are some limitations still prevailed in this type of treatment process such as fouling microbial growth flux reduction poor mechanical and thermal stability lower lifetime etc hence the nanocomposite membrane has introduced to eradicate those limitations and enhance the performance as well as the effectiveness of the membrane the composite membranes using a different type of nanoparticle i e tio2 silver al2o3 pd sio2 ce fe2o3 etc have been incorporated in the recent past in the field of membrane science the present article represents an in depth review on surface modification of membrane with nanoparticles its performance improvement characterization and its possible applications in different fields of water as well as wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords nanocomposite surface modification water treatment fouling membrane performances 1 introduction the demand for freshwater is rapidly increasing day by day globally however the source of fresh water is very limited and it has been estimated that half a billion people are under severe water scarcity all year round therefore it is mandating that water to be recycled as much as possible by any means of advanced water treatment technologies such as adsorption coagulation flocculation membrane separation process etc except for membrane separation other processes have some limitations like chemical consumption disposal of adsorbent high maintenance the large amount of material handling etc therefore in the current scenario several research organizations and industries have adopted pressure driven membrane separation technology in a different type of water wastewater treatment due to several advantages like cost effectiveness space utilization and effective separation etc nevertheless there are also a few disadvantages under the beneath of the various advantages to the membrane separation process however the major problem is the fouling of the membrane which is caused due to the deposition of materials on the surface of the membrane during the filtration process potts et al 1981 mulder 1996 hence during the separation process pores are blocked gradually and the performance of membrane decreases this phenomenon may be further accelerated in presence of hydrophobic material in the effluent which is going to be treated using membrane mohammadi et al 2003 therefore it is our major concern to reduce the fouling effect and this can be achieved through the surface modification of the membrane such an effect can be reduced to some extent by improving the hydrophilicity of the membrane and at the same time if the surface is reactive in nature then the fouled material can be degraded simultaneously nowadays the fabrication of organic inorganic composite membranes is becoming most popular among the research fraternities and such type of membranes are capable of minimizing the limitations of membrane separation process bottino et al 2001 aerts et al 2001 wang et al 2003 nanotechnology becomes the pathway to meet the socio economic requirements thus nanocomposite membranes have shown a better opportunity in the field of separation processes the composite membrane shows better thermal and mechanical stability as well as it is more efficient flexible and reactive in nature as compared to the ordinary membrane homayoonfal et al 2013 moreover the nanoparticles act as an additive on the membrane surface therefore the characteristics of composite membrane are distinct from the ordinary membrane some of the nanoparticles increase the hydrophilicity of a membrane thus it helps to minimize the fouling tendency of the membrane surface in the presence of tio2 zno al2o3 yan et al 2006 maximous et al 2009 zro2 sio2 fe3o4 silver and fe taurozzi et al 2011 nanoparticles the mechanical and thermal resistance of polymeric membranes can be improved moreover the presence of zno li et al 2010 tio2 razmjou et al 2011a and silver zodrow et al 2009 nanoparticles enhance the antibacterial property of a membrane the ferromagnetic property and conductivity can be introduced to the membrane surface with the help of nano grade fe3o4 yu et al 2009 and sio2 jian et al 2006 respectively however the fabrication of nanocomposite membrane is a very tedious and controlled job according to several studies mainly two different approaches have adopted by the researchers homayoonfal et al 2013 mojtahedi et al 2013 sotto et al 2011 for the fabrication of composite membranes i entrapment of nanoparticle inside the polymeric structure during fabrication via phase inversion method and ii surface coating of the membrane using nanoparticle the present review article aims to highlight the several aspects of nanocomposite membrane such as fabrication characterization application and advantages over the common membrane separation process 2 methods of surface modification and challenges in general two major methodologies have been broadly adopted by several groups of researchers to prepare composite membrane in presence of nanoparticles though fabrication techniques are again modified by an individual research group based on their end applications and to achieve desired properties of the composite membrane based on available pieces of literature a brief detail of such methods has been portrayed in this article 2 1 membrane surface coating using nanoparticles the coating on the polymeric membrane is a very common and effective way of surface modification homayoonfal et al 2013 mojtahedi et al 2013 bae and tak 2005a yang et al 2007 rahimpour et al 2008 mansourpanah et al 2009 the basic concept of this method is quite simple and initially the membrane is dipped into the desired concentration of nanoparticle solution for a certain period of time kim et al 2003 rahimpour et al 2012 mohammadi et al 2013 rajaeian et al 2013 meng et al 2011 razmjou et al 2011b yang et al 2009 ahmad et al 2011b madaeni et al 2011 after that the attachment of the nanoparticle on the membrane surface could be further improved by certain means i e pressure uv irradiation rahimpour et al 2008 razmjou et al 2011b madaeni et al 2011 etc sometimes the membrane surface can be modified in situ interfacial polymerization technique where a secondary polymer or adhesive is used for polymerization with the membrane surface and it binds nanoparticles on the membrane surface lee et al 2007 madaeni et al 2011 the surface modification can be ensured with the help of various equipment such as sem scanning electron microscope ftir fourier transform infrared spectroscopy mojtahedi et al 2013 bae and tak 2005a a typical schematic diagram of the surface modified membrane has been shown in fig 1 a moreover surface coating method can be done using the sol gel method hong et al 2012 where the solution of tio2 is called sol and after the dipped coating the coated layer is called a gel layer in the year of 2012 amanipour et al 2012 adopted a different technique where they deposited nanoparticle with the help of argon gas which contained nano grade sio2 and al2o3 at high temperature this method is called chemical vapour deposition method cvd here nanoparticles are spat over the membrane surface using inert gas with high velocity the main driving force for attachment in the cvd process is the gas injection velocity towards the membrane surface in the same year ke et al 2012 adopted in situ sol gel method here sol gel method was followed by the surface reaction on the top layer of the membrane in such cases enough time was provided to complete the reaction this type of surface modification is very simple less time consuming effective in the field of membrane science however after all those attempts it has been summarized that the leaching of nanoparticle from surface coated membrane has been observed after certain cycles of operation as particles are loosely attached to the membrane surface mahmoudi et al 2019 2 2 entrapment of nanoparticle during membrane fabrication another important method for preparation of nanocomposite membrane is the entrapment of nanoparticle inside the membrane matrix during the fabrication process this method is more complex and tedious than surface coating method and it is also known as phase inversion method first the selected nanoparticle is dispersed in polymer solution by introducing enhanced stirring i e mechanical and ultrasonic stirring to ensure the casting solution forms a homogeneous mixture and there is no gas bubble present in casting solution after that homogeneous solution is cast over some clean as well as smooth surface using a casting knife or by any other means afterward some post treatment methods should follow to produce nanocomposite membrane homayoonfal et al 2013 yan et al 2006 maximous et al 2009 jian et al 2006 mojtahedi et al 2013 bae and tak 2005a cao et al 2006 li et al 2007 taurozzi et al 2008 ahn et al 2008 kim and marand 2008 wang et al 2008 lue et al 2008 sun et al 2013 shi et al 2013 lin et al 2012 li et al 2013 pua et al 2009 farno et al 2011 mingliang et al 2011 karkhanechi et al 2012 hong and he 2012 linh et al 2011b li et al 2012 jeddi et al 2013 abdal haya et al 2013 alpatova et al 2013 meng et al 2011 zhan and cao 2011 mierzwa et al 2013 arsuaga et al 2013 huang et al 2012a teli et al 2012 huang et al 2012b hosseinia et al 2010 li et al 2009b wu et al 2008 a schematic of the composite membrane has been shown in fig 1 b sometimes the phase inversion method can be categorized into two different types i e in situ and ex situ taurozzi et al 2008 during in situ method the nanomaterial is synthesized during the membrane fabrication process whereas in case of ex situ the synthesis of the nanoparticle is carried out prior to the fabrication taurozzi et al 2008 the present methodology for membrane fabrication enhances the stability of nanoparticle as those are entrapped in a polymeric matrix hence the chances of leaching of nanoparticles reduce to a greater extent 2 3 challenges associated with nanocomposite membrane the performance of the composite membrane depends on available active site of nanoparticles on the membrane surface and therefore the major challenges associated with such membrane are agglomeration and leaching of nanoparticle jan et al 2018 ahmad et al 2019 bolto and xie 2018 mahmoudi et al 2019 mahmoudi et al 2019 have reviewed different pieces of literature where it has clearly mentioned that agglomeration and leaching take place in any kind of composite membrane the leaching of nanoparticle causes the detrimental effects on the downstream process as well as an increment in the cost of nanocomposite membrane fabrication both challenges are more predominant in case of the surface coated membrane as compare to other composite membranes jan et al 2018 ahmad et al 2019 however different activities of nanoparticles are more effective in case of the coated membrane as those are fully exposed to the working solution rahimpour et al 2008 the membrane properties are gradually altered due to leach out of the material generally different type of anchor materials graphene oxide reduced graphene oxide acrylamide polydopamine polyvinylpyrrolidone etc are used by different research groups for reduction of agglomeration and leaching of nanomaterials mahmoudi et al 2019 hence leaching study should be considered during performance analysis of any composite membrane 3 improvement of membrane properties the physiochemical properties of the composite membrane are altered in presence of nanoparticles homayoonfal et al 2013 kim and bruggen 2010 in terms of stability the nanocomposite membranes have better thermal yu et al 2009 soroko and livingston 2009 shin et al 2013 gestel et al 2008 xin et al 2013 li et al 2009b 2013 pua et al 2009 rajaeian et al 2013 huang et al 2012a 2012b wu et al 2008 dasguptaa et al 2014 and mechanical stability yang et al 2007 li et al 2007 2013 taurozzi et al 2008 soroko and livingston 2009 pua et al 2009 wu et al 2008 as well as it is more compact than ordinary on at the same time those are more flexible and reactive in nature linh et al 2011a as the nanoparticles are incorporated inside or upper surface of the membrane the structural stability of the membrane is improved by principle amanipour et al 2012 sometime membrane is used in fuel cell and other reactive systems and for such purposes the membrane should be chemically stable those type of requirements can be fulfilled only using nanocomposite membrane shin et al 2013 ke et al 2012 li et al 2013 pua et al 2009 jeddi et al 2013 mohammadi et al 2013 hosseinia et al 2010 the surface charge of the membrane is generally increased due to the presence of nanoparticle and hence the ion exchange capacity may improve li et al 2013 similarly the proton conductivity can be enhanced using sio2 composite membrane wang et al 2008 pua et al 2009 above all one of the major properties is the hydrophilicity of the membrane which can be enhanced due to the presence of nanoparticle thus the effect of fouling can be reduced to a greater extent in presence of nanoparticle though the flux of such membrane reduces to some extent in comparison with ordinary membrane bae and tak 2005a rahimpour et al 2008 2011 2012 li et al 2007 2009a zhang et al 2008 soroko and livingston 2009 amanipour et al 2012 lin et al 2012 meng et al 2011 zhan and cao 2011 huang et al 2012a teli et al 2012 madaeni et al 2011 wu et al 2008 in addition the flux recovery of the composite membrane is always better than the common one maximous et al 2009 mansourpanah et al 2009 soroko and livingston 2009 farno et al 2011 mingliang et al 2011 mierzwa et al 2013 madaeni et al 2011 another important property of the membrane is the swelling characteristic which refers to the interaction between membrane material and the liquid penetrates through the membrane the degree of swelling is measured as the fraction of weight of the membrane increase in presence of penetrated liquid with compare to the dried membrane sun et al 2013 reported that with the incorporation of the nanoparticle the degree of swelling was increased and it had been accepted by several researchers shi et al 2013 li et al 2013 in modern days selectivity and permeability of the membrane are greatly improved using nanoparticle and those properties are very much helpful for separation of a gas from a different gas mixture amanipour et al 2012 kim and marand 2008 farno et al 2011 karkhanechi et al 2012 ahmad et al 2011b the silver nanoparticle has an ability to reduce the potential growth of bacteria therefore such composite membranes have already used by several researchers zodrow et al 2009 shi et al 2012 taurozzi et al 2008 alpatova et al 2013 yang et al 2009 to reduce the bio fouling of the membrane similarly rahimpour et al 2012 examined that under uv irradiation the modified membrane had a good antibacterial property as under uv irradiation tio2 nanoparticle shows photocatalytic activity li et al 2012 linh et al 2011a 2011b also ensured the photocatalytic activity of tio2 composite membrane overall we can say the nanoparticle is a blessing of science that has already enhanced the performance of the membrane 4 characterization technique of the modified membrane the surface modification and the structural changes can be confirmed using sem afm atomic force microscopy tem transmission electron microscopy xps x ray photoelectron spectroscopy sem edax or eds energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy and ftir maximous et al 2009 zodrow et al 2009 yu et al 2009 jian et al 2006 yang et al 2007 rahimpour et al 2008 li et al 2007 2009a xu and bhattacharyya 2007 lee et al 2007 taurozzi et al 2008 ahn et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 mansourpanah et al 2009 soroko and livingston 2009 amanipour et al 2012 xin et al 2013 rahimpour et al 2012 li et al 2013 pua et al 2009 mingliang et al 2011 karkhanechi et al 2012 hong and he 2012 linh et al 2011b li et al 2012 jeddi et al 2013 abdal haya et al 2013 mohammadi et al 2013 rajaeian et al 2013 alpatova et al 2013 meng et al 2011 zhan and cao 2011 mierzwa et al 2013 arsuaga et al 2013 huang et al 2012a teli et al 2012 huang et al 2012b razmjou et al 2011b yang et al 2009 ahmad et al 2011b hosseinia et al 2010 madaeni et al 2011 li et al 2009b wu et al 2008 gul et al 2017 andrade et al 2015 jan et al 2018 ahmad et al 2019 bolto and xie 2018 fischer et al 2018 analysis the sem analyses confirm that modified pore distribution pore size structural change of the membrane matrix as well as the cross linkage between the polymer and the nanoparticle the elemental composition of the membrane surface can be well defined by xps and sem edax xps also helps to determine the binding states of the elements with a membrane matrix the superficial changes of the membrane surface are analyzed with afm and it also provides a qualitative measure of the roughness of the membrane surface 3d morphology of membrane can be well understood with help of tem as well as the nature of fouling inside the pores of the membrane the heat resistivity of the membrane can be examined using thermogravimetric analysis tga rajaeian et al 2013 moreover the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the membrane surface can be confirmed using contact angle goniometry yang et al 2007 rahimpour et al 2008 2012 zhang et al 2008 mingliang et al 2011 meng et al 2011 zhan and cao 2011 huang et al 2012a teli et al 2012 madaeni et al 2011 wu et al 2008 gul et al 2017 andrade et al 2015 in general contact angle decreases for hydrophilic and increases for the hydrophobic surface thus a higher contact angle refers to the hydrophobic nature of the membrane and less fouling tendency as

membrane during this measurement the sample is placed under constant controlled tensile stress until failure the nominal stress and strain are calculated from the measured value of load displacement original cross sectional area and initial length of the sample in any membrane based separation process it is always expected that the membrane should have high mechanical strength so that it should

nanoparticles and the applications of those composite membranes have been elaborated 5 1 nanocomposite membrane using tio2 nanoparticle tio2 nanoparticle is commonly used for fabrication of nanocomposite membrane such metal oxide always helps to improve water permeability hydrophilicity mechanical strength and anti fouling ability of a membrane sometimes it also improves the ani bacterial property of the membrane surface some major findings on nanocomposite membrane using tio2 have been elaborate in table 1 5 2 nanocomposite membrane using silver nanoparticle silver is a good anti bacterial agent therefore silver nanoparticle is used to make the membrane surface anti bacterial in nature so that it minimizes the biofouling of the membrane surface moreover such a particle

properties than the ordinary one in different aspects moreover the study has described the morphological changes of the composite membranes in recent years the scarcity of freshwater is rapidly increasing due to water pollution caused by industrial and domestic activities it is already been proven that with help of membrane separation process various type of pollutants can be removed to make any system zero water discharge based on the present discussion there is a huge opportunity to use nanocomposite membrane in industrial as well as domestic applications though the application of such membrane is very limited in commercial scale due to higher cost involvement in membrane fabrication and hence the utmost effort to be given for further development so that it can be economically

12022,in recent years the occurrence of several unwanted compounds from industrial processes as well as domestic activities is increasing the concentration of different pollutants in effluents which is becoming a serious threat to our environment among various conventional technologies of water treatment membrane separation process has shown promising results against treatment or recovery of various contaminants several pieces of literature show that mainly polymeric membranes are more promising for water and wastewater treatment however there are some limitations still prevailed in this type of treatment process such as fouling microbial growth flux reduction poor mechanical and thermal stability lower lifetime etc hence the nanocomposite membrane has introduced to eradicate those limitations and enhance the performance as well as the effectiveness of the membrane the composite membranes using a different type of nanoparticle i e tio2 silver al2o3 pd sio2 ce fe2o3 etc have been incorporated in the recent past in the field of membrane science the present article represents an in depth review on surface modification of membrane with nanoparticles its performance improvement characterization and its possible applications in different fields of water as well as wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords nanocomposite surface modification water treatment fouling membrane performances 1 introduction the demand for freshwater is rapidly increasing day by day globally however the source of fresh water is very limited and it has been estimated that half a billion people are under severe water scarcity all year round therefore it is mandating that water to be recycled as much as possible by any means of advanced water treatment technologies such as adsorption coagulation flocculation membrane separation process etc except for membrane separation other processes have some limitations like chemical consumption disposal of adsorbent high maintenance the large amount of material handling etc therefore in the current scenario several research organizations and industries have adopted pressure driven membrane separation technology in a different type of water wastewater treatment due to several advantages like cost effectiveness space utilization and effective separation etc nevertheless there are also a few disadvantages under the beneath of the various advantages to the membrane separation process however the major problem is the fouling of the membrane which is caused due to the deposition of materials on the surface of the membrane during the filtration process potts et al 1981 mulder 1996 hence during the separation process pores are blocked gradually and the performance of membrane decreases this phenomenon may be further accelerated in presence of hydrophobic material in the effluent which is going to be treated using membrane mohammadi et al 2003 therefore it is our major concern to reduce the fouling effect and this can be achieved through the surface modification of the membrane such an effect can be reduced to some extent by improving the hydrophilicity of the membrane and at the same time if the surface is reactive in nature then the fouled material can be degraded simultaneously nowadays the fabrication of organic inorganic composite membranes is becoming most popular among the research fraternities and such type of membranes are capable of minimizing the limitations of membrane separation process bottino et al 2001 aerts et al 2001 wang et al 2003 nanotechnology becomes the pathway to meet the socio economic requirements thus nanocomposite membranes have shown a better opportunity in the field of separation processes the composite membrane shows better thermal and mechanical stability as well as it is more efficient flexible and reactive in nature as compared to the ordinary membrane homayoonfal et al 2013 moreover the nanoparticles act as an additive on the membrane surface therefore the characteristics of composite membrane are distinct from the ordinary membrane some of the nanoparticles increase the hydrophilicity of a membrane thus it helps to minimize the fouling tendency of the membrane surface in the presence of tio2 zno al2o3 yan et al 2006 maximous et al 2009 zro2 sio2 fe3o4 silver and fe taurozzi et al 2011 nanoparticles the mechanical and thermal resistance of polymeric membranes can be improved moreover the presence of zno li et al 2010 tio2 razmjou et al 2011a and silver zodrow et al 2009 nanoparticles enhance the antibacterial property of a membrane the ferromagnetic property and conductivity can be introduced to the membrane surface with the help of nano grade fe3o4 yu et al 2009 and sio2 jian et al 2006 respectively however the fabrication of nanocomposite membrane is a very tedious and controlled job according to several studies mainly two different approaches have adopted by the researchers homayoonfal et al 2013 mojtahedi et al 2013 sotto et al 2011 for the fabrication of composite membranes i entrapment of nanoparticle inside the polymeric structure during fabrication via phase inversion method and ii surface coating of the membrane using nanoparticle the present review article aims to highlight the several aspects of nanocomposite membrane such as fabrication characterization application and advantages over the common membrane separation process 2 methods of surface modification and challenges in general two major methodologies have been broadly adopted by several groups of researchers to prepare composite membrane in presence of nanoparticles though fabrication techniques are again modified by an individual research group based on their end applications and to achieve desired properties of the composite membrane based on available pieces of literature a brief detail of such methods has been portrayed in this article 2 1 membrane surface coating using nanoparticles the coating on the polymeric membrane is a very common and effective way of surface modification homayoonfal et al 2013 mojtahedi et al 2013 bae and tak 2005a yang et al 2007 rahimpour et al 2008 mansourpanah et al 2009 the basic concept of this method is quite simple and initially the membrane is dipped into the desired concentration of nanoparticle solution for a certain period of time kim et al 2003 rahimpour et al 2012 mohammadi et al 2013 rajaeian et al 2013 meng et al 2011 razmjou et al 2011b yang et al 2009 ahmad et al 2011b madaeni et al 2011 after that the attachment of the nanoparticle on the membrane surface could be further improved by certain means i e pressure uv irradiation rahimpour et al 2008 razmjou et al 2011b madaeni et al 2011 etc sometimes the membrane surface can be modified in situ interfacial polymerization technique where a secondary polymer or adhesive is used for polymerization with the membrane surface and it binds nanoparticles on the membrane surface lee et al 2007 madaeni et al 2011 the surface modification can be ensured with the help of various equipment such as sem scanning electron microscope ftir fourier transform infrared spectroscopy mojtahedi et al 2013 bae and tak 2005a a typical schematic diagram of the surface modified membrane has been shown in fig 1 a moreover surface coating method can be done using the sol gel method hong et al 2012 where the solution of tio2 is called sol and after the dipped coating the coated layer is called a gel layer in the year of 2012 amanipour et al 2012 adopted a different technique where they deposited nanoparticle with the help of argon gas which contained nano grade sio2 and al2o3 at high temperature this method is called chemical vapour deposition method cvd here nanoparticles are spat over the membrane surface using inert gas with high velocity the main driving force for attachment in the cvd process is the gas injection velocity towards the membrane surface in the same year ke et al 2012 adopted in situ sol gel method here sol gel method was followed by the surface reaction on the top layer of the membrane in such cases enough time was provided to complete the reaction this type of surface modification is very simple less time consuming effective in the field of membrane science however after all those attempts it has been summarized that the leaching of nanoparticle from surface coated membrane has been observed after certain cycles of operation as particles are loosely attached to the membrane surface mahmoudi et al 2019 2 2 entrapment of nanoparticle during membrane fabrication another important method for preparation of nanocomposite membrane is the entrapment of nanoparticle inside the membrane matrix during the fabrication process this method is more complex and tedious than surface coating method and it is also known as phase inversion method first the selected nanoparticle is dispersed in polymer solution by introducing enhanced stirring i e mechanical and ultrasonic stirring to ensure the casting solution forms a homogeneous mixture and there is no gas bubble present in casting solution after that homogeneous solution is cast over some clean as well as smooth surface using a casting knife or by any other means afterward some post treatment methods should follow to produce nanocomposite membrane homayoonfal et al 2013 yan et al 2006 maximous et al 2009 jian et al 2006 mojtahedi et al 2013 bae and tak 2005a cao et al 2006 li et al 2007 taurozzi et al 2008 ahn et al 2008 kim and marand 2008 wang et al 2008 lue et al 2008 sun et al 2013 shi et al 2013 lin et al 2012 li et al 2013 pua et al 2009 farno et al 2011 mingliang et al 2011 karkhanechi et al 2012 hong and he 2012 linh et al 2011b li et al 2012 jeddi et al 2013 abdal haya et al 2013 alpatova et al 2013 meng et al 2011 zhan and cao 2011 mierzwa et al 2013 arsuaga et al 2013 huang et al 2012a teli et al 2012 huang et al 2012b hosseinia et al 2010 li et al 2009b wu et al 2008 a schematic of the composite membrane has been shown in fig 1 b sometimes the phase inversion method can be categorized into two different types i e in situ and ex situ taurozzi et al 2008 during in situ method the nanomaterial is synthesized during the membrane fabrication process whereas in case of ex situ the synthesis of the nanoparticle is carried out prior to the fabrication taurozzi et al 2008 the present methodology for membrane fabrication enhances the stability of nanoparticle as those are entrapped in a polymeric matrix hence the chances of leaching of nanoparticles reduce to a greater extent 2 3 challenges associated with nanocomposite membrane the performance of the composite membrane depends on available active site of nanoparticles on the membrane surface and therefore the major challenges associated with such membrane are agglomeration and leaching of nanoparticle jan et al 2018 ahmad et al 2019 bolto and xie 2018 mahmoudi et al 2019 mahmoudi et al 2019 have reviewed different pieces of literature where it has clearly mentioned that agglomeration and leaching take place in any kind of composite membrane the leaching of nanoparticle causes the detrimental effects on the downstream process as well as an increment in the cost of nanocomposite membrane fabrication both challenges are more predominant in case of the surface coated membrane as compare to other composite membranes jan et al 2018 ahmad et al 2019 however different activities of nanoparticles are more effective in case of the coated membrane as those are fully exposed to the working solution rahimpour et al 2008 the membrane properties are gradually altered due to leach out of the material generally different type of anchor materials graphene oxide reduced graphene oxide acrylamide polydopamine polyvinylpyrrolidone etc are used by different research groups for reduction of agglomeration and leaching of nanomaterials mahmoudi et al 2019 hence leaching study should be considered during performance analysis of any composite membrane 3 improvement of membrane properties the physiochemical properties of the composite membrane are altered in presence of nanoparticles homayoonfal et al 2013 kim and bruggen 2010 in terms of stability the nanocomposite membranes have better thermal yu et al 2009 soroko and livingston 2009 shin et al 2013 gestel et al 2008 xin et al 2013 li et al 2009b 2013 pua et al 2009 rajaeian et al 2013 huang et al 2012a 2012b wu et al 2008 dasguptaa et al 2014 and mechanical stability yang et al 2007 li et al 2007 2013 taurozzi et al 2008 soroko and livingston 2009 pua et al 2009 wu et al 2008 as well as it is more compact than ordinary on at the same time those are more flexible and reactive in nature linh et al 2011a as the nanoparticles are incorporated inside or upper surface of the membrane the structural stability of the membrane is improved by principle amanipour et al 2012 sometime membrane is used in fuel cell and other reactive systems and for such purposes the membrane should be chemically stable those type of requirements can be fulfilled only using nanocomposite membrane shin et al 2013 ke et al 2012 li et al 2013 pua et al 2009 jeddi et al 2013 mohammadi et al 2013 hosseinia et al 2010 the surface charge of the membrane is generally increased due to the presence of nanoparticle and hence the ion exchange capacity may improve li et al 2013 similarly the proton conductivity can be enhanced using sio2 composite membrane wang et al 2008 pua et al 2009 above all one of the major properties is the hydrophilicity of the membrane which can be enhanced due to the presence of nanoparticle thus the effect of fouling can be reduced to a greater extent in presence of nanoparticle though the flux of such membrane reduces to some extent in comparison with ordinary membrane bae and tak 2005a rahimpour et al 2008 2011 2012 li et al 2007 2009a zhang et al 2008 soroko and livingston 2009 amanipour et al 2012 lin et al 2012 meng et al 2011 zhan and cao 2011 huang et al 2012a teli et al 2012 madaeni et al 2011 wu et al 2008 in addition the flux recovery of the composite membrane is always better than the common one maximous et al 2009 mansourpanah et al 2009 soroko and livingston 2009 farno et al 2011 mingliang et al 2011 mierzwa et al 2013 madaeni et al 2011 another important property of the membrane is the swelling characteristic which refers to the interaction between membrane material and the liquid penetrates through the membrane the degree of swelling is measured as the fraction of weight of the membrane increase in presence of penetrated liquid with compare to the dried membrane sun et al 2013 reported that with the incorporation of the nanoparticle the degree of swelling was increased and it had been accepted by several researchers shi et al 2013 li et al 2013 in modern days selectivity and permeability of the membrane are greatly improved using nanoparticle and those properties are very much helpful for separation of a gas from a different gas mixture amanipour et al 2012 kim and marand 2008 farno et al 2011 karkhanechi et al 2012 ahmad et al 2011b the silver nanoparticle has an ability to reduce the potential growth of bacteria therefore such composite membranes have already used by several researchers zodrow et al 2009 shi et al 2012 taurozzi et al 2008 alpatova et al 2013 yang et al 2009 to reduce the bio fouling of the membrane similarly rahimpour et al 2012 examined that under uv irradiation the modified membrane had a good antibacterial property as under uv irradiation tio2 nanoparticle shows photocatalytic activity li et al 2012 linh et al 2011a 2011b also ensured the photocatalytic activity of tio2 composite membrane overall we can say the nanoparticle is a blessing of science that has already enhanced the performance of the membrane 4 characterization technique of the modified membrane the surface modification and the structural changes can be confirmed using sem afm atomic force microscopy tem transmission electron microscopy xps x ray photoelectron spectroscopy sem edax or eds energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy and ftir maximous et al 2009 zodrow et al 2009 yu et al 2009 jian et al 2006 yang et al 2007 rahimpour et al 2008 li et al 2007 2009a xu and bhattacharyya 2007 lee et al 2007 taurozzi et al 2008 ahn et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 mansourpanah et al 2009 soroko and livingston 2009 amanipour et al 2012 xin et al 2013 rahimpour et al 2012 li et al 2013 pua et al 2009 mingliang et al 2011 karkhanechi et al 2012 hong and he 2012 linh et al 2011b li et al 2012 jeddi et al 2013 abdal haya et al 2013 mohammadi et al 2013 rajaeian et al 2013 alpatova et al 2013 meng et al 2011 zhan and cao 2011 mierzwa et al 2013

al 2017 andrade et al 2015 jan et al 2018 ahmad et al 2019 bolto and xie 2018 fischer et al 2018 analysis the sem analyses confirm that modified pore distribution pore size structural change of the membrane matrix as well as the cross linkage between the polymer and the nanoparticle the elemental composition of the membrane surface can be well defined by xps and sem edax xps also helps to determine the binding states of the elements with a membrane matrix the superficial changes of the membrane surface are analyzed with afm and it also provides a qualitative measure of the roughness of

12023,groundwater arsenic contamination is a serious concern in many countries around the globe because of the noxious impacts of arsenic on human health in nepal contamination has seriously affected many districts of terai region leading to significantly increased risks of cancer and mass poisoning whilst many technologies have been available to remove arsenic from contaminated water the kanchan arsenic filter kaf still stands ahead in terms of efficiency affordability operation and maintenance however some recent studies have revealed poor performance of kaf and highlighted the need to improve performance this paper proposes a slight modification in kaf design with integration of a human hair layer and the replacement of iron nails in the system with iron mesh the authors reviewed the potential adsorption mechanisms and suitability of a hair layer on integration to existing arsenic removal filter hair contains a large quantity of keratin protein containing sulfhydryl amino acid cysteine which has a strong binding affinity for as iii this review suggests that such a modification to the kaf filter could be effective but further experimental evidence is required graphical abstract image 1 keywords adsorption arsenic removal cysteine groundwater hair layer iron mesh keratin 1 introduction arsenic as is one of the naturally occurring significant heavy metals which has been listed in as a class 1 carcinogen by the international agency of research on cancer iarc bakhat et al 2019 iarc 2004 arsenic is found in all the significant heavy metals in nature and existed in four different oxidation states v iii 0 and iii however the inorganic forms of as in the trivalent state iii and pentavalent state v are most common in groundwater in wide range of ph and are more malignant than organic forms shankar and shanker 2014 arsenic exists in both oxidizing as well as reducing conditions and commonly present in groundwater of ph 6 5 ph 8 5 thakur et al 2011 arsenic can be found in high concentrations in groundwater in many areas and is particularly prevalent in north and south america africa central south and southeast parts of asia jianmin et al 2015 singh and vedwan 2015 podgorski and berg 2020 the countries of central asia such as kazakhstan mangolia and uzbekistan etc and south east asian countries such as bangladesh nepal myanmar pakistan vietnam lao people s democratic republic cambodia china etc are exposed to increased arsenic hazards mukherjee et al 2006 jianmin et al 2015 podgorski and berg 2020 bundschuh et al 2020 more than 150 million individuals are estimated to be at potential threat from groundwater as contamination and more than 700 000 individuals have already suffered from as related diseases in these areas rahman et al 2009 shankar and shanker 2014 abiye and bhattacharya 2019 more than 45 million people residing in the developing nations from asia are exposed to as contamination at concentrations higher than 50 ppb which is maximum allowable concentration in drinking water in numerous countries in asia rahman et al 2009 shankar and shanker 2014 abiye and bhattacharya 2019 a recent study by podgorski and berg 2020 estimates that 94 to 220 million people are possibly at risk to high groundwater as concentration the majority of which are people 94 from asia nepal is one of the developing nations from asia greatly impacted by as contamination in groundwater and so this study focuses on arsenic removal filters commonly used in nepal a large number of people residing on terai region rely on groundwater for domestic and agricultural uses haque et al 2020 thakur et al 2011 reported in their study that out of the total population 28 58 million of nepal in 2011 about 2 29 million access drinking water where the as concentration is 10 50 ppb and 0 37 million where the concentration is 50 ppb the who standard 10 ppb is considered the safe limit for as in drinking water while majority of asian countries including nepal s ndwqs nepal drinking water quality standard uses 50 ppb as the safe limit because of the natural high levels and the problems associated with removal according to census report of nepal 2011 nearly 50 people of nepal reside on terai region and about 90 of them rely on groundwater source for drinking purposes but most of the sources have microbial and as contamination arsenic contamination has predominately affected several terai districts of nepal such as rupandehi nawalparasi rautahat dhanusa bara parsa banke bardiya kailali kanchanpur shrestha et al 2003 census report 2011 2019 likewise other districts of terai region also contain as above the safe limit the overview on status of groundwater as contamination in several terai districts of nepal table 1 documented with maximum arsenic concentration of 2620 ppb in rupendehi district of the several geogenic contaminants as is directly related to geochemical processes such as mineralization of rocks several hypotheses have been proposed to explain its release in groundwater one of the suggested mechanisms for as discharge in the terai region of nepal is the presence of high concentrations of bicarbonate ions which form complexes with manganese hydroxides or iron that are plenteous in the soil resulting in increased dissolution of parent rock materials however there are other mechanisms for as discharge in groundwater that includes pyrite oxidation hydro chemical ores deposition ion displacement caused by phosphate microbe related reduction and mobilized through the sporadic sandy aquifer thakur et al 2011 abiye and bhattacharya 2019 nghiem et al 2019 huq et al 2020 khan et al 2020 bundschuh et al 2020 morales simfors et al 2020 since the terai region of nepal is a flat alluvial stretch which is located between himalayan foothills and the gangetic deltaic plain fig 1 reductive dissolution of naturally occurring as containing minerals more than 200 including oxides pyrites silicates sulfosalts arsenides etc might be another major possible cause of release into groundwater also reductive dissolution of iron oxides are the major causes of release of as from aquifer sediments shankar and shanker 2014 abiye and bhattacharya 2019 and further groundwater as is predominately related with sedimentary facies acquired from the large rivers of nepal i e the narayani gandaki that carry sedimentary materials eroded from the basement rocks of upper himalaya diwakar et al 2015 the arsenic existing in sediments and groundwater in this region originates from erosion of mountains of the greater himalaya and sedimented over several millennia the tectonic activity in the himalaya region also helps generate groundwater as in low lying areas subsequently transported by rivers paudel et al 2018 bundschuh et al 2020 frequent erosion has led to release the rock forming minerals including those containing as to hydrosphere oxides of iron which can form coatings on the surface of silt and clay particles are capable of scavenging binding as from groundwater in fact the movement of as through river systems is often associated with the occurrence and deposition of iron oxide coatings on particle surfaces ngai and walewijk 2003 luzi et al 2004 taloor et al 2020 exposure to as contaminated drinking water has detrimental health impacts biswas et al 2018 on communities hence various mitigation approaches are used to reduce exposure short term mitigation includes the use of various filters to remove as from the contaminated water whilst long term mitigation would make use of alternative sources of water among the short term mitigation approaches various filters are popular in asian context and the kanchan arsenic filter kaf is popular in nepal mostly in the terai region mainly due to affordability efficiency and availability of materials for the filter design a well maintained and quality controlled kaf initially produces the water within ndqws range however because of improper quality control breakage or leaks lowered capacity of iron nails in supplying ferric hydroxide fe oh 3 to water due to overuse or higher initial as concentration the effluent is often not within the safe limit ngai et al 2007 ogata et al 2020a on the other hand as iii which is ten times more harmful than as v is difficult to be removed by kaf wasiuddin et al 2002 a study on efficacy of as filtration by kaf singh et al 2014 found low efficacy of kaf in reducing contaminated influent to the safe level as per ndwqs under in situ conditions a recent study by ogata et al 2020a reported that an average as removal rate of 75 and that 38 of the selected samples did not meet the limit of ndqws likewise e coli removal rate was 85 but 43 of water samples were not within ndqws limits moreover at 80 removal rate kafs did not lessen the as level below the required limit whenever the initial concentration was greater than about 250 ppb the inefficiency in current kaf invites a sever health risk to communities consuming contaminated source water particularly if they believe that the kaf process has made the water safe the low e coli removal is a further problem when water borne diseases such as dysentery and diarrhea are considered singh et al 2014 thus the modification of kaf to enhance the removal capacity is very crucial integration of two kafs in series might be a possible solution but implementation is quite difficult and results in twice the cost of installation and maintenance based on previous research into various aspects of as removal from water this paper proposes some modifications replacement of iron nails by iron mesh and addition of a layer of hair in the existing design of kaf for improvement in removal efficiency more specifically this review aims to improve the effluent quality well below standard limit by the use of iron mesh in place of conventional iron nails in kaf which could also enhance adsorption of as v in significant amount and the additional embedded hair layer in the filter could also help increase removal of particularly as iii and other heavy metals that cannot be easily removed by the current filter in this review the authors shed light on possibility of future research direction on hair based arsenic removal through the modified filter 2 review of fundamental science 2 1 chemistry and toxicity of arsenic arsenic exists as a wide range of organic and inorganic compounds and there are two oxidation states which impact the chemistry arsenite or as iii and arsenate as v inorganic forms include oxides hydrides sulfides phosphates and halides common organic forms include methyl and dimethyl compounds namely monomethylarsonous acid mma iii monomethylarsonic acid mma v dimethylarsonous acid dma iii dimethylarsonic acid dma v the aqueous speciation of inorganic arsenic affects the overall mobility of arsenic in the environment as well as its bioavailability and toxicity in the ph range 4 9 as v species are negatively charged oxyanions aso4 3 haso4 2 and h2aso4 and as iii uncharged as h3aso3 hence as v can react with positively charged surfaces such as fe oxide containing minerals such as goethite clays and al oxides under more alkaline conditions as iii oxyanions aso3 3 haso3 2 and h2aso3 have an affinity for fe iii hydroxides and oxyhydroxides at higher soil redox level 500 200 mv arsenic solubility is low and tends to exist as as v under moderate redox conditions 0 100 mv dissolution of iron oxy hydroxides control as solubility as as v is co precipitated with iron oxy hydroxides inorganic forms of as are more toxic than organic forms and as iii is generally considered more toxic than as v mma v and dma v however the methylated as species in trivalent form mma iii and dma iii are capable of causing dna breakdown the toxicity of as species follows the order arsenite arsenate mono methylarsenate mma dimethylarsenate dma elemental arsenic vaclavikova et al 2008 zakhar 2018 arsenic is a well known carcinogen having potential of causing cancers at multiple organs eminently in the skin prostate liver lungs kidneys and bladder in addition to being carcinogenic it also causes non carcinogenic health disorders such as respiratory problems hypertension weakness anemia cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders neurological cerebrovascular and immunological problems diabetes hepatopathy etc zakhar 2018 ahmad and khan 2015 generally the first chronic symptoms after prolonged exposure to as include skin ailments like hypopigmentation appearance of white spots on skin hyperpigmentation advents of dark spots on skin and keratosis breaking of the skin on hands and feet excessive intake of inorganic as from food and drinking water for 5 10 years causes arsenicosis which includes health problems such as skin cancers internal cancer vascular diseases of feet and legs reproductive disorders diabetes increase in blood pressure etc ten or more years of exposure leads to skin cancer or cardiovascular and nervous affections past studies reported that 15 30 years of exposure of as leads to lungs kidney or bladder cancer luzi et al 2004 abernathy and morgan 2001 abdul et al 2015 shankar and shanker 2014 zakhar 2018 besides physical harm several mental social as well as psychological hazards and neurotoxicological effects are also reported brinkelet al 2009 tamayo et al 2020 2 2 overview of arsenic removal technologies a range of technologies are employed worldwide to remove as from drinking water these include oxidation coagulation co precipitation adsorption ion exchange membrane filtration and phytoremediation ahmed 2001 zakhar 2018 guo et al 2020 oxidation processes to convert the more toxic as ii to as v are comparatively simple and low cost but are also inefficient as iii can be oxidized using agents such as oxygen ozone hydrogen peroxide free chlorine hypochlorite permanganate and fenton s reagent atmospheric oxygen hypochlorite and permanganate are widely used oxidants in developing countries ahmed 2001 guo et al 2020 coagulation and co precipitation process are also relatively cheap and simple to employ but produce toxic sludge which require treatment before disposal adsorption techniques using activated alumina iron coated sand and ion exchange resin are popular methods and available commercially but they also produce toxic solid waste and require regeneration and replacement of adsorbents periodically and so are higher cost however these methods often fail to meet the current who standards and removal of as iii is more troublesome ahmed 2001 vaclavikova et al 2008 zakhar 2018 filtration methods such as reverse osmosis electrodialysis and nano filtration are pressure driven techniques and have capacity to remove almost all kinds of dissolved species and particles including forms of as iii as v they are well defined techniques having high removal efficiency however they are high capital high energy processes that require sophisticated plant and maintenance in addition influent water must be free of suspended solids to avoid issues with fouling removal of as is more efficient as as v so oxidation is often required but most membranes cannot withstand oxidizing agents ahmed 2001 choong et al 2007 vaclavikova et al 2008 zakhar 2018 given the magnitude of the problem there is a great need to develop low cost and effective methods to treat as contaminated groundwater in regard to cost efficiency factors sorption methods based on iron compounds and aluminum compounds are widely used these could be further modified to meet the desired standards an appropriate filter should be efficient economical socially adequate locally accessible convenient to use and use minimum or no chemicals further in context of terai region of nepal the filter should have rural focus and must have simple design and be easily produced and maintained household filters should expel as as well as iron from water and be very straightforward to operate luzi et al 2004 vaclavikova et al 2008 xu et al 2002 the 3 kolshi filter 2 kolshi filter jerry can system and kanchan arsenic filter kaf proposed by several organizations turned out to be reasonably suitable for as removal in rural terai of nepal 3 kolshi which was developed initially by sono diagnostic centre in bangladesh comprises of three clay pots that are piled up vertically containing a combination of sand charcoal and iron turnings or nails in which adsorption onto the surface of the iron component is the major removal mechanism for as the 2 kolshi system originated in south asia removes as through a process of co precipitation and filtration it consists of a 20 l plastic bucket with a filtration unit consisting of two ceramic pots containing chemical packets which contain ferric chloride fecl3 as coagulant and calcium hypochlorite ca ocl 2 as oxidant and disinfectant while charcoal powder acts as adsorbent the jerry can system developed at the university of colorado in denver uses sorption and decantation mechanisms that combine the adsorption precipitation and sedimentation techniques and similar to the 3 kolshi system it uses iron filings nails or similar for as removal the kaf is a modified bio sand filter which was developed by mit enpho team consists of a plastic or concrete container that is filled with gravel sand and rusty iron nails for as adsorption shrestha et al 2003 ngai et al 2007 hayder et al 2018 a pilot study ngai et al 2007 of 3 kolshi 2 kolshi and kaf methods revealed table 2 that as removal was similar for the 3 kolshi filter 90 99 and kaf 88 95 and slightly lower for the 2 kolshi filter 80 95 iron removal was satisfactory for all the filters pathogen removal was generally higher for the 2 kolshi system 93 99 than for kaf 60 99 table 2 3 kolshi filters were easily clogged and clay pots used were fragile whilst the major challenge for 2 kolshi filters was distribution of chemical coagulant packets in rural areas ngai et al 2007 hayder et al 2018 on the other hand the jerry can system was ineffective for as removal shrestha et al 2003 considering the removal efficiency of coliform as and iron economy of construction and maintenance cost and availability of the materials for construction of the filter it is not surprising that kaf is the most commonly used as removal filter in nepal 2 3 mechanism for arsenic removal a number of studies have revealed that ferric hydroxide fe oh 3 or rust is an excellent adsorbent for as in these filter systems fe ii initially dissolves from the iron source and is quickly oxidized into fe iii which precipitates to form colloidal ferric hydroxide in suspension or accumulated at the surface of sand particles when aqueous as species come in contact with the iron oxides strong surface fe as complexes form which effectively immobilize soluble as species most of the ferric hydroxide particles rust including sorbed as are separated from the water after filtration through the fine sand layer resulting in effective as removal from water ngai 2003 luzi et al 2004 pentavalent arsenic as v and trivalent arsenic as iii forms both outer sphere as well as inner sphere surface complexes with ferric hydroxides fig 2 a e weerasundara et al 2020 rivas et al 2018 these arsenic species are oxyanion contaminants in water which adsorb on the surface of ferric hydroxide resulting stable monodentate and bidentate inner sphere complexes with oh or oh2 groups through oxygen bridges the empty d orbitals present in the transition elements act as lewis acids for the electron rich oxygens of oxyanions hristovski and markovski 2017 rivas et al 2018 further bidentate inner sphere complex of arsenite can be mononuclear or binuclear with ferric oxides and hydroxides some studies documented that the existence of tridentate complexes is also possible at some specific conditions tridentate complexes are quite stable however their formation is slow at working conditions of filter due to high activation barriers of 51 kcal mol and thus requires an activation energy hristovski and markovski 2017 farrell 2017 the stability of thus formed inner sphere complexes depends upon the number of formation of oxygen bridges concentration of surface loading orientation and contiguity of lewis acid sites thermodynamically bidentate complexes are more stable than monodentate complexes which are mainly attributed to the reinforcing effects of the second oxygen bridges despite of bond shear stress therefore inner sphere arsenate bidentate complexes are more prevalent at the environmental conditions of filter ph 6 8 however dominance of these complexes formation is mainly governed by ph redox potential and surface loading conditions of the impurities present in water o reilly et al 2001 hristovski and markovski 2017 rivas et al 2018 weerasundara et al 2020 2 4 working mechanism of kanchan arsenic filter kaf is an award winning and the most commonly used household water filter in nepal developed by massachusetts institute of technology mit civil and environmental engineering department in partnership with environment and public health organization enpho and rural water supply and sanitation support programme rwsssp nepal ngai et al 2006 based on the principle of a bio sand filter it uses an innovative diffuser basin that contains iron nails for removal of as it is designed to simultaneously remove pathogens and arsenic and utilizes locally available materials like plastic containers iron nails pvc pipes sand gravel and brick for construction ngai et al 2006 2007 rust is formed from a source of iron which in these devices is non galvanized iron nails iron filings or mesh and the ferric hydroxide formed acts as the sorbent of as species brick chips are used to reduce the impact of the incoming water from the influent and to spread the water across the iron source material the iron particles loaded with as then pass into the sand layer below since fine sand layer contains very small pores space the arsenic loaded iron particles get confined to few centimeters on the top of the fine sand layer likewise most of the iron particles get trapped on the fine sand layer mainly due to physical straining phenomena in addition to that the pathogens are also removed by the sand filter ngai et al 2006 2007 whilst the kaf process is moderately effective at removing most as species improving the performance without increasing cost or complexity would be of significant value to communities that rely on the filter to decontaminate groundwater we now look at other media that might provide a means to improve the kaf design 2 5 fundamentals of arsenic adsorption on hair hair is rich in fibrous keratin proteins containing cysteine which has a sulfhydryl group of a high binding affinity for as iii species 2 5 1 chemical composition of human hair human hair is a biological polymer with about 88 of its dry weight composed of keratin protein and average chemical composition carbon 45 oxygen 28 nitrogen 15 hydrogen 7 and sulfur 5 shimomura and ito 2005 paswan 2012 keratins are the proteins which are generally found in hair nails feathers claws sheep wool etc the sulfhydryl group containing amino acid cysteine is the distinguishing feature of keratins paswan 2012 moll et al 2008 enkhzaya et al 2017 ogata et al 2020b on average human hair has around 19 cysteine the value ranging from 15 6 to 21 2 wilson and lewis 1927 cysteine has a thiol side chain fig 3 that is nucleophilic and exhibit reactivity readily towards the electrophilic arsenic species morphologically hair contains three regions cuticle cortex and medulla cuticle is a protective layer covering the core of the fibers and is majorly composed of β keratins cortex surrounded by cuticle includes the most voluminous part of human hair and comprises of two main groups of protein low sulfur alpha keratins and high sulfur matrix proteins also known as keratin associated proteins kaps matrix proteins form 20 30 of human hair while alpha proteins comprise 50 60 medullas are the small membrane bound holes inside a cell and may exist in parallel to alpha keratin fiber these cells contribute negligible percentage to the hair mass and hence to the overall protein composition paswan 2012 2 5 2 chemical bonds in hair the keratin proteins insoluble in water comprise of polypeptide chains called the alpha helix alpha helixes are hard fibrous coils made up by the linking of amino acids by peptide bonds the bond is located between the nitrogen atoms of one amino acid to the carbon atom of the next each alpha helix in the keratin protein consists of following bonds hydrogen bond salt bond cysteine bond and sugar bond paswan 2012 the hydrogen bond is the weak bond located between the coils of the alpha helix and are easily formed as well as readily broken these bonds are controlled electrolytically the salt bond is an electrovalent bond located at a point which is parallel to the line of axis of rotation of the helix of hair it is formed by the transport of electron from the side chain of basic amino group to the side chain of amino acid acidic the cysteine bond is the disulfide bond formed by cross linking of cysteine residues of the polypeptide chains and is located between polypeptide chains always formed perpendicular to the hair axis the sugar bond is also formed perpendicular to the hair axis and is formed between the side chains of acidic amino group to the amino acid having oh group paswan 2012 2 5 3 arsenic adsorption in hair every cysteine molecule in keratin protein consists of a combination of hydrophobic carbon chain and a hydrophilic head group of polar amino acid resulting in an amphiphilic structure which confers these molecules with their high surface activity makavipour et al 2019 as iii has a tendency to bind to the sulfhydryl sh groups of cysteine present in peptides and proteins khosa et al 2013 shen et al 2013 hughes 2002 cysteine thiolates in the hair are the major binding ligands for arsenite shen et al 2013 and the unique chemistry of thiol r sh groups or thiolates present in cysteine have high affinity to metal binding thiol groups r sh are subject to deprotonation loss of h to form the charged thiolate groups r s which replace the oh groups present in as species poole 2015 each arsenite as iii couples to three cysteine residues while mma3 links to two and dma3 binds to one shen et al 2013 li et al 2013 the possible reaction mechanisms for binding of inorganic arsenite as iii mma iii and dma iii to cysteine in proteins are illustrated in fig 4 three hydroxyl groups oh in arsenite are replaced by thiolate groups of cysteine and two cysteine bonds are formed between three cysteine species after binding to as iii meanwhile two hydroxyl groups from mma are replaced by thiolates and a cysteine bond is formed between two cysteine species also a hydroxyl group of dma gets replaced by thiolates of cysteine group thus adequate cysteine content is required for binding of arsenite with peptides which should be provided by the hair layer integrated into the filters 3 proposed modified arsenic removal filter integration of a hair layer may increase overall performance of the kaf particularly with respect to removing as and some heavy metals and with minimal addition of cost other toxic metals such as aluminium cadmium copper lead and zinc are also found to be absorbed by human hair and so addition of a hair matrix has the capacity to improve overall kaf performance wilhelm et al 1989 zhang et al 2020 also static tests on as adsorption by human hair demonstrate the high adsorption capacity of hair for as and dynamic tests have demonstrated the feasibility of adsorption in a packed bed column wasiuddin et al 2002 the hair layer is proposed to be integrated at the layer between coarse sand and gravel layers because most as is removed by the iron mesh and sand layers leaving relatively lower concentration of as v unabsorbed as iii and other heavy metals fig 5 furthermore the thickness of hair on one side should be slightly larger than the other side making inclined surface on upper as well as lower layer of hair refer to fig 5 thus acquired slope in hair layer assists to increase the time of contact of as with the hair layer thus increasing the adsorption capacity however it depends on the findings of detailed technical and feasibility study which is essential before the proposed configuration in the filter come into practice because iron is responsible for most of the as v removal banerji et al 2019 it is likely that increasing the relative amount of iron oxide hydroxide surface will improve the removal a recent study on low cost as treatment by hayder et al 2018 demonstrated that iron mesh gives the highest removal efficiency for as compared to iron slags and nails because of the higher relative surface area of the mesh material the study revealed that the removal efficiency for iron mesh 88 was much higher than iron nails 50 over a period of one week the long term efficiency for iron mesh 99 90 was also greater than that for iron nails 98 94 hayder et al 2018 although as v can be very efficiently removed using iron substrates as iii which is not sufficiently oxidized to as v is more problematic and a more suitable substrate is required such as hair as discussed above when required on a large scale as removal could be achieved using a hair layer integrated with the bio sand multistage filter fig 6 the combination of a hair layer and iron mesh in a bio sand filter is likely to improve overall filter performance for community use a detailed feasibility study and performance evaluation of the proposed system is imperative 3 1 operation and maintenance of the proposed arsenic filter the removal of arsenic is likely dependent upon the amount of hair in the filter with higher adsorption favored when the cortex layer of hair is exposed as this contains a higher proportion keratin protein than the cuticle layer cortex layers can be exposed on the cross section of hair by cutting the hair into small pieces size 2 mm 6 mm using scissors the size of cut hair is larger than the fine sand less than 1 mm to prevent the problems of frequent clogging the hair layer of 4 6 cm can be prepared by compressing the cut hair and integrated in the filter by placing on the polyester cloth above gravel layer the layer thickness should be slightly higher on one side than the other maintaining a gentle slope on the hair layer for increasing the contact time of arsenic with hair for adsorption regular maintenance on periodic basis is necessary to ensure that the filter is functioning properly and producing drinking water in compliance with the as maximum allowable limit operation and maintenance activities would consist of both regular scheduled tasks as well as emergency troubleshooting responses the sorbent media iron mesh and hair layer should be cleaned regularly to expose more iron surface for rusting and replaced periodically either on a set frequency or based on monitoring and tracking use it is suggested that the sand should also be replaced annually in order to maintain sorption capacity mueller 2020 the iron mesh should be constantly wet but should not be completely immersed inside water so as to promote rust formation for releasing higher ferric oxides also there should be sufficient contact time between the iron mesh and arsenic which can be achieved by preventing the formation of holes and dents in the iron mesh layer iron particles can be used along with iron mesh if there is chance of formation of holes use of polyester cloth to separate the iron mesh layer and sand layer can facilitate for cleaning of filter moreover the filter should not be exposed to direct sunlight for a long time as the increase in temperature is reported to reduce efficiency of the filter mueller 2020 the replacement schedules of iron mesh sand and gravels should be based on results from pilot scale tests 4 discussion limited research is available to assess the adsorption capacity of as on untreated hair however studies on the adsorption of as by keratin protein extracted from sheep wool modified chicken feathers human hair claws nails etc gault 2008 chowdhury 2000 samanta 2004 spallholz 2005 sanz et al 2007 goswami et al 2020 joardar et al 2020 enkhzaya et al 2017 suggest that keratin protein is an excellent sorbent for as and other heavy metals batch tests of arsenic adsorption onto hair was investigated by wasiuddin et al 2002 and kareer 2011 and the results found are presented in table 3 the studies demonstrated a great potential of hair to strongly retain as particularly at low as concentration maximum adsorption capacity was 12 4 mg kg for an initial arsenic concentration of 360 ppb also the as adsorption using hair within the ph range of 5 5 7 5 depended upon the oxidation state and the amount of hair used wasiuddin et al 2002 breakthrough time recorded by wasiuddin et al 2002 for hair was around 100 min the breakthrough time limit for drinking water is approximately 300 min which demonstrates an outstanding performance of the hair to be an adsorbent substrate in the filter studies using human hair and finger nail as sorbents in the as exposed regions of bihar showed that the average as concentration on hair was 5 5 mg kg range 4 0 8 8 and that in nail was 14 2 mg kg range 6 1 24 0 comparable results were seen in the studies in west bengal where as concentration ranged from 0 17 to 14 39 mg kg in hair and 0 74 36 63 mg kg in nails sanz et al 2007 samanta et al 2004 table 4 the as species distribution in hair sample for as iii as v mma was 75 25 2 and that for nail sample was 60 35 5 the report demonstrated that the as removal in nails was more correlated than as removal in hair except only for as iii and mma in hair sanz et al 2007 in this variation adsorption of as species by hair can meet the current requirement removal of more harmful as iii moreover hair is more available cheaper and more abundant than nails since the test was conducted on previously untreated human hair it also exhibits a great potential on removing as from contaminated water 4 1 arsenic removal issues and enhancement with other heavy metals a report by jica dwss and dwss jica enpho 2016 on performance of kaf in nawalparasi district revealed 83 removal of as for mean value and 75 removal for median value and significantly good removal for pathogens where the untreated raw tube well water had concentration of median value of 60 ppb mean 91 57 ppb and ranging from 0 to 1320 ppb the filtered water had concentration of median value of 10 ppb mean of 25 72 ppb and range 0 590 ppb also the percentage of kafs exceeding who guideline was 38 and exceeding ndwqs guideline was 13 thus recommending the improvement activities to enhance the performance of kaf a study by liang et al 2017 reported that average of 0 127 0 078 mg kg of as in hair was adsorbed with range 0 03 0 87 mg kg table 4 and the published range was 0 015 26 mg kg another study by katz 2019 documented that the as concentration in hair was 1240 610 ppb for exposed environmental condition and as concentration was 60 20 ppb in controlled condition at the equilibrium concentration of 0 35 μg g amount adsorbed was found 1 1 μg g over 6 h and 1 95 μg g over 24 h a research on hair and toe nail as concentration of the people residing in as contaminated area in australia by hindwood et al 2003 determined an average as concentration of 5 52 mg kg where the median as concentration of drinking water was 43 8 ppb likewise mandal et al 2003 observed an average of 7 65 mg kg of as in hair where the as in drinking water had an average as concentration of 190 ppb table 4 if it is feasible to treat hair with na2s and naoh the efficiency of removal can show more remarkable result it is because on treatment with na2s hydrogen bond of the keratins breaks and disulfide bonds disperse also treatment with naoh makes cleavages on disulfide bonds creating more adsorptive sites creating more possibility for bonding with as treated hair should be washed thoroughly before integrating into filter enkhzaya et al 2017 even though the effluent may be above standard limits the concentration is comparatively much lower than that of influent can be reduced well below the who standards when filter is integrated with hair layer and replacement of iron nails by iron mesh further the integration can also be useful in adsorbing excess of as contents in case of the filters are either installed incorrectly or maintained improperly however quality control is highly crucial moreover kaf may not be effective in removing other heavy metals for example chromium cadmium copper zinc lead etc in such cases integration of hair layer in the filter can be an efficacious way to enhance its efficiency in removal of as iii as well as heavy metals economically wilhelm et al 1989 fergusson et al 1991 enkhzaya et al 2017 calderón et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 however exact removal efficiency of the proposed filter should be experimentally verified 4 2 regeneration potential of a modified filter once the hair layer gets saturated after series of adsorption with as it gradually loses capacity for further adsorption of as it then should either be replaced by new hair layer or the saturated hair layer should be treated with chemicals for desorption of as from hair since arsenic protein complexes are sensitive to naoh treatment and alkaline conditions have been investigated to release as from proteins moreover oxidizing the as absorbed hair with concentrated hydrogen peroxide h2o2 at room temperature was observed liberate all the protein bound as species as free pentavalent forms of as shen et al 2013 besides alkaline treatment acidic treatments also have been found to liberate as from protein with the releasing capability of descending order of hno3 h2so4 trichloro acetic acid tca hcl shen et al 2013 5 conclusions and future perspectives arsenic contamination in groundwater is an important health and environmental problem in many parts of terai lowland of nepal and many people of this area are dependent upon groundwater while many technologies have been proposed for water treatment most of them are not practical or cost effective in the context of rural terai of nepal both the static and dynamic tests as documented by past reports have revealed that addition of hair layer and replacement of iron nail with iron mesh could potentially offer an improved solution over the current kaf methods currently in use integration of a hair layer on bio sand filters for large scale filtration might be very beneficial to remove as and also help to eliminate other problem metals such as lead cadmium copper and nickel there is also very strong evidence that replacement of the iron nails with a higher surface area source of iron such as mesh or filings might also lead to improvements in extraction of as species whilst literature evidence suggests that using iron mesh and adding a hair layer to the kaf could offer significant benefits and gains in efficiency there is little understanding of how a modified kaf process would be impacted by parameters such as ph temperature dimension of hair layer and contact time since as changes into different oxidation states depending upon the redox potential ph temperature etc that causes in efficient removal of arsenic from drinking water at the same time moreover removal of arsenic is impacted by the other ions for instance phosphates present in water thus selective removal of as is still challenging nevertheless thiol based adsorption of both form of arsenic thiol present in cysteine of hair can be a good technique for effective removal of as iii and as v from groundwater therefore this review also emphasizes further research on hair cysteine thiol based arsenic removal method which could significantly improve the selective removal of arsenic from drinking water and could help decrease the load on adsorbent too moreover detailed study to verify the efficacy of these proposed changes to kaf and effects of various operational and environmental factors is essential declaration of competing

12023,groundwater arsenic contamination is a serious concern in many countries around the globe because of the noxious impacts of arsenic on human health in nepal contamination has seriously affected many districts of terai region leading to significantly increased risks of cancer and mass poisoning whilst many technologies have been available to remove arsenic from contaminated water the kanchan arsenic filter kaf still stands ahead in terms of efficiency affordability operation and maintenance however some recent studies have revealed poor performance of kaf and highlighted the need to improve performance this paper proposes a slight modification in kaf design with integration of a human hair layer and the replacement of iron nails in the system with iron mesh the authors reviewed the potential adsorption mechanisms and suitability of a hair layer on integration to existing arsenic removal filter hair contains a large quantity of keratin protein containing sulfhydryl amino acid cysteine which has a strong binding affinity for as iii this review suggests that such a modification to the kaf filter could be effective but further experimental evidence is required graphical abstract image 1 keywords adsorption arsenic removal cysteine groundwater hair layer iron mesh keratin 1 introduction arsenic as is one of the naturally occurring significant heavy metals which has been listed in as a class 1 carcinogen by the international agency of research on cancer iarc bakhat et al 2019 iarc 2004 arsenic is found in all the significant heavy metals in nature and existed in four different oxidation states v iii 0 and iii however the inorganic forms of as in the trivalent state iii and pentavalent state v are most common in groundwater in wide range of ph and are more malignant than organic forms shankar and shanker 2014 arsenic exists in both oxidizing as well as reducing conditions and commonly present in groundwater of ph 6 5 ph 8 5 thakur et al 2011 arsenic can be found in high concentrations in groundwater in many areas and is particularly prevalent in north and south america africa central south and southeast parts of asia jianmin et al 2015 singh and vedwan 2015 podgorski and berg 2020 the countries of central asia such as kazakhstan mangolia and uzbekistan etc and south east asian countries such as bangladesh nepal myanmar pakistan vietnam lao people s democratic republic cambodia china etc are exposed to increased arsenic hazards mukherjee et al 2006 jianmin et al 2015 podgorski and berg 2020 bundschuh et al 2020 more than 150 million individuals are estimated to be at potential threat from groundwater as contamination and more than 700 000 individuals have already suffered from as related diseases in these areas rahman et al 2009 shankar and shanker 2014 abiye and bhattacharya 2019 more than 45 million people residing in the developing nations from asia are exposed to as contamination at concentrations higher than 50 ppb which is maximum allowable concentration in drinking water in numerous countries in asia rahman et al 2009 shankar and shanker 2014 abiye and bhattacharya 2019 a recent study by podgorski and berg 2020 estimates that 94 to 220 million people are possibly at risk to high groundwater as concentration the majority of which are people 94 from asia nepal is one of the developing nations from asia greatly impacted by as contamination in groundwater and so this study focuses on arsenic removal filters commonly used in nepal a large number of people residing on terai region rely on groundwater for domestic and agricultural uses haque et al 2020 thakur et al 2011 reported in their study that out of the total population 28 58 million of nepal in 2011 about 2 29 million access drinking water where the as concentration is 10 50 ppb and 0 37 million where the concentration is 50 ppb the who standard 10 ppb is considered the safe limit for as in drinking water while majority of asian countries including nepal s ndwqs nepal drinking water quality standard uses 50 ppb as the safe limit because of the natural high levels and the problems associated with removal according to census report of nepal 2011 nearly 50 people of nepal reside on terai region and about 90 of them rely on groundwater source for drinking purposes but most of the sources have microbial and as contamination arsenic contamination has predominately affected several terai districts of nepal such as rupandehi nawalparasi rautahat dhanusa bara parsa banke bardiya kailali kanchanpur shrestha et al 2003 census report 2011 2019 likewise other districts of terai region also contain as above the safe limit the overview on status of groundwater as contamination in several terai districts of nepal table 1 documented with maximum arsenic concentration of 2620 ppb in rupendehi district of the several geogenic contaminants as is directly related to geochemical processes such as mineralization of rocks several hypotheses have been proposed to explain its release in groundwater one of the suggested mechanisms for as discharge in the terai region of nepal is the presence of high concentrations of bicarbonate ions which form complexes with manganese hydroxides or iron that are plenteous in the soil resulting in increased dissolution of parent rock materials however there are other mechanisms for as discharge in groundwater that includes pyrite oxidation hydro chemical ores deposition ion displacement caused by phosphate microbe related reduction and mobilized through the sporadic sandy aquifer thakur et al 2011 abiye and bhattacharya 2019 nghiem et al 2019 huq et al 2020 khan et al 2020 bundschuh et al 2020 morales simfors et al 2020 since the terai region of nepal is a flat alluvial stretch which is located between himalayan foothills and the gangetic deltaic plain fig 1 reductive dissolution of naturally occurring as containing minerals more than 200 including oxides pyrites silicates sulfosalts arsenides etc might be another major possible cause of release into groundwater also reductive dissolution of iron oxides are the major causes of release of as from aquifer sediments shankar and shanker 2014 abiye and bhattacharya 2019 and further groundwater as is predominately related with sedimentary facies acquired from the large rivers of nepal i e the narayani gandaki that carry sedimentary materials eroded from the basement rocks of upper himalaya diwakar et al 2015 the arsenic existing in sediments and groundwater in this region originates from erosion of mountains of the greater himalaya and sedimented over several millennia the tectonic activity in the himalaya region also helps generate groundwater as in low lying areas subsequently transported by rivers paudel et al 2018 bundschuh et al 2020 frequent erosion has led to release the rock forming minerals including those containing as to hydrosphere oxides of iron which can form coatings on the surface of silt and clay particles are capable of scavenging binding as from groundwater in fact the movement of as through river systems is often associated with the occurrence and deposition of iron oxide coatings on particle surfaces ngai and walewijk 2003 luzi et al 2004 taloor et al 2020 exposure to as contaminated drinking water has detrimental health impacts biswas et al 2018 on communities hence various mitigation approaches are used to reduce exposure short term mitigation includes the use of various filters to remove as from the contaminated water whilst long term mitigation would make use of alternative sources of water among the short term mitigation approaches various filters are popular in asian context and the kanchan arsenic filter kaf is popular in nepal mostly in the terai region mainly due to affordability efficiency and availability of materials for the filter design a well maintained and quality controlled kaf initially produces the water within ndqws range however because of improper quality control breakage or leaks lowered capacity of iron nails in supplying ferric hydroxide fe oh 3 to water due to overuse or higher initial as concentration the effluent is often not within the safe limit ngai et al 2007 ogata et al 2020a on the other hand as iii which is ten times more harmful than as v is difficult to be removed by kaf wasiuddin et al 2002 a study on efficacy of as filtration by kaf singh et al 2014 found low efficacy of kaf in reducing contaminated influent to the safe level as per ndwqs under in situ conditions a recent study by ogata et al 2020a reported that an average as removal rate of 75 and that 38 of the selected samples did not meet the limit of ndqws likewise e coli removal rate was 85 but 43 of water samples were not within ndqws limits moreover at 80 removal rate kafs did not lessen the as level below the required limit whenever the initial concentration was greater than about 250 ppb the inefficiency in current kaf invites a sever health risk to communities consuming contaminated source water particularly if they believe that the kaf process has made the water safe the low e coli removal is a further problem when water borne diseases such as dysentery and diarrhea are considered singh et al 2014 thus the modification of kaf to enhance the removal capacity is very crucial integration of two kafs in series might be a possible solution but implementation is quite difficult and results in twice the cost of installation and maintenance based on previous research into various aspects of as removal from water this paper proposes some modifications replacement of iron nails by iron mesh and addition of a layer of hair in the existing design of kaf for improvement in removal efficiency more specifically this review aims to improve the effluent quality well below standard limit by the use of iron mesh in place of conventional iron nails in kaf which could also enhance adsorption of as v in significant amount and the additional embedded hair layer in the filter could also help increase removal of particularly as iii and other heavy metals that cannot be easily removed by the current filter in this review the authors shed light on possibility of future research direction on hair based arsenic removal through the modified filter 2 review of fundamental science 2 1 chemistry and toxicity of arsenic arsenic exists as a wide range of organic and inorganic compounds and there are two oxidation states which impact the chemistry arsenite or as iii and arsenate as v inorganic forms include oxides hydrides sulfides phosphates and halides common organic forms include methyl and dimethyl compounds namely monomethylarsonous acid mma iii monomethylarsonic acid mma v dimethylarsonous acid dma iii dimethylarsonic acid dma v the aqueous speciation of inorganic arsenic affects the overall mobility of arsenic in the environment as well as its bioavailability and toxicity in the ph range 4 9 as v species are negatively charged oxyanions aso4 3 haso4 2 and h2aso4 and as iii uncharged as h3aso3 hence as v can react with positively charged surfaces such as fe oxide containing minerals such as goethite clays and al oxides under more alkaline conditions as iii oxyanions aso3 3 haso3 2 and h2aso3 have an affinity for fe iii hydroxides and oxyhydroxides at higher soil redox level 500 200 mv arsenic solubility is low and tends to exist as as v under moderate redox conditions 0 100 mv dissolution of iron oxy hydroxides control as solubility as as v is co precipitated with iron oxy hydroxides inorganic forms of as are more toxic than organic forms and as iii is generally considered more toxic than as v mma v and dma v however the methylated as species in trivalent form mma iii and dma iii are capable of causing dna breakdown the toxicity of as species follows the order arsenite arsenate mono methylarsenate mma dimethylarsenate dma elemental arsenic vaclavikova et al 2008 zakhar 2018 arsenic is a well known carcinogen having potential of causing cancers at multiple organs eminently in the skin prostate liver lungs kidneys and bladder in addition to being carcinogenic it also causes non carcinogenic health disorders such as respiratory problems hypertension weakness anemia cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders neurological cerebrovascular and immunological problems diabetes hepatopathy etc zakhar 2018 ahmad and khan 2015 generally the first chronic symptoms after prolonged exposure to as include skin ailments like hypopigmentation appearance of white spots on skin hyperpigmentation advents of dark spots on skin and keratosis breaking of the skin on hands and feet excessive intake of inorganic as from food and drinking water for 5 10 years causes arsenicosis which includes health problems such as skin cancers internal cancer vascular diseases of feet and legs reproductive disorders diabetes increase in blood pressure etc ten or more years of exposure leads to skin cancer or cardiovascular and nervous affections past studies reported that 15 30 years of exposure of as leads to lungs kidney or bladder cancer luzi et al 2004 abernathy and morgan 2001 abdul et al 2015 shankar and shanker 2014 zakhar 2018 besides physical harm several mental social as well as psychological hazards and neurotoxicological effects are also reported brinkelet al 2009 tamayo et al 2020 2 2 overview of arsenic removal technologies a range of technologies are employed worldwide to remove as from drinking water these include oxidation coagulation co precipitation adsorption ion exchange membrane filtration and phytoremediation ahmed 2001 zakhar 2018 guo et al 2020 oxidation processes to convert the more toxic as ii to as v are comparatively simple and low cost but are also inefficient as iii can be oxidized using agents such as oxygen ozone hydrogen peroxide free chlorine hypochlorite permanganate and fenton s reagent atmospheric oxygen hypochlorite and permanganate are widely used oxidants in developing countries ahmed 2001 guo et al 2020 coagulation and co precipitation process are also relatively cheap and simple to employ but produce toxic sludge which require treatment before disposal adsorption techniques using activated alumina iron coated sand and ion exchange resin are popular methods and available commercially but they also produce toxic solid waste and require regeneration and replacement of adsorbents periodically and so are higher cost however these methods often fail to meet the current who standards and removal of as iii is more troublesome ahmed 2001 vaclavikova et al 2008 zakhar 2018 filtration methods such as reverse osmosis electrodialysis and nano filtration are pressure driven techniques and have capacity to remove almost all kinds of dissolved species and particles including forms of as iii as v they are well defined techniques having high removal efficiency however they are high capital high energy processes that require sophisticated plant and maintenance in addition influent water must be free of suspended solids to avoid issues with fouling removal of as is more efficient as as v so oxidation is often required but most membranes cannot withstand oxidizing agents ahmed 2001 choong et al 2007 vaclavikova et al 2008 zakhar 2018 given the magnitude of the problem there is a great need to develop low cost and effective methods to treat as contaminated groundwater in regard to cost efficiency factors sorption methods based on iron compounds and aluminum compounds are widely used these could be further modified to meet the desired standards an appropriate filter should be efficient economical socially adequate locally accessible convenient to use and use minimum or no chemicals further in context of terai region of nepal the filter should have rural focus and must have simple design and be easily produced and maintained household filters should expel as as well as iron from water and be very straightforward to operate luzi et al 2004 vaclavikova et al 2008 xu et al 2002 the 3 kolshi filter 2 kolshi filter jerry can system and kanchan arsenic filter kaf proposed by several organizations turned out to be reasonably suitable for as removal in rural terai of nepal 3 kolshi which was developed initially by sono diagnostic centre in bangladesh comprises of three clay pots that are piled up vertically containing a combination of sand charcoal and iron turnings or nails in which adsorption onto the surface of the iron component is the major removal mechanism for as the 2 kolshi system originated in south asia removes as through a process of co precipitation and filtration it consists of a 20 l plastic bucket with a filtration unit consisting of two ceramic pots containing chemical packets which contain ferric chloride fecl3 as coagulant and calcium hypochlorite ca ocl 2 as oxidant and disinfectant while charcoal powder acts as adsorbent the jerry can system developed at the university of colorado in denver uses sorption and decantation mechanisms that combine the adsorption precipitation and sedimentation techniques and similar to the 3 kolshi system it uses iron filings nails or similar for as removal the kaf is a modified bio sand filter which was developed by mit enpho team consists of a plastic or concrete container that is filled with gravel sand and rusty iron nails for as adsorption shrestha et al 2003 ngai et al 2007 hayder et al 2018 a pilot study ngai et al 2007 of 3 kolshi 2 kolshi and kaf methods revealed table 2 that as removal was similar for the 3 kolshi filter 90 99 and kaf 88 95 and slightly lower for the 2 kolshi filter 80 95 iron removal was satisfactory for all the filters pathogen removal was generally higher for the 2 kolshi system 93 99 than for kaf 60 99 table 2 3 kolshi filters were easily clogged and clay pots used were fragile whilst the major challenge for 2 kolshi filters was distribution of chemical coagulant packets in rural areas ngai et al 2007 hayder et al 2018 on the other hand the jerry can system was ineffective for as removal shrestha et al 2003 considering the removal efficiency of coliform as and iron economy of construction and maintenance cost and availability of the materials for construction of the filter it is not surprising that kaf is the most commonly used as removal filter in nepal 2 3 mechanism for arsenic removal a number of studies have revealed that ferric hydroxide fe oh 3 or rust is an excellent adsorbent for as in these filter systems fe ii initially dissolves from the iron source and is quickly oxidized into fe iii which precipitates to form colloidal ferric hydroxide in suspension or accumulated at the surface of sand particles when aqueous as species come in contact with the iron oxides strong surface fe as complexes form which effectively immobilize soluble as species most of the ferric hydroxide particles rust including sorbed as are separated from the water after filtration through the fine sand layer resulting in effective as removal from water ngai 2003 luzi et al 2004 pentavalent arsenic as v and trivalent arsenic as iii forms both outer sphere as well as inner sphere surface complexes with ferric hydroxides fig 2 a e weerasundara et al 2020 rivas et al 2018 these arsenic species are oxyanion contaminants in water which adsorb on the surface of ferric hydroxide resulting stable monodentate and bidentate inner sphere complexes with oh or oh2 groups through oxygen bridges the empty d orbitals present in the transition elements act as lewis acids for the electron rich oxygens of oxyanions hristovski and markovski 2017 rivas et al 2018 further bidentate inner sphere complex of arsenite can be mononuclear or binuclear with ferric oxides and hydroxides some studies documented that the existence of tridentate complexes is also possible at some specific conditions tridentate complexes are quite stable however their formation is slow at working conditions of filter due to high activation barriers of 51 kcal mol and thus requires an activation energy hristovski and markovski 2017 farrell 2017 the stability of thus formed inner sphere complexes depends upon the number of formation of oxygen bridges concentration of surface loading orientation and contiguity of lewis acid sites thermodynamically bidentate complexes are more stable than monodentate complexes which are mainly attributed to the reinforcing effects of the second oxygen bridges despite of bond shear stress therefore inner sphere arsenate bidentate complexes are more prevalent at the environmental conditions of filter ph 6 8 however dominance of these complexes formation is mainly governed by ph redox potential and surface loading conditions of the impurities present in water o reilly et al 2001 hristovski and markovski 2017 rivas et al 2018 weerasundara et al 2020 2 4 working mechanism of kanchan arsenic filter kaf is an award winning and the most commonly used household water filter in nepal developed by massachusetts institute of technology mit civil and environmental engineering department in partnership with environment and public health organization enpho and rural water supply and sanitation support programme rwsssp nepal ngai et al 2006 based on the principle of a bio sand filter it uses an innovative diffuser basin that contains iron nails for removal of as it is designed to simultaneously remove pathogens and arsenic and utilizes locally available materials like plastic containers iron nails pvc pipes sand gravel and brick for construction ngai et al 2006 2007 rust is formed from a source of iron which in these devices is non galvanized iron nails iron filings or mesh and the ferric hydroxide formed acts as the sorbent of as species brick chips are used to reduce the impact of the incoming water from the influent and to spread the water across the iron source material the iron particles loaded with as then pass into the sand layer below since fine sand layer contains very small pores space the arsenic loaded iron particles get confined to few centimeters on the top of the fine sand layer likewise most of the iron particles get trapped on the fine sand layer mainly due to physical straining phenomena in addition to that the pathogens are also removed by the sand filter ngai et al 2006 2007 whilst the kaf process is moderately effective at removing most as species improving the performance without increasing cost or complexity would be of significant value to communities that rely on the filter to decontaminate groundwater we now look at other media that might provide a means to improve the kaf design 2 5 fundamentals of arsenic adsorption on hair hair is rich in fibrous keratin proteins containing cysteine which has a sulfhydryl group of a high binding affinity for as iii species 2 5 1 chemical composition of human hair human hair is a biological polymer with about 88 of its dry weight composed of keratin protein and average chemical composition carbon 45 oxygen 28 nitrogen 15 hydrogen 7 and sulfur 5 shimomura and ito 2005 paswan 2012 keratins are the proteins which are generally found in hair nails feathers claws sheep wool etc the sulfhydryl group containing amino acid cysteine is the distinguishing feature of keratins paswan 2012 moll et al 2008 enkhzaya et al 2017 ogata et al 2020b on average human hair has around 19 cysteine the value ranging from 15 6 to 21 2 wilson and lewis 1927 cysteine has a thiol side chain fig 3 that is nucleophilic and exhibit reactivity readily towards the electrophilic arsenic species morphologically hair contains three regions cuticle cortex and medulla cuticle is a protective layer covering the core of the fibers and is majorly composed of β keratins cortex surrounded by cuticle includes the most voluminous part of human hair and comprises of two main groups of protein low sulfur alpha keratins and high sulfur matrix proteins also known as keratin associated proteins kaps matrix proteins form 20 30 of human hair while alpha proteins comprise 50 60 medullas are the small membrane bound holes inside a cell and may exist in parallel to alpha keratin fiber these cells contribute negligible percentage to the hair mass and hence to the overall protein composition paswan 2012 2 5 2 chemical bonds in hair the keratin proteins insoluble in water comprise of polypeptide chains called the alpha helix alpha helixes are hard fibrous coils made up by the linking of amino acids by peptide bonds the bond is located between the nitrogen atoms of one amino acid to the carbon atom of the next each alpha helix in the keratin protein consists of following bonds hydrogen bond salt bond cysteine bond and sugar bond paswan 2012 the hydrogen bond is the weak bond located between the coils of the alpha helix and are easily formed as well as readily broken these bonds are controlled electrolytically the salt bond is an electrovalent bond located at a point which is parallel to the line of axis of rotation of the helix of hair it is formed by the transport of electron from the side chain of basic amino group to the side chain of amino acid acidic the cysteine bond is the disulfide bond formed by cross linking of cysteine residues of the polypeptide chains and is located between polypeptide chains always formed perpendicular to the hair axis the sugar bond is also formed perpendicular to the hair axis and is formed between the side chains of acidic amino group to the amino acid having oh group paswan 2012 2 5 3 arsenic adsorption in hair every cysteine molecule in keratin protein consists of a combination of hydrophobic carbon chain and a hydrophilic head group of polar amino acid resulting in an amphiphilic structure which confers these molecules with their high surface activity makavipour et al 2019 as iii has a tendency to bind to the sulfhydryl sh groups of cysteine present in peptides and proteins khosa et al 2013 shen et al 2013 hughes 2002 cysteine thiolates in the hair are the major binding ligands for arsenite shen et al 2013 and the unique chemistry of thiol r sh groups or thiolates present in cysteine have high affinity to metal binding thiol groups r sh are subject to deprotonation loss of h to form the charged thiolate groups r s which replace the oh groups present in as species poole 2015 each arsenite as iii couples to three cysteine residues while mma3 links to two and dma3 binds to one shen et al 2013 li et al 2013 the possible reaction mechanisms for binding of inorganic arsenite as iii mma iii and dma iii to cysteine in proteins are illustrated in fig 4 three hydroxyl groups oh in arsenite are replaced by thiolate groups of cysteine and two cysteine bonds are formed between three cysteine species after binding to as iii meanwhile two hydroxyl groups from mma are replaced by thiolates and a cysteine bond is formed between two cysteine species also a hydroxyl group of dma gets replaced by thiolates of cysteine group thus adequate cysteine content is required for binding of arsenite with peptides which should be provided by the hair layer integrated into the filters 3 proposed modified arsenic removal filter integration of a hair layer may increase overall performance of the kaf particularly with respect to removing as and some heavy metals and with minimal addition of cost other toxic metals such as aluminium cadmium copper lead and zinc are also found to be absorbed by human hair and so addition of a hair matrix has the capacity to improve overall kaf performance wilhelm et al 1989 zhang et al 2020 also static tests on as adsorption by human hair demonstrate the high adsorption capacity of hair for as and dynamic tests have demonstrated the feasibility of adsorption in a packed bed column wasiuddin et al 2002 the hair layer is proposed to be integrated at the layer between coarse sand and gravel layers because most as is removed by the iron mesh and sand layers leaving relatively lower concentration of as v unabsorbed as iii and other heavy metals fig 5 furthermore the thickness of hair on one side should be slightly larger than the other side making inclined surface on upper as well as lower layer of hair refer to fig 5 thus acquired slope in hair layer assists to increase the time of contact of as with the hair layer thus increasing the adsorption capacity however it depends on the findings of detailed technical and feasibility study which is essential before the proposed configuration in the filter come into practice because iron is responsible for most of the as v removal banerji et al 2019 it is likely that increasing the relative amount of iron oxide hydroxide surface will improve the removal a recent study on low cost as treatment by hayder et al 2018 demonstrated that iron mesh gives the highest removal efficiency for as compared to iron slags and nails because of the higher relative surface area of the mesh material the study revealed that the removal efficiency for iron mesh 88 was much higher than iron nails 50 over a period of one week the long term efficiency for iron mesh 99 90 was also greater than that for iron nails 98 94 hayder et al 2018 although as v can be very efficiently removed using iron substrates as iii which is not sufficiently oxidized to as v is more problematic and a more suitable substrate is required such as hair as discussed above when required on a large scale as removal could be achieved using a hair layer integrated with the bio sand multistage filter fig 6 the combination of a hair layer and iron mesh in a bio sand filter is likely to improve overall filter performance for community use a detailed feasibility study and performance evaluation of the proposed system is imperative 3 1 operation and maintenance of the proposed arsenic filter the removal of arsenic is likely dependent upon the amount of hair in the filter with higher adsorption favored when the cortex layer of hair is exposed as this contains a higher proportion keratin protein than the cuticle layer cortex layers can be exposed on the cross section of hair by cutting the hair into small pieces size 2 mm 6 mm using scissors the size of cut hair is larger than the fine sand less than 1 mm to prevent the problems of frequent clogging the hair layer of 4 6 cm can be prepared by compressing the cut hair and integrated in the filter by placing on the polyester cloth above gravel layer the layer thickness should be slightly higher on one side than the other maintaining a gentle slope on the hair layer for increasing the contact time of arsenic with hair for adsorption regular maintenance on periodic basis is necessary to ensure that the filter is functioning properly and producing drinking water in compliance with the as maximum allowable limit operation and maintenance activities would consist of both regular scheduled tasks as well as emergency troubleshooting responses the sorbent media iron mesh and hair layer should be cleaned regularly to expose more iron surface for rusting and replaced periodically either on a set frequency or based on monitoring and tracking use it is suggested that the sand should also be replaced annually in order to maintain sorption capacity mueller 2020 the iron mesh should be constantly wet but should not be completely immersed inside water so as to promote rust formation for releasing higher ferric oxides also there should be sufficient contact time between the iron mesh and arsenic which can be achieved by preventing the formation of holes and dents in the iron mesh layer iron particles can be used along with iron mesh if there is chance of formation of holes use of polyester cloth to separate the iron mesh layer and sand layer can facilitate for cleaning of filter moreover the filter should not be exposed to direct sunlight for a long time as the increase in temperature is reported to reduce efficiency of the filter mueller 2020 the replacement schedules of iron mesh sand and gravels should be based on results from pilot scale tests 4 discussion limited research is available to assess the adsorption capacity of as on untreated hair however studies on the adsorption of as by keratin protein extracted from sheep wool modified chicken feathers human hair claws nails etc gault 2008 chowdhury 2000 samanta 2004 spallholz 2005 sanz et al 2007 goswami et al 2020 joardar et al 2020 enkhzaya et al 2017 suggest that keratin protein is an excellent sorbent for as and other heavy metals batch tests of arsenic adsorption onto hair was investigated by wasiuddin et al 2002 and kareer 2011 and the results found are presented in table 3 the studies demonstrated a great potential of hair to strongly retain as particularly at low as concentration maximum adsorption capacity was 12 4 mg kg for an initial arsenic concentration of 360 ppb also the as adsorption using hair within the ph range of 5 5 7 5 depended upon the oxidation state and the amount of hair used wasiuddin et al 2002 breakthrough time recorded by wasiuddin et al 2002 for hair was around 100 min the breakthrough time limit for drinking water is approximately 300 min which demonstrates an outstanding performance of the hair to be an adsorbent substrate in the filter studies using human hair and finger nail as sorbents in the as exposed regions of bihar showed that the average as concentration on hair was 5 5 mg kg range 4 0 8 8 and that in nail was 14 2 mg kg range 6 1 24 0 comparable results were seen in the studies in west bengal where as concentration ranged from 0 17 to 14 39 mg kg in hair and 0 74 36 63 mg kg in nails sanz et al 2007 samanta et al 2004 table 4 the as species distribution in hair sample for as iii as v mma was 75 25 2 and that for nail sample was 60 35 5 the report demonstrated that the as removal in nails was more correlated than as removal in hair except only for as iii and mma in hair sanz et al 2007 in this variation adsorption of as species by hair can meet the current requirement removal of more harmful as iii moreover hair is more available cheaper and more abundant than nails since the test was conducted on previously untreated human hair it also exhibits a great potential on removing as from contaminated water 4 1 arsenic removal issues and enhancement with other heavy metals a report by jica dwss and dwss jica enpho 2016 on performance of kaf in nawalparasi district revealed 83 removal of as for mean value and 75 removal for median value and significantly good removal for pathogens where the untreated raw tube well water had concentration of median value of 60 ppb mean 91 57 ppb and ranging from 0 to 1320 ppb the filtered water had concentration of median value of 10 ppb mean of 25 72 ppb and range 0 590 ppb also the percentage of kafs exceeding who guideline was 38 and exceeding ndwqs guideline was 13 thus recommending the improvement activities to enhance the performance of kaf a study by liang et al 2017 reported that average of 0 127 0 078 mg kg of as in hair was adsorbed with range 0 03 0 87 mg kg table 4 and the published range was 0 015 26 mg kg another study by katz 2019 documented that the as concentration in hair was 1240 610 ppb for exposed environmental condition and as concentration was 60 20 ppb in controlled condition at the equilibrium concentration of 0 35 μg g amount adsorbed was found 1 1 μg g over 6 h and 1 95 μg g over 24 h a research on hair and toe nail as concentration of the people residing in as contaminated area in australia by hindwood et al 2003 determined an average as concentration of 5 52 mg kg where the median as concentration of drinking water was 43 8 ppb likewise mandal et al 2003 observed an average of 7 65 mg kg of as in hair where the as in drinking water had an average as concentration of 190 ppb table 4 if it is feasible to treat hair with na2s and naoh the efficiency of removal can show more remarkable result it is because on treatment with na2s hydrogen bond of the keratins breaks and disulfide bonds disperse also treatment with naoh makes cleavages on disulfide bonds creating more adsorptive sites creating more possibility for bonding with as treated hair should be washed thoroughly before integrating into filter enkhzaya et al 2017 even though the effluent may be above standard limits the concentration is comparatively much lower than that of influent can be reduced well below the who standards when filter is integrated with hair layer and replacement of iron nails by iron mesh further the integration can also be useful in adsorbing excess of as contents in case of the filters are either installed incorrectly or maintained improperly however quality control is highly crucial moreover kaf may not be effective in removing other heavy metals for example chromium cadmium copper zinc lead etc in such cases integration of hair layer in the filter can be an efficacious way to enhance its efficiency in removal of as iii as well as heavy metals economically wilhelm et al 1989 fergusson et al 1991 enkhzaya et al 2017 calderón et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 however exact removal efficiency of the proposed filter should be experimentally verified 4 2 regeneration potential of a modified filter once the hair layer gets saturated after series of adsorption with as it gradually loses capacity for further adsorption of as it then should either be replaced by new hair layer or the saturated hair layer should be treated with chemicals for desorption of as from hair since arsenic protein complexes are sensitive to naoh treatment and alkaline conditions have been investigated to release as from proteins moreover oxidizing the as absorbed hair with concentrated hydrogen peroxide h2o2 at room temperature was observed liberate all the protein bound as species as free pentavalent forms of as shen et al 2013 besides alkaline treatment acidic treatments also have been found to liberate as from protein with the releasing capability of descending order of hno3 h2so4 trichloro acetic acid tca hcl shen et al 2013 5 conclusions and future perspectives arsenic contamination in groundwater is an important health and environmental problem in many parts of terai lowland of nepal and many people of this area are dependent upon groundwater while many technologies have been proposed for water treatment most of them are not practical or cost effective in the context of rural terai of nepal both the static and dynamic tests as documented by past reports have revealed that addition of hair layer and replacement of iron nail with iron mesh could potentially offer an improved solution over the current kaf methods currently in use integration of a hair layer on bio sand filters for large scale filtration might be very beneficial to remove as and also help to eliminate other problem metals such as lead cadmium copper and nickel there is also very strong evidence that replacement of the iron nails with a higher surface area source of iron such as mesh or filings might also lead to improvements in extraction of as species whilst literature evidence suggests that using iron mesh and adding a hair layer to the kaf could offer significant benefits and gains in efficiency there is little understanding of how a modified kaf process would be impacted by parameters such as ph temperature dimension of hair layer and contact time since as changes into different oxidation states depending upon the redox potential ph temperature etc that causes in efficient removal of arsenic from drinking water at the same time moreover removal of arsenic is impacted by the other ions for instance phosphates present in water thus selective removal of as is still challenging nevertheless thiol based adsorption of both form of arsenic thiol present in cysteine of hair can be a good technique for effective removal of as iii and as v from groundwater therefore this review also emphasizes further research on hair cysteine thiol based arsenic removal method which could significantly improve the selective removal of arsenic from drinking water and could help decrease the load on adsorbent too moreover detailed study to verify the efficacy of these proposed changes to kaf and effects of various operational and environmental factors is essential declaration of competing

devastating issue of water pollution you et al 2018 the need of clean water is compounded in developing countries like india and china due to large consumption of water in industrial operations saeed et al 2010 the effluents from various industries like textile food processing cosmetics rubber and plastics are the major sources of water pollution kumari et al 2017 you et al 2018 tyagi 2020 dyes are the most notorious organic contaminant that are discharged into water bodies dyes have complex structure and are stable to light heat and oxidizing agent they are mostly carcinogenic due to the presence of aromatic rings mittal et al 2010 sarma et al 2016 it causes depletion of dissolved oxygen toxicity to flora fauna and humans therefore the removal of these colored effluents from wastewater is an important subject of concern for environmentalists all over the globe mittal et al 2010 crystal violet is a cationic tri phenylmethane dye and is responsible for causing eyes skin and digestive tract irritation it is a mitotic poisoning agent which is carcinogenic and therefore is regarded as a potential biohazard sarma et al 2016 for the removal of dyes from wastewater adsorption offers a suitable cost effective regenerative and easily operative process gholami et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 various adsorbents have already been explored in literature for the removal of dyes from wastewater gholami et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 the use of natural polymer or biopolymer for the synthesis of nanocomposite as an adsorbent have received great attention owing to the era of green and ecofriendly environment zhang et al 2013 the functional groups on the surface of adsorbent plays an important role in adsorbent effectiveness and capacity therefore the key idea for the synthesis of nanocomposite in this paper is to cross link two natural and easily available biopolymers alginate and pectin in order to enhance its functionality the combination of biopolymers is unique and thus it describes its novelty sodium alginate is a salt of alginic acid and have excellent hydrophilicity binding ability and biocompatibility monier et al 2015 the presence of carboxylic groups in the alginate structure enhances its complex formation process with dyes and therefore the use of alginate in the synthesis of adsorbent is efficient pectin is a secondary product of fruit juice and sugar manufacturing industries chistyakova et al 2014 hence it is inexpensive and abundantly available it is mainly composed of 1 4 linked α d galacturonic acid moreira et al 2013 it is able to bind with

synthesis of novel and ecofriendly alginate pectin nanocomposite alg pec for the removal of crystal violet dye from aqueous solution the effect of various experimental parameters such as ph dose contact time initial dye concentration and temperature on the adsorption of the dye onto nanocomposite were examined the experimental isotherm data were analyzed using langmuir and freundlich isotherm models the equlibrium data were further validated using pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetic models in order to make the process more economical and feasible desorption and regeneration

scientific india pvt ltd ethanol and glyoxal used were of analytical grade sodium hydroxide naoh was purchased from avarice laboratories pvt ltd india crystal violet dye were obtained from merck india the stock solution of dye 1000 mgl 1 were prepared by dissolving the required amount of dye in double distilled water 2 2 synthesis of bionanocomposite 2 w v solution of pectin were added to 2 w v solution of alginate and the solution were left for 6 h at 333 k with continuous stirring at 420 rpm then 3 ml of glyoxal solution were added to it and this was left for 24 h at 323 k with stirring the oh group of alginate or pectin is treated with co group of glyoxal to form acetal formation that increases the binding sites for adsorption the solution was then precipitated using ethanol and then filtered and washed with water finally the precipitate was dried in oven and powdered using mortar for subsequent studies 2 3 characterization the elemental analysis and surface morphology of the

particle size of nanocomposite was examined by high resolution transmission electron microscope tecnai g2 20 fei s twin ftir measurements were recorded in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 with a nicolet is50 ftir spectrometer from samples in kbr pellets xrd pattern was obtained using bruker axsd8 advance x ray diffractometer with cu α radiation λ 1 542 a0 the absorbance of the crystal violet samples were measured by t70 uv vis spectrometer pg instruments ltd u k uv vis spectrophotometer working at λ max of 582 nm the zeta potential analyzer malvern instruments corporation uk was used to measure the isoelectric point iep 2 4 batch adsorption experiments for batch adsorption experiments 20 ml of initial cv concentration 5 50 mgl 1 contact time 5 360 min ph 1 7 and temperature 298 318 k containing 0 01 g of nanocomposite were treated in a series of 100 ml conical flasks the studies were conducted by varying the initial dye concentration ph contact time dose and temperature the initial ph values of the samples were adjusted using 0 5 m hcl and 0 5 m naoh solution whatman filter paper 1 was used to filter the samples after adsorption the concentration of dye samples were then determined using uv vis spectrophotometer for cv λ max 582 nm the amount of dye adsorbed per unit mass of the nanocomposite qe mgg 1 and the extent of adsorption were computed from equations 1 and 2 1 q e c i c e m v 2 c i c e c i 100 where ci and ce are the initial dye concentration and that after adsorption mgl 1 after time t min m is the mass of the adsorbent g and v l is the initial volume of the dye solution respectively zare et al 2015 2 5 comparison of nanocomposite capacity for dye adsorption the adsorption ability of precursors alginate and pectin is compared with nanocomposite for dye adsorption the removal comes out in the order as nanocomposite 81 alginate 10 pectin 5 therefore the nanocomposite showed highest dye adsorption 2 6 desorption and regeneration studies the desorption of crystal violet dye adsorbed nanocomposite were tested for 0 1 n hcl and 0 1 n naoh the best result was found with 0 1 n hcl therefore adsorption desorption cycles were tested with 0 1 n hcl solution as desorbing agent 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 sem edx and tem analysis the sem images before a and after treatment of crystal violet dye b onto the surface of nanocomposite are shown in fig 1 a taken at 5000 x the sem image of alginate showed spherical granules as reported in literature mittal et al 2016 there is a drastic change in morphology of nanocomposite as compared to alginate the sem image of nanocomposite a showed highly cross linked irregular and porous structure that provided sites for adsorption of crystal violet dye thus it revealed the adsorptive nature of adsorbent the sem image of crystal violet dye treated nanocomposite b showed structural variation due to the adsorption of dye onto the surface of nanocomposite the appearance of smooth and cloudy surface confirms the successful binding of dye molecule with the functional groups present on the nanocomposite surface the edx analysis of nanocomposite before and after treatment of crystal violet dye are shown in fig 1 b and the elemental analysis are tabulated in table 1 the edx of nanocomposite showed the presence of c o na and au while the crystal violet dye treated nanocomposite showed the presence of c o na n cl and au elements the presence of n and cl in crystal violet dye adsorbed nanocomposite spectra further confirms the adsorption of crystal violet dye onto the surface of nanocomposite tem image of nanocomposite showed dispersed particles onto nanocomposite surface of size in 13 34 nm range fig 1 c 3 1 2 ftir and xrd analysis ftir spectra of nanocomposite and crystal violet adsorbed nanocomposite are represented in fig 1 d the nanocomposite showed peaks at 3436 oh stretching vibration 2929 ch stretching vibration 1737 asymmetric coo stretching 1625 symmetric coo stretching 1025 stretching vibration of c oh group 609 and 433 cm 1 c c o c c h stretching respectively whereas the crystal violet loaded nanocomposite showed peaks at 3430 2923 1752 1632 1019 644 and 448 cm 1 respectively monier et al 2015 shi and gunasekaran 2008 the peaks in the range of 1200 1020 cm 1 are mainly due to acetal formation that confirms the successful synthesis of biopolymers with glyoxal the spectra of crystal violet loaded nanocomposite showed that there are shifting of peaks as being compared with the spectra of nanocomposite showing the possible involvement of these functional groups in the adsorption of dye onto the surface of nanocomposite the xrd spectra of alg pec showed amorphous nature of nanocomposite as depicted in fig 1 e 3 2 effect of ph on adsorption the solution ph greatly affects the adsorption process by influencing the surface charge of the adsorbent and the degree of ionization of adsorbate species present in the solution the test for the effect of ph ranging 1 7 on adsorption process were carried out at dye concentration 20 mgl 1 contact time 240 min dose 0 01 g and temperature 298 k respectively it is seen from fig 2 a that the adsorption capacity qe increases with increase in ph and reaches maximum at ph 6 1 after ph 6 1 there is slight decrease in adsorption capacity this fact could be explained as there is electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged sites of the adsorbent and positively charged dye molecules till ph 6 1 therefore for experimental studies ph 6 1 were selected as optimum ph kumari et al 2017 the effect of ph on zeta potential values for the nanocomposite was conducted and it was found that zeta potential value decreases from 15 to 13 mv on increasing ph from 1 to 12 the iep was found to be 3 at ph higher than iep the surface of nanocomposite was negatively charged whereas for ph lower than iep the surface of nanocomposite was positively charged therefore at ph greater than 3 the surface of nanocomposite was negatively charged that enhance the adsorption of crystal violet dye onto the surface of nanocomposite 3 3 effect of adsorbent dosage on adsorption the test for the effect of adsorbent dose ranging 0 01 0 05 g on adsorption process were carried out at dye concentration 20 mgl 1 contact time 240 min ph 6 1 and temperature 298 k respectively as seen from fig 2 b with increased in adsorbent dose the adsorption capacity qe of crystal violet dye decreases this could be explained by the fact that the higher adsorbent dose will inhibit the dye molecule to reach the available adsorption sites and hence the adsorption capacity decreases ahmad and mirza 2018 a kumari et al 2017 therefore for experimental studies adsorbent dose of 0 01 g was selected 3 4 effect of contact time on adsorption and adsorption kinetics the test for the effect of contact time ranging 5 360 min on adsorption process were carried out at dye concentration 20 mgl 1 and 50 mgl 1 dose 0 01 g ph 6 1 and temperature 298 k respectively the adsorption capacity increases from 17 5 to 36 0528 mgg 1 for 20 mgl 1 and from 82 96 to 90 89 mgg 1 for 50 mgl 1 with increased in contact time till 240 min and after that equilibrium is reached fig 3 this could be explained as the increase in adsorption capacity in initial stages is due to the high availability of adsorption sites till 240 min and after that dye molecules have to compete for available adsorption sites and hence adsorption capacity slightly decreases at this stage alswata et al 2017 therefore for experimental studies contact time of 240 min was selected the mechanism and rate of adsorption process were investigated using pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetic models equations 3 and 4 for these models respectively are as follows 3 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 4 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where qe and qt mgg 1 are the adsorption capacity at equilibrium and time t k1 min 1 and k2 gmg 1min 1 are the pseudo first and pseudo second order rate constants respectively fig 4 ammar et al 2014 from table 2 it is evident that the high correlation coefficient r2 value and the close agreement between experimental qe and calculated qe values strongly supports pseudo second order kinetic mechanism for crystal violet dye adsorption onto nanocomposite and hence the mechanism involved in the adsorption process is chemisorption ahmad and mirza 2018 b kumari et al 2017 mathew and krishnamurthy 2018 3 5 effect of initial dye concentration and adsorption isotherms the test for the effect of initial dye concentration ranging 5 50 mgl 1 on adsorption process were carried out at experimental conditions taking contact time 240 min dose 0 01 g ph 6 1 and temperature 298 318 k respectively as seen from fig 5 the adsorption capacity increases with increasing initial concentration ci at all temperature that might be due to increased concentration gradient between the bulk solution and the adsorbent surface mittal et al 2010 the equilibrium relationship between adsorbate and adsorbent are explained by adsorption isotherm the equilibrium data was evaluated using langmuir and freundlich isotherm models equations 5 and 6 for these models are represented as 5 q e q m b c e 1 b c e 6 q e k f c e 1 n where ce and qe are the equilibrium concentration mgl 1 and adsorption capacity at equilibrium mgg 1 b signifies energy of adsorption lmgg 1 kf mgg 1 lmg 1 1 n and n are the freundlich constant related to adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity respectively mirza and ahmad 2018 sarma et al 2016 based on high correlation coefficient value r2 as can be observed from table 3 the langmuir isotherm model fitted best with the equilibrium adsorption data signifying monolayer coverage of crystal violet dye onto the surface of nanocomposite fig 6 and also reported elsewere gholami et al 2016 the langmuir constant value decreases with increase in temperature indicating exothermic nature of existing process the value of n 1 shows favorable adsorption process 3 6 thermodynamics of adsorption the thermodynamic parameters like free energy change δg enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs for the adsorption of crystal violet onto nanocomposite were calculated from the following equations 7 9 7 k c c i c e c e 8 δ g r t l n k c 9 ln k c δ s r δ h r t where t is the temperature k kc is the distribution coefficient and r is the universal gas constant respectively the thermodynamic parameters δh and δs were evaluated from the plot of ln kc versus 1 t fig 7 and also reported by gholami et al 2016 ahmad and mirza 2018 c the thermodynamic parameters are tabulated in table 4 the negative value of δh and δs for cv demonstrates that the adsorption onto the nanocomposite is exothermic with decreased randomness at solid liquid interface during adsorption the negative value of δg at all temperature for cv showed spontaneous nature of adsorption kumari et al 2017 roy and mondal 2019 the increasing trend in the values of δg with increasing temperature indicates the involvement of exothermic process 3 7 desorption and regeneration of the adsorbent as the dye loaded nanocomposite further poses disposal problem and therefore for the safe disposal of the exhausted adsorbent the desorption studies acquire a very significant role so it is desirable to remove the dye from the adsorbent after adsorption using desorption process the results showed that using 0 1 n hcl solution 82 of crystal violet dye could be desorbed from dye loaded adsorbent in first cycle the effective regeneration can be carried out up to three cycles 65 desorption successfully without significant loss in adsorption capacity fig 8 therefore alg pec nanocomposite has been proved to be an excellent adsorbent with good regenerative capacity for the sequestration of crystal violet dye from aqueous solution 4 conclusion a novel promising and ecofriendly alg pec nanocomposite was successfully synthesized for the removal of crystal violet dye from aqueous solution the results showed that the nanocomposite is porous with particle size of 13 34 in nanometer range amorphous in nature and there is involvement of functional groups in the adsorption of crystal violet dye as observed from ftir spectra the adsorption process is highly influenced by various experimental factors such as contact time initial concentration dose temperature and ph the langmuir and pseudo second order are the best fitted models for the adsorption process the thermodynamic studies showed that the involved adsorption is exothermic spontaneous with decreased randomness between solid solution interface the desorption and regeneration studies are best described by using 0 1 n hcl solution that excellently lasts up to third cycle without significant loss in adsorption capacity therefore alg pec nanocomposite has been proved to be an excellent adsorbent for the removal of crystal violet dye

gholami et al 2016 ahmad and mirza 2018 c the thermodynamic parameters are tabulated in table 4 the negative value of δh and δs for cv demonstrates that the adsorption onto the nanocomposite is exothermic with decreased randomness at solid liquid interface during adsorption the negative value of δg at all temperature for cv showed spontaneous nature of adsorption kumari et al 2017 roy and mondal 2019 the increasing trend in the values of δg with increasing temperature indicates the involvement of exothermic process 3 7 desorption and regeneration of the adsorbent as the dye loaded nanocomposite further poses disposal problem and therefore for the safe disposal of the exhausted adsorbent the desorption studies acquire a very significant role so it is desirable to remove the dye from the adsorbent after adsorption using desorption process the results showed that using 0 1 n hcl solution 82 of crystal violet dye could be desorbed from dye loaded adsorbent in first cycle the effective regeneration can be carried out up to three cycles 65 desorption successfully without significant loss in adsorption capacity fig 8 therefore alg pec nanocomposite has been proved to be an excellent adsorbent with good regenerative capacity for the sequestration of crystal violet dye from aqueous solution 4 conclusion a novel promising and ecofriendly alg pec nanocomposite was successfully synthesized for the removal of crystal violet dye from aqueous solution the results showed that the nanocomposite is porous with particle size of 13 34 in nanometer range amorphous in nature and there is involvement of functional groups in the adsorption of crystal violet dye as observed from ftir spectra the adsorption process is highly influenced by various experimental factors such as contact time initial concentration dose temperature and ph the langmuir and pseudo second order are the best fitted models for the adsorption process the thermodynamic studies showed that the involved adsorption is exothermic spontaneous with decreased randomness between solid solution interface the desorption and regeneration studies are best described by using 0 1 n hcl solution that excellently lasts up to third cycle without significant loss in adsorption capacity therefore alg pec nanocomposite has been proved to be an excellent adsorbent for the removal of crystal violet dye
