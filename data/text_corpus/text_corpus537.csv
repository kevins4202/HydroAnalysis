corrado corradini associate editor frédéric huneau dissolved inorganic carbon dic fluxes from the land to ocean have been quantified for many rivers globally however co2 fluxes to the atmosphere from inland waters are quantitatively significant components of the global carbon cycle that are currently poorly constrained understanding the relative contributions of natural and human impacted processes on the dic cycle within catchments may provide a basis for developing improved management strategies to mitigate free co2 concentrations in rivers and subsequent evasion to the atmosphere here a large internally consistent dataset collected from 41 catchments across great britain gb accounting for 36 of land area 83 997 km2 and representative of national land cover was used to investigate catchment controls on riverine dissolved inorganic carbon dic bicarbonate hco3 and free co2 concentrations fluxes to the coastal sea and annual yields per unit area of catchment estimated dic flux to sea for the survey catchments was 647 kt dic yr 1 which represented 69 of the total dissolved carbon flux from these catchments generally those catchments with large proportions of carbonate and sedimentary sandstone were found to deliver greater dic and hco3 to the ocean the calculated mean free co2 yield for survey catchments i e potential co2 emission to the atmosphere was 0 56 t c km 2 yr 1 regression models demonstrated that whilst river dic r2 0 77 and hco3 r2 0 77 concentrations are largely explained by the geology of the landmass along with a negative correlation to annual precipitation free co2 concentrations were strongly linked to catchment macronutrient status overall dic dominates dissolved c inputs to coastal waters meaning that estuarine carbon dynamics are sensitive to underlying geology and therefore are likely to be reasonably constant in contrast potential losses of carbon to the atmosphere via dissolved co2 which likely constitute a significant fraction of net terrestrial ecosystem production and hence the national carbon budget may be amenable to greater direct management via altering patterns of land use keywords catchments rivers dissolved inorganic carbon free co2 macro nutrients survey data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the transport of dissolved inorganic carbon dic via streams and rivers to estuaries is a significant part of the global c cycle linking terrestrial oceanic and atmospheric environments meybeck 1993 ludwig et al 1998 dupré et al 2003 aufdenkampe et al 2011 ciais et al 2014 the importance of the dic cycle over geological periods occurs via the weathering of ca or mg silicate rocks which consumes co2 and produces alkalinity berner 1998 suchet et al 2003 however much current interest concerns freshwater and estuarine environments super saturated with co2 that act as a source of greenhouse gases rawlins et al 2014 hunt et al 2014 kitidis et al 2019 regnier et al 2022 a recent estimate indicated that inland waters receive 1 7 pg c yr 1 of terrestrial carbon transported from soils ciais et al 2014 of this 0 2 pg is buried in aquatic sediments and 0 7 pg is returned to the atmosphere via gas exchange the remaining 0 8 pg is transported to the oceans as dissolved inorganic and organic carbon and particulate organic carbon dic equilibrates into multiple forms in natural waters bicarbonate hco3 carbonate co3 2 and carbonic acid h2co3 and dissolved free co2 the concentrations of which vary temporally and spatially in streams and rivers and with ph and water temperature being key controls on speciation jarvie et al 2017 major natural influences on concentrations and fluxes of dic include catchment lithology and mineralogy mineral weathering rates altitude and climate chaplot and mutema 2021 kindler et al 2011 suchet et al 2003 catchment lithology is a major control with carbonate dominated catchments typically providing the highest hco3 and co3 2 concentrations in great britain gb this is demonstrated where dic in carbonate rock dominated catchments typically exceeds 40 mg l 1 whilst in catchments where there are few or no carbonate bearing rocks concentrations are typically 10 mg l 1 jarvie et al 2017 altitude and climate also strongly influence catchment dic flux and speciation as they influence temperature and precipitation which act as controls on catchment respiration soil and vegetation hydrology and the transport of dic produced from weathering reactions drake et al 2020 soil derived co2 is reported to account for 67 of dic in the world s rivers amiotte suchet et al 1999 the natural catchment processes that integrate to produce riverine dic fluxes operate over a variety of timescales raymond and hamilton 2018 suggest that dic fluxes are based on the availability and reactivity of minerals for weathering supply limitation the transport of solutes transport limitation and volume and residence time of water passing through the system reaction limitation on top of these natural dic producing processes anthropogenic activities such as those associated with climate warming acid precipitation mining and construction have been identified as perturbing riverine dic fluxes drake et al 2020 neal et al 2000 raymond and hamilton 2018 ren et al 2015 increasingly the impacts of agriculture borges et al 2018 raymond and hamilton 2018 and urbanisation jarvie et al 1997 2004 baker et al 2008 marescaux et al 2018 wang et al 2017 within catchments are recognised as contributing to changing river dic flux much of this derives from increases in catchment macro nutrient status with much research focusing on the increase and evasion potential of greenhouse gases billett and harvey 2013 marescaux et al 2018 it is evident that human impacts can change the dic cycle however changes to the dic cycle are unlikely to be in isolation from other biogeochemical cycles greater understanding of the interactions of these cycles is needed for example how perturbations to coupled p n and c cycles impact degassing of co2 from rivers management solutions aimed at reducing nutrient inputs to rivers e g improved nutrient management implementation of agricultural conservation practices and improvements in sewage treatment are being increasingly used whilst newer ideas such as re balancing macro nutrient stoichiometry within catchments are being developed stutter et al 2018 graeber et al 2021 in addition technologies being suggested to mitigate rising co2 levels may also influence exports of dic in future for example the application of ground basalt to soils appears to be a technology gaining support as a form of greenhouse gas removal as a means of accelerating chemical weathering and subsequent drawdown of co2 beerling et al 2020 kelland et al 2020 improved understanding and quantification of the responses of the dic cycle to land use change and management are therefore required for modelling of c fluxes from land to oceans and atmosphere key uncertainties include i understanding the extent to which land use impacts the underlying geological geomorphological weathering and catchment processes ii identifying the main drivers of co2 flux to the atmosphere and dic flux to the sea and iii gas transfer velocities which are still poorly constrained these uncertainties are demonstrated in reports where global co2 evasion from inland waters has been estimated as being up to 4 gt c yr 1 ciais et al 2014 raymond et al 2013 drake et al 2017 this paper addresses the first two of these uncertainties through a year long sampling survey in which 41 rivers were sampled with catchments covering 36 of the gb landmass the results focus on the spatial concentrations mg l 1 fluxes kt yr 1 and yields t km 2 yr 1 of dic hco3 as the dominant aqueous species and free co2 the work explores how current land use and human activities may impact the natural background gradient controls on dic concentrations flux and yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 survey outline great britain gb scotland wales and england has a temperate climate it is considerably smaller in size than some of the major basins including the congo drake et al 2020 and the mississippi raymond and hamilton 2018 where previous experimental work on dic has been undertaken and it has a number of geographical gradients jarvie et al 1997 2017 that have been recognised as fundamental controls on riverine dic flux and yield the survey sampled rivers n 41 that drain 36 of gb defined as being both the mainland and islands 233 327 km2 fig 1 the catchments selected are representative of the land cover of gb as a whole si 1 the most widespread land cover type sampled according to the ukceh land cover map lcm 2015 was improved grassland 28 for gb cf 29 for the catchments sampled followed by arable land 24 of both gb and catchments sampled and then acid grassland 9 for gb and cf 11 for the catchments sampling sites were located close to but always above the tidal limits the defined boundary for terrestrial to marine c export in this work williamson et al 2021 and where either the national river flow archive nrfa https nrfa ceh ac uk or the uk harmonised monitoring scheme hms sites https data gov uk dataset bda4e065 41e5 4b78 b405 41c1d3606225 historic uk water quality sampling harmonised monitoring scheme summary data provide long term water export and quality monitoring the gb area incorporates gradients in geology soils precipitation temperature and land use intensity si 2 5 gb has north south and west east trends in both geology and altitude typically catchments with large proportions of carbonate based sedimentary rock are situated in southern and eastern gb whilst catchments predominantly comprised of weathering resistant silicate rocks are found to the north and west altitude influences both precipitation and temperature and follows a similar pattern with the highest altitude catchments generally in the north and west with the prevailing wind coming from the southwest and higher land elevation predominantly in the west precipitation follows a gradient from west to east land cover reflects the intensity of soils agriculture and urbanisation soils generally track geology and are more acidic and organic rich in the north and west of the country whilst more alkaline mineral soils are found in the south and east of the country in the south eastern quarter of gb the topography and climate are more conducive to intensive agriculture with upland agriculture and peatland dominating landscapes in the north and west 2 2 sampling and collection methods a major aim of the survey was to ensure a consistency of approach equipment and methodologies for calculating riverine carbon fluxes tye et al 2020 samples for specific determinants were analysed by one laboratory for the duration of the project rivers were sampled monthly from january 2017 to december 2017 samples were collected during the third week of each month to minimise within month temporal variation between catchments especially variation associated with antecedent weather water samples were taken from the centre of the river or from fast flowing water away from the river bank water temperature and conductivity were measured and recorded immediately after sample collection samples for ph and alkalinity were collected unfiltered into 250 ml hdpe bottles to overflowing and sealed to avoid potential changes in speciation due to gaseous exchange samples were distributed after collection to their respective analytical centres under cool conditions ice bags and ice packs using overnight couriers 2 3 laboratory analysis a skalar sp10 robotic auto sampler connected to an inolab 730 ph meter with a sentix 60 probe was used to measure ph alkalinity was determined by titration using a metrohm 814 sample processor and metrohm 888 titrando diluter which undertakes analyses using automatically predefined methods analyses of total dissolved carbon tdc and non purgeable organic carbon npoc were used to calculate dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations a shimadzu toc l analyser was used to measure npoc in filtered and acidified 1 m hcl samples the method to determine tdc was the same as above without the acidification and purge step to remove inorganic carbon williamson et al 2021 limits of detection for npoc and tdc were 0 6 mg c l 1 see si 9 for sampling and analysis details of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp 2 4 use of the thincarb model for calculating dissolved inorganic carbon speciation and excess 2 4 1 partial pressure of carbon dioxide from ph and alkalinity the thincarb model thermodynamic modelling of inorganic carbon jarvie et al 2017 uses ph temperature and gran alkalinity alkgran measurements to calculate dissolved inorganic carbon concentration and speciation from excess partial pressure of co2 epco2 x atmospheric pressure in the water sample compared to the dissolved co2 concentration found in pure water in equilibrium with the atmosphere at the same temperature and pressure thincarb is open access and is described in detail in jarvie et al 2017 an outline is provided in si 6 thincarb works effectively across the range ph 6 and 10 in our dataset n 521 6 samples 1 15 were found to be below ph 6 with the highest ph value being 9 29 the total sum of dissolved inorganic carbon dictotal represents the sum of c concentrations in all the inorganic c species 1 dic total mg l 1 c c in hco 3 c c in h 2 c o 3 c c in c o 3 2 after speciation calculations the percentage contribution of each species in dictotal was applied to the measured by difference inorganic carbon concentration dicmeasured and used in the interpretation of survey results thus the term dic used in this paper to describe results corresponds to dicmeasured which was determined as 2 dic measured mg l 1 total dissolved carbon tdc non purgeable organic carbon npoc values of epco2 were used to estimate free co2 c concentrations in the water samples described as free co2 in text the co2 concentration equals pco2 times the solubility of co2 corrected using water temperature henry s law constant at a given temperature and salinity thus 3 free co 2 c k h x pco 2 w k h x pco 2 a where kh represents henry s law constant for freshwater and corrected for water temperature pco2 w and pco2 a are the pco2 in the surface water and the pco2 in equilibrium with the overlying air respectively wang et al 2017 2 5 ancillary data ancillary data used in the statistical and modelling analysis were the same as used in williamson et al 2021 which describes the doc results from this survey enabling consistent comparison between the dic and doc results mean catchment altitude and average annual precipitation as standard period average annual rainfall saar were included in the modelling data set both being likely key gradients for controlling dic across gb see si 3 and si 4 catchment area and land cover characteristics 14 broad habitats were obtained from the 2015 ukceh land cover map 2015 rowland et al 2017a 2017b and are shown in si 5 the different grassland types were not aggregated as they typically represent soils with different ph values e g acid or calcareous grassland or where ph may be manipulated using agricultural lime e g improved grassland thus influencing river dic concentrations see si 5 additional variables included the percentage of carbonate and sedimentary sandstone in survey catchments see si 2 these were obtained by combining uk catchment and sub catchment maps with the bgs 50 k soil parent material model and using the european soil bureau bedrock classification catchment areas of basalt and shale known to be important in co2 drawdown via silicate weathering were obtained in a similar manner however the contributions from these rocks to catchment geology was minimal estimates of catchment population were made by summing the proportion of population for each local authority area that intersected the catchment mean daily gauged river flows were obtained from the national agencies for england scotland and wales environment agency ea scottish environmental protection agency sepa and natural resources wales nrw respectively at most sites water sampling and flow gauging were located within a few hundred metres of each other flows at the gauging station were assumed to be indicative of those at the water sampling site upstream gauging data were used to estimate flows for four rivers eden mersey and welsh dee where co located flow data were not available during 2017 past annual discharge data were calculated for each comparison gauging station to ensure that total annual discharge was estimated to within 10 of observations with a correction made to the annual discharge calculation for 2017 if differences between upstream and downstream gauging stations were 10 the relationship between upstream and downstream daily flows during 2015 the most recent year with comparable data was calculated using regression analysis and daily flows for the sampling site for 2017 were estimated from the regression equation williamson et al 2021 daily flows for the conon were used to represent those in the nearby beauly assuming the same mean areal runoff for both catchments since they are similar in area and topography daily flow data for 2017 were unavailable for the dyfi whilst only half a year s data was collected for the dorset stour so these two rivers were excluded from calculations of dic flux and yield catchment mean elevation m and area along with hydrogeology including base flow index were obtained from the uk national river flow archive nrfa http nrfa ceh ac uk 2 6 data treatment all statistical analysis was undertaken using the r statistical package v3 5 1 r core team 2018 stepwise regression analysis was undertaken using the mass and leaps packages to identify the explanatory land use and hydrogeological variables that best predicted the concentrations of dic species a complete list of variables used in the regression analysis can be found in si 7 prior to running regression models correlation matrices were used to eliminate variables where co linearity was exhibited the model selected was the one which reported the lowest bayesian information criteria bic value tests for skewness were undertaken on the dependent variables and were log10 transformed if skewness was 1 or 1 epco2 values were converted into concentrations of free co2 prior to models being parameterised for river free co2 concentrations initial modelling was carried out using the above dataset and a second dataset of river mean macronutrient concentrations collated from the survey data dic fluxes were calculated using method 5 of littlewood et al 1998 to be consistent with data analysis for the doc component of the study undertaken in williamson et al 2021 some underestimation may occur using such methods as compared to using high resolution data worrall et al 2013 method 5 is detailed in eq 4 whereby k specifies a conversion factor for the length of sampling ci refers to the doc concentration at sampling time i qi refers to flow at sampling time i qt refers to the mean flow over the whole sampling period and n is the number of samples taken 4 dic flux k i 1 n c i q i i 1 n q i q t stepwise regression analysis was again undertaken on the annual river flux estimates to identify the explanatory variables that most likely explained the annual flux across gb 3 results 3 1 initial dataset the relationship between the thincarb modelled dic data and the measured by subtraction alkalinity results si 8 was significant y 0 9525 0 4572 r2 0 99 n 518 giving confidence to the interpretation of the modelling results some over prediction of dic occurred when doc concentrations were high due to the greater role for organic c buffers such as organic acids jarvie et al 2017 fig 2 describes the range of concentrations of dic species for the entire survey mg c l 1 for dic hco3 co3 2 and h2co3 as expected for the range of ph values recorded hco3 dominated dic accounting for 80 of dic in river waters with ph 7 and 40 80 of dic in rivers with ph 7 a median hco3 concentration of 10 mg c l 1 was found the highest values 95th percentile for hco3 exceeded 57 mg c l 1 and were associated with two rivers stour and the great ouse in eastern england with high proportions of chalk geology 44 and 95 respectively within their catchments these catchments also received the two lowest annual average precipitation rates 580 and 587 mm yr 1 respectively the contribution of co3 2 was low across the sites with a median value 1 mg c l 1 whilst h2co3 concentrations were generally 2 mg c l 1 most samples had epco2 values 1 representing oversaturation with respect to atmospheric co2 partial pressure and suggesting potential efflux of co2 from rivers to the atmosphere only 2 of epco2 results had values 1 indicating under saturation with respect to atmospheric pressure suggesting potential influx of co2 to rivers from the atmosphere the 95th percentile value of epco2 results was 9 6 atmospheric partial pressure and the highest estimated value was 21 3 atmospheric partial pressure 3 2 spatial patterns of dicmeasured hco3 and free co2 concentrations across gb the highest flow weighted mean concentrations of dic were found in england and southern scotland fig 3a and the lowest concentrations were found in the west of england wales and north eastern scotland this pattern demonstrates the role of the catchment bedrock geology particularly those with high proportions of carbonate rocks on dic concentrations flow weighted mean hco3 concentrations showed a similar pattern as hco3 generally makes up the greatest proportion of dic in these catchments fig 3b the spatial pattern of concentrations of free co2 mg c l 1 fig 3c showed the highest concentrations in the peat dominated halladale catchment and the river mersey in northwest england catchments in the west of scotland along with the large lowland agricultural catchments of southern gb also demonstrated relatively high concentrations of free co2 3 3 modelling concentrations of dic species using catchment land cover and catchment characteristics the best fit model to predict dic had an r2 of 0 77 table 1 in this model dic was positively correlated with the percentages of carbonate rocks and sedimentary sandstone within the catchment and negatively correlated with average annual precipitation and heather grassland area whilst most gb catchments possess a small area of heather grassland it is the catchments of northern britain that generally have greater areas the inclusion of heather grassland increased the r2 to 0 72 from 0 77 the best model for hco3 r2 0 77 included the catchment percentages of carbonate and sedimentary sandstone rocks and the base flow index bfi positive coefficients and the percentage of heather grassland and average annual precipitation negative coefficients table 2 in a similar manner to the dic model the inclusion of the land cover variable heather grassland increased the model r2 from 0 69 to 0 77 the initial regression model for free co2 concentrations used only catchment characteristics in the pool of potential explanatory variables it had an r2 value of 0 50 and included altitude negative coefficient and neutral grassland positive coefficient a second model based on the river macro nutrient concentrations tn tp and doc produced an r2 of 0 72 table 3 no improvement was found in model prediction using po4 p and no3 n as they were highly correlated with tp and tn r 0 99 and r 0 98 respectively 3 4 spatial distribution of dic hco3 and free co2 flux kt yr 1 from rivers to the coastal sea fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of dic hco3 and free co2 flux from rivers across great britain the total flux t yr 1 of these species largely reflected catchment size which scales with total water discharge a total combined flux of dic of 647 kt dic yr 1 was calculated from the sampled rivers as hco3 is the predominant species in the samples the annual flux was 636 kt c yr 1 and for free co2 c it was 47 6 kt c yr 1 3 5 spatial distribution of dic hco3 and free co2 yield t km 2 yr 1 catchment estimates of dic fluxes were converted to estimates of yield t c km 2 yr 1 with the range varying between 1 3 and 33 3 t c km 2 yr 1 for the rivers helmsdale and stour respectively fig 5a other than the stour catchment which is chalk dominated higher dictotal yield was associated with catchments on the western side of gb where there is generally greater precipitation resulting in higher drainage a similar pattern was found for hco3 fig 5b for free co2 yield t c km 2 yr 1 the smaller upland catchments of scotland had the highest yields fig 5c the larger agricultural catchments and lowland catchments of southern england had lower yields 3 6 modelling yield of dic species using catchment landcover characteristics using stepwise regression the significant land cover and catchment variables for predicting dic yield were carbonate rocks and acid grassland positive coefficients and peat negative coefficient the model had an r2 of 0 37 table 4 for hco3 the coefficients were similar to those for dic table 5 the stepwise regression for free co2 yield table 6 had an r2 0 67 and the coefficients selected were negative for both the area of arable agriculture in catchments and bfi 4 discussion 4 1 dic budgets and their contribution to terrestrial c loss a combined total doc and dic flux of 938 kt was estimated in the 39 river systems with flow data sampled in 2017 the 2017 flux of dic to the estuaries 647 kt dic yr 1 is more than double the estimated doc export of 290 kt for the same rivers and time period as reported by williamson et al 2021 the dic contribution is therefore 69 of total gb aquatic carbon export similarly dic accounted for 63 of dissolved carbon export in a global analysis of river dissolved carbon flux li et al 2017 a recent study of 39 years of harmonised monitoring scheme data suggested that dic accounted for an average of 80 of the total tdc flux from the uk s 7 largest rivers severn thames trent wye great ouse ouse tay jarvie et al 2017 dic export from the same rivers in our one year study comprised on average 78 of the tdc flux demonstrating excellent comparability thus our study confirms that dic makes a dominant contribution to the gb annual land ocean c budget for the doc results in this survey williamson et al 2021 modelled an annual export of doc from gb of 1150 kt c yr 1 which produced an upscaling factor of 3 96 from the survey results to gb scale this figure was used to obtain a first order estimate dic flux for gb of 2560 kt c yr 1 for 2017 this estimate is within the range of 2000 3000 kt c yr 1 modelled using the ltls macro nutrient model for gb bell et al 2021 the dic yields t c km 2 yr 1 determined in this survey are of similar magnitude to those reported previously for the long term hms monitoring dataset of the uk jarvie et al 2017 yields from the 246 rivers in the harmonised monitoring scheme hms ranged from 6 8 t c km 2 yr 1 in the tay to 17 7 t c km 2 yr 1 in the yorkshire ouse and trent over the years 1974 2012 dic yields calculated from the 2017 survey range from 1 2 t c km 2 yr 1 for the helmsdale which wasn t available as part of the hms dataset in the jarvie et al 2017 analysis to 33 3 t c km 2 yr 1 for the stour the mean dic values for the two surveys were compared where data n 35 existed si 9 an r2 of 0 95 was found with a slope of 0 99 between the two sets of data suggesting that concentrations were largely comparable even though they represent two very different time periods i e 36 years for the hms monitoring dataset and 1 year in the current study with respect to the 2017 survey precipitation was close to the long term average https www metoffice gov uk about us press office news weather and climate 2017 weather review of 2017 with a uk average of 1106 mm being 95 9 of the long term average 1981 2010 this comparison suggests the 2017 results are not biased towards an extreme dry or wet year 4 2 controls on dic and hco3 concentrations dic and hco3 concentrations were strongly associated with geology and geomorphology i e rock type altitude and precipitation the important variables driving the concentration of dic and hco3 are identified in the regression models tables 1 2 the relationships between these variables and dic concentrations are demonstrated in plots si 10 high concentrations of dic and hco3 were found in catchments with a large percentage of either carbonate or sedimentary sandstone e g severn sedimentary sandstones contain carbonate cements in their mineral matrices and are a known additional source of hco3 through the weathering of this cement the graphs in si 10 show that there are no direct relationships between of carbonate and sandstone in catchments and the dic concentrations catchments will often contain both of these lithologies and the form of carbonate rocks may be chalk limestone or both the regression models identify the relative contributions of both rivers draining silicate rocks e g spey dee scotland and tay produced the lowest concentrations of dic and hco3 5 mg l 1 a global analysis of the contributions of major rock types to drawdown of co2 through weathering reactions identified the importance of carbonate and sedimentary sandstone suchet et al 2003 basalts are particularly recognised for their ability to draw down co2 through ca and mg silicate weathering whilst the magnitude is less for shales suchet et al 2005 however none of the monitored catchments had large percentages of shale or basalt geology the chalk limestone and sedimentary sandstone lithologies also contribute to high catchment base flow identified as positive coefficients in both the dic and hco3 concentration models the relationship between base flow and dic concentrations is shown in si 10 a negative relationship between dic and hco3 concentrations with annual precipitation was reported in the models and shown in si 10 altitude was also identified by the regression models and had a strong negative relationship see si 10 the influence of altitude and precipitation is linked firstly at the highest mean altitudes catchments are predominantly comprised of non carbonate geology secondly as altitude increases the contribution of soil derived dic decreases as a result of shorter growing seasons typically thinner soils and reduced annual mean temperatures that constrain rates of ecosystem respiration and weathering altitude and prevailing wind direction also create the precipitation gradient from west to east across gb the negative coefficients for average annual precipitation in the dic and hco3 concentration models likely identifies the lowland drier areas in the south east of the country that also tend to have the highest percentages of carbonate geology within catchments the inclusion of heather grassland as a land cover variable in both the dic and hco3 concentration models where it increased r2 by small amounts is likely acting as a proxy for acid peaty soils and accounting for extra variability regarding low dic and hco3 the dic and hco3 concentration models demonstrate the influence of geology and other associated physical gradients e g altitude average annual precipitation on the spatial pattern of their concentrations previous studies have suggested some human influences on river dic concentrations particularly around land use change raymond et al 2008 urbanisation barnes and raymond 2009 or the use of soil liming materials e g oh and raymond 2006 stets et al 2014 in this study it is the large agricultural and urbanised catchments of southern england where greater human impacts on dic concentrations may be expected however indicators of human impact such as catchment population and the area of catchment urbanisation were not identified within the regression analysis whilst the regression models were based on mfw concentrations of dic and hco3 seasonal and water flow influences were also examined these are shown for individual rivers in si 11 12 overall there was relatively little influence of either season or flow on concentrations of dic and hco3 si 11 12 for those catchments with greater chalk and sandstone based catchments avon great ouse stour test thames trent there were slightly higher concentrations of dic in the winter jan mar 4 3 catchment controls on dic yield the total flux t yr 1 of dic and hco3 from catchments largely reflected catchment size and average annual precipitation which promotes the flushing of the products of silicate weathering and respiration öquist et al 2009 when flux is converted to yield t km 2 yr 1 the effect of precipitation is apparent for much of the country with only the small chalk based stour catchment having a high yield when compared to western gb both the dic and hco3 yield models were parameterised using the variables carbonate rocks peat and acid grassland whilst the carbonate rock and peat variables describe the end points of catchment geochemistry with respect to dic concentrations the acid grassland represents the best descriptor of catchments with high precipitation and soils with ph values 5 5 thus a greater proportion of dic and hco3 may be derived from soil respiration and silicate weathering and flushed from the terrestrial system through high rates of rainfall and runoff acid grassland is predominantly found in the wetter western and northern parts of gb see si 5 and highlights the influence of precipitation and altitude in addition many of the large catchments e g thames chalk limestone severn sandstone trent sandstone and limestone and great ouse chalk have large areas where precipitation effectively recharges major groundwater aquifers which will result in lower surface runoff to river systems thus whilst the geology may largely control concentrations of dic and hco3 the distribution of precipitation is a key variable for yield the importance of annual average precipitation was also seen in the doc yield model produced from results of this sampling program williamson et al 2021 for the yield of doc across gb a model that explained 90 of the variability was obtained with only three variables annual average precipitation peat soils and forest 4 4 catchment controls on concentrations of free co2 beyond the estimation of dic flux and yield particular interest lies in the factors that contribute to the concentration and spatial distribution of free co2 in the river waters this pool is potentially available for atmospheric exchange harley et al 2015 it has been shown that as catchment size increases the residence time increases and concentrations of free co2 c may reflect more in stream processes rather than catchment processes particularly groundwater inputs as stream water will get close to epco2 1 worrall and lancaster 2005 sources of free co2 from terrestrial ecosystems include soils and groundwater it can also be generated within river particularly through the respiration of terrestrial and autochthonous derived doc results showed that the large southern catchments with a high percentage of carbonate geology generally had relatively high concentrations of dissolved free co2 fig 3c although it may be expected that because of their higher water ph values a smaller fraction of the dic would exist as free co2 two catchments in particular had very high free co2 concentrations firstly the river mersey possibly due to large sewage effluent contributions as previously identified by jarvie et al 2017 secondly the halladale the most northerly catchment which had high epco2 year round but had a dramatic increase in epco2 in september 2017 reaching 20 x atmospheric co2 the halladale catchment drains the large flow country blanket bog and flushing of free co2 from catchment respiration is suspected as the likely cause here concentrations of free co2 were of similar magnitude to those found by rawlins et al 2014 who estimated median free co2 concentrations in may and november across england and wales as 1 78 and 1 11 mg c l 1 respectively lower and upper 95 confidence intervals were 1 97 and 1 47 mg l 1 for may and 0 91 and 1 24 mg l 1 for november dawson et al 2002 generally found concentrations 2 mg l 1 for free co2 in streams in peat dominated catchments in scotland and wales although concentrations increased in areas of greater and thicker peat coverage where gas retention in water may be higher and streams are more strongly coupled to the terrestrial environment and the super saturated soil pore waters therein the initial regression model identifying catchment controls on free co2 gave a negative coefficient for altitude and a positive coefficient for neutral grassland these variables suggest that greater concentrations of free co2 were found in low altitude catchments however the percentage of free co2 as a fraction of dic in the low altitude catchments is the lowest in our survey 2 3 and it may be that free co2 is highest in these catchments simply because dic is highest these catchments also have the highest water ph along with temperatures these may influence the dic speciation and are accounted for in the calculation by thincarb of epco2 however when macro nutrients tn tp doc were used to model free co2 concentrations an improved model was found table 3 thus the concentration of free co2 in the river waters at the river estuary interface appears to reflect the macro nutrient status of the whole catchment which in term suggests a relationship with land use intensity however in the regression model arable agriculture population and urban area were not identified as explanatory variables this may reflect the fact that some large urban areas or large parts of them are below the tidal limit e g london but also that greater population and land use intensity are found at lower altitudes and are accounted for within this variable the lack of relationship with arable land extent may simply reflect the dominance of grassland agriculture at a gb scale which may therefore exert the greatest influence on river macronutrient concentrations there appeared to be little effect of free co2 derived from groundwater sources pitman 1978 worrall and lancaster 2005 this is likely a reflection of the dominance of proximal sources of co2 in the lower river reaches and the distal sources of co2 from groundwater higher up in the catchments subsequent calcite precipitation in addition to co2 degassing with travel from the source may reduce free co2 concentrations from groundwater sources e g neal et al 2002 increased soil respiration bought on by agricultural fertilisation borges et al 2018 in the catchment has been identified in river waters over prolonged periods regional increases in stream co2 evasion are positively correlated with total precipitation with increased flushing from the soil a contributory factor butman and raymond 2011 dawson et al 2002 in addition nutrients released from sewage effluent will contribute to in stream production of free co2 marescaux et al 2018 wang et al 2017 however an additional groundwater influence may exist through the release of nutrients particularly nitrate from those rivers with a high base flow index bfi wang et al 2013a 2013b further evidence as to the role of nutrients in the concentrations of free co2 are the strong relationships between tn and tp and po4 p and no3 n with both altitude and annual average precipitation si 13 and si 14 these relationships suggest that nutrient enrichment and resulting higher rates of microbial respiration in the more intensive agricultural lowland catchments are a driver of free co2 concentrations these catchments have high population density and large nutrient load contributions from sewage effluent ascott et al 2016 jarvie et al 2018 holden et al 2017 bowes et al 2011 4 5 the flux and yield of free co2 the flux to estuaries and potentially to the atmosphere of co2 in 2017 was 47 6 kt for the 39 rivers where estimates could be quantified fig 4c the only other available figure was a modelled estimate rawlins et al 2014 based on the alkalinity of headwater streams analysed through the national geochemical sampling program g base johnson et al 2005 the rawlins et al 2014 study produced an estimate of co2 loss from england and wales 68 of gb landmass of 65 4 kt with 95 confidence limit of 46 1 77 2 kt the figures of uncertainty quoted are associated with the prediction of pco2 concentrations and do not account for the uncertainties in the computation of flow or with stream temperature estimation used to compute henry s constant these would also be of relevance in this study both the current and rawlins et al 2014 estimates should be considered high as both assume complete co2 evasion indeed the higher ph in coastal waters where co2 evasion is likely to occur would change the carbonate speciation such that free co2 is converted to hco3 free co2 in seawater is typically 0 5 of dic nevertheless this flux is likely to contribute to substantial co2 evasion as measured in gb estuarine waters yang et al 2019 whilst the rawlins et al 2014 estimate covers a larger area it does not include the significant losses of co2 from the peatlands of scotland which are only partially accounted for in the estimates from our study for free co2 fig 5c there was a strong pattern of increased yield t km2 yr 1 from catchments on the western side of gb likely influenced by high average annual precipitation and thus runoff in addition the lower ph values of the rivers would ensure that free co2 would represent a higher proportion of the lower dic concentrations the chalk based catchments of southern england had lower yields of free co2 possibly reflecting both higher water ph favouring hco3 longer residence times allowing degassing of groundwater derived epco2 as well as lower precipitation the lower yields may also partly reflect the effects of groundwater recharge on river flows in these lowland permeable catchments estimates of free co2 export from catchments in this paper are based on samples collected close to the tidal maximum before entering the estuarine system therefore this probably only represents a proportion of co2 that has evaded from catchments losses of catchment co2 through evasion can be greater than that carried as dissolved gas downstream billett and moore 2008 other sources of catchment co2 evasion include surface waters such as ponds lakes and reservoirs tranvik et al 2009 peat and bog ecosystems along with the head waters and tributaries of the major rivers estimates of co2 evasion from catchment surface waters have been placed at 10 sun et al 2011 and 70 hope et al 2001 of net ecosystem exchange at the continental scale and peatland catchment scale respectively headwater streams in particular have been identified as co2 sources within catchments with evasion being driven by turbulence generated by steep slopes rough channel bottoms and high velocity maurice et al 2017 our river estuary free co2 yields may therefore represent only a small fraction of the co2 evasion that occurs within the catchment with much degassed to the atmosphere upstream of the sampling points the model predicting free co2 yield t km 2 yr 1 had coefficients which were negative for both arable and bfi suggesting that the larger intensive agricultural catchments and chalk based ones with high bfi and lower proportion of dic as free co2 had a lower potential co2 evasion per km2 this likely reflects their lower annual average precipitation and the greater recharge to aquifers as they had relatively high concentrations of co2 this also suggests that groundwater does not act as a large source of epco2 at the tidal limit in the chalk and limestone dominated catchments because of the greater residence time of the water in rivers based on the total area of land our survey covered and the total flux 47 6 kt a yield of 0 56 t c km 2 yr 1 can be derived which is slightly higher than the 0 44 t c km 2 yr 1 figure that rawlins et al 2014 published for england and wales for two peat dominated streams in scotland dawson et al 2002 reported yields of 0 26 and 0 87 t c km 2 there remains uncertainty in global estimates of co2 flux from riverine and freshwater systems to the atmosphere with values estimated to be up to 4 gt c yr 1 drake et al 2017 regardless the figure obtained from the current study suggests a considerable export from terrestrial to estuarine systems where co2 evasion may occur laruelle et al 2017 examining ocean air fluxes of co2 on the nw european shelf kitidis et al 2019 suggest that most river borne c losses largely occur within estuaries with co2 accounting for much of this c loss whilst estuarine co2 efflux is biased towards large estuaries as these are where work is often focused these large estuaries are also likely to be more urbanised industrial and have longer residence times for co2 efflux to occur 4 6 potential responses to environmental change the current dic concentration results are very similar to ones taken from a 30 year dataset si 9 however the flux of dic from terrestrial ecosystems to the ocean may become more variable in the future with land use and climate temperature and precipitation change potentially acting as drivers ren et al 2015 raymond and hamilton 2018 acknowledge the difficulties in assessing chemical weathering because of the numerous interacting biotic and abiotic processes that have to be considered in assessing landscape level controls even before the added complications of anthropogenic disturbances however future uk climate projections of increased probabilities of higher rainfall and temperature met office 2019 may introduce greater seasonal and spatial variability into the dic cycle possibly due to changes in chemical weathering rates and runoff white blum 1995 oliva et al 2003 dessert et al 2003 temperature is less likely to induce major changes in dic concentrations in the carbonate geology chalk limestone of gb it is recognised that soil pco2 can be controlled by temperature and soil moisture which help determine ecosystem respiration romero mujalli et al 2019 and it would be expected that higher pco2 concentrations would increase chemical weathering however in a global river study of rivers in carbonate rock based catchments a temperature effect was identified whereby river alkalinity concentrations appear to reach a maximum before declining at land temperatures 11 c gaillardet et al 2019 this was primarily due to the role temperature plays on solubility in the carbonate system whilst increased temperatures may increase pco2 through respiration cold water would be expected to contain greater co2 leading to calcite dissolution being favoured at lower temperatures thus the temperature effect on carbonate dissolution intensity represents a balance of two competing mechanisms the effect of increasing temperature on the thermodynamic constants of the carbonate system particularly in decreasing henry s constant countered by the increase in production of ecosystem soil co2 gaillardet et al 2019 other processes that may impact changes in dic may involve the precipitation of secondary carbonates higher temperatures will increase soil respiration leading to increased pco2 and during carbonate dissolution the water will equilibrate with the higher pco2 in soils when the water comes into contact with air degassing of co2 will increase the ph promoting carbonate precipitation gaillardet et al 2019 on the other hand ca and mg silicate weathering may be expected to increase with temperature without the same mineral precipitation constraints as those found for carbonate based rocks and unlike carbonates this weathering will be effective at drawing down co2 gaillardet et al 1999 however changes are most likely to occur in runoff due to changes in seasonal precipitation and this may alter seasonal flux and yield results from this study have demonstrated the effect of relatively greater precipitation and runoff on dic fluxes across the country to add to the complexity of the dic system increasing temperature may increase soil respiration and also influence evapotranspiration rates leading to changes in runoff and silicate weathering kelly et al 1998 richter and billings 2015 land use change may also influence the future dic budget in agriculture the expected trend is that there may be an increase in the area of arable farmland with a decrease in grassland and continued reforestation and urban area expansion ccc 2020 to demonstrate the influence that different vegetation types have on dic export kindler et al 2011 examined losses of biogenically derived dic from grasslands forests and croplands across europe they found leaching of biogenic dic to be 8 3 4 9 g m 2 yr 1 for forests 24 1 7 2 g m 2 yr 1 for grassland and 4 1 1 3 g m 2 yr 1 for crop systems this would suggest that any shift towards either arable and forest land coverage may alter dic export concentrations of co2 have been found to be significantly higher in grasslands than forests because of the greater rates of root and microbial respiration and because greater soil wetness reduces diffusion rates parfitt et al 1997 in addition if fertilised there is the potential for increases in soil respiration strong acid production through nitrification and weathering raymond and hamilton 2018 urbanisation within catchments may also impact dic budgets through increasing sewage effluent discharges and urban diffuse runoff from impermeable surfaces barnes and raymond 2009 differentiating the role of land use in dic loss to surface waters can be difficult to decouple from lithology and surficial materials but some studies have found a possible response to urban areas for example barnes and raymond 2009 demonstrated that both agricultural and urban areas can enhance stream water dic concentrations relative to forestry in a series of small catchments on the same bedrock and superficial geology those catchments with greater percentages of urban areas had higher dic exports this confirms other studies demonstrating increases in dic observed in urban areas baker et al 2008 jarvie et al 2017 sources of dic within urban systems may include weathering of caco3 in concrete and the weathering of limestone road capping baker et al 2008 raymond and hamilton 2018 however in our study the role of urban areas within catchments did not significantly improve model performance possibly because there were strong links to altitude since major urban areas are located in the lowland catchments finally increasing attention is being given to enhanced rock weathering i e application of basaltic rock to agricultural land as a means of removing co2 from the atmosphere beerling et al 2020 this has been estimated to have a maximum technical potential for the uk of 19 mt co2 yr 1 to greenhouse gas removal in the uk simon et al 2021 while large scale implementation of enhanced weathering as a climate mitigation measure is unlikely in the near term even modest implementation could lead to measurable changes in the gb dic flux the application of agricultural liming has previously been identified in dic fluxes oh and raymond 2006 potential exists for increased hco3 flux to rivers and the increased precipitation of ca mg and fe carbonates in soils in this context our data provides an update on current dic flux and a valuable baseline against which to monitor and verify any additional co2 drawdown resulting from this process and to support the assessment of any biogeochemical or ecological impacts 5 conclusions results from a year long survey of 41 rivers across gb representing 36 of the landmass and where land cover was representative of the whole of great britain are reported dic represented 69 of the total dissolved carbon flux from the surveyed catchments the concentration flux and yield recorded for dic species supported previous published gb estimates based on data collected between 10 and 30 years old the study suggests that river dic and hco3 concentrations are largely controlled by catchment geology whilst average annual precipitation influenced flux and yield an average dic yield of 8 13 t ha 1 yr 1 was calculated from the survey results concentrations of dissolved free co2 appeared to be related to catchment macro nutrient status with probable sources being both from agriculture and urban land uses sewage treatment understanding this pool of dissolved co2 is of importance as it is a source of greenhouse gas emission through evasion to the atmosphere whilst increases in free co2 concentrations were linked to the lowland agricultural and densely populated catchments yield estimates t c km 2 yr 1 identified the northern peat dominated catchments as being of great importance an overall yield of 0 56 t c km 2 yr 1 of free co2 was found for the sampled catchments the results provide further evidence of the importance of land ocean c fluxes in the national c budget and offers an updated baseline for dic land ocean transport in gb author contributions funding acquisition richard sanders

corrado corradini associate editor frédéric huneau dissolved inorganic carbon dic fluxes from the land to ocean have been quantified for many rivers globally however co2 fluxes to the atmosphere from inland waters are quantitatively significant components of the global carbon cycle that are currently poorly constrained understanding the relative contributions of natural and human impacted processes on the dic cycle within catchments may provide a basis for developing improved management strategies to mitigate free co2 concentrations in rivers and subsequent evasion to the atmosphere here a large internally consistent dataset collected from 41 catchments across great britain gb accounting for 36 of land area 83 997 km2 and representative of national land cover was used to investigate catchment controls on riverine dissolved inorganic carbon dic bicarbonate hco3 and free co2 concentrations fluxes to the coastal sea and annual yields per unit area of catchment estimated dic flux to sea for the survey catchments was 647 kt dic yr 1 which represented 69 of the total dissolved carbon flux from these catchments generally those catchments with large proportions of carbonate and sedimentary sandstone were found to deliver greater dic and hco3 to the ocean the calculated mean free co2 yield for survey catchments i e potential co2 emission to the atmosphere was 0 56 t c km 2 yr 1 regression models demonstrated that whilst river dic r2 0 77 and hco3 r2 0 77 concentrations are largely explained by the geology of the landmass along with a negative correlation to annual precipitation free co2 concentrations were strongly linked to catchment macronutrient status overall dic dominates dissolved c inputs to coastal waters meaning that estuarine carbon dynamics are sensitive to underlying geology and therefore are likely to be reasonably constant in contrast potential losses of carbon to the atmosphere via dissolved co2 which likely constitute a significant fraction of net terrestrial ecosystem production and hence the national carbon budget may be amenable to greater direct management via altering patterns of land use keywords catchments rivers dissolved inorganic carbon free co2 macro nutrients survey data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the transport of dissolved inorganic carbon dic via streams and rivers to estuaries is a significant part of the global c cycle linking terrestrial oceanic and atmospheric environments meybeck 1993 ludwig et al 1998 dupré et al 2003 aufdenkampe et al 2011 ciais et al 2014 the importance of the dic cycle over geological periods occurs via the weathering of ca or mg silicate rocks which consumes co2 and produces alkalinity berner 1998 suchet et al 2003 however much current interest concerns freshwater and estuarine environments super saturated with co2 that act as a source of greenhouse gases rawlins et al 2014 hunt et al 2014 kitidis et al 2019 regnier et al 2022 a recent estimate indicated that inland waters receive 1 7 pg c yr 1 of terrestrial carbon transported from soils ciais et al 2014 of this 0 2 pg is buried in aquatic sediments and 0 7 pg is returned to the atmosphere via gas exchange the remaining 0 8 pg is transported to the oceans as dissolved inorganic and organic carbon and particulate organic carbon dic equilibrates into multiple forms in natural waters bicarbonate hco3 carbonate co3 2 and carbonic acid h2co3 and dissolved free co2 the concentrations of which vary temporally and spatially in streams and rivers and with ph and water temperature being key controls on speciation jarvie et al 2017 major natural influences on concentrations and fluxes of dic include catchment lithology and mineralogy mineral weathering rates altitude and climate chaplot and mutema 2021 kindler et al 2011 suchet et al 2003 catchment lithology is a major control with carbonate dominated catchments typically providing the highest hco3 and co3 2 concentrations in great britain gb this is demonstrated where dic in carbonate rock dominated catchments typically exceeds 40 mg l 1 whilst in catchments where there are few or no carbonate bearing rocks concentrations are typically 10 mg l 1 jarvie et al 2017 altitude and climate also strongly influence catchment dic flux and speciation as they influence temperature and precipitation which act as controls on catchment respiration soil and vegetation hydrology and the transport of dic produced from weathering reactions drake et al 2020 soil derived co2 is reported to account for 67 of dic in the world s rivers amiotte suchet et al 1999 the natural catchment processes that integrate to produce riverine dic fluxes operate over a variety of timescales raymond and hamilton 2018 suggest that dic fluxes are based on the availability and reactivity of minerals for weathering supply limitation the transport of solutes transport limitation and volume and residence time of water passing through the system reaction limitation on top of these natural dic producing processes anthropogenic activities such as those associated with climate warming acid precipitation mining and construction have been identified as perturbing riverine dic fluxes drake et al 2020 neal et al 2000 raymond and hamilton 2018 ren et al 2015 increasingly the impacts of agriculture borges et al 2018 raymond and hamilton 2018 and urbanisation jarvie et al 1997 2004 baker et al 2008 marescaux et al 2018 wang et al 2017 within catchments are recognised as contributing to changing river dic flux much of this derives from increases in catchment macro nutrient status with much research focusing on the increase and evasion potential of greenhouse gases billett and harvey 2013 marescaux et al 2018 it is evident that human impacts can change the dic cycle however changes to the dic cycle are unlikely to be in isolation from other biogeochemical cycles greater understanding of the interactions of these cycles is needed for example how perturbations to coupled p n and c cycles impact degassing of co2 from rivers management solutions aimed at reducing nutrient inputs to rivers e g improved nutrient management implementation of agricultural conservation practices and improvements in sewage treatment are being increasingly used whilst newer ideas such as re balancing macro nutrient stoichiometry within catchments are being developed stutter et al 2018 graeber et al 2021 in addition technologies being suggested to mitigate rising co2 levels may also influence exports of dic in future for example the application of ground basalt to soils appears to be a technology gaining support as a form of greenhouse gas removal as a means of accelerating chemical weathering and subsequent drawdown of co2 beerling et al 2020 kelland et al 2020 improved understanding and quantification of the responses of the dic cycle to land use change and management are therefore required for modelling of c fluxes from land to oceans and atmosphere key uncertainties include i understanding the extent to which land use impacts the underlying geological geomorphological weathering and catchment processes ii identifying the main drivers of co2 flux to the atmosphere and dic flux to the sea and iii gas transfer velocities which are still poorly constrained these uncertainties are demonstrated in reports where global co2 evasion from inland waters has been estimated as being up to 4 gt c yr 1 ciais et al 2014 raymond et al 2013 drake et al 2017 this paper addresses the first two of these uncertainties through a year long sampling survey in which 41 rivers were sampled with catchments covering 36 of the gb landmass the results focus on the spatial concentrations mg l 1 fluxes kt yr 1 and yields t km 2 yr 1 of dic hco3 as the dominant aqueous species and free co2 the work explores how current land use and human activities may impact the natural background gradient controls on dic concentrations flux and yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 survey outline great britain gb scotland wales and england has a temperate climate it is considerably smaller in size than some of the major basins including the congo drake et al 2020 and the mississippi raymond and hamilton 2018 where previous experimental work on dic has been undertaken and it has a number of geographical gradients jarvie et al 1997 2017 that have been recognised as fundamental controls on riverine dic flux and yield the survey sampled rivers n 41 that drain 36 of gb defined as being both

2 5 gb has north south and west east trends in both geology and altitude typically catchments with large proportions of carbonate based sedimentary rock are situated in southern and eastern gb whilst catchments predominantly comprised of weathering resistant silicate rocks are found to the north and west altitude influences both precipitation and temperature and follows a similar pattern with the highest altitude catchments generally in the north and west with the prevailing wind coming from the southwest and higher land elevation predominantly in the west precipitation follows a gradient from west to east land cover reflects the intensity of soils agriculture and urbanisation soils generally track geology and are more acidic and organic rich in the north and west of the country whilst more alkaline mineral soils are found in the south and east of the country in the south eastern quarter of gb the topography and climate are more conducive to intensive agriculture with upland agriculture and peatland dominating landscapes in the north and west 2 2 sampling and collection methods a major aim of the survey was to ensure a consistency of approach equipment and methodologies for calculating riverine carbon fluxes tye et al 2020 samples for specific determinants were analysed by one laboratory for the duration of the project rivers were sampled monthly from january 2017 to december 2017 samples were collected during the third week of each month to minimise within month temporal variation between catchments especially variation associated with antecedent weather water samples were taken from the centre of the river or from fast flowing water away from the river bank water temperature and conductivity were measured and recorded immediately after sample collection samples for ph and alkalinity were collected unfiltered into 250 ml hdpe bottles to overflowing and sealed to avoid potential changes in speciation due to gaseous exchange samples were distributed after collection to their respective analytical centres under cool conditions ice bags and ice packs using overnight couriers 2 3 laboratory analysis a skalar sp10 robotic auto sampler connected to an inolab 730 ph meter with a sentix 60 probe was used to measure ph alkalinity was determined by titration using a metrohm 814 sample processor and metrohm 888 titrando diluter which undertakes analyses using automatically predefined methods analyses of total dissolved carbon tdc and non purgeable organic carbon npoc were used to calculate dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations a shimadzu toc l analyser was used to measure npoc in filtered and acidified 1 m hcl samples the method to determine tdc was the same as above without the acidification and purge step to remove inorganic carbon williamson et al 2021 limits of detection for npoc and tdc were 0 6 mg c l 1 see si 9 for sampling and analysis details of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp 2 4 use of the thincarb model for calculating dissolved inorganic carbon speciation and excess 2 4 1 partial pressure of carbon dioxide from ph and alkalinity the thincarb model thermodynamic modelling of inorganic carbon jarvie et al 2017 uses ph temperature and gran alkalinity alkgran measurements to calculate dissolved inorganic carbon concentration and speciation from excess partial pressure of co2 epco2 x atmospheric pressure in the water sample compared to the dissolved co2 concentration found in pure water in equilibrium with the atmosphere at the same temperature and pressure thincarb is open access and is described in detail in jarvie et al 2017 an outline is provided in si 6 thincarb works effectively across the range ph 6 and 10 in our dataset n 521 6 samples 1 15 were found to be below ph 6 with the highest ph value being 9 29 the total sum of dissolved inorganic carbon dictotal represents the sum of c concentrations in all the inorganic c species 1 dic total mg l 1 c c in hco 3 c c in h 2 c o 3 c c in c o 3 2 after speciation calculations the percentage contribution of each species in dictotal was applied to the measured by difference inorganic carbon concentration dicmeasured and used in the interpretation of survey results thus the term dic used in this paper to describe results corresponds to dicmeasured which was determined as 2 dic measured mg l 1 total dissolved carbon tdc non purgeable organic carbon npoc values of epco2 were used to estimate free co2 c concentrations in the water samples described as free co2 in text the co2 concentration equals pco2 times the solubility of co2 corrected using water temperature henry s law constant at a given temperature and salinity thus 3 free co 2 c k h x pco 2 w k h x pco 2 a where kh represents henry s law constant for freshwater and corrected for water temperature pco2 w and pco2 a are the pco2 in the surface water and the pco2 in equilibrium with the overlying air respectively wang et al 2017 2 5 ancillary data ancillary data used in the statistical and modelling analysis were the same as used in williamson et al 2021 which describes the doc results from this survey enabling consistent comparison between the dic and doc results mean catchment altitude and average annual precipitation as standard period average annual rainfall saar were included in the modelling data set both being likely key gradients for controlling dic across gb see si 3 and si 4 catchment area and land cover characteristics 14 broad habitats were obtained from the 2015 ukceh land cover map 2015 rowland et al 2017a 2017b and are shown in si 5 the different grassland types were not aggregated as they typically represent soils with different ph values e g acid or calcareous grassland or where ph may be manipulated using agricultural lime e g improved grassland thus influencing river dic concentrations see si 5 additional variables included the percentage of carbonate and sedimentary sandstone in survey catchments see si 2 these were obtained by combining uk catchment and sub catchment maps with the bgs 50 k soil parent material model and using the european soil bureau bedrock classification catchment areas of basalt and shale known to be important in co2 drawdown via silicate weathering were obtained in a similar manner however the contributions from these rocks to catchment geology was minimal estimates of catchment population were made by summing the proportion of population for each local authority area that intersected the catchment mean daily gauged river flows were obtained from the national agencies for england scotland and wales environment agency ea scottish environmental protection agency sepa and natural resources wales nrw respectively at most sites water sampling and flow gauging were located within a few hundred metres of each other flows at the gauging station were assumed to be indicative of those at the water sampling site upstream gauging data were used to estimate flows for four rivers eden mersey and welsh dee where co located flow data were not available during 2017 past annual discharge data were calculated for each comparison gauging station to ensure that total annual discharge was estimated to within 10 of observations with a correction made to the annual discharge calculation for 2017 if differences between upstream and downstream gauging stations were 10 the relationship between upstream and downstream daily flows during 2015 the most recent year with comparable data was calculated using regression analysis and daily flows for the sampling site for 2017 were estimated from the regression equation williamson et al 2021 daily flows for the conon were used to represent those in the nearby beauly assuming the same mean areal runoff for both catchments since they are similar in area and topography daily flow data for 2017 were unavailable for the dyfi whilst only half a year s data was collected for the dorset stour so these two rivers were excluded from calculations of dic flux and yield catchment mean elevation m and area along with hydrogeology including base flow index were obtained from the uk national river flow archive nrfa http nrfa ceh ac uk 2 6 data treatment all statistical analysis was undertaken using the r statistical package v3 5 1 r core team 2018 stepwise regression analysis was undertaken using the mass and leaps packages to identify the explanatory land use and hydrogeological variables that best predicted the concentrations of dic species a complete list of variables used in the regression analysis can be found in si 7 prior to running regression models correlation matrices were used to eliminate variables where co linearity was exhibited the model selected was the one which reported the lowest bayesian information criteria bic value tests for skewness were undertaken on the dependent variables and were log10 transformed if skewness was 1 or 1 epco2 values were converted into concentrations of free co2 prior to models being parameterised for river free co2 concentrations initial modelling was carried out using the above dataset and a second dataset of river mean macronutrient concentrations collated from the survey data dic fluxes were calculated using method 5 of littlewood et al 1998 to be consistent with data analysis for the doc component of the study undertaken in williamson et al 2021 some underestimation may occur using such methods as compared to using high resolution data worrall et al 2013 method 5 is detailed in eq 4 whereby k specifies a conversion factor for the length of sampling ci refers to the doc concentration at sampling time i qi refers to flow at sampling time i qt refers to the mean flow over the whole sampling period and n is the number of samples taken 4 dic flux k i 1 n c i q i i 1 n q i q t stepwise regression analysis was again undertaken on the annual river flux estimates to identify the explanatory variables that most likely explained the annual flux across gb 3 results 3 1 initial dataset the relationship between the thincarb modelled dic data and the measured by subtraction alkalinity results si 8 was significant y 0 9525 0 4572 r2 0 99 n 518 giving confidence to the interpretation of the modelling results some over prediction of dic occurred when doc concentrations were high due to the greater role for organic c buffers such as organic acids jarvie et al 2017 fig 2 describes the range of concentrations of dic species for the entire survey mg c l 1 for dic hco3 co3 2 and h2co3 as expected for the range of ph values recorded hco3 dominated dic accounting for 80 of dic in river waters with ph 7 and 40 80 of dic in rivers with ph 7 a median hco3 concentration of 10 mg c l 1 was found the highest values 95th percentile for hco3 exceeded 57 mg c l 1 and were associated with two rivers stour and the great ouse in eastern england with high proportions of chalk geology 44 and 95 respectively within their catchments these catchments also received the two lowest annual average precipitation rates 580 and 587 mm yr 1 respectively the contribution of co3 2 was low across the sites with a median value 1 mg c l 1 whilst h2co3 concentrations were generally 2 mg c l 1 most samples had epco2 values 1 representing oversaturation with respect to atmospheric co2 partial pressure and suggesting potential efflux of co2 from rivers to the atmosphere only 2 of epco2 results had values 1 indicating under saturation with respect to atmospheric pressure suggesting potential influx of co2 to rivers from the atmosphere the 95th percentile value of epco2 results was 9 6 atmospheric partial pressure and the highest estimated value was 21 3 atmospheric partial pressure 3 2 spatial patterns of dicmeasured hco3 and free co2 concentrations across gb the highest flow weighted mean concentrations of dic were found in england and southern scotland fig 3a and the lowest concentrations were found in the west of england wales and north eastern scotland this pattern demonstrates the role of the catchment bedrock geology particularly those with high proportions of carbonate rocks on dic concentrations flow weighted mean hco3 concentrations showed a similar pattern as hco3 generally makes up the greatest proportion of dic in these catchments fig 3b the spatial pattern of concentrations of free co2 mg c l 1 fig 3c showed the highest concentrations in the peat dominated halladale catchment and the river mersey in northwest england catchments in the west of scotland along with the large lowland agricultural catchments of southern gb also demonstrated relatively high concentrations of free co2 3 3 modelling concentrations of dic species using catchment land cover and catchment characteristics the best fit model to predict dic had an r2 of 0 77 table 1 in this model dic was positively correlated with the percentages of carbonate rocks and sedimentary sandstone within the catchment and negatively correlated with average annual precipitation and heather grassland area whilst most gb catchments possess a small area of heather grassland it is the catchments of northern britain that generally have greater areas the inclusion of heather grassland increased the r2 to 0 72 from 0 77 the best model for hco3 r2 0 77 included the catchment percentages of carbonate and sedimentary sandstone rocks and the base flow index bfi positive coefficients and the percentage of heather grassland and average annual precipitation negative coefficients table 2 in a similar manner to the dic model the inclusion of the land cover variable heather grassland increased the model r2 from 0 69 to 0 77 the initial regression model for free co2 concentrations used only catchment characteristics in the pool of potential explanatory variables it had an r2 value of 0 50 and included altitude negative coefficient and neutral grassland positive coefficient a second model based on the river macro nutrient concentrations tn tp and doc produced an r2 of 0 72 table 3 no improvement was found in model prediction using po4 p and no3 n as they were highly correlated with tp and tn r 0 99 and r 0 98 respectively 3 4 spatial distribution of dic hco3 and free co2 flux kt yr 1 from rivers to the coastal sea fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of dic hco3 and free co2 flux from rivers across great britain the total flux t yr 1 of these species largely reflected catchment size which scales with total water discharge a total combined flux of dic of 647 kt dic yr 1 was calculated from the sampled rivers as hco3 is the predominant species in the samples the annual flux was 636 kt c yr 1 and for free co2 c it was 47 6 kt c yr 1 3 5 spatial distribution of dic hco3 and free co2 yield t km 2 yr 1 catchment estimates of dic fluxes were converted to estimates of yield t c km 2 yr 1 with the range varying between 1 3 and 33 3 t c km 2 yr 1 for the rivers helmsdale and stour respectively fig 5a other than the stour catchment which is chalk dominated higher dictotal yield was associated with catchments on the western side of gb where there is generally greater precipitation resulting in higher drainage a similar pattern was found for hco3 fig 5b for free co2 yield t c km 2 yr 1 the smaller upland catchments of scotland had the highest yields fig 5c the larger agricultural catchments and lowland catchments of southern england had lower yields 3 6 modelling yield of dic species using catchment landcover characteristics using stepwise regression the significant land cover and catchment variables for predicting dic yield were carbonate rocks and acid grassland positive coefficients and peat negative coefficient the model had an r2 of 0 37 table 4 for hco3 the coefficients were similar to those for dic table 5 the stepwise regression for free co2 yield table 6 had an r2 0 67 and the coefficients selected were negative for both the area of arable agriculture in catchments and bfi 4 discussion 4 1 dic budgets and their contribution to terrestrial c loss a combined total doc and dic flux of 938 kt was estimated in the 39 river systems with flow data sampled in 2017 the 2017 flux of dic to the estuaries 647 kt dic yr 1 is more than double the estimated doc export of 290 kt for the same rivers and time period as reported by williamson et al 2021 the dic contribution is therefore 69 of total gb aquatic carbon export similarly dic accounted for 63 of dissolved carbon export in a global analysis of river dissolved carbon flux li et al 2017 a recent study of 39 years of harmonised monitoring scheme data suggested that dic accounted for an average of 80 of the total tdc flux from the uk s 7 largest rivers severn thames trent wye great ouse ouse tay jarvie et al 2017 dic export from the same rivers in our one year study comprised on average 78 of the tdc flux demonstrating excellent comparability thus our study confirms that dic makes a dominant contribution to the gb annual land ocean c budget for the doc results in this survey williamson et al 2021 modelled an annual export of doc from gb of 1150 kt c yr 1 which produced an upscaling factor of 3 96 from the survey results to gb scale this figure was used to obtain a first order estimate dic flux for gb of 2560 kt c yr 1 for 2017 this estimate is within the range of 2000 3000 kt c yr 1 modelled using the ltls macro nutrient model for gb bell et al 2021 the dic yields t c km 2 yr 1 determined in this survey are of similar magnitude to those reported previously for the long term hms monitoring dataset of the uk jarvie et al 2017 yields from the 246 rivers in the harmonised monitoring scheme hms ranged from 6 8 t c km 2 yr 1 in the tay to 17 7 t c km 2 yr 1 in the yorkshire ouse and trent over the years 1974 2012 dic yields calculated from the 2017 survey range from 1 2 t c km 2 yr 1 for the helmsdale which wasn t available as part of the hms dataset in the jarvie et al 2017 analysis to 33 3 t c km 2 yr 1 for the stour the mean dic values for the two surveys were compared where data n 35 existed si 9 an r2 of 0 95 was found with a slope of 0 99 between the two sets of data suggesting that concentrations were largely comparable even though they represent two very different time periods i e 36 years for the hms monitoring dataset and 1 year in the current study with respect to the 2017 survey precipitation was close to the long term average https www metoffice gov uk about us press office news weather and climate 2017 weather review of 2017 with a uk average of 1106 mm being 95 9 of the long term average 1981 2010 this comparison suggests the 2017 results are not biased towards an extreme dry or wet year 4 2 controls on dic and hco3 concentrations dic and hco3 concentrations were strongly associated with geology and geomorphology i e rock type altitude and precipitation the important variables driving the concentration of dic and hco3 are identified in the regression models tables 1 2 the relationships between these variables and dic concentrations are demonstrated in plots si 10 high concentrations of dic and hco3 were found in catchments with a large percentage of either carbonate or sedimentary sandstone e g severn sedimentary sandstones contain carbonate cements in their mineral matrices and are a known additional source of hco3 through the weathering of this cement the graphs in si 10 show that there are no direct relationships between of carbonate and sandstone in catchments and the dic concentrations catchments will often contain both of these lithologies and the form of carbonate rocks may be chalk limestone or both the regression models identify the relative contributions of both rivers draining silicate rocks e g spey dee scotland and tay produced the lowest concentrations of dic and hco3 5 mg l 1 a global analysis of the contributions of major rock types to drawdown of co2 through weathering reactions identified the importance of carbonate and sedimentary sandstone suchet et al 2003 basalts are particularly recognised for their ability to draw down co2 through ca and mg silicate weathering whilst the magnitude is less for shales suchet et al 2005 however none of the monitored catchments had large percentages of shale or basalt geology the chalk limestone and sedimentary sandstone lithologies also contribute to high catchment base flow identified as positive coefficients in both the dic and hco3 concentration models the relationship between base flow and dic concentrations is shown in si 10 a negative relationship between dic and hco3 concentrations with annual precipitation was reported in the models and shown in si 10 altitude was also identified by the regression models and had a strong negative relationship see si 10 the influence of altitude and precipitation is linked firstly at the highest mean altitudes catchments are predominantly comprised of non carbonate geology secondly as altitude increases the contribution of soil derived dic decreases as a result of shorter growing seasons typically thinner soils and reduced annual mean temperatures that constrain rates of ecosystem respiration and weathering altitude and prevailing wind direction also create the precipitation gradient from west to east across gb the negative coefficients for average annual precipitation in the dic and hco3 concentration models likely identifies the lowland drier areas in the south east of the country that also tend to have the highest percentages of carbonate geology within catchments the inclusion of heather grassland as a land cover variable in both the dic and hco3 concentration models where it increased r2 by small amounts is likely acting as a proxy for acid peaty soils and accounting for extra variability regarding low dic and hco3 the dic and hco3 concentration models demonstrate the influence of geology and other associated physical gradients e g altitude average annual precipitation on the spatial pattern of their concentrations previous studies have suggested some human influences on river dic concentrations particularly around land use change raymond et al 2008 urbanisation barnes and raymond 2009 or the use of soil liming materials e g oh and raymond 2006 stets et al 2014 in this study it is the large agricultural and urbanised catchments of southern england where greater human impacts on dic concentrations may be expected however indicators of human impact such as catchment population and the area of catchment urbanisation were not identified within the regression analysis whilst the regression models were based on mfw concentrations of dic and hco3 seasonal and water flow influences were also examined these are shown for individual rivers in si 11 12 overall there was relatively little influence of either season or flow on concentrations of dic and hco3 si 11 12 for those catchments with greater chalk and sandstone based catchments avon great ouse stour test thames trent there were slightly higher concentrations of dic in the winter jan mar 4 3 catchment controls on dic yield the total flux t yr 1 of dic and hco3 from catchments largely reflected catchment size and average annual precipitation which promotes the flushing of the products of silicate weathering and respiration öquist et al 2009 when flux is converted to yield t km 2 yr 1 the effect of precipitation is apparent for much of the country with only the small chalk based stour catchment having a high yield when compared to western gb both the dic and hco3 yield models were parameterised using the variables carbonate rocks peat and acid grassland whilst the carbonate rock and peat variables describe the end points of catchment geochemistry with respect to dic concentrations the acid grassland represents the best descriptor of catchments with high precipitation and soils with ph values 5 5 thus a greater proportion of dic and hco3 may be derived from soil respiration and silicate weathering and flushed from the terrestrial system through high rates of rainfall and runoff acid grassland is predominantly found in the wetter western and northern parts of gb see si 5 and highlights the influence of precipitation and altitude in addition many of the large catchments e g thames chalk limestone severn sandstone trent sandstone and limestone and great ouse chalk have large areas where precipitation effectively recharges major groundwater aquifers which will result in lower surface runoff to river systems thus whilst the geology may largely control concentrations of dic and hco3 the distribution of precipitation is a key variable for yield the importance of annual average precipitation was also seen in the doc yield model produced from results of this sampling program williamson et al 2021 for the yield of doc across gb a model that explained 90 of the variability was obtained with only three variables annual average precipitation peat soils and forest 4 4 catchment controls on concentrations of free co2 beyond the estimation of dic flux and yield particular interest lies in the factors that contribute to the concentration and spatial distribution of free co2 in the river waters this pool is potentially available for atmospheric exchange harley et al 2015 it has been shown that as catchment size increases the residence time increases and concentrations of free co2 c may reflect more in stream processes rather than catchment processes particularly groundwater inputs as stream water will get close to epco2 1 worrall and lancaster 2005 sources of free co2 from terrestrial ecosystems include soils and groundwater it can also be generated within river particularly through the respiration of terrestrial and autochthonous derived doc results showed that the large southern catchments with a high percentage of carbonate geology generally had relatively high concentrations of dissolved free co2 fig 3c although it may be expected that because of their higher water ph values a smaller fraction of the dic would exist as free co2 two catchments in particular had very high free co2 concentrations firstly the river mersey possibly due to large sewage effluent contributions as previously identified by jarvie et al 2017 secondly the halladale the most northerly catchment which had high epco2 year round but had a dramatic increase in epco2 in september 2017 reaching 20 x atmospheric co2 the halladale catchment drains the large flow country blanket bog and flushing of free co2 from catchment respiration is suspected as the likely cause here concentrations of free co2 were of similar magnitude to those found by rawlins et al 2014 who estimated median free co2 concentrations in may and november across england and wales as 1 78 and 1 11 mg c l 1 respectively lower and upper 95 confidence intervals were 1 97 and 1 47 mg l 1 for may and 0 91 and 1 24 mg l 1 for november dawson et al 2002 generally found concentrations 2 mg l 1 for free co2 in streams in peat dominated catchments in scotland and wales although concentrations increased in areas of greater and thicker peat coverage where gas retention in water may be higher and streams are more strongly coupled to the terrestrial environment and the super saturated soil pore waters therein the initial regression model identifying catchment controls on free co2 gave a negative coefficient for altitude and a positive coefficient for neutral grassland these variables suggest that greater concentrations of free co2 were found in low altitude catchments however the percentage of free co2 as a fraction of dic in the low altitude catchments is the lowest in our survey 2 3 and it may be that free co2 is highest in these catchments simply because dic is highest these catchments also have the highest water ph along with temperatures these may influence the dic speciation and are accounted for in the calculation by thincarb of epco2 however when macro nutrients tn tp doc were used to model free co2 concentrations an improved model was found table 3 thus the concentration of free co2 in the river waters at the river estuary interface appears to reflect the macro nutrient status of the whole catchment which in term suggests a relationship with land use intensity however in the regression model arable agriculture population and urban area were not identified as explanatory variables this may reflect the fact that some large urban areas or large parts of them are below the tidal limit e g london but also that greater population and land use intensity are found at lower altitudes and are accounted for within this variable the lack of relationship with arable land extent may simply reflect the dominance of grassland agriculture at a gb scale which may therefore exert the greatest influence on river macronutrient concentrations there appeared to be little effect of free co2 derived from groundwater sources pitman 1978 worrall and lancaster 2005 this is likely a reflection of the dominance of proximal sources of co2 in the lower river reaches and the distal sources of co2 from groundwater higher up in the catchments subsequent calcite precipitation in addition to co2 degassing with travel from the source may reduce free co2 concentrations from groundwater sources e g neal et al 2002 increased soil respiration bought on by agricultural fertilisation borges et al 2018 in the catchment has been identified in river waters over prolonged periods regional increases in stream co2 evasion are positively correlated with total precipitation with increased flushing from the soil a contributory factor butman and raymond 2011 dawson et al 2002 in addition nutrients released from sewage effluent will contribute to in stream production of free co2 marescaux et al 2018 wang et al 2017 however an additional groundwater influence may exist through the release of nutrients particularly nitrate from those rivers with a high base flow index bfi wang et al 2013a 2013b further evidence as to the role of nutrients in the concentrations of free co2 are the strong relationships between tn and tp and po4 p and no3 n with both altitude and annual average precipitation si 13 and si 14 these relationships suggest that nutrient enrichment and resulting higher rates of microbial respiration in the more intensive agricultural lowland catchments are a driver of free co2 concentrations these catchments have high population density and large nutrient load contributions from sewage effluent ascott et al 2016 jarvie et al 2018 holden et al 2017 bowes et al 2011 4 5 the flux and yield of free co2 the flux to estuaries and potentially to the atmosphere of co2 in 2017 was 47 6 kt for the 39 rivers where estimates could be quantified fig 4c the only other available figure was a modelled estimate rawlins et al 2014 based on the alkalinity of headwater streams analysed through the national geochemical sampling program g base johnson et al 2005 the rawlins et al 2014 study produced an estimate of co2 loss from england and wales 68 of gb landmass of 65 4 kt with 95 confidence limit of 46 1 77 2 kt the figures of uncertainty quoted are associated with the prediction of pco2 concentrations and do not account for the uncertainties in the computation of flow or with stream temperature estimation used to compute henry s constant these would also be of relevance in this study both the current and rawlins et al 2014 estimates should be considered high as both assume complete co2 evasion indeed the higher ph in coastal waters where co2 evasion is likely to occur would change the carbonate speciation such that free co2 is converted to hco3 free co2 in seawater is typically 0 5 of dic nevertheless this flux is likely to contribute to substantial co2 evasion as measured in gb estuarine waters yang et al 2019 whilst the rawlins et al 2014 estimate covers a larger area it does not include the significant losses of co2 from the peatlands of scotland which are only partially accounted for in the estimates from our study for free co2 fig 5c there was a strong pattern of increased yield t km2 yr 1 from catchments on the western side of gb likely influenced by high average annual precipitation and thus runoff in addition the lower ph values of the rivers would ensure that free co2 would represent a higher proportion of the lower dic concentrations the chalk based catchments of southern england had lower yields of free co2 possibly reflecting both higher water ph favouring hco3 longer residence times allowing degassing of groundwater derived epco2 as well as lower precipitation the lower yields may also partly reflect the effects of groundwater recharge on river flows in these lowland permeable catchments estimates of free co2 export from catchments in this paper are based on samples collected close to the tidal maximum before entering the estuarine system therefore this probably only represents a proportion of co2 that has evaded from catchments losses of catchment co2 through evasion can be greater than that carried as dissolved gas downstream billett and moore 2008 other sources of catchment co2 evasion include surface waters such as ponds lakes and reservoirs tranvik et al 2009 peat and bog ecosystems along with the head waters and tributaries of the major rivers estimates of co2 evasion from catchment surface waters have been placed at 10 sun et al 2011 and 70 hope et al 2001 of net ecosystem exchange at the continental scale and peatland catchment scale respectively headwater streams in particular have been identified as co2 sources within catchments with evasion being driven by turbulence generated by steep slopes rough channel bottoms and high velocity maurice et al 2017 our river estuary free co2 yields may therefore represent only a small fraction of the co2 evasion that occurs within the catchment with much degassed to the atmosphere upstream of the sampling points the model predicting free co2 yield t km 2 yr 1 had coefficients which were negative for both arable and bfi suggesting that the larger intensive agricultural catchments and chalk based ones with high bfi and lower proportion of dic as free co2 had a lower potential co2 evasion per km2 this likely reflects their lower annual average precipitation and the greater recharge to aquifers as they had relatively high concentrations of co2 this also suggests that groundwater does not act as a large source of epco2 at the tidal limit in the chalk and limestone dominated catchments because of the greater residence time of the water in rivers based on the total area of land our survey covered and the total flux 47 6 kt a yield of 0 56 t c km 2 yr 1 can be derived which is slightly higher than the 0 44 t c km 2 yr 1 figure that rawlins et al 2014 published for england and wales for two peat dominated streams in scotland dawson et al 2002 reported yields of 0 26 and 0 87 t c km 2 there remains uncertainty in global estimates of co2 flux from riverine and freshwater systems to the atmosphere with values estimated to be up to 4 gt c yr 1 drake et al 2017 regardless the figure obtained from the current study suggests a considerable export from terrestrial to estuarine systems where co2 evasion may occur laruelle et al 2017 examining ocean air fluxes of co2 on the nw european shelf kitidis et al 2019 suggest that most river borne c losses largely occur within estuaries with co2 accounting for much of this c loss whilst estuarine co2 efflux is biased towards large estuaries as these are where work is often focused these large estuaries are also likely to be more urbanised industrial and have longer residence times for co2 efflux to occur 4 6 potential responses to environmental change the current dic concentration results are very similar to ones taken from a 30 year dataset si 9 however the flux of dic from terrestrial ecosystems to the ocean may become more variable in the future with land use and climate temperature and precipitation change potentially acting as drivers ren et al 2015 raymond and hamilton 2018 acknowledge the difficulties in assessing chemical weathering because of the numerous interacting biotic and abiotic processes that have to be considered in assessing landscape level controls even before the added complications of anthropogenic disturbances however future uk climate projections of increased probabilities of higher rainfall and temperature met office 2019 may introduce greater seasonal and spatial variability into the dic cycle possibly due to changes in chemical weathering rates and runoff white blum 1995 oliva et al 2003 dessert et al 2003 temperature is less likely to induce major changes in dic concentrations in the carbonate geology chalk limestone of gb it is recognised that soil pco2 can be controlled by temperature and soil moisture which help determine ecosystem respiration romero mujalli et al 2019 and it would be expected that higher pco2 concentrations would increase chemical weathering however in a global river study of rivers in carbonate rock based catchments a temperature effect was identified whereby river alkalinity concentrations appear to reach a maximum before declining at land temperatures 11 c gaillardet et al 2019 this was primarily due to the role temperature plays on solubility in the carbonate system whilst increased temperatures may increase pco2 through respiration cold water would be expected to contain greater co2 leading to calcite dissolution being favoured at lower temperatures thus the temperature effect on carbonate dissolution intensity represents a balance of two competing mechanisms the effect of increasing temperature on the thermodynamic constants of the carbonate system particularly in decreasing henry s constant countered by the increase in production of ecosystem soil co2 gaillardet et al 2019 other processes that may impact changes in dic may involve the precipitation of secondary carbonates higher temperatures will increase soil respiration leading to increased pco2 and during carbonate dissolution the water will equilibrate with the higher pco2 in soils when the water comes into contact with air degassing of co2 will increase the ph promoting carbonate precipitation gaillardet et al 2019 on the other hand ca and mg silicate weathering may be expected to increase with temperature without the same mineral precipitation constraints as those found for carbonate based rocks and unlike carbonates this weathering will be effective at drawing down co2 gaillardet et al 1999 however changes are most likely to occur in runoff due to changes in seasonal precipitation and this may alter seasonal flux and yield results from this study have demonstrated the effect of relatively greater precipitation and runoff on dic fluxes across the country to add to the complexity of the dic system increasing temperature may increase soil respiration and also influence evapotranspiration rates leading to changes in runoff and silicate weathering kelly et al 1998 richter and billings 2015 land use change may also influence the future dic budget in agriculture the expected trend is that there may be an increase in the area of arable farmland with a decrease in grassland and continued reforestation and urban area expansion ccc 2020 to demonstrate the influence that different vegetation types have on dic export kindler et al 2011 examined losses of biogenically derived dic from grasslands forests and croplands across europe they found leaching of biogenic dic to be 8 3 4 9 g m 2 yr 1 for forests 24 1 7 2 g m 2 yr 1 for grassland and 4 1 1 3 g m 2 yr 1 for crop systems this would suggest that any shift towards either arable and forest land coverage may alter dic export concentrations of co2 have been found to be significantly higher in grasslands than forests because of the greater rates of root and microbial respiration and because greater soil wetness reduces diffusion rates parfitt et al 1997 in addition if fertilised there is the potential for increases in soil respiration strong acid production through nitrification and weathering raymond and hamilton 2018 urbanisation within catchments may also impact dic budgets through increasing sewage effluent discharges and urban diffuse runoff from impermeable surfaces barnes and raymond 2009 differentiating the role of land use in dic loss to surface waters can be difficult to decouple from lithology and surficial materials but some studies have found a possible response to urban areas for example barnes and raymond 2009 demonstrated that both agricultural and urban areas can enhance stream water dic concentrations relative to forestry in a series of small catchments on the same bedrock and superficial geology those catchments with greater percentages of urban areas had higher dic exports this confirms other studies demonstrating increases in dic observed in urban areas baker et al 2008 jarvie et al 2017 sources of dic within urban systems may include weathering of caco3 in concrete and the weathering of limestone road capping baker et al 2008 raymond and hamilton 2018 however in our study the role of urban areas within catchments did not significantly improve model performance possibly because there were strong links to altitude since major urban areas are located in the lowland catchments finally increasing attention is being given to enhanced rock weathering i e application of basaltic rock to agricultural land as a means of removing co2 from the atmosphere beerling et al 2020 this has been estimated to have a maximum technical potential for the uk of 19 mt co2 yr 1 to greenhouse gas removal in the uk simon et al 2021 while large scale implementation of enhanced weathering as a climate mitigation measure is unlikely in the near term even modest implementation could lead to measurable changes in the gb dic flux the application of agricultural liming has previously been identified in dic fluxes oh and raymond 2006 potential exists for increased hco3 flux to rivers and the increased precipitation of ca mg and fe carbonates in soils in this context our data provides an update on current dic flux and a valuable baseline against which to monitor and verify any additional co2 drawdown resulting from this process and to support the assessment of any biogeochemical or ecological impacts 5 conclusions results from a year long survey of 41 rivers across gb representing 36 of the landmass and where land cover was representative of the whole of great britain are reported dic represented 69 of the total dissolved carbon flux from the surveyed catchments the concentration flux and yield recorded for dic species supported previous published gb estimates based on data collected between 10 and 30 years old the study suggests that river dic and hco3 concentrations are largely controlled by catchment geology whilst average annual precipitation influenced flux and yield an average dic yield of 8 13 t ha 1 yr 1 was calculated from the survey results concentrations of dissolved free co2 appeared to be related to catchment macro nutrient status with probable sources being both from agriculture and urban land uses sewage treatment understanding this pool of dissolved co2 is of importance as it is a source of greenhouse gas emission through evasion to the atmosphere whilst increases in free co2 concentrations were linked to the lowland agricultural and densely populated catchments yield estimates t c km 2 yr 1 identified the northern peat dominated catchments as being of great importance an overall yield of 0 56 t c km 2 yr 1 of free co2 was found for the sampled catchments the results provide further evidence of the importance of land ocean c fluxes in the national c budget and offers an updated baseline for dic land ocean transport in gb author contributions funding acquisition richard sanders

2686,global climate change has been projected to affect hydrology the ice covered flow period and river morphology including changed sediment transport conditions in northern high latitude regions to understand the impact of the expected shortening of the ice covered period on bedload transport one needs to understand the present sediment transport in these high latitude rivers with annually occurring ice cover thus the aims are 1 to define the impacts of ice cover on near bed flow characteristics during hydrologically varying years and 2 to analyse the impacts of these mid winter flow characteristics on the bed sediment transport potential the analyses are based on acoustic doppler current profiler adcp 2016 21 and acoustic doppler velocimeter adv 2020 21 measurements performed in mid winter ice covered conditions of the sandy and small circa 20 m wide pulmanki river in northern finnish lapland despite the ice covered river conditions in winter sediment transport occurs even during these harshest mid winter conditions the critical velocities and shear velocities of mid winter conditions were exceeded in winters 2016 2021 and bedload transport occurred according to bedload measurements three different situations occurred regarding the bed sediment transport and near bed velocity conditions 1 high measured mid winter discharges indicate high velocities throughout the meander bend 2 low measured mid winter discharges cause low near bed velocities throughout the meander bend 3 winters having intermediate discharges indicate near bed velocities and sediment transport potential being higher at the upstream inlet and apex sections of the meander bend but clearly lower downstream of the apex the confinement by the river ice cover i e bottom fast ice explains the velocity variation the near bed velocities were the highest at the upstream inlet section of a symmetrical meander bend where the measurement cross sections were narrower and shallower the velocities were the lowest downstream of the apex where the channel changed from relatively narrow to wider and deeper keywords ice covered flow near bed velocity sediment transport time series analysis subarctic finland data availability the data set of this study is shared as supplementary material excel file format 1 introduction due to global climate change rapid changes are occurring especially in northern high latitude regions ipcc 2021 the warming has been projected to affect hydrology the ice covered flow period and river morphology including changed sediment transport conditions syvitski 2002 kämäri et al 2015 2018 song et al 2019 ipcc 2021 the duration of the frozen and unfrozen periods including river ice cover and its properties may affect the sediment transport characteristics however according to lotsari et al 2015a in their review of reach scale river simulation approaches to future in channel changes overall there had been very few modelling approaches and none of the reviewed papers had included river ice cover cf table 1 of lotsari et al 2015a the enormous and risky work required for measuring the flow and sediment transport potential in ice covered conditions has been one of the factors influencing the availability of data for calibrating models for present and future simulations thus to understand the impacts of the expected future shortening of the frozen period prowse et al 2011 turcotte et al 2011 lind et al 2016 on sediment transport including bedload and before being able to perform reliable future modelling an understanding is needed of the present sediment transport conditions in different high latitude northern rivers with annually occurring ice cover long term data series would enable these analyses at the watershed scale studies of the northern rivers and their sediment transport have mainly concentrated on large arctic rivers e g lena mackenzie ob yenisey the smaller watersheds have received less focus lewis and lamoureux 2010 even though they cover the majority of the land area north of 60 latitude these smaller watersheds respond to fast hydrological changes as the small lake percentage and connectivity of the river network usually enable a relatively quick flow through the system veijalainen et al 2010 kämäri et al 2015 this makes them ideal for measuring the annual variability in the river ice cover and magnitude of the related sediment transport process especially within this northern zone of the most rapid climate change syvitski 2002 ipcc 2021 in high latitude low turbidity rivers bedload can be a major transport process especially during the low flow periods of the ice covered season as many watershed scale sediment load analyses have mainly focused on the suspended load instead of including bedload new insights into reach scale sediment transport are needed before analysing at the watershed scale or projecting into the future ladegaard pedersen et al 2017 recent studies have shown that the ice covered flow season can have a significant impact on river bed sediment transport tremblay et al 2014 lotsari et al 2015b polvi et al 2020 studies on suspended sediment transport in ice covered conditions also exist from previous prowse 1993 ettema and daly 2004 and recent decades and analytical methods based on acoustic signals have recently appeared moore et al 2013 weiss et al 2015 however more studies on reach scale ice covered bed sediment transport processes are especially still needed from a variety of river ice conditions before being able to fully understand the complex flow ice and sediment transport interactions in different river systems the measurements under ice cover are possible via drillholes lotsari et al 2017 for analysing simultaneous flow velocities and bedload transport conditions these ice covered flow and bedload transport conditions can be detected by applying standard equipment such as acoustic doppler current profilers adcp and mechanical helley smith bedload samplers helley and smith 1971 lotsari et al 2017 2019a the helley smith sampler and adcp continuous moving boat measurement with bottom track have been simultaneously used for measuring bedload conditions in an open channel flow rennie et al 2002 gaeuman and jacobson 2006 rennie et al 2017 relationships between bedload and bed velocity i e sediment movement parameters could also be made in ice free seasons gaeuman and jacobson 2006 the presence of ice cover makes transport processes more complicated than in open channel conditions because the roughness of the ice cover has an impact on the flow area and velocities recent research on the ice covered flow of natural rivers i e not laboratory environments has shown that the high velocity cores are closer to the river bed under the ice cover than in open channel conditions e g demers et al 2011 lotsari et al 2017 in a laboratory study by wang et al 2008 the location of the maximum velocity has been shown to move to the bed this is consistent with the studies done in natural rivers by demers et al 2011 and lotsari et al 2017 regarding high velocity core locations wang et al 2008 had also shown in the laboratory that for the same flow depth the near bed velocity under the ice cover is clearly higher than that in the open channel flow further in natural rivers the river ice especially during severe winters and under low flow conditions can cause the flow to concentrate only within the deepest and highest velocity portion of the channel prowse 1996 this may impact the sediment transport including the bedload despite the overall low flow conditions during the ice covered season when compared to other seasons lotsari et al 2019b however the ice cover has been shown to reduce the sediment transport through decreasing velocity bed shear stress and diffusivity prowse 1996 according to beltaos and burrell 2016 the ice cover changes the flow velocity and shear stress but it also affects changes in vertical diffusivity and longitudinal dispersion further affecting the spread of suspended substances studies on the impacts of the ice cover on sediment transport are rarer in natural rivers than in laboratory experiments however a few studies do exist for example the shear forces exerted on the river bed have been shown to increase when the ice thickness and especially its roughness increase kämäri et al 2015 based on the study of kämäri et al 2015 done with a one dimensional hydraulic model hec ras a smooth thermally formed 5 40 cm thick ice cover overall decreased the average shear stress compared to an open water situation also changes in boundary shear stress and flow resistance have been analysed based on the ice cover zare et al 2016a b biron et al 2019 zare et al 2016a showed that ice deposition and erosion can occur during the stable ice cover period as a result of flow variations induced by hydropeaking they also showed that commonly employed assumptions about ice and bed zone velocity values hydraulic radii and energy grade line slopes are inaccurate in these cases further zare et al 2016b studied the shear stress imposed on the boundaries of a natural ice covered river especially during different ice stages and demonstrated that the bed shear stress during the ice cover period is less than during the open water condition which proves that the upper boundary layer i e the ice cover presence has a diminishing effect on bed shear stress however recent publications using acoustic analyses and dealing with river bed resistance in ice covered conditions such as zare et al 2016a have often been done only from one spatial location of the river channel and cross sectional or spatially varying data and analyses between years have not been detected in laboratory conditions namaee and sui 2019 studied the role of critical dimensionless shear stress grain size and roughness of ice cover on the incipient motion of bed material around bridge piers they found that the ice cover can cause a deeper maximum scour depth than in open channel flow conditions and also the required flow velocity for the incipient motion of sediment particles under the ice cover decreases with an increase in the relative roughness coefficient of the ice cover namaee and sui 2019 also wang et al 2008 concluded based on their laboratory study that if the ratio between the ice cover resistance coefficient to the resistance coefficient of channel bed increases then the location of the maximum velocity moves to the bed due to the complex observed impacts of the ice cover on sediment transport processes in both natural and laboratory river experiments and the lack of studies concentrating especially on bedload transport in natural i e non laboratory rivers the impact of hydrologically different winters and their varying ice cover conditions on near bed velocities and the expected bedload transport requires further attention the long time series of ice covered flow and bedload sediment transport conditions are rare in northern high latitude rivers one of them is the pulmanki river in northern finnish lapland where ice covered mid winter conditions have been measured systematically for several years the subarctic study region is within the area of the fastest projected future climatic change and is central for analysing the following impacts of hydrological variability and changes thus this unique data series from the years 2016 2021 makes the pulmanki river an ideal location for analysing the varying mid winter conditions on the near bed flow characteristics and their potential for the sediment transport in the ice covered season the aims of this paper are 1 to define the impacts of ice cover on near bed flow characteristics during hydrologically varying years and 2 to analyse the impacts of these mid winter flow characteristics on the bed sediment transport potential near bed velocity means the velocity measured closest to the river bed within the limits of the equipment the analyses are based on adcp 2016 21 and acoustic doppler velocimeter adv 2020 21 measurements performed in mid winter ice covered conditions at the pulmanki river in northern finnish lapland 2 study site the study site is located at the meandering pulmanki river which is a tributary of the tana river fig 1 the pulmanki river is divided into two parts by lake pulmanki the watershed area of the upper pulmanki river is 484 km2 this study concentrates on one simple symmetric meander bend of the upper pulmanki river its radius of curvature and width of the curvature at the apex are 110 m and 19 m respectively lotsari et al 2014 the climate of northern finnish lapland is influenced both by the atlantic ocean heated by the gulf stream and the great asian continent in the east autio and heikkinen 2002 therefore this area belongs to the köppen climate class cold without dry season but with cold summer the pulmanki river typically freezes in october when the temperature drops below 0 c peel et al 2007 lotsari et al 2019b temperatures start to rise above 0 c again in early april and the freezing period can last approximately seven months lotsari et al 2019b the temperatures usually reach 30 to 40 c sometime during the period of december february figs 2 and 3 in lotsari et al 2019b the pulmanki river had a smooth rough ice cover during the analysed years when defined visually from photos and ice blocks lifted onto the ice surface following demers et al 2013 lotsari et al 2017 and kämäri et al 2017 this was similar to mid winters in 2014 and 2015 analysed by kämäri et al 2017 and lotsari et al 2017 2019a 2019b annual maximum discharges occur during spring snowmelt events when discharges typically rise to 50 m3 s kasvi et al 2013 this typically occurs between mid may and early june during summer discharges are around 4 m3 s and less than 2 m3 s discharges have been measured during autumn and winter lotsari et al 2019a the river runs through glaciolacustrine and glacio fluvial sediments which had been deposited after the ice dammed lake had drained during the final wasting of the fennoscandian ice sheet hirvas et al 1988 johansson 1995 2007 lotsari et al 2020a the d50 values of the river bank material have been measured to range from approximately 0 004 mm to 0 529 mm and the friction angle of the material to be 35 36 5 cf for a detailed description of the banks sediment and figures of ice free conditions from lotsari et al 2020a making the sediment highly mobile consolidated sediment does not appear in the area where there is active river activity there the material is loose sand and gravel for example a high bank studied by lotsari et al 2020a includes 1 5 16 m of loose very well sorted fluvial sand with weak soil development in the upper 0 3 m in addition roots are only causing cohesion at the top of the bank within 0 5 m depth the bulk density of channel bank sediment is 1 73 g cm3 the bed load is the main mode of transport as the suspended sediment amount is small even during the spring snow melt discharge periods cf lotsari et al 2020b 3 methods 3 1 near bed velocity measurements the flow velocity was measured in 2016 2021 cross sectionally with an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp m9 sensor sontek table 1 the m9 sensor has both four 3 0 mhz beams and four 1 5 mhz beams the sensor is accurate up to 0 25 of the measured velocity 0 2 cm s sontek 2015 within the cross sections each measurement hole was drilled about 1 m apart from each other the measurements always began from the left bank and moved towards the right bank the ice depths were measured before the sensor was placed through the holes of the ice cover there were some measurement verticals where the water depth was too shallow for measurements and therefore only the ice thickness was measured from those locations the stationary mode of the m9 sensor was applied i e it produces the time averaged value of each measured parameter at each measurement drillhole location the mid section method was selected for discharge measurements and the averaging time was set to 60 s at each drill hole we selected this time averaged method each year to avoid the macro turbulent impact of the river flow lotsari et al 2020b i e for gaining the time averaged flow parameters directly from the sensor and also for comparing the data between years the sensor which had been mounted on a metal rod was lowered at the level of ice cover water interface before initiating the measurements at each drillhole the tagline azimuth was defined before the adcp measurement at the first drillhole of each cross section a vertical beam was used as the depth reference the transducer depth of the sensor was set as 0 m to maximise the flow measurement area in the vertical direction in this shallow water environment and to include all possible effects of the ice cover and river bed as a result of these adcp measurements the spatial and vertical variations in flow velocity and flow depth were gained from each of the drilled holes within the measurement cross sections the adcp calculates the total velocity of each cell based on the following equation 1 x 2 y 2 z 2 where x y and z represent the velocities in the three different directions the near bed velocities i e the measured total velocity of the cells closest to the river bed were extracted from the data sets the height of the measured cells from the river bed was also derived based on the depth of the cell and the total measured depth of each measurement vertical in some of the measurement points the water depth was too shallow for the adcp as it requires around 25 cm of water thus from these measurement verticals sontek s flowtracker a side looking adv acoustic doppler velocimeter was instead applied to measure the velocity close to the river bed the flowtracker makes a point measurement whereas adcp velocities are obtained over the spatial domain of the acoustic beams the flowtracker was placed as close to the river bed as possible i e the sensor s lower edge was 3 cm above the river bed each time the sensor has 5 cm vertical height and the upper limit of the measurements was each time around 8 cm up from the river bed the measurement height from the river bed coincided with most of the near bed velocity cell heights measured with the adcp cf results section the flowtracker measurements were done in the same cross sections as the adcp measurements table 1 note that the mid section discharge measurement mode was not used in the case of the flowtracker instead each point measurement was a separate 50 second long measurement for making the data set comparable with the adcp data as the flowtracker gives the results in x y and z directions the total velocities of each flowtracker measurement were calculated using eq 1 the near bed velocities measured with the adcp and flowtracker were then compared from year to year at each cross section 3 2 the analyses of the sediment transport and related near bed flow characteristics the near bed flow velocities of each winter were also compared against the critical fluvial forces capable of initiating the bedload movement this also required analyses of the grain sizes of the transported bedload material which were measured in the winters of 2020 and 2021 the helley smith sampler helley and smith 1971 was applied for mechanically measuring the bedload transport on 6 february 2020 and 18 february 2021 table 2 the measurements were aimed to take each time from the high flow location of that cross section i e in the middle or at the left bank side of cs1 and at the outer bank side of the other cross sections cs2 cs3 and cs4 note that no measurements were taken from csa csb or csc the intake opening of the sampler was 77 mm each sample was taken for 6 min each time each sample was dried in the oven 105 c and weighted the bedload was calculated with eq 2 cf morales et al 2019 where g is the dry weight kg b is the intake opening m and t is the measurement time min 2 g b t the grain size distribution of each sample was analysed via dry sieving and by using sieves having half phi interval mesh sizes the d10 d50 and d90 values were calculated in addition to defining the textural group in the winter of 2020 two samples were large enough for dry sieving in the winter of 2021 six samples were large enough for dry sieving table 2 we did not include the unsieved samples in this study the average d50 value of all sieved samples was calculated as these are the basis for the bedload movement analyses the average d50 grain size of all bedload samples was 0 5383 mm in the winter of 2021 and 0 6076 mm in the winter of 2020 overall the average d50 grain size of all samples in 2020 and 2021 had been 0 5557 mm the average d90 value was 1 1341 mm this average d50 value of 0 5557 mm was used in the equations for analysing whether the mid winter near bed velocities were capable of exceeding the critical forces needed to move these sized particles from all analysed years in addition for gaining the spatial distribution of the grain sizes of the river bed the van veen bulk bed sediment sampler was applied to get a more detailed distribution of the river bed material the samples were taken from the right middle and left bank locations at each cross section in 2020 october these were thus measured between the mid winter 2020 and mid winter 2021 measurement times and these river bed material conditions can be expected to best represent the distribution of the 2020 and 2021 mid winter bed material the average d50 and d90 sediment grain size values were calculated for each cross section the d50 values were then used for analysing whether the mid winter 2020 and 2021 velocities exceeded the critical thresholds for moving the sediment these data were not applied in the analyses of previous years to avoid uncertainties as the bed material might have been different in 2016 2019 thus the average d50 value of 0 5557 mm based on helley smith samples was used for all years the traditional hjulström 1935 critical velocity for transport lower line would have been 0 035 m s for 0 5557 mm sized particles i e for the average d50 value of helley smith bedload samples the comparative critical velocity for erosion hjulström 1935 would have been 0 275 m s in addition to comparing the exceeding of these thresholds for motion other methods were also applied for selecting the methods for analysing flow characteristics and their impact on bed sediment transport various previous publications of open channel and under ice particle motion studies were checked especially the ones done in ice covered laboratory experiments and which have not yet been tested widely in real river environments these included publications related to the densimetric froude number for incipient motion of sediment wang et al 2008 eqs 4 and 5 hirshfield and sui 2011 however for being able to define the sediment particle motion as much as possible based on the measured data sets the wang et al 2008 method was discarded as the parameters such as the roughness coefficient of ice cover ni and the roughness coefficient manning s n nb of the channel bed would have been needed to be estimated which would have caused more uncertainties to the analyses also we did not apply the direct moving bed analysis method based on the adcp s bottom track such as by rennie et al 2002 as our data had the output only in time averaged format single value from each drillhole due to the stationary discharge measurement mode which had also been selected for minimizing the possible effect of macro turbulence lotsari et al 2020 we also discarded the methods that would have included parameters that we would not have data for a detailed definition and which would have caused further uncertainties under the ice cover for example the definition of the local slope is uncertain this cross sectional gradient definition for streamwise velocity would have affected the results zare et al 2016b zare et al 2016 also presented different ways to calculate boundary shear stress one of them including a method without the slope effect based on maximum and average velocities and the von karman constant eq 7 of theirs however we did not select this method for our use as it had been originally defined based on a bottom mounted adcp for gaining the local boundary shear stress on both upper ice water interface and lower river bed boundaries and not for detecting the motion of particles similar in size to the pulmanki river material in addition the bed shear velocity related to grains approach of van rijn 1984 was discarded as it would have made the results cross sectionally averaged due to the applied mean velocity that approach would have also required calculation of chezy equation with hydraulic radius parameter which would have been an approximation and would have caused further uncertainties namaee and sui 2019 had used in their ice covered laboratory experiments logarithmic equation for defining the shear forces their eq 9 this equation has been previously been applied for defining the shear velocity from direct flow measurements wilcock 1996 sime et al 2007 according to wilcock 1996 using a single near bed velocity observations in the equation are less precise than if depth averaged velocity in the vertically averaged logarithmic velocity profile is applied instead however wilcock 1996 states that this method requires appropriate flow conditions only near the bed so it may be applied in a wider range of flow conditions including spatially variable flow also according to rhoads 2020 this law of the wall in question can be applied for local shear analyses at channel boundary sime et al 2007 applied the same equation and state that wilcock 1996 results were for time averaged velocities at a particular set of measurement heights at a single site and not instantaneous adcp measurements as our data is time averaged and from various spatial locations the wilcock 1996 approach where the single velocity measurements had been applied for shear velocity u calculation was selected thus we selected the approach which allowed the calculation of shear velocity exactly for the measured velocity value closest to the river bed for calculating critical shear velocity we selected to use a parameterization of the shield s shields 1936 curve more precisely decided to follow the van rijn 1984 approach where non dimensional grain size d is applied after defining both the observed shear velocity u and the critical shear velocity u c the transport stage parameter van rijn 1984 was defined by comparing the resulting shear velocity and critical shear velocities also namaee and sui 2019 had applied this transport stage parameter in their under ice laboratory experiments thus first the particle parameter d was calculated with eq 3 van rijn 1984 their eq 1 3 d d 50 s 1 g v 2 1 3 where s is specific density and calculated as ρ s ρ ρ is the mass density of water 0 99987 g cm3 or 999870 g m3 in zero celsius degree water temperature as we had no other mineralogical knowledge of the sediment ρ s was defined as a quartz density of 2 65 g cm3 common for sand sizes in the majority of natural streams g is the gravitational acceleration which is 9 826 m s2 in the study area of northern finland poutanen et al 2017 v is the kinematic viscosity coefficient defined as μ ρ i e based on dynamic viscosity coefficient µ however as for 0 temperature water the kinematic viscosity coefficient is known to be 1 7930 mm2 s kestin et al 1978 we applied this value directly d50 value of the sediment particle was 0 5557 mm as it is the average value for the transported bedload based on helley smith measurements in addition the d was also calculated based on the average d50 value of each cross section s bed sediment which had been sampled in october 2020 table 3 then the critical mobility parameter θcr was defined based on the equation defined at fig 1 of van rijn 1984 the equation was selected based on the d values defined for applied grain sizes for the 0 5557 mm particles average of helley smith bedload samples the d was 9 530 and the following equation was selected for θcr 4 θ cr 0 14 d 0 64 the resulting critical mobility parameter value was 0 033 this is used for calculating the critical shear velocity and further transport stage parameter for all cross sections of each studied year when calculating the critical mobility parameter based on the autumn 2020 bulk bed sediment samples of each cross section the same equation eq 4 was applicable for cs1 cs3 and cs4 but for the cross sections csa cs2 csb and csc the equation for d values between 10 and 20 was applicable cf d values table 3 5 θ cr 0 04 d 0 10 the resulting critical mobility parameter values are presented in table 3 these are applied for calculating the critical shear velocities and further transport stage parameter for winters 2020 and 2021 next the critical shear velocity u c was solved from the equation eq 6 and 7 van rijn 1984 6 θ cr u c 2 s 1 g d 50 which can be written in the form 7 u c θ cr s 1 g d 50 the resulted critical shear velocities m s were 0 017 based on the average grain sizes of helley smith samples the critical shear velocities based on the autumn 2020 cross sectional sediment data are presented in table 3 according to wilcock 1996 the logarithmic relation between the shear velocity u and the variation of velocity u with height z above bed is as follows eq 8 8 u u 1 κ l n z z 0 from this equation the shear velocity can be resolved when writing the equation in the following form 9 u u κ l n z z 0 u is the variation of velocity with height z above the bed wilcock 1996 according to wilcock 1996 single observation of u can be used to estimate u which we also here now on name as u z in our study as mentioned above the u is the time averaged near bed velocity i e measured within 50 60 s with adcp or adv despite being single observation it represents velocity variation within 50 60 s the measurements of ours were mostly within the lowest 20 of the water column thus making the application of this equation as valid cf wilcock 1996 only at the following locations the measurement had been slightly more than 20 of the full depth from the river bed in 2016 one location at csa in 2018 two locations at cs1 6 locations at cs2 and 10 locations at csb in 2019 one location at csa and one at cs4 in 2020 two locations at csa and in 2021 one location at cs1 however for the unity of the results we calculated the values also for these locations based on the same equation κ is the von karman s constant defined 0 4 similarly to namaee and sui 2019 and wilcock 1996 the z0 is the bed roughness length corresponding to u 0 wilcock 1996 had calculated it for gravel particles with equation ad84 30 where a 3 also sime et al 2007 had followed wilcock 1996 and stated that z0 0 1d84 however sime et al 2007 also state that for well sorted uniformly packed sediment z0 d50 30 note that their study was based on moving boat adcp measurements not time averaged stationary measurements as ours are according to rhoads 2020 the law of the wall in question can be applied for local shear analyses at channel boundary they state that in these cases the common method for defining whether or not at least some portion of the lower part of the turbulent boundary layer exhibits a logarithmic profile and for solving the shear velocity and also the bed roughness length z0 has been to measure mean velocities at several different heights above the bed over the lowest 15 20 of the flow depth and using the resulting data to fit in linear regression analyses however our data does not have several measurements within this 15 20 layer and our shear velocity analyses are therefore based on one measured velocity of the cell closest to the river bed this scarcity of data from bottom layer as adcp inherently leaves cells partially or fully touching the river bed unmeasured as in our data set due to potential data contamination or potential side lobe interference was the reason why gaeuman and jacobson 2004 state that accurate estimates of the height of zero velocity z0 flow cannot be obtained from adcp data rhoads 2020 states also that an alternate approach for eliminating the need for this linear regression analysis is to define a relation between z0 and particle size such as for example wilcock 1996 and sime et al 2007 had done the d84 sediment sizes mentioned in sime et al 2007 are from 17 mm to 82 mm thus making the sediment much larger than in our study site cf the d90 values from table 3 our sediment sizes are well sorted sand or gravelly sand i e smaller than gravel or pebbles table 2 due to these reasons we decided to follow the approach of namaee and sui 2019 whose study had been done in ice covered laboratory conditions and had applied particles from 0 47 0 5 and 0 58 mm in their experiments our d50 value of helley smith samples fell within this range also they had depth of flow as 1 3 m which is close to the maximum measured water depths of pulmanki river in winters c f supplementary material namaee and sui 2019 stated that z0 can be represented as roughness height which is the d50 value of the sediment particle thus due to the similarities to the experimental study conditions of namaee and sui 2019 we applied 0 5557 mm as z0 as it is the average value for the transported bedload based on helley smith measurements this was used for calculating data sets from all years in addition the shear velocity for the years 2020 and 2021 was calculated as a test based on the average d50 value of each cross section s bed sediment which had been sampled in october 2020 table 3 finally the transport stage parameter was calculated based on eq 10 van rijn 1984 their equation 2 10 t u z 2 u c 2 u c 2 this shows the transport capacity based on how much there is excess shear velocity greater than the critical shear velocity if the value is negative there is no excess shear velocity to enable transport the calculations were done for each measurement location at each cross section of each mid winter situation in 2016 2021 the calculated shear velocity derived based on the above equations from original adcp and flowtracker data of each measurement location was compared to the critical shear velocity cf the full results are presented in supplementary material excel format the spatial particle transport potential of each winter was analysed from these data sets in comparison to shear velocity analyses the near bed velocities were analysed against the critical velocity threshold of hjulström 1935 i e whether or not the near bed velocity was greater than the defined threshold in addition the explanatory factors of water depth full depth below ice and ice cover thickness were used against near bed velocities shear velocities and transport stage parameters in pearson s correlation analysis to estimate the linear relationship between the normally distributed variables based on the assumptions of pearson s correlation the method was suitable for the analyses of our data the results of the pearson s correlation analysis can vary between 1 and 1 either indicating a negative or positive linear relationship between variables values close to zero indicate a low correlation between variables 4 results 4 1 the near bed flow characteristics of 2016 2021 mid winter conditions overall the near bed velocities were slow in different winter conditions in 2016 2021 fig 2 the years 2021 2020 and 2019 had mostly higher velocities at the upstream cross sections cs1 csb such as over 0 2 0 3 m s lower velocities i e less than 0 15 m s occurred more often at cs3 cs4 in 2018 the near bed velocities of each cross section were less than 0 1 m s in most of the measurement verticals the overall lowest discharge of the studied years 0 18 m3 s table 1 explains this difference the first two winters 2016 and 2017 had discharges of 1 38 and 1 32 m3 s respectively and thus were very much comparable to each other the near bed velocities were also most consistently the highest in those years i e over 0 2 m s velocities occurred in the three most downstream located cross sections however cs1 inlet cs2 and csb apex had the highest near bed velocities being over 0 25 m s and in many verticals over 0 3 m s the near bed velocities were the highest at the left bank side at cs1 of the inlet area and close to the outer bank side at cs2 and csb thus three different mid winter conditions were observed table 1 fig 2 1 very low discharge and near bed velocities occurred in 2018 when the near bed velocities were low throughout the meander bend 2 two higher mid winter discharge conditions were present in 2016 and 2017 and velocities were higher throughout the meander bend 3 the three last years 2019 2021 had intermediate discharges of 0 5 0 79 m3 s and velocities had been clearly divided between higher velocities at the upstream inlet and the apex sections and lower velocities at the downstream outlet section when comparing different years the lowest near bed velocities occurred most frequently within the cross sections 3 and c these cross sections locate where the cross sectional width area and flow depth increase after a narrower and shallower reach table 4 cf depths from supplementary material the river channel had been confined by the river ice in a way that in the upstream part of the meander bend approximately at cs1 cs2 the channel had been narrower due to mid channel bars and bottom fast ice during many winters i e not possible to measure with the adcp and thus no location measured cf fig 2 also the flow had been diverted next to the outer bank in narrow cross sections of the apex area which also caused higher velocities in several years the width and area of the measurement cross sections can be seen in fig 2 and table 4 thus after flowing from the narrow csb towards the more downstream cross sections the river widened and deepened and slower near bed velocities occurred unfortunately we do not have data from the actual pressure conditions from each winter i e whether or not the flow was pressurised when drilling the ice cover there was no artesian well style surge of water on top of the ice in any of the cross sections during the measurement years thus more likely indicating non pressurised conditions the differences and similarities between the locations of maximum near bed velocities were possible to detect during years 2016 2021 fig 3 the maximum velocities were especially clustered at the left bank side at cs1 and the outer bank at csb and cs3 the most variation between years had been at csa and csc over the years fig 3 the mid channel bar at cs1 existed only in 2020 2017 and 2016 however in 2018 the mid channel bar had influenced the division of flow at cs1 csa and cs2 and the location of maximum velocity varied that year the most from the other years between these cross sections in 2020 the mid channel bar had located at cs1 and csa on the contrary the flow had been possible to measure in mid winter 2021 throughout all cross sections thus the mid channel bars had not influenced the division of the flow around the bar at that time the variations in near bed velocity fig 2 shear velocity cf supplementary material and transport stage parameter fig 4 were analysed against explaining factors of depth full water depth below the ice and ice cover thickness tables 5 and 6 when the annual connections were analysed table 5 all pearson correlation values show very little correlation between any parameters the highest positive correlations occurred in 2016 0 41 and 2021 0 39 between depth and ice thickness and only twice was there a negative correlation greater than 0 30 which occurred in 2020 between ice thickness and near bed velocity 0 32 and ice thickness and shear velocity 0 34 all other parameters and years correlated closer to zero thus basically no correlation occurred when depth was compared to shear velocity or transport stage parameter similarly correlation values were mostly very low when ice thickness was compared to shear velocity or transport stage parameter the application of different d50 values as the basis of the calculations had no clear effect on the results table 5 despite being generally low correlation coefficients in 2016 all correlations were positive in 2017 there was negative correlation when ice thickness was applied in analyses against near bed velocity shear velocity and transport stage parameter but positive correlation when depth was applied in the analyses only in 2018 the correlation between depth and ice thickness was negative i e the greater the depth the thinner the ice thickness in other years the value was positive the correlation coefficient between depth and shear velocity or transport stage parameter and ice thickness and shear velocity or transport stage parameter were mostly negative i e the greater the depth or ice thickness the smaller the shear velocity and transport stage parameter table 6 explains this situation of very low annual correlation values as it shows the correlation between the parameters separately within each cross section there is great variation in the direction of correlation between different cross sections during certain mid winter measurement times but differences also occurred between years for certain cross sections csb which locates at the apex and which has been the narrowest cross section in four out of six mid winter measurement times table 4 has high correlation in most of the years when depth is used in the correlation analyses only in 2021 the correlation between depth and near bed velocity shear velocity or transport stage parameter had been very low when ice thickness was applied in the analyses high correlation occurred with ice thickness in years 2016 2018 and 2020 at csb the years 2021 and 2019 which had lower correlations belong to the ʻintermediate discharge magnitudeʼ mid winter conditions when there had been clearly higher velocities at the upstream and apex sections and lower near bed velocities at the downstream measurement locations when ice thickness was analysed against shear velocity or transport stage parameter at csb only in 2018 and 2020 the correlations were clearly high and negative 0 72 or more at each case meaning that the greater the ice thickness had been the smaller the shear velocity or transport stage parameter had been at csb the correlation between depth and the near bed velocity is mainly positive i e the greater the depth the greater the near bed velocities on the other hand the correlation between the ice thickness and the near bed velocities is negative in each year also the ice thickness and depth have a negative correlation at csb in most of the years thus the greater the ice thickness the smaller the depth and near bed velocities in addition to high correlation values occurring at csb the greatest correlation values at cs1 and cs2 table 6 occurred most often between different parameters in 2016 which was considered to have ʻhigh dischargeʼ conditions during the year 2017 which also had relatively high mid winter discharges there had been high correlation values at cs2 between most of the compared parameter pairs only when ice thickness had been compared against shear velocity or transport stage parameter the correlation had been lower i e around 0 31 0 32 at cs2 there is a clear change when detecting the three downstream most cross sections at the outlet area the most often high correlations occurred between parameters in the 2019 and 2021 ʻintermediate dischargeʼ years at cs3 also at csc the highest correlation values of most parameter pairs occurred in 2021 at cs4 it is noteworthy that this is the only cross section where the ʻlow dischargeʼ mid winter year in 2018 most often had a high correlation between parameter pairs the applied grain size had no or very little i e around 0 01 impact on the correlation values table 6 except in 2021 at cs3 the correlation values had been 0 03 0 05 greater when cross sectional bed sediment grain sizes had been applied instead of the average grain size of bed load overall the direction of the correlation between the parameters varies between years and between cross sections the detected great variation in the flow characteristics within the meander bend explains why the correlation values for each mid winter condition are so low table 5 thus the near bed velocity and the thresholds for sediment transport conditions are highly variable throughout the meander bend however they are most consistent at the apex area and there is an impact of the overall discharge on the spatial variation of the parameters 4 2 sediment transport capacity during varying mid winter conditions the shear velocities exceeded the critical shear velocities i e transport stage parameter had been positive at all cross section at least in some measurement verticals in 2016 2017 and 2021 fig 4 supplementary material the shear velocity had been greater than critical shear velocity at least in one measurement vertical each year at cs1 csa cs2 and csb most often i e at all or most of the measurement verticals the threshold value had been exceeded in 2016 2017 2020 at cs1 and csb also these years the threshold value had been exceeded at multiple measurement verticals at csa and cs2 also in 2021 the transport stage parameter had been positive at multiple measurement verticals at cs1 csa cs2 and csb the shear velocity did not exceed the critical shear velocity at all in 2019 at cs3 csc or cs4 in 2018 the shear velocity did not exceed the threshold of sediment transport at any measurement vertical at csc and cs4 and in 2020 at cs3 and csc thus overall this indicates that least transport occurred at csc during different years whether the applied d50 value had been based on the average bed load samples helley smith or on the cross sectional bulk bed sediment samples van veen in the calculations of years 2020 and 2021 affected the values of shear velocity and transport stage parameter cf supplementary material however despite there were differences in the values it only little affected whether or not the critical shear velocity threshold had been exceeded in 2021 only in the following measurement vertical drill holes the threshold was not anymore exceeded if the cross sectional particle size had been applied instead of the particle size of bed load samples cf supplementary material drill holes 7 and 12 at cs1 drill hole 10 at cs3 drill holes 2 3 and 4 at cs4 at drill hole 13 of csa the difference was opposite i e the threshold was exceeded in 2021 when cross sectional sediment data was applied instead of the grain size of the sampled bed load in 2020 the critical shear velocity threshold was not exceeded anymore only at drill hole 9 of cs1 and at drill holes 12 and 16 of cs 4 when cross sectional sediment data was applied note that cross sections cs2 csb and csc had similar spatial variation of excess shear velocity over the critical shear velocity threshold in both 2020 and 2021 years independent of the applied grain size in addition to analysing exceeding of the critical shear velocities the near bed flow velocities were detected against the hjulström 1935 diagram of critical velocities for erosion and transport the hjulström critical velocity for transport 0 035 m s was exceeded in most of the measurement locations as the near bed velocities were higher than that each year fig 3 the velocity of 0 275 m s which is the critical velocity for erosion according to hjulström 1935 would have been exceeded at least in one measurement vertical of the inlet area i e cs1 csa and cs2 in each year except 2019 during mid winter 2019 the exceeding would have occurred from those upstream cross sections only at cs1 and cs2 however in that year at csb as well the critical velocity for erosion would have been exceeded close to the inner bank side fig 2 in addition to the inlet area s cross sections the exceeding of the critical velocity threshold for erosion would have taken place in 2020 also at csb and cs4 and in 2018 at csb in 2016 this threshold was actually exceeded in each measurement cross section and in 2017 at all other cross sections except at cs4 of the outlet area this large amount of measurement verticals where the exceeding of 0 275 m s would have taken place coincides with the years having the highest mid winter discharges i e 1 3 m3 s cf table 1 the bedload transport measurements with the helley smith sampler support this as they show that during each of their measurement time i e in mid winter 2021 and 2020 the bedload was possible to measure from cs1 and cs4 and in 2021 also from cs2 most often sampling was possible from cs1 these measurement locations coincide with the maximum velocities measured in many years fig 3 i e the helley smith measurements were done in the middle or at the left bank side at cs1 and at the outer bank at cs2 and cs4 note that no bedload sample large enough for sieving had been collected from cs3 this coincides with the location where the flow changes from narrow csb towards the wider cross sections of cs3 cs4 and where the near bed velocities had been lower in mid winter 2020 and 2021 when compared to the upstream sections also based on the transport stage parameter no sediment transport would have occurred at cs3 in 2020 and only in one measurement vertical in 2021 5 discussion based on analyses done with a six year long flow velocity data time series 2016 2021 and two years of bedload data 2020 2021 it has been verified that despite the ice cover there is bed sediment transport even during these harshest mid winter conditions at this subarctic river having bed material particles of 0 56 mm the present study adds to the previously studied low and high open channel flow conditions at the same study site cf kasvi et al 2013 lotsari et al 2020b and gives proof that sediment transport occurs during each season this also suggests that the ice cover should be included in future simulations in rivers having seasonal ice cover and the sediment transport over winter should not be ignored in future change studies lotsari et al 2019a had stated based on both simulation and measurement results gained in previous years at the same pulmanki river study site that the extent of the areas where critical velocities are exceeded is reduced due to ice cover when compared to open channel situations note there were fewer measurement cross sections in the 2013 open channel flow period and 2014 mid winter than in the present study despite this reduction the modelling approach of lotsari et al 2019a had shown that there is sediment transport in winter conditions similarly as in the present study done based on data from 2016 to 2021 the discharges of the lotsari et al 2019a study were 0 63 m3 s and thus close to the ones during the ʻintermediateʼ discharge year 2019 0 61 m3 s of the present study according to hirschfield and sui 2011 the maximum flow velocity under ice cover depends on the roughness coefficients of the ice cover and the bed material and the location of maximum flow velocity will be closer to the surface with the smallest resistance coefficient despite the ice cover being categorised as ʻsmooth roughʼ in the pulmanki river the near bed flow velocities had been enough for moving sediment particles in particular at the inlet and apex area of the meander bend each winter three different situations were possible for describing the sediment transport and near bed velocity conditions during 2016 2021 1 ʻhighʼ measured mid winter discharges indicate sediment transport potential and high near bed velocities throughout the meander bend 2 ʻlowʼ measured mid winter discharges indicate low near bed velocities and sediment transport potential throughout the meander bend 3 winters having ʻintermediateʼ discharges indicate near bed velocities and sediment transport potential being higher at the upstream inlet and apex sections of the meander bend but clearly lower downstream of the apex the near bed velocities were the highest at the upstream inlet section of the studied symmetrical meander bend where the measurement cross sections were narrow and shallow and velocities were less in the deeper and wider cross sections of the outlet area the confinement of the channel by the river ice cover i e bottom fast ice can explain the velocity variation in the case of the present study especially during the years when the discharge had been ʻintermediateʼ this statement is consistent with previous studies by kämäri et al 2017 and lotsari et al 2017 2019a that the ice covered high flows concentrated on narrower areas due to ice extents they had also shown that the spatial differences in high and low flow locations increased when compared to open channel conditions in the present study it was possible to show that between years there had also been a variation in the high flow locations especially when the mid channel bars had affected the flow diversion around the two sides of the mid channel bar on the other hand the deep and narrowest cross section at the apex area had shown the least differences between years and it also had in most of the mid winters of 2016 2021 high correlation coefficient values when near bed velocities the ice thickness and depth were compared to each other the correlation between ice thickness and the near bed velocities was negative at that location each year thus the greater the velocity the thinner the ice had been at that location kämäri et al 2017 had also observed this in the same study bend but in the case of depth averaged velocities that is the increase in water flow velocity decreases the ice thickness in each cross section furthermore however the positive correlation was found between depth and near bed velocity at the apex location during most mid winters except in 2019 when it was 0 53 also depth and ice thickness had a positive correlation in 2019 and 2021 at the meander bend apex of the pulmanki river but a negative correlation in 2017 2018 and 2022 thus the greater the depth the greater the near bed velocity but most often the ice thickness is less when greater depths occur wang et al 2008 observed in their laboratory experiments that the higher the flow velocities are needed for the incipient motion of bed material the deeper the flow depth is under ice cover our study indicates overall as the depth had positive correlation with near bed velocity and transport stage parameter in most of the analysed cross sections and years except at csa and cs4 that the greater the depth the greater the near bed velocity and transport capacity are the largest bedload transport helley smith bedload measurements had been measured at the upstream cross section which had the shallowest depths and mid channel bars narrowing the flow area but high flow velocities however also the deeper cross sections located downstream of the apex had bedload transport thus this supports the above observations the mechanical bedload samples should always be taken with some reservations due to the possibility of measurement errors helley and smith 1971 also gaeuman and jacobson 2006 have shown that the squared product moment correlation coefficient r2 has been only 0 33 between the helley smith bedload capture rate kg s and the bedload velocity m s thus including scatter ancey 2020 listed reasons why bedload transport is difficult to predict among them being ʻthe mix of fast and slow processesʼ ʻnonequilibrium and noise driven processesʼ ʻcascades of interacting processesʼ ʻthe varying temporal and spatial scales dependent on flow conditionsʼ ʻthe heterogeneity of materials and flow conditionsʼ and ʻdifficulties in obtaining reliable measurementsʼ in the present study the variation in the velocities between ice covered mid winters of 2016 2021 underlines especially the heterogeneity of flow conditions the near bed velocity and the thresholds for sediment transport conditions were highly variable throughout the meander bend however they were most consistent at the apex area and there was an impact of the overall discharge on the spatial variation of the parameters factors affecting bedload have been analysed more in open channel conditions as an example a study done in an open channel flume khosravi et al 2021 found that the discharge would be the third significant factor affecting bedload transport the most significant impact being flow velocity followed by shear stress discharge bed shear velocity bed slope flow depth median sediment diameter and finally relative roughness many studies have concentrated only on suspended sediment transport in ice covered conditions moore et al 2013 weiss et al 2015 and thus are not directly comparable to the present study the observed and calculated flow characteristics show that there is sediment transport potential each mid winter at this small subarctic river flowing towards the arctic ocean based on the results the near bed flow velocities of up to 0 35 m s are expected to be able to transport the bedload in the coldest mid winter conditions in meandering rivers having ʻslightly gravelly sandʼ as their material sizes similar to the pulmanki river the strength of the present study is that multiple years of flow observations were possible to apply from the same cross sectional locations and that transport occurs especially at inlet and apex locations despite spatial and temporal variations in ice and flow velocity conditions under the expected future shortening of the frozen period prowse et al 2011 turcotte et al 2011 lind et al 2016 changes in bed sediment transport are also expected based on these mid winter conditions the models used for future sediment transport simulations could be validated in more detail than previously thus the next step is to detect whether or not the current simulation approaches will be able to produce the observed transport conditions or if changes in the modelling approaches and fine tuning of the equations are needed continuing the measurement at the pulmanki river and different seasonally ice covered rivers and their long term data series would enable such better validated future analyses in this present study it was only possible to analyse one meander bend which was symmetrical in its shape and therefore represents only one type of river reach to fully understand the sediment transport processes the river reaches having different characteristics e g varying curvature and braiding urroz and ettema 1994 would also need to be analysed we had not yet included the curvature in our analyses as there is ongoing research by the authors where the flow directions and effect of curvature on them and also the spatial analyses are further considered in more detail the larger the river system is detailed consecutive measurements become more difficult especially in ice covered conditions the data analysed in the present study enabled the application of simple sediment transport potential analyses and further analyses based on the densimetric froude number impacts of the ice cover roughness parameter namaee and sui 2019 or impacts of fluid viscosity incl water temperature would give further insight into the flow processes in varying mid winter sediment transport conditions the pulmanki river had had smooth rough ice cover during the analysed years when defined visually following demers et al 2013 lotsari et al 2017 and kämäri et al 2017 however more detailed roughness analyses for example via underwater photogrammetry would be important next step and undergoing work is also to analyse any possible sampling error of mechanical bed load measurements in ice covered conditions multiple measurements of bedload with different methods for further developing winter time ice covered measurements however this data is not yet available for this present paper therefore to gain these results of roughness impact and bedload both laboratory and field measurements are needed together to get further information on these different sediment transport conditions affecting different types of reaches the difficulties in wintertime field measurements could also be overcome in the future when measurement techniques develop further and autonomous measurement methods e g underwater remote sensing and long term observation stations enable analyses of spatially wider and temporally longer ice covered flow processes 6 conclusions the comparison between the mid winter conditions in 2016 2021 showed that there is great variation in near bed velocities between winters but also spatially within a meander bend however the velocities of mid winter conditions exceeded the requirements for particle motion each year 2016 2021 at inlet and apex area of a meander bend at the pulmanki river but also at the outlet area during years having discharges classified as high or intermediate it was possible to detect three different types of situations regarding the sediment transport and near bed velocity conditions 1 rather similar higher flow and transport conditions throughout the meander bend during the years having the two highest overall discharges 2 low velocities throughout the meander bend during the mid winter having the lowest discharge however even during that year the shear velocities required for sediment transport were exceeded at least in some measurement verticals of most of the cross sections 3 during the years of intermediate discharges the velocities and sediment transport potential were higher at the upstream inlet and apex sections of the meander bend but clearly lower downstream of the apex the confinement of the channel by the river ice cover i e bedfast ice explains the velocity variation the near bed velocities were highest at the upstream inlet section of a symmetrical meander bend where the measurement cross sections were shallower the velocities were lowest in the cross sections located downstream of the apex where the channel changed from relatively narrow to relatively wide at the apex the narrowest cross section had the highest correlation in most of the analysed mid winters of 2016 2021 between depth as explanatory factor and near bed velocity shear velocity and the transport stage parameter the correlation was showing in most years at each cross section negative values when near bed velocities and transport stage parameters were compared to ice thickness instead in most years positive values occurred when near bed velocities and transport stage parameter had been analysed against depth except at csa and cs4 the study showed that there is bedload transport despite low overall discharges during mid winter conditions of a small circa 20 m wide subarctic meandering river based on the results the near bed flow velocities of up to 0 35 m s are expected to be able to transport bedload in the coldest mid winter conditions in

2686,global climate change has been projected to affect hydrology the ice covered flow period and river morphology including changed sediment transport conditions in northern high latitude regions to understand the impact of the expected shortening of the ice covered period on bedload transport one needs to understand the present sediment transport in these high latitude rivers with annually occurring ice cover thus the aims are 1 to define the impacts of ice cover on near bed flow characteristics during hydrologically varying years and 2 to analyse the impacts of these mid winter flow characteristics on the bed sediment transport potential the analyses are based on acoustic doppler current profiler adcp 2016 21 and acoustic doppler velocimeter adv 2020 21 measurements performed in mid winter ice covered conditions of the sandy and small circa 20 m wide pulmanki river in northern finnish lapland despite the ice covered river conditions in winter sediment transport occurs even during these harshest mid winter conditions the critical velocities and shear velocities of mid winter conditions were exceeded in winters 2016 2021 and bedload transport occurred according to bedload measurements three different situations occurred regarding the bed sediment transport and near bed velocity conditions 1 high measured mid winter discharges indicate high velocities throughout the meander bend 2 low measured mid winter discharges cause low near bed velocities throughout the meander bend 3 winters having intermediate discharges indicate near bed velocities and sediment transport potential being higher at the upstream inlet and apex sections of the meander bend but clearly lower downstream of the apex the confinement by the river ice cover i e bottom fast ice explains the velocity variation the near bed velocities were the highest at the upstream inlet section of a symmetrical meander bend where the measurement cross sections were narrower and shallower the velocities were the lowest downstream of the apex where the channel changed from relatively narrow to wider and deeper keywords ice covered flow near bed velocity sediment transport time series analysis subarctic finland data availability the data set of this study is shared as supplementary material excel file format 1 introduction due to global climate change rapid changes are occurring especially in northern high latitude regions ipcc 2021 the warming has been projected to affect hydrology the ice covered flow period and river morphology including changed sediment transport conditions syvitski 2002 kämäri et al 2015 2018 song et al 2019 ipcc 2021 the duration of the frozen and unfrozen periods including river ice cover and its properties may affect the sediment transport characteristics however according to lotsari et al 2015a in their review of reach scale river simulation approaches to future in channel changes overall there had been very few modelling approaches and none of the reviewed papers had included river ice cover cf table 1 of lotsari et al 2015a the enormous and risky work required for measuring the flow and sediment transport potential in ice covered conditions has been one of the factors influencing the availability of data for calibrating models for present and future simulations thus to understand the impacts of the expected future shortening of the frozen period prowse et al 2011 turcotte et al 2011 lind et al 2016 on sediment transport including bedload and before being able to perform reliable future modelling an understanding is needed of the present sediment transport conditions in different high latitude northern rivers with annually occurring ice cover long term data series would enable these analyses at the watershed scale studies of the northern rivers and their sediment transport have mainly concentrated on large arctic rivers e g lena mackenzie ob yenisey the smaller watersheds have received less focus lewis and lamoureux 2010 even though they cover the majority of the land area north of 60 latitude these smaller watersheds respond to fast hydrological changes as the small lake percentage and connectivity of the river network usually enable a relatively quick flow through the system veijalainen et al 2010 kämäri et al 2015 this makes them ideal for measuring the annual variability in the river ice cover and magnitude of the related sediment transport process especially within this northern zone of the most rapid climate change syvitski 2002 ipcc 2021 in high latitude low turbidity rivers bedload can be a major transport process especially during the low flow periods of the ice covered season as many watershed scale sediment load analyses have mainly focused on the suspended load instead of including bedload new insights into reach scale sediment transport are needed before analysing at the watershed scale or projecting into the future ladegaard pedersen et al 2017 recent studies have shown that the ice covered flow season can have a significant impact on river bed sediment transport tremblay et al 2014 lotsari et al 2015b polvi et al 2020 studies on suspended sediment transport in ice covered conditions also exist from previous prowse 1993 ettema and daly 2004 and recent decades and analytical methods based on acoustic signals have recently appeared moore et al 2013 weiss et al 2015 however more studies on reach scale ice covered bed sediment transport processes are especially still needed from a variety of river ice conditions before being able to fully understand the complex flow ice and sediment transport interactions in different river systems the measurements under ice cover are possible via drillholes lotsari et al 2017 for analysing simultaneous flow velocities and bedload transport conditions these ice covered flow and bedload transport conditions can be detected by applying standard equipment such as acoustic doppler current profilers adcp and mechanical helley smith bedload samplers helley and smith 1971 lotsari et al 2017 2019a the helley smith sampler and adcp continuous moving boat measurement with bottom track have been simultaneously used for measuring bedload conditions in an open channel flow rennie et al 2002 gaeuman and jacobson 2006 rennie et al 2017 relationships between bedload and bed velocity i e sediment movement parameters could also be made in ice free seasons gaeuman and jacobson 2006 the presence of ice cover makes transport processes more complicated than in open channel conditions because the roughness of the ice cover has an impact on the flow area and velocities recent research on the ice covered flow of natural rivers i e not laboratory environments has shown that the high velocity cores are closer to the river bed under the ice cover than in open channel conditions e g demers et al 2011 lotsari et al 2017 in a laboratory study by wang et al 2008 the location of the maximum velocity has been shown to move to the bed this is consistent with the studies done in natural rivers by demers et al 2011 and lotsari et al 2017 regarding high velocity core locations wang et al 2008 had also shown in the laboratory that for the same flow depth the near bed velocity under the ice cover is clearly higher than that in the open channel flow further in natural rivers the river ice especially during severe winters and under low flow conditions can cause the flow to concentrate only within the deepest and highest velocity portion of the channel prowse 1996 this may impact the sediment transport including the bedload despite the overall low flow conditions during the ice covered season when compared to other seasons lotsari et al 2019b however the ice cover has been shown to reduce the sediment transport through decreasing velocity bed shear stress and diffusivity prowse 1996 according to beltaos and burrell 2016 the ice cover changes the flow velocity and shear stress but it also affects changes in vertical diffusivity and longitudinal dispersion further affecting the spread of suspended substances studies on the impacts of the ice cover on sediment transport are rarer in natural rivers than in laboratory experiments however a few studies do exist for example the shear forces exerted on the river bed have been shown to increase when the ice thickness and especially its roughness increase kämäri et al 2015 based on the study of kämäri et al 2015 done with a one dimensional hydraulic model hec ras a smooth thermally formed 5 40 cm thick ice cover overall decreased the average shear stress compared to an open water situation also changes in boundary shear stress and flow resistance have been analysed based on the ice cover zare et al 2016a b biron et al 2019 zare et al 2016a showed that ice deposition and erosion can occur during the stable ice cover period as a result of flow variations induced by hydropeaking they also showed that commonly employed assumptions about ice and bed zone velocity values hydraulic radii and energy grade line slopes are inaccurate in these cases further zare et al 2016b studied the shear stress imposed on the boundaries of a natural ice covered river especially during different ice stages and demonstrated that the bed shear stress during the ice cover period is less than during the open water condition which proves that the upper boundary layer i e the ice cover presence has a diminishing effect on bed shear stress however recent publications using acoustic analyses and dealing with river bed resistance in ice covered conditions such as zare et al 2016a have often been done only from one spatial location of the river channel and cross sectional or spatially varying data and analyses between years have not been detected in laboratory conditions namaee and sui 2019 studied the role of critical dimensionless shear stress grain size and roughness of ice cover on the incipient motion of bed material around bridge piers they found that the ice cover can cause a deeper maximum scour depth than in open channel flow conditions and also the required flow velocity for the incipient motion of sediment particles under the ice cover decreases with an increase in the relative roughness coefficient of the ice cover namaee and sui 2019 also wang et al 2008 concluded based on their laboratory study that if the ratio between the ice cover resistance coefficient to the resistance coefficient of channel bed increases then the location of the maximum velocity moves to the bed due to the complex observed impacts of the ice cover on sediment transport processes in both natural and laboratory river experiments and the lack of studies concentrating especially on bedload transport in natural i e non laboratory rivers the impact of hydrologically different winters and their varying ice cover conditions on near bed velocities and the expected bedload transport requires further attention the long time series of ice covered flow and bedload sediment transport conditions are rare in northern high latitude rivers one of them is the pulmanki river in northern finnish lapland where ice covered mid winter conditions have been measured systematically for several years the subarctic study region is within the area of the fastest projected future climatic change and is central for analysing the following impacts of hydrological variability and changes thus this unique data series from the years 2016 2021 makes the pulmanki river an ideal location for analysing the varying mid winter conditions on the near bed flow characteristics and their potential for the sediment transport in the ice covered season the aims of this paper are 1 to define the impacts of ice cover on near bed flow characteristics during hydrologically varying years and 2 to analyse the impacts of these mid winter flow characteristics on the bed sediment transport potential near bed velocity means the velocity measured closest to the river bed within the limits of the equipment the analyses are based on adcp 2016 21 and acoustic doppler velocimeter adv 2020 21 measurements performed in mid winter ice covered conditions at the pulmanki river in northern finnish lapland 2 study site the study site is located at the meandering pulmanki river which is a tributary of the tana river fig 1 the pulmanki river is divided into two parts by lake pulmanki the watershed area of the upper pulmanki river is 484 km2 this study concentrates on one simple symmetric meander bend of the upper pulmanki river its radius of curvature and width of the curvature at the apex are 110 m and 19 m respectively lotsari et al 2014 the climate of northern finnish lapland is influenced both by the atlantic ocean heated by the gulf stream and the great asian continent in the east autio and heikkinen 2002 therefore this area belongs to the köppen climate class cold without dry season but with cold summer the pulmanki river typically freezes in october when the temperature drops below 0 c peel et al 2007 lotsari et al 2019b temperatures start to rise above 0 c again in early april and the freezing period can last approximately seven months lotsari et al 2019b the temperatures usually reach 30 to 40 c sometime during the period of december february figs 2 and 3 in lotsari et al 2019b the pulmanki river had a smooth rough ice cover during the analysed years when defined visually from photos and ice blocks lifted onto the ice surface following demers et al 2013 lotsari et al 2017 and kämäri et al 2017 this was similar to mid winters in 2014 and 2015 analysed by kämäri et al 2017 and lotsari et al 2017 2019a 2019b annual maximum discharges occur during spring snowmelt events when discharges typically rise to 50 m3 s kasvi et al 2013 this typically occurs between mid may and early june during summer discharges are around 4 m3 s and less than 2 m3 s discharges have been measured during autumn and winter lotsari et al 2019a the river runs through glaciolacustrine and glacio fluvial sediments which had been deposited after the ice dammed lake had drained during the final wasting of the fennoscandian ice sheet hirvas et al 1988 johansson 1995 2007 lotsari et al 2020a the d50 values of the river bank material have been measured to range from approximately 0 004 mm to 0 529 mm and the friction angle of the material to be 35 36 5 cf for a detailed description of the banks sediment and figures of ice free conditions from lotsari et al 2020a making the sediment highly mobile consolidated sediment does not appear in the area where there is active river activity there the material is loose sand and gravel for example a high bank studied by lotsari et al 2020a includes 1 5 16 m of loose very well sorted fluvial sand with weak soil development in the upper 0 3 m in addition roots are only causing cohesion at the top of the bank within 0 5 m depth the bulk density of channel bank sediment is 1 73 g cm3 the bed load is the main mode of transport as the suspended sediment amount is small even during the spring snow melt discharge periods cf lotsari et al 2020b 3 methods 3 1 near bed velocity measurements the flow velocity was measured in 2016 2021 cross sectionally with an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp m9 sensor sontek table 1 the m9 sensor has both four 3 0 mhz beams and four 1 5 mhz beams the sensor is accurate up to 0 25 of the measured velocity 0 2 cm s sontek 2015 within the cross sections each measurement hole was drilled about 1 m apart from each other the measurements always began from the left bank and moved towards the right bank the ice depths were measured before the sensor was placed through the holes of the ice cover there were some measurement verticals where the water depth was too shallow for measurements and therefore only the ice thickness was measured from those locations the stationary mode of the m9 sensor was applied i e it produces the time averaged value of each measured parameter at each measurement drillhole location the mid section method was selected for discharge measurements and the averaging time was set to 60 s at each drill hole we selected this time averaged method each year to avoid the macro turbulent impact of the river flow lotsari et al 2020b i e for gaining the time averaged flow parameters directly from the sensor and also for comparing the data between years the sensor which had been mounted on a metal rod was lowered at the level of ice cover water interface before initiating the measurements at each drillhole the tagline azimuth was defined before the adcp measurement at the first drillhole of each cross section a vertical beam was used as the depth reference the transducer depth of the sensor was set as 0 m to maximise the flow measurement area in the vertical direction in this shallow water environment and to include all possible effects of the ice cover and river bed as a result of these adcp measurements the spatial and vertical variations in flow velocity and flow depth were gained from each of the drilled holes within the measurement cross sections the adcp calculates the total velocity of each cell based on the following equation 1 x 2 y 2 z 2 where x y and z represent the velocities in the three different directions the near bed velocities i e the measured total velocity of the cells closest to the river bed were extracted from the data sets the height of the measured cells from the river bed was also derived based on the depth of the cell and the total measured depth of each measurement vertical in some of the measurement points the water depth was too shallow for the adcp as it requires around 25 cm of water thus from these measurement verticals sontek s flowtracker a side looking adv acoustic doppler velocimeter was instead applied to measure the velocity close to the river bed the flowtracker makes a point measurement whereas adcp velocities are obtained over the spatial domain of the acoustic beams the flowtracker was placed as close to the river bed as possible i e the sensor s lower edge was 3 cm above the river bed each time the sensor has 5 cm vertical height and the upper limit of the measurements was each time around 8 cm up from the river bed the measurement height from the river bed coincided with most of the near bed velocity cell heights measured with the adcp cf results section the flowtracker measurements were done in the same cross sections as the adcp measurements table 1 note that the mid section discharge measurement mode was not used in the case of the flowtracker instead each point measurement was a separate 50 second long measurement for making the data set comparable with the adcp data as the flowtracker gives the results in x y and z directions the total velocities of each flowtracker measurement were calculated using eq 1 the near bed velocities measured with the adcp and flowtracker were then compared from year to year at each cross section 3 2 the analyses of the sediment transport and related near bed flow characteristics the near bed flow velocities of each winter were also compared against the critical fluvial forces capable of initiating the bedload movement this also required analyses of the grain sizes of the transported bedload material which were measured in the winters of 2020 and 2021 the helley smith sampler helley and smith 1971 was applied for mechanically measuring the bedload transport on 6 february 2020 and 18 february 2021 table 2 the measurements were aimed to take each time from the high flow location of that cross section i e in the middle or at the left bank side of cs1 and at the outer bank side of the other cross sections cs2 cs3 and cs4 note that no measurements were taken from csa csb or csc the intake opening of the sampler was 77 mm each sample was taken for 6 min each time each sample was dried in the oven 105 c and weighted the bedload was calculated with eq 2 cf morales et al 2019 where g is the dry weight kg b is the intake opening m and t is the measurement time min 2 g b t the grain size distribution of each sample was analysed via dry sieving and by using sieves having half phi interval mesh sizes the d10 d50 and d90 values were calculated in addition to defining the textural group in the winter of 2020 two samples were large enough for dry sieving in the winter of 2021 six samples were large enough for dry sieving table 2 we did not include the unsieved samples in this study the average d50 value of all sieved samples was calculated as these are the basis for the bedload movement analyses the average d50 grain size of all bedload samples was 0 5383 mm in the winter of 2021 and 0 6076 mm in the winter of 2020 overall the average d50 grain size of all samples in 2020 and 2021 had been 0 5557 mm the average d90 value was 1 1341 mm this average d50 value of 0 5557 mm was used in the equations for analysing whether the mid winter near bed velocities were capable of exceeding the critical forces needed to move these sized particles from all analysed years in addition for gaining the spatial distribution of the grain sizes of the river bed the van veen bulk bed sediment sampler was applied to get a more detailed distribution of the river bed material the samples were taken from the right middle and left bank locations at each cross section in 2020 october these were thus measured between the mid winter 2020 and mid winter 2021 measurement times and these river bed material conditions can be expected to best represent the distribution of the 2020 and 2021 mid winter bed material the average d50 and d90 sediment grain size values were calculated for each cross section the d50 values were then used for analysing whether the mid winter 2020 and 2021 velocities exceeded the critical thresholds for moving the sediment these data were not applied in the analyses of previous years to avoid uncertainties as the bed material might have been different in 2016 2019 thus the average d50 value of 0 5557 mm based on helley smith samples was used for all years the traditional hjulström 1935 critical velocity for transport lower line would have been 0 035 m s for 0 5557 mm sized particles i e for the average d50 value of helley smith bedload samples the comparative critical velocity for erosion hjulström 1935 would have been 0 275 m s in addition to comparing the exceeding of these thresholds for motion other methods were also applied for selecting the methods for analysing flow characteristics and their impact on bed sediment transport various previous publications of open channel and under ice particle motion studies were checked especially the ones done in ice covered laboratory experiments and which have not yet been tested widely in real river environments these included publications related to the densimetric froude number for incipient motion of sediment wang et al 2008 eqs 4 and 5 hirshfield and sui 2011 however for being able to define the sediment particle motion as much as possible based on the measured data sets the wang et al 2008 method was discarded as the parameters such as the roughness coefficient of ice cover ni and the roughness coefficient manning s n nb of the channel bed would have been needed to be estimated which would have caused more uncertainties to the analyses also we did not apply the direct moving bed analysis method based on the adcp s bottom track such as by rennie et al 2002 as our data had the output only in time averaged format single value from each drillhole due to the stationary discharge measurement mode which had also been selected for minimizing the possible effect of macro turbulence lotsari et al 2020 we also discarded the methods that would have included parameters that we would not have data for a detailed definition and which would have caused further uncertainties under the ice cover for example the definition of the local slope is uncertain this cross sectional gradient definition for streamwise velocity would have affected the results zare et al 2016b zare et al 2016 also presented different ways to calculate boundary shear stress one of them including a method without the slope effect based on maximum and average velocities and the von karman constant eq 7 of theirs however we did not select this method for our use as it had been originally defined based on a bottom mounted adcp for gaining the local boundary shear stress on both upper ice water interface and lower river bed boundaries and not for detecting the motion of particles similar in size to the pulmanki river material in addition the bed shear velocity related to grains approach of van rijn 1984 was discarded as it would have made the results cross sectionally averaged due to the applied mean velocity that approach would have also required calculation of chezy equation with hydraulic radius parameter which would have been an approximation and would have caused further uncertainties namaee and sui 2019 had used in their ice covered laboratory experiments logarithmic equation for defining the shear forces their eq 9 this equation has been previously been applied for defining the shear velocity from direct flow measurements wilcock 1996 sime et al 2007 according to wilcock 1996 using a single near bed velocity observations in the equation are less precise than if depth averaged velocity in the vertically averaged logarithmic velocity profile is applied instead however wilcock 1996 states that this method requires appropriate flow conditions only near the bed so it may be applied in a wider range of flow conditions including spatially variable flow also according to rhoads 2020 this law of the wall in question can be applied for local shear analyses at channel boundary sime et al 2007 applied the same equation and state that wilcock 1996 results were for time averaged velocities at a particular set of measurement heights at a single site and not instantaneous adcp measurements as our data is time averaged and from various spatial locations the wilcock 1996 approach where the single velocity measurements had been applied for shear velocity u calculation was selected thus we selected the approach which allowed the calculation of shear velocity exactly for the measured velocity value closest to the river bed for calculating critical shear velocity we selected to use a parameterization of the shield s shields 1936 curve more precisely decided to follow the van rijn 1984 approach where non dimensional grain size d is applied after defining both the observed shear velocity u and the critical shear velocity u c the transport stage parameter van rijn 1984 was defined by comparing the resulting shear velocity and critical shear velocities also namaee and sui 2019 had applied this transport stage parameter in their under ice laboratory experiments thus first the particle parameter d was calculated with eq 3 van rijn 1984 their eq 1 3 d d 50 s 1 g v 2 1 3 where s is specific density and calculated as ρ s ρ ρ is the mass density of water 0 99987 g cm3 or 999870 g m3 in zero celsius degree water temperature as we had no other mineralogical knowledge of the sediment ρ s was defined as a quartz density of 2 65 g cm3 common for sand sizes in the majority of natural streams g is the gravitational acceleration which is 9 826 m s2 in the study area of northern finland poutanen et al 2017 v is the kinematic viscosity coefficient defined as μ ρ i e based on dynamic viscosity coefficient µ however as for 0 temperature water the kinematic viscosity coefficient is known to be 1 7930 mm2 s kestin et al 1978 we applied this value directly d50 value of the sediment particle was 0 5557 mm as it is the average value for the transported bedload based on helley smith measurements in addition the d was also calculated based on the average d50 value of each cross section s bed sediment which had been sampled in october 2020 table 3 then the critical mobility parameter θcr was defined based on the equation defined at fig 1 of van rijn 1984 the equation was selected based on the d values defined for applied grain sizes for the 0 5557 mm particles average of helley smith bedload samples the d was 9 530 and the following equation was selected for θcr 4 θ cr 0 14 d 0 64 the resulting critical mobility parameter value was 0 033 this is used for calculating the critical shear velocity and further transport stage parameter for all cross sections of each studied year when calculating the critical mobility parameter based on the autumn 2020 bulk bed sediment samples of each cross section the same equation eq 4 was applicable for cs1 cs3 and cs4 but for the cross sections csa cs2 csb and csc the equation for d values between 10 and 20 was applicable cf d values table 3 5 θ cr 0 04 d 0 10 the resulting critical mobility parameter values are presented in table 3 these are applied for calculating the critical shear velocities and further transport stage parameter for winters 2020 and 2021 next the critical shear velocity u c was solved from the equation eq 6 and 7 van rijn 1984 6 θ cr u c 2 s 1 g d 50 which can be written in the form 7 u c θ cr s 1 g d 50 the resulted critical shear velocities m s were 0 017 based on the average grain sizes of helley smith samples the critical shear velocities based on the autumn 2020 cross sectional sediment data are presented in table 3 according to wilcock 1996 the logarithmic relation between the shear velocity u and the variation of velocity u with height z above bed is as follows eq 8 8 u u 1 κ l n z z 0 from this equation the shear velocity can be resolved when writing the equation in the following form 9 u u κ l n z z 0 u is the variation of velocity with height z above the bed wilcock 1996 according to wilcock 1996 single observation of u can be used to estimate u which we also here now on name as u z in our study as mentioned above the u is the time averaged near bed velocity i e measured within 50 60 s with adcp or adv despite being single observation it represents velocity variation within 50 60 s the measurements of ours were mostly within the lowest 20 of the water column thus making the application of this equation as valid cf wilcock 1996 only at the following locations the measurement had been slightly more than 20 of the full depth from the river bed in 2016 one location at csa in 2018 two locations at cs1 6 locations at cs2 and 10 locations at csb in 2019 one location at csa and one at cs4 in 2020 two locations at csa and in 2021 one location at cs1 however for the unity of the results we calculated the values also for these locations based on the same equation κ is the von karman s constant defined 0 4 similarly to namaee and sui 2019 and wilcock 1996 the z0 is the bed roughness length corresponding to u 0 wilcock 1996 had calculated it for gravel particles with equation ad84 30 where a 3 also sime et al 2007 had followed wilcock 1996 and stated that z0 0 1d84 however sime et al 2007 also state that for well sorted uniformly packed sediment z0 d50 30 note that their study was based on moving boat adcp measurements not time averaged stationary measurements as ours are according to rhoads 2020 the law of the wall in question can be applied for local shear analyses at channel boundary they state that in these cases the common method for defining whether or not at least some portion of the lower part of the turbulent boundary layer exhibits a logarithmic profile and for solving the shear velocity and also the bed roughness length z0 has been to measure mean velocities at several different heights above the bed over the lowest 15 20 of the flow depth and using the resulting data to fit in linear regression analyses however our data does not have several measurements within this 15 20 layer and our shear velocity analyses are therefore based on one measured velocity of the cell closest to the river bed this scarcity of data from bottom layer as adcp inherently leaves cells partially or fully touching the river bed unmeasured as in our data set due to potential data contamination or potential side lobe interference was the reason why gaeuman and jacobson 2004 state that accurate estimates of the height of zero velocity z0 flow cannot be obtained from adcp data rhoads 2020 states also that an alternate approach for eliminating the need for this linear regression analysis is to define a relation between z0 and particle size such as for example wilcock 1996 and sime et al 2007 had done the d84 sediment sizes mentioned in sime et al 2007 are from 17 mm to 82 mm thus making the sediment much larger than in our study site cf the d90 values from table 3 our sediment sizes are well sorted sand or gravelly sand i e smaller than gravel or pebbles table 2 due to these reasons we decided to follow the approach of namaee and sui 2019 whose study had been done in ice covered laboratory conditions and had applied particles from 0 47 0 5 and 0 58 mm in their experiments our d50 value of helley smith samples fell within this range also they had depth of flow as 1 3 m which is close to the maximum measured water depths of pulmanki river in winters c f supplementary material namaee and sui 2019 stated that z0 can be represented as roughness height which is the d50 value of the sediment particle thus due to the similarities to the experimental study conditions of namaee and sui 2019 we applied 0 5557 mm as z0 as it is the average value for the transported bedload based on helley smith measurements this was used for calculating data sets from all years in addition the shear velocity for the years 2020 and 2021 was calculated as a test based on the average d50 value of each cross section s bed sediment which had been sampled in october 2020 table 3 finally the transport stage parameter was calculated based on eq 10 van rijn 1984 their equation 2 10 t u z 2 u c 2 u c 2 this shows the transport capacity based on how much there is excess shear velocity greater than the critical shear velocity if the value is negative there is no excess shear velocity to enable transport the calculations were done for each measurement location at each cross section of each mid winter situation in 2016 2021 the calculated shear velocity derived based on the above equations from original adcp and flowtracker data of each measurement location was compared to the critical shear velocity cf the full results are presented in supplementary material excel format the spatial particle transport potential of each winter was analysed from these data sets in comparison to shear velocity analyses the near bed velocities were analysed against the critical velocity threshold of hjulström 1935 i e whether or not the near bed velocity was greater than the defined threshold in addition the explanatory factors of water depth full depth below ice and ice cover thickness were used against near bed velocities shear velocities and transport stage parameters in pearson s correlation analysis to estimate the linear relationship between the normally distributed variables based on the assumptions of pearson s correlation the method was suitable for the analyses of our data the results of the pearson s correlation analysis can vary between 1 and 1 either indicating a negative or positive linear relationship between variables values close to zero indicate a low correlation between variables 4 results 4 1 the near bed flow characteristics of 2016 2021 mid winter conditions overall the near bed velocities were slow in different winter conditions in 2016 2021 fig 2 the years 2021 2020 and 2019 had mostly higher velocities at the upstream cross sections cs1 csb such as over 0 2 0 3 m s lower velocities i e less than 0 15 m s occurred more often at cs3 cs4 in 2018 the near bed velocities of each cross section were less than 0 1 m s in most of the measurement verticals the overall lowest discharge of the studied years 0 18 m3 s table 1 explains this difference the first two winters 2016 and 2017 had discharges of 1 38 and 1 32 m3 s respectively and thus were very much comparable to each other the near bed velocities were also most consistently the highest in those years i e over 0 2 m s velocities occurred in the three most downstream located cross sections however cs1 inlet cs2 and csb apex had the highest near bed velocities being over 0 25 m s and in many verticals over 0 3 m s the near bed velocities were the highest at the left bank side at cs1 of the inlet area and close to the outer bank side at cs2 and csb thus three different mid winter conditions were observed table 1 fig 2 1 very low discharge and near bed velocities occurred in 2018 when the near bed velocities were low throughout the meander bend 2 two higher mid winter discharge conditions were present in 2016 and 2017 and velocities were higher throughout the meander bend 3 the three last years 2019 2021 had intermediate discharges of 0 5 0 79 m3 s and velocities had been clearly divided between higher velocities at the upstream inlet and the apex sections and lower velocities at the downstream outlet section when comparing different years the lowest near bed velocities occurred most frequently within the cross sections 3 and c these cross sections locate where the cross sectional width area and flow depth increase after a narrower and shallower reach table 4 cf depths from supplementary material the river channel had been confined by the river ice in a way that in the upstream part of the meander bend approximately at cs1 cs2 the channel had been narrower due to mid channel bars and bottom fast ice during many winters i e not possible to measure with the adcp and thus no location measured cf fig 2 also the flow had been diverted next to the outer bank in narrow cross sections of the apex area which also caused higher velocities in several years the width and area of the measurement cross sections can be seen in fig 2 and table 4 thus after flowing from the narrow csb towards the more downstream cross sections the river widened and deepened and slower near bed velocities occurred unfortunately we do not have data from the actual pressure conditions from each winter i e whether or not the flow was pressurised when drilling the ice cover there was no artesian well style surge of water on top of the ice in any of the cross sections during the measurement years thus more likely indicating non pressurised conditions the differences and similarities between the locations of maximum near bed velocities were possible to detect during years 2016 2021 fig 3 the maximum velocities were especially clustered at the left bank side at cs1 and the outer bank at csb and cs3 the most variation between years had been at csa and csc over the years fig 3 the mid channel bar at cs1 existed only in 2020 2017 and 2016 however in 2018 the mid channel bar had influenced the division of flow at cs1 csa and cs2 and the location of maximum velocity varied that year the most from the other years between these cross sections in 2020 the mid channel bar had located at cs1 and csa on the contrary the flow had been possible to measure in mid winter 2021 throughout all cross sections thus the mid channel bars had not influenced the division of the flow around the bar at that time the variations in near bed velocity fig 2 shear velocity cf supplementary material and transport stage parameter fig 4 were analysed against explaining factors of depth full water depth below the ice and ice cover thickness tables 5 and 6 when the annual connections were analysed table 5 all pearson correlation values show very little correlation between any parameters the highest positive correlations occurred in 2016 0 41 and 2021 0 39 between depth and ice thickness and only twice was there a negative correlation greater than 0 30 which occurred in 2020 between ice thickness and near bed velocity 0 32 and ice thickness and shear velocity 0 34 all other parameters and years correlated closer to zero thus basically no correlation occurred when depth was compared to shear velocity or transport stage parameter similarly correlation values were mostly very low when ice thickness was compared to shear velocity or transport stage parameter the application of different d50 values as the basis of the calculations had no clear effect on the results table 5 despite being generally low correlation coefficients in 2016 all correlations were positive in 2017 there was negative correlation when ice thickness was applied in analyses against near bed velocity shear velocity and transport stage parameter but positive correlation when depth was applied in the analyses only in 2018 the correlation between depth and ice thickness was negative i e the greater the depth the thinner the ice thickness in other years the value was positive the correlation coefficient between depth and shear velocity or transport stage parameter and ice thickness and shear velocity or transport stage parameter were mostly negative i e the greater the depth or ice thickness the smaller the shear velocity and transport stage parameter table 6 explains this situation of very low annual correlation values as it shows the correlation between the parameters separately within each cross section there is great variation in the direction of correlation between different cross sections during certain mid winter measurement times but differences also occurred between years for certain cross sections csb which locates at the apex and which has been the narrowest cross section in four out of six mid winter measurement times table 4 has high correlation in most of the years when depth is used in the correlation analyses only in 2021 the correlation between depth and near bed velocity shear velocity or transport stage parameter had been very low when ice thickness was applied in the analyses high correlation occurred with ice thickness in years 2016 2018 and 2020 at csb the years 2021 and 2019 which had lower correlations belong to the ʻintermediate discharge magnitudeʼ mid winter conditions when there had been clearly higher velocities at the upstream and apex sections and lower near bed velocities at the downstream measurement locations when ice thickness was analysed against shear velocity or transport stage parameter at csb only in 2018 and 2020 the correlations were clearly high and negative 0 72 or more at each case meaning that the greater the ice thickness had been the smaller the shear velocity or transport stage parameter had been at csb the correlation between depth and the near bed velocity is mainly positive i e the greater the depth the greater the near bed velocities on the other hand the correlation between the ice thickness and the near bed velocities is negative in each year also the ice thickness and depth have a negative correlation at csb in most of the years thus the greater the ice thickness the smaller the depth and near bed velocities in addition to high correlation values occurring at csb the greatest correlation values at cs1 and cs2 table 6 occurred most often between different parameters in 2016 which was considered to have ʻhigh dischargeʼ conditions during the year 2017 which also had relatively high mid winter discharges there had been high correlation values at cs2 between most of the compared parameter pairs only when ice thickness had been compared against shear velocity or transport stage parameter the correlation had been lower i e around 0 31 0 32 at cs2 there is a clear change when detecting the three downstream most cross sections at the outlet area the most often high correlations occurred between parameters in the 2019 and 2021 ʻintermediate dischargeʼ years at cs3 also at csc the highest correlation values of most parameter pairs occurred in 2021 at cs4 it is noteworthy that this is the only cross section where the ʻlow dischargeʼ mid winter year in 2018 most often had a high correlation between parameter pairs the applied grain size had no or very little i e around 0 01 impact on the correlation values table 6 except in 2021 at cs3 the correlation values had been 0 03 0 05 greater when cross sectional bed sediment grain sizes had been applied instead of the average grain size of bed load overall the direction of the correlation between the parameters varies between years and between cross sections the detected great variation in the flow characteristics within the meander bend explains why the correlation values for each mid winter condition are so low table 5 thus the near bed velocity and the thresholds for sediment transport conditions are highly variable throughout the meander bend however they are most consistent at the apex area and there is an impact of the overall discharge on the spatial variation of the parameters 4 2 sediment transport capacity during varying mid winter conditions the shear velocities exceeded the critical shear velocities i e transport stage parameter had been positive at all cross section at least in some measurement verticals in 2016 2017 and 2021 fig 4 supplementary material the shear velocity had been greater than critical shear velocity at least in one measurement vertical each year at cs1 csa cs2 and csb most often i e at all or most of the measurement verticals the threshold value had been exceeded in 2016 2017 2020 at cs1 and csb also these years the threshold value had been exceeded at multiple measurement verticals at csa and cs2 also in 2021 the transport stage parameter had been positive at multiple measurement verticals at cs1 csa cs2 and csb the shear velocity did not exceed the critical shear velocity at all in 2019 at cs3 csc or cs4 in 2018 the shear velocity did not exceed the threshold of sediment transport at any measurement vertical at csc and cs4 and in 2020 at cs3 and csc thus overall this indicates that least transport occurred at csc during different years whether the applied d50 value had been based on the average bed load samples helley smith or on the cross sectional bulk bed sediment samples van veen in the calculations of years 2020 and 2021 affected the values of shear velocity and transport stage parameter cf supplementary material however despite there were differences in the values it only little affected whether or not the critical shear velocity threshold had been exceeded in 2021 only in the following measurement vertical drill holes the threshold was not anymore exceeded if the cross sectional particle size had been applied instead of the particle size of bed load samples cf supplementary material drill holes 7 and 12 at cs1 drill hole 10 at cs3 drill holes 2 3 and 4 at cs4 at drill hole 13 of csa the difference was opposite i e the threshold was exceeded in 2021 when cross sectional sediment data was applied instead of the grain size of the sampled bed load in 2020 the critical shear velocity threshold was not exceeded anymore only at drill hole 9 of cs1 and at drill holes 12 and 16 of cs 4 when cross sectional sediment data was applied note that cross sections cs2 csb and csc had similar spatial variation of excess shear velocity over the critical shear velocity threshold in both 2020 and 2021 years independent of the applied grain size in addition to analysing exceeding of the critical shear velocities the near bed flow velocities were detected against the hjulström 1935 diagram of critical velocities for erosion and transport the hjulström critical velocity for transport 0 035 m s was exceeded in most of the measurement locations as the near bed velocities were higher than that each year fig 3 the velocity of 0 275 m s which is the critical velocity for erosion according to hjulström 1935 would have been exceeded at least in one measurement vertical of the inlet area i e cs1 csa and cs2 in each year except 2019 during mid winter 2019 the exceeding would have occurred from those upstream cross sections only at cs1 and cs2 however in that year at csb as well the critical velocity for erosion would have been exceeded close to the inner bank side fig 2 in addition to the inlet area s cross sections the exceeding of the critical velocity threshold for erosion would have taken place in 2020 also at csb and cs4 and in 2018 at csb in 2016 this threshold was actually exceeded in each measurement cross section and in 2017 at all other cross sections except at cs4 of the outlet area this large amount of measurement verticals where the exceeding of 0 275 m s would have taken place coincides with the years having the highest mid winter discharges i e 1 3 m3 s cf table 1 the bedload transport measurements with the helley smith sampler support this as they show that during each of their measurement time i e in mid winter 2021 and 2020 the bedload was possible to measure from cs1 and cs4 and in 2021 also from cs2 most often sampling was possible from cs1 these measurement locations coincide with the maximum velocities measured in many years fig 3 i e the helley smith measurements were done in the middle or at the left bank side at cs1 and at the outer bank at cs2 and cs4 note that no bedload sample large enough for sieving had been collected from cs3 this coincides with the location where the flow changes from narrow csb towards the wider cross sections of cs3 cs4 and where the near bed velocities had been lower in mid winter 2020 and 2021 when compared to the upstream sections also based on the transport stage parameter no sediment transport would have occurred at cs3 in 2020 and only in one measurement vertical in 2021 5 discussion based on analyses done with a six year long flow velocity data time series 2016 2021 and two years of bedload data 2020 2021 it has been verified that despite the ice cover there is bed sediment transport even during these harshest mid winter conditions at this subarctic river having bed material particles of 0 56 mm the present study adds to the previously studied low and high open channel flow conditions at the same study site cf kasvi et al 2013 lotsari et al 2020b and gives proof that sediment transport occurs during each season this also suggests that the ice cover should be included in future simulations in rivers having seasonal ice cover and the sediment transport over winter should not be ignored in future change studies lotsari et al 2019a had stated based on both simulation and measurement results gained in previous years at the same pulmanki river study site that the extent of the areas where critical velocities are exceeded is reduced due to ice cover when compared to open channel situations note there were fewer measurement cross sections in the 2013 open channel flow period and 2014 mid winter than in the present study despite this reduction the modelling approach of lotsari et al 2019a had shown that there is sediment transport in winter conditions similarly as in the present study done based on data from 2016 to 2021 the discharges of the lotsari et al 2019a study were 0 63 m3 s and thus close to the ones during the ʻintermediateʼ discharge year 2019 0 61 m3 s of the present study according to hirschfield and sui 2011 the maximum flow velocity under ice cover depends on the roughness coefficients of the ice cover and the bed material and the location of maximum flow velocity will be closer to the surface with the smallest resistance coefficient despite the ice cover being categorised as ʻsmooth roughʼ in the pulmanki river the near bed flow velocities had been enough for moving sediment particles in particular at the inlet and apex area of the meander bend each winter three different situations were possible for describing the sediment transport and near bed velocity conditions during 2016 2021 1 ʻhighʼ measured mid winter discharges indicate sediment transport potential and high near bed velocities throughout the meander bend 2 ʻlowʼ measured mid winter discharges indicate low near bed velocities and sediment transport potential throughout the meander bend 3 winters having ʻintermediateʼ discharges indicate near bed velocities and sediment transport potential being higher at the upstream inlet and apex sections of the meander bend but clearly lower downstream of the apex the near bed velocities were the highest at the upstream inlet section of the studied symmetrical meander bend where the measurement cross sections were narrow and shallow and velocities were less in the deeper and wider cross sections of the outlet area the confinement of the channel by the river ice cover i e bottom fast ice can explain the velocity variation in the case of the present study especially during the years when the discharge had been ʻintermediateʼ this statement is consistent with previous studies by kämäri et al 2017 and lotsari et al 2017 2019a that the ice covered high flows concentrated on narrower areas due to ice extents they had also shown that the spatial differences in high and low flow locations increased when compared to open channel conditions in the present study it was possible to show that between years there had also been a variation in the high flow locations especially when the mid channel bars had affected the flow diversion around the two sides of the mid channel bar on the other hand the deep and narrowest cross section at the apex area had shown the least differences between years and it also had in most of the mid winters of 2016 2021 high correlation coefficient values when near bed velocities the ice thickness and depth were compared to each other the correlation between ice thickness and the near bed velocities was negative at that location each year thus the greater the velocity the thinner the ice had been at that location kämäri et al 2017 had also observed this in the same study bend but in the case of depth averaged velocities that is the increase in water flow velocity decreases the ice thickness in each cross section furthermore however the positive correlation was found between depth and near bed velocity at the apex location during most mid winters except in 2019 when it was 0 53 also depth and ice thickness had a positive correlation in 2019 and 2021 at the meander bend apex of the pulmanki river but a negative correlation in 2017 2018 and 2022 thus the greater the depth the greater the near bed velocity but most often the ice thickness is less when greater depths occur wang et al 2008 observed in their laboratory experiments that the higher the flow velocities are needed for the incipient motion of bed material the deeper the flow depth is under ice cover our study indicates overall as the depth had positive correlation with near bed velocity and transport stage parameter in most of the analysed cross sections and years except at csa and cs4 that the greater the depth the greater the near bed velocity and transport capacity are the largest bedload transport helley smith bedload measurements had been measured at the upstream cross section which had the shallowest depths and mid channel bars narrowing the flow area but high flow velocities however also the deeper cross sections located downstream of the apex had bedload transport thus this supports the above observations the mechanical bedload samples should always be taken with some reservations due to the possibility of measurement errors helley and smith 1971 also gaeuman and jacobson 2006 have shown that the squared product moment correlation coefficient r2 has been only 0 33 between the helley smith bedload capture rate kg s and the bedload velocity m s thus including scatter ancey 2020 listed reasons why bedload transport is difficult to predict among them being ʻthe mix of fast and slow processesʼ ʻnonequilibrium and noise driven processesʼ ʻcascades of interacting processesʼ ʻthe varying temporal and spatial scales dependent on flow conditionsʼ ʻthe heterogeneity of materials and flow conditionsʼ and ʻdifficulties in obtaining reliable measurementsʼ in the present study the variation in the velocities between ice covered mid winters of 2016 2021 underlines especially the heterogeneity of flow conditions the near bed velocity and the thresholds for sediment transport conditions were highly variable throughout the meander bend however they were most consistent at the apex area and there was an impact of the overall discharge on the spatial variation of the parameters factors affecting bedload have been analysed more in open channel conditions as an example a study done in an open channel flume khosravi et al 2021 found that the discharge would be the third significant factor affecting bedload transport the most significant impact being flow velocity followed by shear stress discharge bed shear velocity bed slope flow depth median sediment diameter and finally relative roughness many studies have concentrated only on suspended sediment transport in ice covered conditions moore et al 2013 weiss et al 2015 and thus are not directly comparable to the present study the observed and calculated flow characteristics show that there is sediment transport potential each mid winter at this small subarctic river flowing towards the arctic ocean based on the results the near bed flow velocities of up to 0 35 m s are expected to be able to transport the bedload in the coldest mid winter conditions in meandering rivers having ʻslightly gravelly sandʼ as their material sizes similar to the pulmanki river the strength of the present study is that multiple years of flow observations were possible to apply from the same cross sectional locations and that transport occurs especially at inlet and apex locations despite spatial and temporal variations in ice and flow velocity conditions under the expected future shortening of the frozen period prowse et al 2011 turcotte et al 2011 lind et al 2016 changes in bed sediment transport are also expected based on these mid winter conditions the models used for future sediment transport simulations could be validated in more detail than previously thus the next step is to detect whether or not the current simulation approaches will be able to produce the observed transport conditions or if changes in the modelling approaches and fine tuning of the equations are needed continuing the measurement at the pulmanki river and different seasonally ice covered rivers and their long term data series would enable such better validated future analyses in this present study it was only possible to analyse one meander bend which was symmetrical in its shape and therefore represents only one type of river reach to fully understand the sediment transport processes the river reaches having different characteristics e g varying curvature and braiding urroz and ettema 1994 would also need to be analysed we had not yet included the curvature in our analyses as there is ongoing research by the authors where the flow directions and effect of curvature on them and also the spatial analyses are further considered in more detail the larger the river system is detailed consecutive measurements become more difficult especially in ice covered conditions the data analysed in the present study enabled the application of simple sediment transport potential analyses and further analyses based on the densimetric froude number impacts of the ice cover roughness parameter namaee and sui 2019 or impacts of fluid viscosity incl water temperature would give further insight into the flow processes in varying mid winter sediment transport conditions the pulmanki river had had smooth rough ice cover during the analysed years when defined visually following demers et al 2013 lotsari et al 2017 and kämäri et al 2017 however more detailed roughness analyses for example via underwater photogrammetry would be important next step and undergoing work is also to analyse any possible sampling error of mechanical bed load measurements in ice covered conditions multiple measurements of bedload with different methods for further developing winter time ice covered measurements however this data is not yet available for this present paper therefore to gain these results of roughness impact and bedload both laboratory and field measurements are needed together to get further information on these different sediment transport conditions affecting different types of reaches the difficulties in wintertime field measurements could also be overcome in the future when measurement techniques develop further and autonomous measurement methods e g underwater remote sensing and long term observation stations enable analyses of spatially wider and temporally longer ice covered flow processes 6 conclusions the comparison between the mid winter conditions in 2016 2021 showed that there is great variation in near bed velocities between winters but also spatially within a meander bend however the velocities of mid winter conditions exceeded the requirements for particle motion each year 2016 2021 at inlet and apex area of a meander bend at the pulmanki river but also at the outlet area during years having discharges classified as high or intermediate it was possible to detect three different types of situations regarding the sediment transport and near bed velocity conditions 1 rather similar higher flow and transport conditions throughout the meander bend during the years having the two highest overall discharges 2 low velocities throughout the meander bend during the mid winter having the lowest discharge however even during that year the shear velocities required for sediment transport were exceeded at least in some measurement verticals of most of the cross sections 3 during the years of intermediate discharges the velocities and sediment transport potential were higher at the upstream inlet and apex sections of the meander bend but clearly lower downstream of the apex the confinement of the channel by the river ice cover i e bedfast ice explains the velocity variation the near bed velocities were highest at the upstream inlet section of a symmetrical meander bend where the measurement cross sections were shallower the velocities were lowest in the cross sections located downstream of the apex where the channel changed from relatively narrow to relatively wide at the apex the narrowest cross section had the highest correlation in most of the analysed mid winters of 2016 2021 between depth as explanatory factor and near bed velocity shear velocity and the transport stage parameter the correlation was showing in most years at each cross section negative values when near bed velocities and transport stage parameters were compared to ice thickness instead in most years positive values occurred when near bed velocities and transport stage parameter had been analysed against depth except at csa and cs4 the study showed that there is bedload transport despite low overall discharges during mid winter conditions of a small circa 20 m wide subarctic meandering river based on the results the near bed flow velocities of up to 0 35 m s are expected to be able to transport bedload in the coldest mid winter conditions in meandering rivers having ʻslightly gravelly sandʼ as their material sizes similar to the pulmanki river this should be taken into account in future analyses of the changing winter conditions on sediment transport to the arctic ocean especially in the case of larger river systems having similar sand sized river channel bed material the gathered data and knowledge of the transportation locations amounts and conditions enable better calibration and validation of models used for future sediment transport simulations credit authorship contribution statement eliisa lotsari

2687,the complex hydrological connectivity of integrated river reservoir catchment command regions in conjunction with abrupt societal development and population growth impose adverse water availability scenario in the global reservoirs in this context to formulate optimal reservoir operation policies numerous reservoir simulation and optimization models are currently on board however lack of combined hydrologic and hydraulic conceptualizations in the existing reservoir operation framework fetches considerable uncertainty thereby leading to formulation of erroneous reservoir operation rule this study proposed an integrated soil and water assessment tool swat based hydrologic hec ressim based hydraulic and genetic algorithm ga based optimization framework swat hec ressim ga for formulating the optimal reservoir operation rule of the kangsabati reservoir located in the eastern india unlike the existing reservoir operation rules the present study incorporates a 10 daily scale environmental flow estimation approach to quantify the water demand the proposed reservoir operation framework generated rule curve based hec ressim simulation revealed improved reservoir performance with reservoir time reliability volume reliability and resiliency magnitudes of 0 631 0 736 and 0 591 respectively finally this study endorses to use the developed methodology for supply demand management and subsequent reservoir operation in any global reservoir catchment command regions with utmost accuracy keywords environmental flow genetic algorithm hec ressim reservoir operation rule curve swat data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction most of the global reservoirs are involved with incommensurable and conflicting objectives thereby requires a continuous optimization approach for formulating a sustainable operation rule malekmohammadi et al 2011 however the presence of conflicting objectives yields delay in achieving the optimal solution with all desired goals achieved in general the multi objective optimization problems are characterised by multiple optimal solution which constitutes a series of pareto optimal solutions under such contrasting scenario there is an ever increasing apprehension about formulating a balance between supply and demand from allied sectors in river basin scale applications in general the country like india which experience tropical climatology is subjected to substantial seasonal and annual variation in the precipitation and temperature dash et al 2021 dey et al 2022 sahoo et al 2020 this variability tends to create an unstable supply demand scenario for the water managers most of the multi purpose reservoirs are meant to address the adverse flood hazard domestic water supply irrigation water management and hydropower generation problems however the erroneous operation of the reservoirs may aggravate the water management issues by manyfold resulting in poor performance of the given reservoir project in the current state of art the reservoir operation with highly subjective management operations using the conventional technologies may yield inefficient output as reported by global researchers oliveira and loucks 1997 chen 2003 the tendency of most of the indian reservoirs to remain dry in the summer season threatens the structural stability of dam and significantly high reservoir inflow during the monsoon leads to devastating flood scenario in the reservoir downstream the water availability extremes in the monsoon season and lean season makes the operational rule formulation more intricate in nature further rapid urbanization followed by exponential rate of population growth has caused substantial alteration in the hydro climatology of a region hence the formulated operation rule must be feasible enough to accommodate the widespread shifting between the supply demand in the future climate change scenarios presence of numerous decision variables and contrasting objective functions makes the long term reservoir operation quite complex by adding substantial degree of uncertainty guariso and rinaldi 1986 while making operational decisions in reservoir operation the conflicting objectives make the decision making process intricate the conventional way of rule curve embracing using the heuristic approaches is highly subjective thereby leads to erroneous policy formulation they can only provide a simplified reservoir operation rule based on the present water level reservoir storage and generated demand however the established rule curves lack dynamism while significant changes take place with respect to the prevailing condition in such contrasting scenario implementation of a flexible analytic and systematic approach for real time reservoir operation under present and future climate change scenario is quite inevitable in this line the advanced computational technologies are getting attention over the conventional stochastic based approaches upon improving the supply demand dynamics under contrasting objective scenarios the optimisation based approaches for formulating an efficient reservoir operation scheme is quite ancient the commonly used reservoir optimization techniques include linear non linear programing lp nlp dynamic programming heuristic approaches like neural network fuzzy logic shuffled complex evolution and genetic algorithm being a simplified technique with non requirement of any initial solution the lp approach is very commonly used in the reservoir operation studies yeh 1985 subsequently mujumdar and ramesh 1997 proposed a short term annual reservoir operation scheme of an irrigation reservoir using the deterministic lp approach in the dynamic programming dp approach the sequential decision problems are splitted into individual interrelated sub problems thus the complex problems are solved by combining the solutions of smaller sub problems and are suitable enough to address short term i e hourly or daily reservoir operation problems the problem of two parallel reservoirs supplying water for irrigation system management was solved using the dp model forecasted crop et reservoir evaporation loss and inflow are operated in real time to formulate a precise irrigation scheduling policy considering stochastic dynamic programming sdp an extension of the dp which accounts for stochastic behaviour of hydrology was attempted by vedula and mujumdar 1992 for optimal reservoir operation for irrigation planning conversely the heuristic algorithm based approaches work on the basis of simultaneous search of global optimum using a set of points an attempt by oliveira and loucks 1997 revealed that the genetic algorithm ga approach based reservoir operational rule formulation suitably overcome the limitation of finding global optimum and getting trapped at the local optimum associated with the conventional mathematical optimization models while estimating the downstream water demand the existing reservoir operation frameworks ignore the environmental flow e flow component leading to underestimation in demand quantification padhiary et al 2022 sahoo et al 2022 moreover the conventional monthly scale e flow assessment approach results substantial uncertainty in the e flow estimation the tropical monsoon type climatology of the kangsabati river basin krb resulted highly variable streamflow dynamics with respect to space and time dash et al 2021 to maintain the ecological balance between the different supply demand components of the krb the kangsabati reservoir need to be operated optimally across all the time periods in a year the complex physical and hydrological behaviour of a reservoir system may not be adequately represented by the optimization and data driven approaches which could add considerable uncertainty in the decision making process this limitation could be resolved with the estimation of certain hydrological fluxes like reservoir inflow and storage by the use of efficient hydrological model soil and water assessment tool swat dash et al 2020 therefore linking two primary concerns of hydraulic and hydrologic simulation with the optimization may prove to be an efficient way of reservoir operation with multiple objectives further coupling of the swat model derived estimates with the reservoir simulation model hec ressim can appropriately address the complex supply demand mechanism in a reservoir system in light of this the specific research gaps pertaining to development of a flexible reservoir operation scheme for real time application is summarised as follows 1 the existing reservoir operation rules lacks flexibility in futuristic corrections 2 adoption of only hydrologic framework in the reservoir operation rule formulation may not yield a reliable supply demand scenario 3 accurate quantification of e flow and subsequent incorporation in the demand component is lacking in the existing reservoir operation rules and 4 the conventional ga based optimization framework may not adequately represent the supply demand scenario in a complex river reservoir catchment command region hence the present study attempted to address the following research questions i is it essential to provision the futuristic corrections in the reservoir operation rule framework ii will the combined hydrologic hydraulic reservoir simulation framework prove to be more reliable in formulating adaptive reservoir operation rule iii will the consideration of e flow component in the demand quantification alter the supply demand dynamics and iii how effectively the supply demand scenario can be modeled by using the proposed integrated reservoir operation framework the specific objectives of this study are i to set up the hydrological model swat and reservoir simulation model hec ressim for quantifying the various demand components of the command region and ii to develop a swat hec ressim ga based simulation optimization framework for deriving real time reservoir operation rules addressing the flood control and irrigation demand fulfilment objectives 2 materials and methods 2 1 swat model the soil and water assessment tool swat is a watershed scale semi distributed and continuous time step model widely used for analyzing the catchment hydrologic and water quality parameters under varying soil land use and topographic conditions arnold et al 1998 as a physically based model the swat employs various algorithms to conceptualize the water movement and energy balance for evapotranspiration in the catchment akhavan et al 2010 the swat algorithms are solely based on the laws of conservation of mass momentum and energy dash et al 2019 in swat conceptualization scheme first the catchment area is divided into several sub basins followed by hydrologic response unit hru based on the land use soil and slope classes dash et al 2018 the present study adopted the penman monteith approach for computation of potential evapotranspiration the soil conservation service scs proposed curve number cn technique was chosen for simulation of the surface runoff the streamflow is routed through the channel using the variable storage routing method 2 2 hec ressim the hec ressim is a successor of the flood control and conservation system model hec 5 exclusively meant for reservoir simulation in long term decision making the hec ressim was proposed to assist in long term planning and evaluation of complex river reservoir system with major objectives of flood control hydropower generation and irrigation planning the hec ressim is capable of quantifying the effect of major reservoirs on primary hydrological component like streamflow and subsequently formulates the reservoir operation rule to satisfy the downstream demand components with minimal failure the hec ressim is a graphical user interface gui based software that adopts the usace data storage system hec dss for storing and managing the input output database usace 1995 the hec dss tool is competent enough in transferring the data from the geo database to the hec ressim readable format robayo 2004 thus hec ressim behaves as a connecting link between the hydrologic and hydraulic reservoir simulation and decision making process in water resources management usace 1995 in general hec ressim is characterised by three individual modules viz watershed setup reservoir network and simulation wherein individual module solves a unique purpose accessible through different menus and toolbars hec ressim has a provision for users to import the shape files prepared in arc gis as the base map layer the shape file helps the representation of real world reservoir network in the model domain in a much competent way the typical model inputs for hec ressim include the reservoir inflow domestic water withdrawal irrigation demand reservoir operation rule storage capacity area elevation capacity curve diversion and evaporation loss and withdrawal for hydropower generation incorporation of more detailed input information tend to improve the reservoir simulation capability of hec ressim considerably 2 3 multi objective optimization model the reservoir operation based multi objective optimization problems are characterized by the simultaneous optimization of numerous conflicting objectives often the reservoirs have two primary uses including generation of hydropower and supply sufficient quantity of water to meet irrigation demand as observed these objectives are generally contradictory and conflicting in nature with each other an increase in the level of generation of hydroelectric power demands a higher level of water which means a lesser amount of water releasing to meet irrigation demand likewise the policy makers and decision makers should consider the probable trade off between maximizing generation of hydroelectric power and gratifying irrigation and navigation requirements before reaching out for the most optimal policy 2 3 1 genetic algorithm ga genetic algorithm ga is a popular heuristic approach that searches over the solution space in a given problem to find out a unique or set of solutions as envisaged from the holland 1992 the ga resembles the darwin s theory of survival of the fittest the ga based search algorithms are characterised by the natural genetic and selection mechanism that includes reproduction crossover and mutation ga is comprised of different solution locations and random piloted search points to evolve under stated selection policies to the point that optimizes the chosen objective function goldberg 1989 however like other ea ga is deprived of derivatives to identify the best solution the major advantages of ga over other eas is listed as follows goldberg 1989 1 ga tend to search from a population of points irrespective of single search points 2 ga functions on the basis of information of objective function not on auxiliary information like other eas 3 ga is a completely probabilistic transition approach the concept of programming the decision variables of the optimization problem to a single artificial gene within the whole ga set may outline many probable answers to a defined problem in general the solution approach to a given problem begins with an arbitrary chromosome population initially followed by combining with various genetic operators such as the selection mutation and crossover to fine tune the initial solution by fitting suitable chromosomes in subsequent iterations the selection step is constituted by the identification of best chromosome from the gene pool with superior fitness value for survival the crossover mechanism reciprocates the two likely solution of a given optimisation problem between two arbitrary positions based on the single point or multi point crossover chosen during the process of optimal solution selection mutation process introduces new chromosomes to a given population space 2 3 2 development of ga model the present optimization study is characterized by two major objectives of minimizing the deficit in water supply and maximizing the reservoir storage for downstream flood control as per the information obtained from the report of modernisation of kangsabati reservoir project 1988 irrigation department gowb the drinking water supply is meant only for cattle in very few locations of the bankura district hence can be treated as a negligible component however fulfilment of irrigation demand and flood control are the two major thrust areas served by the kangsabati irrigation project hence the optimization problem consisted of two conflicting objectives as increased reservoir storage demands minimal release from the reservoir and the water supply for fulfilment of irrigation demand requires maximum extraction of water from the reservoir since the optimization problem consisted of contrasting objective functions two scenarios based optimization has been approached in this study in the first scenario priority was given to minimize the deficit in water supply only and thereby termed as the supply priority rule curve sprc scenario further equal weightage was given to both minimization of supply deficit and increased reservoir storage in the second scenario and regarded as the equal priority rule curve eprc scenario thus the first reservoir operation scenarios operate solely on optimization of solitary objective function and the second scenario accounts for both the conflicting objective functions with equal priority moreover provision was given to design the release scenario for the environmental flow requirement in the two aforementioned reservoir simulation scenarios all the genetic algorithm formulations used in this study were carried out using the genetic algorithm toolbox of matlab programming tool 2016a and subsequently optimal operating rules were proposed the excellent computational ability of the matlab coupled with inbuilt auxiliary function led to choose matlab over other existing programing languages for the optimization assignment in general the multi objective optimization problems are consisted of two or more conflicting objective functions those are subjected to certain constraints further the solution to these multi objective problems generally exists in sets and family of these sets of points are regarded as the pareto optimal front every individual point in a pareto optimal front is an optimal solution and based on the decision maker s preference the final solution was chosen out of all the optimal solutions while evaluating or aggregating the preferences over multiple objective functions the proposed optimization code uses the concept of pareto optimality ranking por goldberg 1989 the por is a rank based fitness that accounts for the individual objective functions during the optimization process the working procedure of the por approach is described below i as per the objective function all the chromosomes existing in the current population are compared to estimate the pareto optimal front for this population and subsequently assigned a rank 1 for a given set a chromosome belongs to this pareto set if there is no other chromosome that can improve at least one of the objectives without reduction of any other objective ngatchou et al 2005 ii the original set of chromosomes having 1st rank is fixed apart and the remaining chromosomes are compared further to identify a new pareto set having rank 2 the above process is continued until the ranking of all the population is completed iii the value of fitness function for each chromosome is assigned as per their rank as given below liu et al 1997 1 f i 1 rank i where f i is the fitness function value for the ith chromosome and rank i is the rank of the corresponding ith chromosome moreover to obtain the compromise solution of this particular multi objective optimization problem the pareto edgeworth grierson peg theorem suggested by the grierson 2008 was adopted this approach is popularly known as the multi criteria decision making mcdm wherein the competing criteria is mutually satisfied from a set of pareto optimal solution to derive the compromise solution from the set of pareto optimal solutions the mathematical formulations given in the form of codes by elhadidy et al 2015 was adopted the overall framework of the proposed methodology is given in fig 1 2 3 3 formulation of reservoir objective function the present ga based optimization study of the kangsabati reservoir is consisted of the following two objective functions fitness functions viz minimization of the squared deviation of monthly demand for irrigation deficit and improvement of the reservoir storage capacity to aid in flood control and demand fulfilment in the monsoon and lean periods respectively the current deficit in reservoir water availability is indicated by the reservoir water level and subsequently the water level fluctuation represents the variation in the reservoir outflow consequently the reservoir water level is chosen as the decision variable in the present optimization problem the mathematical expression for the two conflicting objectives is given below 2 f 1 m i n i m i z e t 1 12 r t d t 2 s t s t 2 where r t is the water release for fulfilment of irrigation and environmental flow requirement mcm d t is the net water demand from different sectors of reservoir downstream mcm s t is initial water storage volume in the reservoir in the period t mcm and s t is the reservoir target water storage volume in the period t mcm the objective function for the flood control f2 is given by 3 f 2 m i n i m i z e t 1 12 m a x q t d q t th 0 where q t d is the reservoir release corresponding to a given demand in the month t mcm q t th is the discharge threshold above which the reservoir downstream gets flooded mcm the decision variables of this optimization problem are subjected to the following constraints in general the constraints define the range boundary of objective function that imposes restriction on the solution space of the optimization problem 1 water balance constraint the monthly scale reservoir water balance governs the storage release dynamics in any reservoir system and is expressed in the form of continuity equation as 4 s t 1 s t i t r t e t o t p t t 1 2 12 where s t 1 is the final storage of the reservoir in the month t mcm i t is the reservoir inflow in the month t mcm e t is the evaporation loss from the reservoir during time period t mcm o t is outflow from the reservoir during month t mcm and p t is the seepage loss from the reservoir during month t mcm this continuity equation maintains the reservoir water balance during the course of simulation 2 storage constraint under no circumstances the reservoir storage cannot be higher than the designed storage capacity to avoid the overtopping problem moreover the active reservoir storage can also never go below the dead storage capacity to sustain the reservoir structural stability the storage constraints can be expressed as 5 s dead s t s max t 1 2 12 where s dead is the reservoir dead storage capacity and s max is the maximum allowed reservoir storage 3 release constraint the amount of water planned to be released for the fulfilment of the irrigation demand and environmental flow in a given month must be less than equal to the net water demand as represented below 6 r t d t t 1 2 12 4 overflow constraint when the present water level of reservoir exceeds the maximum storage level to avoid the reservoir safety issue the surplus amount of water must be released from the reservoir and termed as the overflow constraint 7 o t s t 1 s max mathematically the overflow constraint is expressed as 8 o t 0 t 1 2 12 the incoming flood water level when reaches the maximum expected reservoir water level i e 153 64 m the additional flood water is released through the emergency spillway and has been suitably defined in the ga optimization framework 3 study area and pedo hydrologic database 3 1 study area the kangsabati river basin krb is located in the indian state of west bengal and bounded between the 86 00 e and 87 30 e longitudes and the 22 20 n and 23 30 n latitudes the study basin comprised of an area of approximately 12014 70 km2 of which the catchment and command regions consisted of 5735 22 km2 and 6 279 48 km2 area respectively the kangsabati river originates in the uplands of the chhota nagpur plateau has caused highly eroded and gullied topography in the upper reaches where ephemeral 1st and 2nd order streams are dominant it flows in south easterly direction before becoming the last contributing river to the ganges river in india the elevation of the krb varies from 2 to 656 m above mean sea level msl the hilly areas are mostly predominant in the north eastern region of the basin the major prevalent soil texture classes present in krb are sandy clay loam and sandy loam and they combinedly constitute 70 13 of total basin area paddy is the main crop grown in the cultivable land of the command area the study basin receives an average annual rainfall of 1400 mm and concentrated mostly during monsoon season which lasts for five months i e from june to october the index map of the study area is shown in fig 2 the kangsabati reservoir is the only reservoir present in the study region meant for two primary purposes of irrigation water supply and downstream flood control the kangsabati irrigation project started with an initial aim to address the acute water scarcity and drought problem in the bankura district and northern part of medinipur district although investigation for the irrigation site was started in the pre independence period as per the recommendation of government of india suitable site was finalised in the post independence period subsequently this project was designed to irrigate an area of 3407 50 and 606 29 km2 during the kharif and rabi seasons respectively in the very first phase of this project the dam was raised over the kangsabati reservoir with irrigation started from the kharif season of 1966 when the dam construction was completed over the right bank tributary of kangsabati river in 1973 74 both the dams were connected to form the single kangsabati reservoir to satisfy the above said objectives the kangsabati reservoir management authority adopts a pre defined irrigation management schedule as given below 3 1 1 existing irrigation management schedule the kangsabati irrigation system is characterized by two major canal systems i e left bank feeder canal lbfc and right bank main canal rbmc to manage the irrigation distribution in the command area the present delivery schedule of both lbfc and rbmc exhibit considerable discrepancy in terms of duration and magnitude of release since the reservoir performs the irrigation mostly during the kharif season the detailed delivery schedule of the lbfc and rbmc are given in table a1 the daily canal release information at both the head regulators is available for the period 1986 2011 as envisaged from table a1 the 26 year average canal release information revealed that both the head regulators remain operational for 62 days during the kharif season the studies conducted by bhadra et al 2009 and mishra et al 2002 in the lbfc and rbmc respectively revealed that 2 to 4 irrigations of varying duration are practiced in the kharif season moreover the starting period of irrigation is mostly confined to the july and august months of the kharif season with gradual delay in irrigation starting is experienced during the year 2009 and 2010 3 2 data acquisition and pre processing 3 2 1 reservoir input database for swat the primary reservoir information essential for the simulation of swat model are enlisted below in table 1 moreover for formulation of an optimized rule curve the historic reservoir information such as the stage area curve stage volume curve daily reservoir inflow and daily reservoir outflow at both the head regulators of lbfc and rbmc were obtained from the irrigation and waterways department bankura govt of west bengal the daily reservoir rainfall data for the period 1986 2018 and the canal network details were procured from the office of the superintending engineer irrigation and waterways department bankura govt of west bengal moreover the seepage loss in the canals and application efficiency information of canal networks were obtained from the water and power consultancy services india ltd report wapcos 2003 the detailed crop calendar of the kangsabati command area during both the crop growing season was prepared by a conducting a detailed field survey 3 2 2 hec ressim simulation database considering the limitation in data acquisition the best possible effort was given to obtain as much as hydro meteorological information essential for the model simulation the major inputs used in the hec ressim simulation incudes the reservoir inflow river network reservoir structural components water level and surface area up to principal spillway and emergency spillway number of gates spillways evaporation loss water spreading area of reservoir irrigation canal networks water demand in the command area before proceeding for the model simulation the raw inputs need to be processed into hec ressim readable format the following steps are adopted for preparing the inputs for hec ressim model simulation i digitization of the stream networks and canal networks using the google earth and subsequent conversion of the digitized networks into the shape file format using the arc gis 10 1 software geo referenced shape files of the reservoir location and extent watershed boundary and stream networks are updated in the watershed module of hec ressim ii time series of reservoir inflow local flow hydrograph irrigation demand observed reservoir pool elevation storage and release are updated in the hec dss for model simulation iii at individual stream gauge locations the rating curve and routing reach parameters are updated prior to this the key locations of the watershed i e gauge locations reservoirs control points diversion locations were identified and updated in the watershed module of hec ressim after updating the database seven flow routing approaches viz coefficient muskingum muskingum cunge 8 pt channel muskingum cunge prismatic channel modified puls ssarr and working r d routing were evaluated on the main stream and major tributaries considering the availability of routing parameters the muskingum method was chosen for the flow routing in this study further reservoir structural and physical information were updated in the software followed defining the reservoir operation details including specification of the operation zones the operation rules that control the releases for each zone and a release allocation strategy that governs how the releases would be allotted to the various outlet locations finally the calibration and validation of the model is executed by the simulation module using the observed reservoir outflow information 4 estimation of various demand components 4 1 estimation of irrigation water demand the domestic water requirement by the stakeholders of the command region is negligible for the kangsabati reservoir hence irrigation requirement for the crops grown in the command area and the environmental flow requirement for sustenance of the aquatic habitat combinedly constitute the water demand for the kangsabati command region the irrigation demand of the command area is solely based on the water requirement of different crops during their growth phases which in turn fulfils their water loss through the et process to maintain the productivity of crops during the water scarcity period chen et al 2022 in this study the monthly irrigation demand of the command area is estimated using the methodology suggested by the doorenbos and pruitt 1977 hence the essential components of the adopted approach viz crop et actual crop water demand and net irrigation demand are estimated as described below 4 1 1 estimation of actual crop water demand the daily scale reference crop et et0 for the command region is estimated at three representative locations of the kangsabati command area having major crops of paddy potato and vegetables using the penman monteith equation the daily scale reference et is further accumulated into monthly time scale in order to estimate the monthly crop water requirement once the et o is estimated the actual crop water demand actual et is estimated by multiplying the crop specific and growth stage specific coefficients with the et o chapter 6 fao 56 paper allen et al 1998 9 et actual et 0 k c i t where k c i t is the crop coefficient for crop i during t growth stage the present study estimated the et actual directly from the swat output database for individual hrus of the command region the magnitude of the crop coefficients adopted in swat for the major crops during three growth phases viz initial mid and end season period are derived as per the usual practice followed in the kangsabati command region and presented in table 2 and subsequently updated in the swat input database 4 1 2 estimation of net irrigation demand the net irrigation demand is characterized by the deficit in crop water requirement which remains unfulfilled by the effective rainfall component of the hydrologic cycle mathematically the net irrigation requirement ir net is defined as 10 ir net et actual dp loss r eff where dp loss the deep percolation loss in the paddy is field in mm and r eff is the effective rainfall in mm thus to accurately quantify the net irrigation requirement over a region estimation of effective rainfall component is quite essential the effective rainfall is defined as the amount of water that infiltrates into the soil and reaches the crop root zone and subsequently lost into air in the form of et after satisfying the various loss components of the hydrologic cycle such as the canopy interception and evaporation the rainfall reaches the ground surface further after extraction of other surface flow component streamflow and subsurface flow components lateral flow and seepage the remaining water stored in the crop root zone is termed as the effective rainfall in the literature many empirical equations exist to compute the effective rainfall in different regions with varying climatic conditions some of the popular approaches for computation of effective rainfall includes the usda scs method usda 1970 et rainfall ratio method us bureau of reclamation method stamm 1967 renfro method chow 1964 however no single empirical approach is adequate enough to quantify the effective rainfall in a generalized condition in this context the physically based modelling approach to derive individual water balance components and subsequently computation of the effective rainfall seems to be the best possible alternative contemplating the ability of swat to simulate the water balance components the hru scale water balance in the command region are derived from the calibrated and validated swat to compute the effective rainfall as given below 11 r eff r q s q lat q seep where r is the magnitude of total precipitation reaching the ground surface in mm q s is the streamflow in mm q lat is the lateral flow in mm and q seep is the seepage loss in the bottom of soil profile in mm the water requirement is computed individually for different crops by identifying the area of growth moreover all the large command area based irrigation projects are subjected to three major loss components viz conveyance efficiency canal efficiency and the field application efficiency the value of these three efficiencies are completely dependent upon the structure and construction material of canal the type of irrigation method practiced in the respective irrigation project a report by government of west bengal 1988 suggested that about 60 of released water from the kangsabati reservoir is lost in the form of evaporation and seepage since the information about individual loss components is not available for the command region as per the report given by cada 1997 the overall irrigation efficiency for the paddy crop by the kangsabati irrigation project was assumed to be 37 accordingly the net irrigation requirement was computed 4 2 estimation of environmental flow although the kangsabati reservoir fulfils the irrigation demand of the downstream command region throughout the year maintaining the minimum environmental flow for sustaining the aquatic ecosystem is inevitable in this study a flow duration curve fdc based approach has been used to derive the essential minimum environmental flow in a monthly time scale for the downstream of reservoir fig 3 a plot of discharge against percent of time flow has equaled or exceeded gives the interpretation of existing variability in the streamflow and popularly known as the fdc in this study observed daily reservoir inflow data for the pristine condition 1950 1973 was subjected to the fdc analysis at 10 daily scale considering averaged value of consecutive ten daily streamflow data as one set each month can be expressed as a set of three individual values for example january month can be expressed as jan i averaged of first ten consecutive daily data jan ii averaged of next ten continuous daily data jan iii averaged of remaining data of the month for the ease of understanding these jan i jan ii are referred as the sub monthly period expressing a month in this way will decrease the inherent noise in the data during monsoon lean periods moreover this approach stabilizes the fluctuations in the inflow data during the lean period particularly those days having high and unexpected magnitude of precipitations using weibull s technique the plotting position was computed for the descending ordered time series data of same sub monthly stage within each window then flow value for each sub monthly stage was computed from the plotted fdc corresponding to ninety percent exceedance probability signified as q90 or the desired environmental flow subsequently the three q90 value of individual month are accumulated to estimate the environmental flow requirement of the respective month 4 3 reservoir performance evaluation indicators the reservoir operation performance as simulated by the hec ressim model was evaluated using a few performance evaluation indicators as given below 4 3 1 reliability reliability is a widely adopted performance evaluation index in water resources planning and is defined as the probability of no failure that occurs during a fixed planning horizon hashimoto et al 1982 reliability is characterised by the inverse of risk thus the reliability of a water resource system can be explained by the probability that the system is in a satisfactory state broadly the reliability can be categorised as time reliability and volume reliability the time reliability of a system is expressed as 12 r t p x t s where r t is the time reliability p refers to probability x t correspond to the state of system in a given time period t and s is a set of satisfactory sets 13 r t 1 f p t p 0 r t 1 f p t p where f p is the number of failure period corresponding to a given demand present in the total time period t p the volume reliability of water resource system correspond to how reliably the system meets the downstream water demand and expressed mathematically as r v v s v d 14 where r v is the volume reliability v s and v d is the volume of water supplied and water demand respectively however the reliability is not capable of describing the severity or likely adverse consequences of failure thus the probable severity of the failure can be ell explained by the performance measures such as the resiliency and vulnerability 4 3 2 resiliency γ resiliency signifies the ability of system to quickly bounce back from the state of failure to the satisfactory state which in turn is an indicative of the fact that how good the system design is while a prolonged failure and increased system recovery time could cause serious implications on the water resources system more the flexibility of a system to operate between the failure and satisfactory state better is the system resiliency let f and s denotes the state of failure and satisfactory the number of transitions from satisfactory to failure state and vice versa must be equal expressed as 15 p x t s a n d x t 1 f p x t f a n d x t 1 s thus resiliency may be defined as the average probability of recovery from the failure set in a single time stem in terms of conditional probability the mathematical expression of the resiliency is given by 16 γ p x t 1 s x t f p x t f a n d x t 1 s p x t f moreover the resiliency is also characterized as the inverse of mean value of time that the system resides in the unsatisfactory state 17 γ 1 m j 1 m d j 1 where d j is the duration of the jth failure event and m is the total number of failure events 4 3 3 vulnerability v the likely consequences of failure in a water supply system is characterized by the reservoir vulnerability sometimes a system of lower failure probability could cause significant damage to the system components hence necessitates quantification of possible adverse consequences thus attempt to maximize the system reliability some time leads to increase in the system vulnerability mathematically vulnerability is expressed as 18 v j f s j e j where e j is the probability of discrete failure corresponding to s j which is the most unsatisfactory and severe outcome in a set of unsatisfactory outcomes f 5 results and discussion 5 1 daily reservoir inflow simulation by swat the reproduction capability of the observed reservoir inflow time series by the swat is illustrated in figs 4 and 5 which show that the peak and low inflow magnitudes are best represented by the swat model during both calibration and validation periods the reservoir inflow peaks were mostly underestimated by the swat during the monsoon period of 2001 and 2003 as shown in fig 4 the nse estimates varied in the range of 0 77 0 84 during the calibration and validation periods which is well above the satisfactory model acceptance criteria defined by the moriasi et al 2007 further the r2 value of 0 77 and 0 85 respectively revealed that the simulated reservoir inflow estimates are in well accordance with their observed counterparts the developed swat seems to be performed well in the least paddy growing regions of the kangsabati river basin which mostly constitute the inflow to the kangsabati reservoir however with a positive bias of 15 40 the validation period of reservoir inflow simulation indicates the overestimation of simulated reservoir inflow to some extent further the predictive uncertainty in reservoir inflow simulation is quite low as envisaged from the r factor estimates of 0 66 and 0 69 during the calibration and validation periods respectively moreover a p factor value of 0 82 during the validation period signified that 82 of observed reservoir inflow values are bracketed inside the simulated inflow time series fig 5 a sensitivity analysis of different model parameters in reservoir inflow simulation revealed that the surface water dynamics plays crucial role in governing the catchment dynamics the curve number becomes the most sensitive parameter fitted range of 47 86 depicting that the reservoir head water region guides the flow to the reservoir inflow location further the main channel conductivity ch k2 magnitude of 30 7 mm hr shows the ease with which water gets transferred from the upstream to the downstream section and becomes the second most sensitive parameter in addition to the surface water parameters some of the groundwater parameters including the soil hydraulic conductivity sol k baseflow alpha factor alpha bf and deep percolation recharge rchrg dp became the subsequent sensitive parameters revealing the role of groundwater parameters in simulating the reservoir inflow dynamics overall with appreciable goodness of fit statistics of reservoir inflow simulation during both calibration and validation periods the swat could simulate daily scale reservoir inflow with reasonable accuracy and subsequently adopted for the reservoir inflow simulation for the whole analysis period 1986 2011 in the historical time scales 5 2 existing reservoir operation strategy of the kangsabati reservoir the daily scale reservoir stage level or rule curve of the kangsabati reservoir resulting due to the adopted reservoir operation strategies was analysed for the period 1986 2011 as envisaged from the fig 6 a considerable discrepancy is noticed among the rule curve of every individual year with the highest and low reservoir stages found in the years 1986 and 1989 respectively the highest available reservoir stage in the year 1986 corresponds to the reduced water demand from the stakeholders in the initial days of reservoir operation moreover maintaining increased reservoir storage in anticipation of the plausible adverse demand scenario could be reason for increased reservoir stage level during the initial years conversely the lowest reservoir stage in the year 1988 corresponds to the significant water deficit caused due to the 1987 drought resulting in substantial water release from the reservoir the average daily rule curve so presented in the fig 6 indicates relatively constant release during the lean period whereas the monsoon period is characterised by significant fluctuation in the water level in general the reservoir operators prefer a monthly time scale as a suitable reservoir operation rule the existing monthly reservoir operation rule of the kangsabati reservoir is illustrated in the fig 7 the rule curves presented herein are characterized by three operation extremes of minimum maximum and average depicting most adverse to most favourable operation scenario as envisaged from the fig 7 the difference between the operational reservoir storage was the lowest during the lean period mar may and becomes maximum during the post monsoon october january period the reservoir storage attained the minimum value during the month of may which is also the case in average and maximum reservoir stage the water demand from the downstream stakeholder experiences sudden reduction in the demand as depicted from the elevated reservoir level during the monsoon periods with highest reservoir level is seen during the june month as depicted from fig 7 least disagreement between the rule curves is more pronounced during the summer season revealing acute water shortage issue every year in the summer season the value of lowest reservoir storage attained a value of 6 57 mcm and 2 87 mcm during the month of april and may respectively thereby necessitating formulation of an optimized operation rule for the kangsabati reservoir however the remaining time periods experience considerable variation in the storage values with the highest storage magnitude is achieved during the month of december moreover the minimum rule curve revealed that during acute water shortage period the reservoir storage faced approximately 94 reduction in the maximum storage value thereby raising a concern for the reservoir operation under future adverse scenarios a close observation at all the rule curves revealed that the current operation rule more resembles to the sop wherein the priority is given to the demand in the present time scale by ignoring the possible future water shortages the reservoir water storage level was the highest i e 133 46 m during the month of september depicting the peak of monsoon season in the krb subsequently the crop water requirement is the lowest in the command region to evaluate the impact of current reservoir operation scheme on the supply demand dynamics of the kangsabati reservoir the hec ressim model simulation was carried out with the existing monthly scale operation rule 5 3 evaluation of hec ressim model performance the hec ressim model was used to simulate monthly reservoir release for the period of 1986 2011 with observed daily reservoir inflow as the primary model input to the hec ressim model the model simulation was carried out with the pre defined operation zones and existing monthly operating rules of the kangsabati reservoir the simulated reservoir release for all the three outlets i e lbfc rbmc and reservoir spillway are the integrated outcome of the reservoir operation rule adopted in the model domain across all the analysis periods the observed reservoir outflow is in good agreement with the simulated outflow however sizeable disagreement is observed during the years 1989 1993 and 2001 fig 8 the hec ressim simulated monthly reservoir outflow matched satisfactorily with the observed reservoir outflow as depicted from goodness of fit statistics of nse 0 85 r2 0 89 and pbias 1 23 the simulated reservoir outflow peaks are reproducing the observed reservoir outflow peaks quite well during both monsoon and lean periods however the peak reservoir release in the range of 20 31 mcm during the monsoon periods of the years 1989 and 1993 is found to be underestimated by the hec ressim model corresponding to the reservoir outflow simulation the monthly reservoir storage is also analysed and presented in fig 9 over the period 1986 2011 the simulated mean reservoir storage estimates reproduced the observed counterparts with nse r2 and pbias estimates of 0 81 0 90 and 3 64 respectively across all the analysis years the hec ressim derived reservoir storage simulations represented the incidences of water stress and surplus phases reasonably well across all the seasonal time horizons however the observed reservoir storages are slightly overestimated in the analysis years of 1990 1991 1992 and 1996 which could be attributed to reduced evaporation loss assessment by the corresponding module of hec ressim model overall the hec ressim reservoir simulation model abled to capture the dynamics of reservoir outflow and storage reasonably well and subsequently adopted for the formulation of simulation optimization based reservoir operation framework 5 4 genetic algorithm based modified reservoir operation scheme the present study adopted the swat simulated monthly reservoir inflow and the monthly irrigation demand as computed from the swat model as the two critical inputs for the ga optimization model formulation table 3 the 10 daily e flow estimates with the pristine river condition at the kangsabati reservoir location reveal that the e flow requirement during the kharif season is 126 37 mcm with a substantial reduction in the error associated with the conventional monthly approach the basic purpose of the optimization study was to estimate the optimum monthly release to fulfil water demand as the amount of water needs to be released in a given time step is the primary objective function of this study thus water release is the decision variable around which the ga formulation is pivoted the performance of ga based optimization algorithm is characterized by the optimal value of population size mutation probability and crossover probability during the initial search process the system performance of the objective function was assessed by considering a population size of 20 probability of crossover and mutation as 0 5 and 0 01 respectively the initial search algorithm resulted a total system performance value of 15816 mcm which includes storage deviation and irrigation deficit of 15512 mcm and 304 mcm respectively in the subsequent iterations the population size is increased by an interval of 20 and the subsequent change in the system performance is illustrated in fig 10 as envisaged from fig 10 the system performance improved gradually with increase in the population size up to 150 wherein the system performance attains an optimal value of 9985 mcm beyond this point no improvement is observed in the value of system performance hence the optimal population size for the ga optimization is set to 158 further keeping the population size 158 and mutation of 0 01 the system performance was evaluated by changing the crossover probability in the range of 0 4 to 0 9 with an increment of 0 05 as illustrated in fig 11 the system performance improves with probability of crossover up to 0 69 and decreases thereafter therefore from the above iterations the crossover probability value was fixed to 0 72 similarly by fixing the population size mutation and probability of crossover as 158 0 01 and 0 72 the number of generations were varied from 20 to 180 with an increment of 20 in each run the variability in the system performance owing to the above ga configurations is well presented in fig 12 after a population size of 171 the value of system performance drastically improved to 8327 mcm with almost zero deviation in the irrigation release is depicted the ga formulation was simulated with the above determined three parameter ranges to construct the optimized monthly rule curves for the kangsabati reservoir the ga based optimization approach in conjunction with the two priority scenarios supply priority and equal priority was used to derive the optimized reservoir rule curves the modified reservoir operation rule curves as obtained from the ga based optimization algorithm is presented in fig 13 the magnitude of reservoir storage as presented in fig 13 revealed that during the initial time period a large amount of water is kept as reservoir storage owing to smaller downstream demand for the supply priority scenario with relatively higher storage in the eprc scenario consequently the reservoir storage decreases till may and in the post monsoon period further the storage regained its peak owing to considerable rainfall in the monsoon season conversely in the equal priority scenario during the monsoon and post monsoon seasons the storage is relatively higher justifying the capability of the ga optimized rule curve in accommodating the future water scarcity and present flood control activities in the krb as illustrated in fig 13 the supply priority and equal priority based derived rule curves are mostly pivoted around the existing average rule curve of the kangsabati reservoir except during the months of april may and november however the relative disagreement between the existing rule curve and equal priority rule curve during different seasons is in the decreasing order of post monsoon monsoon pre monsoon with maximum disagreement is confined to the month of november this seasonal behaviour of the optimized rule curve supports the fact that the rainfall is the major decisive factor over the temperature while planning an effective reservoir operation policy as interpreted from the proposed rule curve under two different priority scenarios the ease with which present demand components are met is relatively better by the supply priority based rule curve with no significant storage for satisfying the flood control objective in the sprc scenario the reservoir storage attains a low level of 63 29 mcm in the month of may resulting in acute water shortage in future where the number of irrigation failure increases from 14 during jan may to 31 during june dec although the sprc based reservoir operation aids in improved performance criteria it performs more as a standard operating policy sop based approach with increased number of irrigation failures hence cannot be adopted as a flexible reservoir operation scheme for the future scenarios however the equal priority derived rule curve curtails the present water demand slightly in order to accommodate flood storage and fulfilment of future water demand those resembles a hedge rule based approach conversely in the eprc the month of november shows relatively high deviation from the average rule curve depicting lower supply demand gap condition considering the relevance and improved applicability of eprc the present study incorporated the equal priority derived rule curves in the subsequent analysis 5 5 evaluation of reservoir operation performance under baseline scenario the adaptability of ga derived operation rule curves was evaluated with respect to the existing rule curves under historical climate change scenario using the four performance evaluation indices as described in the section 4 3 the hec ressim model simulation was carried out for the period 1986 2011 using the swat simulated reservoir inflow estimates the corresponding performance statistics of the reservoir simulation in the historical time horizon are presented in table 4 the reservoir performance was analyzed with respect to the actual irrigation demand for the lbfc and rbmc however to add practicality in the irrigation planning a series of irrigation cut off 10 40 in the actual irrigation demand termed as the critical irrigation ci was also evaluated for the existing and proposed rule curve scenarios the maximum cut off in the actual irrigation demand was limited to 40 since any higher cut off than this tends to induce moisture stress to the crops as interpreted from table 4 the sprc based reservoir simulation corresponds to highest volume and time reliability estimates of 0 832 and 0 741 respectively under existing rule curve scenario similarly under ci conditions the time reliability and volume reliability of the sprc scenario attains the highest value of 0 937 and 0 951 respectively with least reservoir storage available to meet the future water demands hence with reduced reservoir storage in the present scenario the provision for flood control and fulfilment of future irrigation demand is completely ignored in the sprc framework among erc and eprc scenarios the difference between the performance statistics is quite significant as depicted from table 4 as compared to the reliability the resiliency and vulnerability of the eprc based reservoir operation is significantly better than the erc moreover the resiliency and vulnerability estimate of eprc scenario attains a value of 0 675 and 0 130 respectively corresponding to 30 cut off in the actual irrigation demand although over 30 cut off in irrigation results marginal increase in all the four performance statistics its practical implantation in the field condition is highly questionable hence the eprc based approach could be well adopted for integrated irrigation planning and flood control of the kangsabati reservoir with cut off in 30 of the actual irrigation demand may be provisioned during acute water shortage periods 6 conclusions the integrated river reservoir catchment command regions under tropical climatic conditions experience acute water scarcity issue thereby demands efficient use of reservoir therefore this study attempted an integrated hydrologic hydraulic modeling based simulation optimization framework with provision for environmental flow consideration for formulation of optimal reservoir operation rule of the kangsabati reservoir some of the key findings form the assessment of existing and proposed rule curve based reservoir operation of the kangsabati reservoir are described below 1 the swat ep reproduced the daily scale reservoir inflow with reasonable accuracy during the calibration and validation period with nse estimates of 0 77 and 0 84 respectively however certain degree of overestimation in the reservoir inflow is observed during the monsoon season of the validation period 2004 2006 2 the reservoir outflow simulation by the hec ressim model exhibit satisfactory performance with nse 0 85 r2 0 89 and pbias 1 23 during the period 1986 2011 corresponding to the reservoir outflow simulation the reservoir storage prediction is improved substantially as envisaged from nse r2 and pbias estimates of 0 81 0 90 and 3 64 respectively during the analysis years of 1990 1991 1992 and 1996 some of the reservoir storage were found to be slightly overestimated 3 a close observation at the existing rule curves viz minimum maximum and actual revealed considerable discrepancies during the summer season wherein the reservoir storage attains a lower value of 6 57 and 2 87 mcm during april and may respectively moreover the minimum rule curve indicated that during acute water shortage periods the reservoir storage reduced to 94 of the maximum storage value depicting a concern for the reservoir operation under future adverse drought scenarios 4 the ga derived optimized rule curve eprc based hec ressim simulation revealed improved reservoir performance with time reliability volume reliability and resiliency magnitude of 0 614 0 722 and 0 579 respectively although sprc based reservoir operation aids in improved performance criteria but it behaves more as a sop based approach with the number of irrigation failure increases from 14 during jan may to 31 during june dec hence could not be adopted as a flexible reservoir operation scheme for the future scenarios 5 moreover in the context of practical irrigation planning the actual irrigation could be cut off to 30 of the original demand with significant improvement in the reservoir performance credit authorship contribution statement sonam sandeep dash conceptualization methodology software formal analysis writing original draft bhabagrahi sahoo

2687,the complex hydrological connectivity of integrated river reservoir catchment command regions in conjunction with abrupt societal development and population growth impose adverse water availability scenario in the global reservoirs in this context to formulate optimal reservoir operation policies numerous reservoir simulation and optimization models are currently on board however lack of combined hydrologic and hydraulic conceptualizations in the existing reservoir operation framework fetches considerable uncertainty thereby leading to formulation of erroneous reservoir operation rule this study proposed an integrated soil and water assessment tool swat based hydrologic hec ressim based hydraulic and genetic algorithm ga based optimization framework swat hec ressim ga for formulating the optimal reservoir operation rule of the kangsabati reservoir located in the eastern india unlike the existing reservoir operation rules the present study incorporates a 10 daily scale environmental flow estimation approach to quantify the water demand the proposed reservoir operation framework generated rule curve based hec ressim simulation revealed improved reservoir performance with reservoir time reliability volume reliability and resiliency magnitudes of 0 631 0 736 and 0 591 respectively finally this study endorses to use the developed methodology for supply demand management and subsequent reservoir operation in any global reservoir catchment command regions with utmost accuracy keywords environmental flow genetic algorithm hec ressim reservoir operation rule curve swat data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction most of the global reservoirs are involved with incommensurable and conflicting objectives thereby requires a continuous optimization approach for formulating a sustainable operation rule malekmohammadi et al 2011 however the presence of conflicting objectives yields delay in achieving the optimal solution with all desired goals achieved in general the multi objective optimization problems are characterised by multiple optimal solution which constitutes a series of pareto optimal solutions under such contrasting scenario there is an ever increasing apprehension about formulating a balance between supply and demand from allied sectors in river basin scale applications in general the country like india which experience tropical climatology is subjected to substantial seasonal and annual variation in the precipitation and temperature dash et al 2021 dey et al 2022 sahoo et al 2020 this variability tends to create an unstable supply demand scenario for the water managers most of the multi purpose reservoirs are meant to address the adverse flood hazard domestic water supply irrigation water management and hydropower generation problems however the erroneous operation of the reservoirs may aggravate the water management issues by manyfold resulting in poor performance of the given reservoir project in the current state of art the reservoir operation with highly subjective management operations using the conventional technologies may yield inefficient output as reported by global researchers oliveira and loucks 1997 chen 2003 the tendency of most of the indian reservoirs to remain dry in the summer season threatens the structural stability of dam and significantly high reservoir inflow during the monsoon leads to devastating flood scenario in the reservoir downstream the water availability extremes in the monsoon season and lean season makes the operational rule formulation more intricate in nature further rapid urbanization followed by exponential rate of population growth has caused substantial alteration in the hydro climatology of a region hence the formulated operation rule must be feasible enough to accommodate the widespread shifting between the supply demand in the future climate change scenarios presence of numerous decision variables and contrasting objective functions makes the long term reservoir operation quite complex by adding substantial degree of uncertainty guariso and rinaldi 1986 while making operational decisions in reservoir operation the conflicting objectives make the decision making process intricate the conventional way of rule curve embracing using the heuristic approaches is highly subjective thereby leads to erroneous policy formulation they can only provide a simplified reservoir operation rule based on the present water level reservoir storage and generated demand however the established rule curves lack dynamism while significant changes take place with respect to the prevailing condition in such contrasting scenario implementation of a flexible analytic and systematic approach for real time reservoir operation under present and future climate change scenario is quite inevitable in this line the advanced computational technologies are getting attention over the conventional stochastic based approaches upon improving the supply demand dynamics under contrasting objective scenarios the optimisation based approaches for formulating an efficient reservoir operation scheme is quite ancient the commonly used reservoir optimization techniques include linear non linear programing lp nlp dynamic programming heuristic approaches like neural network fuzzy logic shuffled complex evolution and genetic algorithm being a simplified technique with non requirement of any initial solution the lp approach is very commonly used in the reservoir operation studies yeh 1985 subsequently mujumdar and ramesh 1997 proposed a short term annual reservoir operation scheme of an irrigation reservoir using the deterministic lp approach in the dynamic programming dp approach the sequential decision problems are splitted into individual interrelated sub problems thus the complex problems are solved by combining the solutions of smaller sub problems and are suitable enough to address short term i e hourly or daily reservoir operation problems the problem of two parallel reservoirs supplying water for irrigation system management was solved using the dp model forecasted crop et reservoir evaporation loss and inflow are operated in real time to formulate a precise irrigation scheduling policy considering stochastic dynamic programming sdp an extension of the dp which accounts for stochastic behaviour of hydrology was attempted by vedula and mujumdar 1992 for optimal reservoir operation for irrigation planning conversely the heuristic algorithm based approaches work on the basis of simultaneous search of global optimum using a set of points an attempt by oliveira and loucks 1997 revealed that the genetic algorithm ga approach based reservoir operational rule formulation suitably overcome the limitation of finding global optimum and getting trapped at the local optimum associated with the conventional mathematical optimization models while estimating the downstream water demand the existing reservoir operation frameworks ignore the environmental flow e flow component leading to underestimation in demand quantification padhiary et al 2022 sahoo et al 2022 moreover the conventional monthly scale e flow assessment approach results substantial uncertainty in the e flow estimation the tropical monsoon type climatology of the kangsabati river basin krb resulted highly variable streamflow dynamics with respect to space and time dash et al 2021 to maintain the ecological balance between the different supply demand components of the krb the kangsabati reservoir need to be operated optimally across all the time periods in a year the complex physical and hydrological behaviour of a reservoir system may not be adequately represented by the optimization and data driven approaches which could add considerable uncertainty in the decision making process this limitation could be resolved with the estimation of certain hydrological fluxes like reservoir inflow and storage by the use of efficient hydrological model soil and water assessment tool swat dash et al 2020 therefore linking two primary concerns of hydraulic and hydrologic simulation with the optimization may prove to be an efficient way of reservoir operation with multiple objectives further coupling of the swat model derived estimates with the reservoir simulation model hec ressim can appropriately address the complex supply demand mechanism in a reservoir system in light of this the specific research gaps pertaining to development of a flexible reservoir operation scheme for real time application is summarised as follows 1 the existing reservoir operation rules lacks flexibility in futuristic corrections 2 adoption of only hydrologic framework in the reservoir operation rule formulation may not yield a reliable supply demand scenario 3 accurate quantification of e flow and subsequent incorporation in the demand component is lacking in the existing reservoir operation rules and 4 the conventional ga based optimization framework may not adequately represent the supply demand scenario in a complex river reservoir catchment command region hence the present study attempted to address the following research questions i is it essential to provision the futuristic corrections in the reservoir operation rule framework ii will the combined hydrologic hydraulic reservoir simulation framework prove to be more reliable in formulating adaptive reservoir operation rule iii will the consideration of e flow component in the demand quantification alter the supply demand dynamics and iii how effectively the supply demand scenario can be modeled by using the proposed integrated reservoir operation framework the specific objectives of this study are i to set up the hydrological model swat and reservoir simulation model hec ressim for quantifying the various demand components of the command region and ii to develop a swat hec ressim ga based simulation optimization framework for deriving real time reservoir operation rules addressing the flood control and irrigation demand fulfilment objectives 2 materials and methods 2 1 swat model the soil and water assessment tool swat is a watershed scale semi distributed and continuous time step model widely used for analyzing the catchment hydrologic and water quality parameters under varying soil land use and topographic conditions arnold et al 1998 as a physically based model the swat employs various algorithms to conceptualize the water movement and energy balance for evapotranspiration in the catchment akhavan et al 2010 the swat algorithms are solely based on the laws of conservation of mass momentum and energy dash et al 2019 in swat conceptualization scheme first the catchment area is divided into several sub basins followed by hydrologic response unit hru based on the land use soil and slope classes dash et al 2018 the present study adopted the penman monteith approach for computation of potential evapotranspiration the soil conservation service scs proposed curve number cn technique was chosen for simulation of the surface runoff the streamflow is routed through the channel using the variable storage routing method 2 2 hec ressim the hec ressim is a successor of the flood control and conservation system model hec 5 exclusively meant for reservoir simulation in long term decision making the hec ressim was proposed to assist in long term planning and evaluation of complex river reservoir system with major objectives of flood control hydropower generation and irrigation planning the hec ressim is capable of quantifying the effect of major reservoirs on primary hydrological component like streamflow and subsequently formulates the reservoir operation rule to satisfy the downstream demand components with minimal failure the hec ressim is a graphical user interface gui based software that adopts the usace data storage system hec dss for storing and managing the input output database usace 1995 the hec dss tool is competent enough in transferring the data from the geo database to the hec ressim readable format robayo 2004 thus hec ressim behaves as a connecting link between the hydrologic and hydraulic reservoir simulation and decision making process in water resources management usace 1995 in general hec ressim is characterised by three individual modules viz watershed setup reservoir network and simulation wherein individual module solves a unique purpose accessible through different menus and toolbars hec ressim has a provision for users to import the shape files prepared in arc gis as the base map layer the shape file helps the representation of real world reservoir network in the model domain in a much competent way the typical model inputs for hec ressim include the reservoir inflow domestic water withdrawal irrigation demand reservoir operation rule storage capacity area elevation capacity curve diversion and evaporation loss and withdrawal for hydropower generation incorporation of more detailed input information tend to improve the reservoir simulation capability of hec ressim considerably 2 3 multi objective optimization model the reservoir operation based multi objective optimization problems are characterized by the simultaneous optimization of numerous conflicting objectives often the reservoirs have two primary uses including generation of hydropower and supply sufficient quantity of water to meet irrigation demand as observed these objectives are generally contradictory and conflicting in nature with each other an increase in the level of generation of hydroelectric power demands a higher level of water which means a lesser amount of water releasing to meet irrigation demand likewise the policy makers and decision makers should consider the probable trade off between maximizing generation of hydroelectric power and gratifying irrigation and navigation requirements before reaching out for the most optimal policy 2 3 1 genetic algorithm ga genetic algorithm ga is a popular heuristic approach that searches over the solution space in a given problem to find out a unique or set of solutions as envisaged from the holland 1992 the ga resembles the darwin s theory of survival of the fittest the ga based search algorithms are characterised by the natural genetic and selection mechanism that includes reproduction crossover and mutation ga is comprised of different solution locations and random piloted search points to evolve under stated selection policies to the point that optimizes the chosen objective function goldberg 1989 however like other ea ga is deprived of derivatives to identify the best solution the major advantages of ga over other eas is listed as follows goldberg 1989 1 ga tend to search from a population of points irrespective of single search points 2 ga functions on the basis of information of objective function not on auxiliary information like other eas 3 ga is a completely probabilistic transition approach the concept of programming the decision variables of the optimization problem to a single artificial gene within the whole ga set may outline many probable answers to a defined problem in general the solution approach to a given problem begins with an arbitrary chromosome population initially followed by combining with various genetic operators such as the selection mutation and crossover to fine tune the initial solution by fitting suitable chromosomes in subsequent iterations the selection step is constituted by the identification of best chromosome from the gene pool with superior fitness value for survival the crossover mechanism reciprocates the two likely solution of a given optimisation problem between two arbitrary positions based on the single point or multi point crossover chosen during the process of optimal solution selection mutation process introduces new chromosomes to a given population space 2 3 2 development of ga model the present optimization study is characterized by two major objectives of minimizing the deficit in water supply and maximizing the reservoir storage for downstream flood control as per the information obtained from the report of modernisation of kangsabati reservoir project 1988 irrigation department gowb the drinking water supply is meant only for cattle in very few locations of the bankura district hence can be treated as a negligible component however fulfilment of irrigation demand and flood control are the two major thrust areas served by the kangsabati irrigation project hence the optimization problem consisted of two conflicting objectives as increased reservoir storage demands minimal release from the reservoir and the water supply for fulfilment of irrigation demand requires maximum extraction of water from the reservoir since the optimization problem consisted of contrasting objective functions two scenarios based optimization has been approached in this study in the first scenario priority was given to minimize the deficit in water supply only and thereby termed as the supply priority rule curve sprc scenario further equal weightage was given to both minimization of supply deficit and increased reservoir storage in the second scenario and regarded as the equal priority rule curve eprc scenario thus the first reservoir operation scenarios operate solely on optimization of solitary objective function and the second scenario accounts for both the conflicting objective functions with equal priority moreover provision was given to design the release scenario for the environmental flow requirement in the two aforementioned reservoir simulation scenarios all the genetic algorithm formulations used in this study were carried out using the genetic algorithm toolbox of matlab programming tool 2016a and subsequently optimal operating rules were proposed the excellent computational ability of the matlab coupled with inbuilt auxiliary function led to choose matlab over other existing programing languages for the optimization assignment in general the multi objective optimization problems are consisted of two or more conflicting objective functions those are subjected to certain constraints further the solution to these multi objective problems generally exists in sets and family of these sets of points are regarded as the pareto optimal front every individual point in a pareto optimal front is an optimal solution and based on the decision maker s preference the final solution was chosen out of all the optimal solutions while evaluating or aggregating the preferences over multiple objective functions the proposed optimization code uses the concept of pareto optimality ranking por goldberg 1989 the por is a rank based fitness that accounts for the individual objective functions during the optimization process the working procedure of the por approach is described below i as per the objective function all the chromosomes existing in the current population are compared to estimate the pareto optimal front for this population and subsequently assigned a rank 1 for a given set a chromosome belongs to this pareto set if there is no other chromosome that can improve at least one of the objectives without reduction of any other objective ngatchou et al 2005 ii the original set of chromosomes having 1st rank is fixed apart and the remaining chromosomes are compared further to identify a new pareto set having rank 2 the above process is continued until the ranking of all the population is completed iii the value of fitness function for each chromosome is assigned as per their rank as given below liu et al 1997 1 f i 1 rank i where f i is the fitness function value for the ith chromosome and rank i is the rank of the corresponding ith chromosome moreover to obtain the compromise solution of this particular multi objective optimization problem the pareto edgeworth grierson peg theorem suggested by the grierson 2008 was adopted this approach is popularly known as the multi criteria decision making mcdm wherein the competing criteria is mutually satisfied from a set of pareto optimal solution to derive the compromise solution from the set of pareto optimal solutions the mathematical formulations given in the form of codes by elhadidy et al 2015 was adopted the overall framework of the proposed methodology is given in fig 1 2 3 3 formulation of reservoir objective function the present ga based optimization study of the kangsabati reservoir is consisted of the following two objective functions fitness functions viz minimization of the squared deviation of monthly demand for irrigation deficit and improvement of the reservoir storage capacity to aid in flood control and demand fulfilment in the monsoon and lean periods respectively the current deficit in reservoir water availability is indicated by the reservoir water level and subsequently the water level fluctuation represents the variation in the reservoir outflow consequently the reservoir water level is chosen as the decision variable in the present optimization problem the mathematical expression for the two conflicting objectives is given below 2 f 1 m i n i m i z e t 1 12 r t d t 2 s t s t 2 where r t is the water release for fulfilment of irrigation and environmental flow requirement mcm d t is the net water demand from different sectors of reservoir downstream mcm s t is initial water storage volume in the reservoir in the period t mcm and s t is the reservoir target water storage volume in the period t mcm the objective function for the flood control f2 is given by 3 f 2 m i n i m i z e t 1 12 m a x q t d q t th 0 where q t d is the reservoir release corresponding to a given demand in the month t mcm q t th is the discharge threshold above which the reservoir downstream gets flooded mcm the decision variables of this optimization problem are subjected to the following constraints in general the constraints define the range boundary of objective function that imposes restriction on the solution space of the optimization problem 1 water balance constraint the monthly scale reservoir water balance governs the storage release dynamics in any reservoir system and is expressed in the form of continuity equation as 4 s t 1 s t i t r t e t o t p t t 1 2 12 where s t 1 is the final storage of the reservoir in the month t mcm i t is the reservoir inflow in the month t mcm e t is the evaporation loss from the reservoir during time period t mcm o t is outflow from the reservoir during month t mcm and p t is the seepage loss from the reservoir during month t mcm this continuity equation maintains the reservoir water balance during the course of simulation 2 storage constraint under no circumstances the reservoir storage cannot be higher than the designed storage capacity to avoid the overtopping problem moreover the active reservoir storage can also never go below the dead storage capacity to sustain the reservoir structural stability the storage constraints can be expressed as 5 s dead s t s max t 1 2 12 where s dead is the reservoir dead storage capacity and s max is the maximum allowed reservoir storage 3 release constraint the amount of water planned to be released for the fulfilment of the irrigation demand and environmental flow in a given month must be less than equal to the net water demand as represented below 6 r t d t t 1 2 12 4 overflow constraint when the present water level of reservoir exceeds the maximum storage level to avoid the reservoir safety issue the surplus amount of water must be released from the reservoir and termed as the overflow constraint 7 o t s t 1 s max mathematically the overflow constraint is expressed as 8 o t 0 t 1 2 12 the incoming flood water level when reaches the maximum expected reservoir water level i e 153 64 m the additional flood water is released through the emergency spillway and has been suitably defined in the ga optimization framework 3 study area and pedo hydrologic database 3 1 study area the kangsabati river basin krb is located in the indian state of west bengal and bounded between the 86 00 e and 87 30 e longitudes and the 22 20 n and 23 30 n latitudes the study basin comprised of an area of approximately 12014 70 km2 of which the catchment and command regions consisted of 5735 22 km2 and 6 279 48 km2 area respectively the kangsabati river originates in the uplands of the chhota nagpur plateau has caused highly eroded and gullied topography in the upper reaches where ephemeral 1st and 2nd order streams are dominant it flows in south easterly direction before becoming the last contributing river to the ganges river in india the elevation of the krb varies from 2 to 656 m above mean sea level msl the hilly areas are mostly predominant in the north eastern region of the basin the major prevalent soil texture classes present in krb are sandy clay loam and sandy loam and they combinedly constitute 70 13 of total basin area paddy is the main crop grown in the cultivable land of the command area the study basin receives an average annual rainfall of 1400 mm and concentrated mostly during monsoon season which lasts for five months i e from june to october the index map of the study area is shown in fig 2 the kangsabati reservoir is the only reservoir present in the study region meant for two primary purposes of irrigation water supply and downstream flood control the kangsabati irrigation project started with an initial aim to address the acute water scarcity and drought problem in the bankura district and northern part of medinipur district although investigation for the irrigation site was started in the pre independence period as per the recommendation of government of india suitable site was finalised in the post independence period subsequently this project was designed to irrigate an area of 3407 50 and 606 29 km2 during the kharif and rabi seasons respectively in the very first phase of this project the dam was raised over the kangsabati reservoir with irrigation started from the kharif season of 1966 when the dam construction was completed over the right bank tributary of kangsabati river in 1973 74 both the dams were connected to form the single kangsabati reservoir to satisfy the above said objectives the kangsabati reservoir management authority adopts a pre defined irrigation management schedule as given below 3 1 1 existing irrigation management schedule the kangsabati irrigation system is characterized by two major canal systems i e left bank feeder canal lbfc and right bank main canal rbmc to manage the irrigation distribution in the command area the present delivery schedule of both lbfc and rbmc exhibit considerable discrepancy in terms of duration and magnitude of release since the reservoir performs the irrigation mostly during the kharif season the detailed delivery schedule of the lbfc and rbmc are given in table a1 the daily canal release information at both the head regulators is available for the period 1986 2011 as envisaged from table a1 the 26 year average canal release information revealed that both the head regulators remain operational for 62 days during the kharif season the studies conducted by bhadra et al 2009 and mishra et al 2002 in the lbfc and rbmc respectively revealed that 2 to 4 irrigations of varying duration are practiced in the kharif season moreover the starting period of irrigation is mostly confined to the july and august months of the kharif season with gradual delay in irrigation starting is experienced during the year 2009 and 2010 3 2 data acquisition and pre processing 3 2 1 reservoir input database for swat the primary reservoir information essential for the simulation of swat model are enlisted below in table 1 moreover for formulation of an optimized rule curve the historic reservoir information such as the stage area curve stage volume curve daily reservoir inflow and daily reservoir outflow at both the head regulators of lbfc and rbmc were obtained from the irrigation and waterways department bankura govt of west bengal the daily reservoir rainfall data for the period 1986 2018 and the canal network details were procured from the office of the superintending engineer irrigation and waterways department bankura govt of west bengal moreover the seepage loss in the canals and application efficiency information of canal networks were obtained from the water and power consultancy services india ltd report wapcos 2003 the detailed crop calendar of the kangsabati command area during both the crop growing season was prepared by a conducting a detailed field survey 3 2 2 hec ressim simulation database considering the limitation in data acquisition the best possible effort was given to obtain as much as hydro meteorological information essential for the model simulation the major inputs used in the hec ressim simulation incudes the reservoir inflow river network reservoir structural components water level and surface area up to principal spillway and emergency spillway number of gates spillways evaporation loss water spreading area of reservoir irrigation canal networks water demand in the command area before proceeding for the model simulation the raw inputs need to be processed into hec ressim readable format the following steps are adopted for preparing the inputs for hec ressim model simulation i digitization of the stream networks and canal networks using the google earth and subsequent conversion of the digitized networks into the shape file format using the arc gis 10 1 software geo referenced shape files of the reservoir location and extent watershed boundary and stream networks are updated in the watershed module of hec ressim ii time series of reservoir inflow local flow hydrograph irrigation demand observed reservoir pool elevation storage and release are updated in the hec dss for model simulation iii at individual stream gauge locations the rating curve and routing reach parameters are updated prior to this the key locations of the watershed i e gauge locations reservoirs control points diversion locations were identified and updated in the watershed module of hec ressim after updating the database seven flow routing approaches viz coefficient muskingum muskingum cunge 8 pt channel muskingum cunge prismatic channel modified puls ssarr and working r d routing were evaluated on the main stream and major tributaries considering the availability of routing parameters the muskingum method was chosen for the flow routing in this study further reservoir structural and physical information were updated in the software followed defining the reservoir operation details including specification of the operation zones the operation rules that control the releases for each zone and a release allocation strategy that governs how the releases would be allotted to the various outlet locations finally the calibration and validation of the model is executed by the simulation module using the observed reservoir outflow information 4 estimation of various demand components 4 1 estimation of irrigation water demand the domestic water requirement by the stakeholders of the command region is negligible for the kangsabati reservoir hence irrigation requirement for the crops grown in the command area and the environmental flow requirement for sustenance of the aquatic habitat combinedly constitute the water demand for the kangsabati command region the irrigation demand of the command area is solely based on the water requirement of different crops during their growth phases which in turn fulfils their water loss through the et process to maintain the productivity of crops during the water scarcity period chen et al 2022 in this study the monthly irrigation demand of the command area is estimated using the methodology suggested by the doorenbos and pruitt 1977 hence the essential components of the adopted approach viz crop et actual crop water demand and net irrigation demand are estimated as described below 4 1 1 estimation of actual crop water demand the daily scale reference crop et et0 for the command region is estimated at three representative locations of the kangsabati command area having major crops of paddy potato and vegetables using the penman monteith equation the daily scale reference et is further accumulated into monthly time scale in order to estimate the monthly crop water requirement once the et o is estimated the actual crop water demand actual et is estimated by multiplying the crop specific and growth stage specific coefficients with the et o chapter 6 fao 56 paper allen et al 1998 9 et actual et 0 k c i t where k c i t is the crop coefficient for crop i during t growth stage the present study estimated the et actual directly from the swat output database for individual hrus of the command region the magnitude of the crop coefficients adopted in swat for the major crops during three growth phases viz initial mid and end season period are derived as per the usual practice followed in the kangsabati command region and presented in table 2 and subsequently updated in the swat input database 4 1 2 estimation of net irrigation demand the net irrigation demand is characterized by the deficit in crop water requirement which remains unfulfilled by the effective rainfall component of the hydrologic cycle mathematically the net irrigation requirement ir net is defined as 10 ir net et actual dp loss r eff where dp loss the deep percolation loss in the paddy is field in mm and r eff is the effective rainfall in mm thus to accurately quantify the net irrigation requirement over a region estimation of effective rainfall component is quite essential the effective rainfall is defined as the amount of water that infiltrates into the soil and reaches the crop root zone and subsequently lost into air in the form of et after satisfying the various loss components of the hydrologic cycle such as the canopy interception and evaporation the rainfall reaches the ground surface further after extraction of other surface flow component streamflow and subsurface flow components lateral flow and seepage the remaining water stored in the crop root zone is termed as the effective rainfall in the literature many empirical equations exist to compute the effective rainfall in different regions with varying climatic conditions some of the popular approaches for computation of effective rainfall includes the usda scs method usda 1970 et rainfall ratio method us bureau of reclamation method stamm 1967 renfro method chow 1964 however no single empirical approach is adequate enough to quantify the effective rainfall in a generalized condition in this context the physically based modelling approach to derive individual water balance components and subsequently computation of the effective rainfall seems to be the best possible alternative contemplating the ability of swat to simulate the water balance components the hru scale water balance in the command region are derived from the calibrated and validated swat to compute the effective rainfall as given below 11 r eff r q s q lat q seep where r is the magnitude of total precipitation reaching the ground surface in mm q s is the streamflow in mm q lat is the lateral flow in mm and q seep is the seepage loss in the bottom of soil profile in mm the water requirement is computed individually for different crops by identifying the area of growth moreover all the large command area based irrigation projects are subjected to three major loss components viz conveyance efficiency canal efficiency and the field application efficiency the value of these three efficiencies are completely dependent upon the structure and construction material of canal the type of irrigation method practiced in the respective irrigation project a report by government of west bengal 1988 suggested that about 60 of released water from the kangsabati reservoir is lost in the form of evaporation and seepage since the information about individual loss components is not available for the command region as per the report given by cada 1997 the overall irrigation efficiency for the paddy crop by the kangsabati irrigation project was assumed to be 37 accordingly the net irrigation requirement was computed 4 2 estimation of environmental flow although the kangsabati reservoir fulfils the irrigation demand of the downstream command region throughout the year maintaining the minimum environmental flow for sustaining the aquatic ecosystem is inevitable in this study a flow duration curve fdc based approach has been used to derive the essential minimum environmental flow in a monthly time scale for the downstream of reservoir fig 3 a plot of discharge against percent of time flow has equaled or exceeded gives the interpretation of existing variability in the streamflow and popularly known as the fdc in this study observed daily reservoir inflow data for the pristine condition 1950 1973 was subjected to the fdc analysis at 10 daily scale considering averaged value of consecutive ten daily streamflow data as one set each month can be expressed as a set of three individual values for example january month can be expressed as jan i averaged of first ten consecutive daily data jan ii averaged of next ten continuous daily data jan iii averaged of remaining data of the month for the ease of understanding these jan i jan ii are referred as the sub monthly period expressing a month in this way will decrease the inherent noise in the data during monsoon lean periods moreover this approach stabilizes the fluctuations in the inflow data during the lean period particularly those days having high and unexpected magnitude of precipitations using weibull s technique the plotting position was computed for the descending ordered time series data of same sub monthly stage within each window then flow value for each sub monthly stage was computed from the plotted fdc corresponding to ninety percent exceedance probability signified as q90 or the desired environmental flow subsequently the three q90 value of individual month are accumulated to estimate the environmental flow requirement of the respective month 4 3 reservoir performance evaluation indicators the reservoir operation performance as simulated by the hec ressim model was evaluated using a few performance evaluation indicators as given below 4 3 1 reliability reliability is a widely adopted performance evaluation index in water resources planning and is defined as the probability of no failure that occurs during a fixed planning horizon hashimoto et al 1982 reliability is characterised by the inverse of risk thus the reliability of a water resource system can be explained by the probability that the system is in a satisfactory state broadly the reliability can be categorised as time reliability and volume reliability the time reliability of a system is expressed as 12 r t p x t s where r t is the time reliability p refers to probability x t correspond to the state of system in a given time period t and s is a set of satisfactory sets 13 r t 1 f p t p 0 r t 1 f p t p where f p is the number of failure period corresponding to a given demand present in the total time period t p the volume reliability of water resource system correspond to how reliably the system meets the downstream water demand and expressed mathematically as r v v s v d 14 where r v is the volume reliability v s and v d is the volume of water supplied and water demand respectively however the reliability is not capable of describing the severity or likely adverse consequences of failure thus the probable severity of the failure can be ell explained by the performance measures such as the resiliency and vulnerability 4 3 2 resiliency γ resiliency signifies the ability of system to quickly bounce back from the state of failure to the satisfactory state which in turn is an indicative of the fact that how good the system design is while a prolonged failure and increased system recovery time could cause serious implications on the water resources system more the flexibility of a system to operate between the failure and satisfactory state better is the system resiliency let f and s denotes the state of failure and satisfactory the number of transitions from satisfactory to failure state and vice versa must be equal expressed as 15 p x t s a n d x t 1 f p x t f a n d x t 1 s thus resiliency may be defined as the average probability of recovery from the failure set in a single time stem in terms of conditional probability the mathematical expression of the resiliency is given by 16 γ p x t 1 s x t f p x t f a n d x t 1 s p x t f moreover the resiliency is also characterized as the inverse of mean value of time that the system resides in the unsatisfactory state 17 γ 1 m j 1 m d j 1 where d j is the duration of the jth failure event and m is the total number of failure events 4 3 3 vulnerability v the likely consequences of failure in a water supply system is characterized by the reservoir vulnerability sometimes a system of lower failure probability could cause significant damage to the system components hence necessitates quantification of possible adverse consequences thus attempt to maximize the system reliability some time leads to increase in the system vulnerability mathematically vulnerability is expressed as 18 v j f s j e j where e j is the probability of discrete failure corresponding to s j which is the most unsatisfactory and severe outcome in a set of unsatisfactory outcomes f 5 results and discussion 5 1 daily reservoir inflow simulation by swat the reproduction capability of the observed reservoir inflow time series by the swat is illustrated in figs 4 and 5 which show that the peak and low inflow magnitudes are best represented by the swat model during both calibration and validation periods the reservoir inflow peaks were mostly underestimated by the swat during the monsoon period of 2001 and 2003 as shown in fig 4 the nse estimates varied in the range of 0 77 0 84 during the calibration and validation periods which is well above the satisfactory model acceptance criteria defined by the moriasi et al 2007 further the r2 value of 0 77 and 0 85 respectively revealed that the simulated reservoir inflow estimates are in well accordance with their observed counterparts the developed swat seems to be performed well in the least paddy growing regions of the kangsabati river basin which mostly constitute the inflow to the kangsabati reservoir however with a positive bias of 15 40 the validation period of reservoir inflow simulation indicates the overestimation of simulated reservoir inflow to some extent further the predictive uncertainty in reservoir inflow simulation is quite low as envisaged from the r factor estimates of 0 66 and 0 69 during the calibration and validation periods respectively moreover a p factor value of 0 82 during the validation period signified that 82 of observed reservoir inflow values are bracketed inside the simulated inflow time series fig 5 a sensitivity analysis of different model parameters in reservoir inflow simulation revealed that the surface water dynamics plays crucial role in governing the catchment dynamics the curve number becomes the most sensitive parameter fitted range of 47 86 depicting that the reservoir head water region guides the flow to the reservoir inflow location further the main channel conductivity ch k2 magnitude of 30 7 mm hr shows the ease with which water gets transferred from the upstream to the downstream section and becomes the second most sensitive parameter in addition to the surface water parameters some of the groundwater parameters including the soil hydraulic conductivity sol k baseflow alpha factor alpha bf and deep percolation recharge rchrg dp became the subsequent sensitive parameters revealing the role of groundwater parameters in simulating the reservoir inflow dynamics overall with appreciable goodness of fit statistics of reservoir inflow simulation during both calibration and validation periods the swat could simulate daily scale reservoir inflow with reasonable accuracy and subsequently adopted for the reservoir inflow simulation for the whole analysis period 1986 2011 in the historical time scales 5 2 existing reservoir operation strategy of the kangsabati reservoir the daily scale reservoir stage level or rule curve of the kangsabati reservoir resulting due to the adopted reservoir operation strategies was analysed for the period 1986 2011 as envisaged from the fig 6 a considerable discrepancy is noticed among the rule curve of every individual year with the highest and low reservoir stages found in the years 1986 and 1989 respectively the highest available reservoir stage in the year 1986 corresponds to the reduced water demand from the stakeholders in the initial days of reservoir operation moreover maintaining increased reservoir storage in anticipation of the plausible adverse demand scenario could be reason for increased reservoir stage level during the initial years conversely the lowest reservoir stage in the year 1988 corresponds to the significant water deficit caused due to the 1987 drought resulting in substantial water release from the reservoir the average daily rule curve so presented in the fig 6 indicates relatively constant release during the lean period whereas the monsoon period is characterised by significant fluctuation in the water level in general the reservoir operators prefer a monthly time scale as a suitable reservoir operation rule the existing monthly reservoir operation rule of the kangsabati reservoir is illustrated in the fig 7 the rule curves presented herein are characterized by three operation extremes of minimum maximum and average depicting most adverse to most favourable operation scenario as envisaged from the fig 7 the difference between the operational reservoir storage was the lowest during the lean period mar may and becomes maximum during the post monsoon october january period the reservoir storage attained the minimum value during the month of may which is also the case in average and maximum reservoir stage the water demand from the downstream stakeholder experiences sudden reduction in the demand as depicted from the elevated reservoir level during the monsoon periods with highest reservoir level is seen during the june month as depicted from fig 7 least disagreement between the rule curves is more pronounced during the summer season revealing acute water shortage issue every year in the summer season the value of lowest reservoir storage attained a value of 6 57 mcm and 2 87 mcm during the month of april and may respectively thereby necessitating formulation of an optimized operation rule for the kangsabati reservoir however the remaining time periods experience considerable variation in the storage values with the highest storage magnitude is achieved during the month of december moreover the minimum rule curve revealed that during acute water shortage period the reservoir storage faced approximately 94 reduction in the maximum storage value thereby raising a concern for the reservoir operation under future adverse scenarios a close observation at all the rule curves revealed that the current operation rule more resembles to the sop wherein the priority is given to the demand in the present time scale by ignoring the possible future water shortages the reservoir water storage level was the highest i e 133 46 m during the month of september depicting the peak of monsoon season in the krb subsequently the crop water requirement is the lowest in the command region to evaluate the impact of current reservoir operation scheme on the supply demand dynamics of the kangsabati reservoir the hec ressim model simulation was carried out with the existing monthly scale operation rule 5 3 evaluation of hec ressim model performance the hec ressim model was used to simulate monthly reservoir release for the period of 1986 2011 with observed daily reservoir inflow as the primary model input to the hec ressim model the model simulation was carried out with the pre defined operation zones and existing monthly operating rules of the kangsabati reservoir the simulated reservoir release for all the three outlets i e lbfc rbmc and reservoir spillway are the integrated outcome of the reservoir operation rule adopted in the model domain across all the analysis periods the observed reservoir outflow is in good agreement with the simulated outflow however sizeable disagreement is observed during the years 1989 1993 and 2001 fig 8 the hec ressim simulated monthly reservoir outflow matched satisfactorily with the observed reservoir outflow as depicted from goodness of fit statistics of nse 0 85 r2 0 89 and pbias 1 23 the simulated reservoir outflow peaks are reproducing the observed reservoir outflow peaks quite well during both monsoon and lean periods however the peak reservoir release in the range of 20 31 mcm during the monsoon periods of the years 1989 and 1993 is found to be underestimated by the hec ressim model corresponding to the reservoir outflow simulation the monthly reservoir storage is also analysed and presented in fig 9 over the period 1986 2011 the simulated mean reservoir storage estimates reproduced the observed counterparts with nse r2 and pbias estimates of 0 81 0 90 and 3 64 respectively across all the analysis years the hec ressim derived reservoir storage simulations represented the incidences of water stress and surplus phases reasonably well across all the seasonal time horizons however the observed reservoir storages are slightly overestimated in the analysis years of 1990 1991 1992 and 1996 which could be attributed to reduced evaporation loss assessment by the corresponding module of hec ressim model overall the hec ressim reservoir simulation model abled to capture the dynamics of reservoir outflow and storage reasonably well and subsequently adopted for the formulation of simulation optimization based reservoir operation framework 5 4 genetic algorithm based modified reservoir operation scheme the present study adopted the swat simulated monthly reservoir inflow and the monthly irrigation demand as computed from the swat model as the two critical inputs for the ga optimization model formulation table 3 the 10 daily e flow estimates with the pristine river condition at the kangsabati reservoir location reveal that the e flow requirement during the kharif season is 126 37 mcm with a substantial reduction in the error associated with the conventional monthly approach the basic purpose of the optimization study was to estimate the optimum monthly release to fulfil water demand as the amount of water needs to be released in a given time step is the primary objective function of this study thus water release is the decision variable around which the ga formulation is pivoted the performance of ga based optimization algorithm is characterized by the optimal value of population size mutation probability and crossover probability during the initial search process the system performance of the objective function was assessed by considering a population size of 20 probability of crossover and mutation as 0 5 and 0 01 respectively the initial search algorithm resulted a total system performance value of 15816 mcm which includes storage deviation and irrigation deficit of 15512 mcm and 304 mcm respectively in the subsequent iterations the population size is increased by an interval of 20 and the subsequent change in the system performance is illustrated in fig 10 as envisaged from fig 10 the system performance improved gradually with increase in the population size up to 150 wherein the system performance attains an optimal value of 9985 mcm beyond this point no improvement is observed in the value of system performance hence the optimal population size for the ga optimization is set to 158 further keeping the population size 158 and mutation of 0 01 the system performance was evaluated by changing the crossover probability in the range of 0 4 to 0 9 with an increment of 0 05 as illustrated in fig 11 the system performance improves with probability of crossover up to 0 69 and decreases thereafter therefore from the above iterations the crossover probability value was fixed to 0 72 similarly by fixing the population size mutation and probability of crossover as 158 0 01 and 0 72 the number of generations were varied from 20 to 180 with an increment of 20 in each run the variability in the system performance owing to the above ga configurations is well presented in fig 12 after a population size of 171 the value of system performance drastically improved to 8327 mcm with almost zero deviation in the irrigation release is depicted the ga formulation was simulated with the above determined three parameter ranges to construct the optimized monthly rule curves for the kangsabati reservoir the ga based optimization approach in conjunction with the two priority scenarios supply priority and equal priority was used to derive the optimized reservoir rule curves the modified reservoir operation rule curves as obtained from the ga based optimization algorithm is presented in fig 13 the magnitude of reservoir storage as presented in fig 13 revealed that during the initial time period a large amount of water is kept as reservoir storage owing to smaller downstream demand for the supply priority scenario with relatively higher storage in the eprc scenario consequently the reservoir storage decreases till may and in the post monsoon period further the storage regained its peak owing to considerable rainfall in the monsoon season conversely in the equal priority scenario during the monsoon and post monsoon seasons the storage is relatively higher justifying the capability of the ga optimized rule curve in accommodating the future water scarcity and present flood control activities in the krb as illustrated in fig 13 the supply priority and equal priority based derived rule curves are mostly pivoted around the existing average rule curve of the kangsabati reservoir except during the months of april may and november however the relative disagreement between the existing rule curve and equal priority rule curve during different seasons is in the decreasing order of post monsoon monsoon pre monsoon with maximum disagreement is confined to the month of november this seasonal behaviour of the optimized rule curve supports the fact that the rainfall is the major decisive factor over the temperature while planning an effective reservoir operation policy as interpreted from the proposed rule curve under two different priority scenarios the ease with which present demand components are met is relatively better by the supply priority based rule curve with no significant storage for satisfying the flood control objective in the sprc scenario the reservoir storage attains a low level of 63 29 mcm in the month of may resulting in acute water shortage in future where the number of irrigation failure increases from 14 during jan may to 31 during june dec although the sprc based reservoir operation aids in improved performance criteria it performs more as a standard operating policy sop based approach with increased number of irrigation failures hence cannot be adopted as a flexible reservoir operation scheme for the future scenarios however the equal priority derived rule curve curtails the present water demand slightly in order to accommodate flood storage and fulfilment of future water demand those resembles a hedge rule based approach conversely in the eprc the month of november shows relatively high deviation from the average rule curve depicting lower supply demand gap condition considering the relevance and improved applicability of eprc the present study incorporated the equal priority derived rule curves in the subsequent analysis 5 5 evaluation of reservoir operation performance under baseline scenario the adaptability of ga derived operation rule curves was evaluated with respect to the existing rule curves under historical climate change scenario using the four performance evaluation indices as described in the section 4 3 the hec ressim model simulation was carried out for the period 1986 2011 using the swat simulated reservoir inflow estimates the corresponding performance statistics of the reservoir simulation in the historical time horizon are presented in table 4 the reservoir performance was analyzed with respect to the actual irrigation demand for the lbfc and rbmc however to add practicality in the irrigation planning a series of irrigation cut off 10 40 in the actual irrigation demand termed as the critical irrigation ci was also evaluated for the existing and proposed rule curve scenarios the maximum cut off in the actual irrigation demand was limited to 40 since any higher cut off than this tends to induce moisture stress to the crops as interpreted from table 4 the sprc based reservoir simulation corresponds to highest volume and time reliability estimates of 0 832 and 0 741 respectively under existing rule curve scenario similarly under ci conditions the time reliability and volume reliability of the sprc scenario attains the highest value of 0 937 and 0 951 respectively with least reservoir storage available to meet the future water demands hence with reduced reservoir storage in the present scenario the provision for flood control and fulfilment of future irrigation demand is completely ignored in the sprc framework among erc and eprc scenarios the difference between the performance statistics is quite significant as depicted from table 4 as compared to the reliability the resiliency and vulnerability of the eprc based reservoir operation is significantly better than the erc moreover the resiliency and vulnerability estimate of eprc scenario attains a value of 0 675 and 0 130 respectively corresponding to 30 cut off in the actual irrigation demand although over 30 cut off in irrigation results marginal increase in all the four performance statistics its practical implantation in the field condition is highly questionable hence the eprc based approach could be well adopted for integrated irrigation planning and flood control of the kangsabati reservoir with cut off in 30 of the actual irrigation demand may be provisioned during acute water shortage periods 6 conclusions the integrated river reservoir catchment command regions under tropical climatic conditions experience acute water scarcity issue thereby demands efficient use of reservoir therefore this study attempted an integrated hydrologic hydraulic modeling based simulation optimization framework with provision for environmental flow consideration for formulation of optimal reservoir operation rule of the kangsabati reservoir some of the key findings form the assessment of existing and proposed rule curve based reservoir operation of the kangsabati reservoir are described below 1 the swat ep reproduced the daily scale reservoir inflow with reasonable accuracy during the calibration and validation period with nse estimates of 0 77 and 0 84 respectively however certain degree of overestimation in the reservoir inflow is observed during the monsoon season of the validation period 2004 2006 2 the reservoir outflow simulation by the hec ressim model exhibit satisfactory performance with nse 0 85 r2 0 89 and pbias 1 23 during the period 1986 2011 corresponding to the reservoir outflow simulation the reservoir storage prediction is improved substantially as envisaged from nse r2 and pbias estimates of 0 81 0 90 and 3 64 respectively during the analysis years of 1990 1991 1992 and 1996 some of the reservoir storage were found to be slightly overestimated 3 a close observation at the existing rule curves viz minimum maximum and actual revealed considerable discrepancies during the summer season wherein the reservoir storage attains a lower value of 6 57 and 2 87 mcm during april and may respectively moreover the minimum rule curve indicated that during acute water shortage periods the reservoir storage reduced to 94 of the maximum storage value depicting a concern for the reservoir operation under future adverse drought scenarios 4 the ga derived optimized rule curve eprc based hec ressim simulation revealed improved reservoir performance with time reliability volume reliability and resiliency magnitude of 0 614 0 722 and 0 579 respectively although sprc based reservoir operation aids in improved performance criteria but it behaves more as a sop based approach with the number of irrigation failure increases from 14 during jan may to 31 during june dec hence could not be adopted as a flexible reservoir operation scheme for the future scenarios 5 moreover in the context of practical irrigation planning the actual irrigation could be cut off to 30 of the original demand with significant improvement in the reservoir performance credit authorship contribution statement sonam sandeep dash conceptualization methodology software formal analysis writing original draft bhabagrahi sahoo

2688,the propagation and accumulation of uncertainty within the water supply power generation and environment wpe nexus may induce unexpected failures effective control strategies are needed to reduce the failure risks optimal control of the wpe nexus is challenging because of the complex interconnections and the multiple stakeholders this study employs stochastic dynamical systems to simulate interconnected wpe systems and compares the performance of centralized decentralized and hybrid control strategies the wpe nexus within the hehuang region of china is selected as a case study the results show that all controllable agents are either selfish or generous protecting or sacrificing their own security respectively hybrid control is the most suitable strategy for realistic cases because it balances the risks of selfish and generous agents the manager s role is to balance or hedge the risks and costs across agents by adjusting their decision preferences this involves changing the risks of generous agents and the control costs of selfish agents the three control strategies have little impact on system bottlenecks despite obvious changes in the trajectories of the highest and lowest risk contribution ratios overall this study advances the understanding of different control strategies for the wpe nexus helping to mitigate the failure risk and improve the management of real systems keywords wpe nexus control strategies stochastic model predictive control risk aversion bottleneck shifts data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the water supply power generation and environment wpe nexus is increasingly interconnected within a basin or region cai et al 2018 yaeger et al 2014 forming a large scale interconnected system feng et al 2019 feng et al 2016 in an interconnected wpe nexus any small uncertainty or interruption e g droughts storms or power shortages from a given subsystem can propagate to other subsystems and the interruptions introduced at different times could accumulate to induce a failure in a particular subsystem ghadge et al 2011 peters et al 2009 tang et al 2016 this emergent failure status can be transferred across subsystems so that a minor local failure may induce system wide cascade failures webber 2015 these unexpected or unintended failures caused by the propagation and accumulation of uncertainties through interconnections increase the difficulty of managing the wpe nexus moreover management is challenged by the engagement of multiple stakeholders and decision makers which have their own goals and strive to pursue contradictory benefits waslander et al 2004 this drives the system management to change from a conventional top down pattern to a bottom up one yang et al 2009 therefore there is an urgent need to develop effective control strategies for policy making within the wpe nexus with the purpose of risk aversion and damage mitigation control algorithms are widely applied in large scale interconnected systems including water resources systems yang et al 2009 you and yu 2013 irrigation canal systems schutter et al 2009 zheng et al 2019 power networks schreck 2016 sekine 1963 shukla and mili 2017 and supply chain networks sahin et al 2013 generally these control strategies algorithms can be classified as either feedback or feedforward algorithms heirung et al 2018 mesbah 2016 zheng et al 2019 feedback control e g classical proportional integral control isapoor et al 2011 and centralized linear quadratic control balogun et al 1988 are designed to correct the deviations between actual and predefined reference values targets such that the system states eventually reach the expected targets however the deviations are always corrected after their appearance i e there are time delays between the deviations and the corrections clemmens and schuurmans 2004 lozano et al 2010 thus feedback algorithms cannot prevent failures from occurring in an unexpected or unintended manner liu et al 2007 vasilakopoulos and marshall 2015 feedforward control also called model predictive control mpc should overcome this problem because the control actions are implemented in advance by taking the predicted future system states into account schreck 2016 zheng et al 2019 in mpc cases the future system states are usually predicted by deterministic models however such models would fail to capture the characteristics of the uncertainty propagation and accumulation within the wpe nexus this problem can be solved by extending deterministic mpcs to stochastic mpcs smpcs where the future states are predicted in a stochastic or probabilistic way heirung et al 2018 mesbah 2016 within the smpc framework interconnected systems are generally optimized through a system of systems concept housh et al 2015 yaeger et al 2014 where a centralized approach is used to find the global or system wide optimal solution it is assumed that there exists a central executor that collects information from and sends orders to all subsystems feng et al 2019 housh et al 2015 it is also assumed that the economic efficiency is perfect across all subsystems yaeger et al 2014 yang et al 2009 however these assumptions are violated in realistic cases especially when multiple stakeholders are engaged in the decision making process inalhan et al 2002 sekine 1963 this leads to a decentralized approach where each subsystem or agent optimizes its own decisions based on local system dynamics and limited information exchange based on the decomposition of a large scale interconnected system sekine 1963 developed a decentralized optimization algorithm that exchanges information between the center and subsystems or components after decomposition yang et al 2009 applied a penalty based decentralized optimization algorithm to multiagent system based watershed management and proposed a bargaining procedure that achieves the nash optimal solution however these methods ignore the dynamical variations of the interconnected system focusing only on static equilibrium states thus the present study focuses on the simulation of the wpe nexus and its optimal control in a dynamical scheme furthermore this study examines whether centralized decentralized or hybrid control within the smpc framework is effective in controlling interconnected systems such as the wpe nexus feng et al 2019 additionally the roles of the coordinator manager and local subsystems in mitigating possible failures are investigated and any subsystem that plays a critical role in the failure of the overall system a so called bottleneck is identified overall the goal is to examine the performance of various smpc strategies in mitigating risks within the wpe nexus first the wpe nexus considered by feng et al 2016 is extended to a stochastic scheme stochastic dynamical system similar to that of an et al 2021 to capture both the interconnections and multiple source uncertainties next within the smpc framework the centralized and decentralized control models are formulated to minimize the risks of system failure and the control costs at global and local scales respectively hybrid control is established by combining the structures of centralized and decentralized control i e the lower layer aims to optimize the subsystem behavior using local information while the upper layer aims to optimize the manager behavior i e attitudes of subsystems such that the global objective can be improved the relevant constraints are formulated in a probabilistic way and incorporated into the optimization process through penalty based reasoning following yang et al 2009 and inalhan et al 2002 unlike yang et al 2009 and inalhan et al 2002 however the decentralized control strategy is implemented in a dynamic scheme the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we formulate the centralized decentralized and hybrid control models within the smpc framework in section 3 we describe a case study of the hehuang region in china and introduce the stochastic scheme for the wpe nexus extended from feng et al 2016 in section 4 we compare the performance of the three control strategies reveal the behavior of different agents and the manager and explore the possibility of shifting any bottlenecks under the three control strategies finally the main conclusions from this study are summarized in section 5 2 methods in this study the centralized decentralized and hybrid control models for the wpe nexus are established within a common smpc framework fig 1 the framework consists of three main parts 1 stochastic model based prediction 2 stochastic optimization and 3 receding horizon as shown in fig 1 at a particular time t the system states of the wpe nexus in the near future can be predicted with possible future inputs and control actions during a certain time period i e the so called forecast horizon q f the stochasticity of the system states is accounted for by an ensemble of trajectories the prediction of the wpe nexus depends on site or region specific stochastic dynamical systems which depict how different subsystems co evolve herein we focus on the wpe nexus in the hehuang region of china details of the stochastic dynamical systems are described in section 3 once the ensemble based predictions have been provided optimal control actions within the time period of the so called control horizon q d q d can equal q f but this is not necessary are determined by optimization models that account for both current and predicted information at each time step a sequence of optimal control actions can be obtained but only the optimal control in the first step is implemented the overall horizon is stepped forward during the procedure which is called the receding horizon the objectives and constraints for centralized decentralized and hybrid control models are now formulated for a generic wpe nexus as decentralized and hybrid control models are embedded within the framework of agent based models the concept of an agent is used to describe a subsystem or group of subsystems that has the ability to decide control actions that is the holistic wpe nexus is divided into a number of agents each of which is capable of controlling one or more subsystems and each agent can make its decision to optimize the objective of this single agent the main differences among centralized decentralized and hybrid optimization models are illustrated in fig 2 in centralized control there is a central coordinator manager that collects information from and sends instructions to different agents in decentralized control multiple agents collect local information and make decisions for their own purposes or objectives in hybrid control the agents optimize their own decisions with the local objectives and are regulated by the central coordinator who optimizes the global objective 2 1 centralized control model the centralized control model follows a top down principle and optimizes the control actions of all agents simultaneously the objective of this model is to minimize the risk and control the cost of a holistic nexus at time point t the objective function of the centralized control model can be represented as follows 1 min u t u t i k j t h u t α h p t k h u t f t k h u t i 1 2 n k 1 2 q d where j t h u t is the global objective of the holistic nexus at time t and u t u t i k i 1 2 n k 1 2 q d is the matrix of control actions of n agents at all time points within the control horizon q d specifically the i th row of u t represents the control actions of the i th agent at different time points while the k th column of u t represents the control actions of all agents at the k th time point p t k h u t is the probability or risk of the failure of the holistic nexus at time t k and f t k h u t is the control cost of the overall nexus within the time period t k 1 the weight α h applied to the system risk represents the decision preference of the manager for risk aversion compared with the cost reduction and is thus called the risk aversion coefficient considering that the probability and control cost have different dimensions these two terms are first normalized to be dimensionless values and then summed to form a weighted objective this weighted objective quantifies the comprehensive performance risks and control costs of the holistic nexus given the matrix of control actions u t the operator returns the expectation over the forecast decision horizon the detailed expression of the system risk and control cost can be formulated as follows 2 p t k h u t p i s i z i r t k 1 p i s i z i r t k 1 z r s max p s t k ds 1 z 1 r s 1 max z n r s n max p s 1 s 2 s n t k d s 1 d s n 3 f t k h u t i 1 n u t i k 2 where the function p returns the probability of the argument s i is the state variable of the i th agent and s i max is the corresponding maximum z r is a threshold vector consisting of state variables below which the agent will fail to function as normal p s t k and p s 1 s 2 s n t k are the joint probabilistic density functions pdfs of all states at time t k eq 2 indicates that the risk of the holistic nexus is quantified as the probability of any one agent s state variable falling below its threshold as indicated by eq 3 we assume a quadratic cost function at time t k for the control actions of all agents clemmens and schuurmans 2004 zheng et al 2019 furthermore the expectations of the holistic risk and control cost over the forecast control horizon can be quantified as follows 4 p t k h u t 1 q f k 1 q f p t k h u t 5 f t k h u t 1 q f k 1 q f f t k h u t where q f is the forecast horizon which is set to the decision horizon q d in our analysis while minimizing the system risk and control cost as defined above the centralized optimization model should simultaneously ensure that the risk of each agent falls below a prescribed acceptable level this is formulated by the following constraints 6 p i t k l u t s i min z i r p s i t k ds i r i 1 2 n k 1 2 q d where p s i t k is the marginal pdf with respective to state s i and p i t k l u t specifies the probability or risk of failure of the i th agent note that eq 6 provides n q d constraints 2 2 decentralized control model in contrast to centralized control the decentralized control model follows a bottom up principle and optimizes the control actions of a particular agent from locally available information the objective of agent i is to minimize its own risk and control cost which can be formulated as follows 7 min u i u j v i j t i l u t i u t j v i α i l p i t k l u t i u t j v i f i t k l u t i u t j v i where j t i l is the objective function of the i th agent at time t u t i i 1 2 n is the vector of the i th agent s control actions at time t i e u t i u t i k k 1 2 q d v i is the subset of agents that are directly connected with the i th agent thus j t i l u t i u t j v i represents the i th agent s objective with its decision vector u t i given the other agents decisions u t j v i the weight α i l represents the risk aversion of the i th agent i e the decision preference of the i th agent for risk aversion compared with the cost reduction p i t k l u t i u t j v i and f i t k l u t i u t j v i are the i th agent s risk at time t k and control cost during time period t k 1 respectively with its decision vector u t i given the other agents decisions u t j v i similar to centralized control these two terms are first normalized to be dimensionless values and then summed to form a weighted objective as in eq 7 essentially this weighted objective quantifies the comprehensive performance agent s risk and control cost of the i th agent at time t given the control actions u t i and u t j v i the i th agent s risk and control cost can be formulated as follows 8 p i t k l u t i u t j v i s i min z i r p s i t k ds i 9 f i t k l u t i u t j v i u t i k 2 where p s i t k is the marginal pdf with respective to state variable s i at time t k and u t i k is the control action of the i th agent at time t k eq 8 indicates that the risk of the i th agent given decision vectors u t i and u t j v i can be quantified by the probability of state variable s i falling below its safety boundary eq 9 indicates that the control cost of the i th agent during time interval t k 1 is a quadratic function of its control action the expectations of the i th agent s risk and control cost over the forecast control horizon can be quantified as follows 10 p i t k l u t i u t j v i 1 q f k 1 q f p i t k l u t i u t j v i 11 f i t k l u t i u t j v i 1 q f k 1 q f f i t k l u t i u t j v i while minimizing the above two terms the decentralized control model of agent i should simultaneously ensure that the risks of the other agents fall below the acceptable level which can be formulated as the following constraints 12 p j t k l u t i u t j v i s j min z j r p s j t k ds j r j 1 2 n j i k 1 2 q d where p s j t k is the marginal pdf with respect to state s j at time t k p j t k l u t i u t j v i is the risk of the failure of agent j given the decisions of the other agents note that eq 12 specifies n 1 q d constraints 2 3 hybrid control model the hybrid control model consists of two optimization layers 1 the lower or agent layer represents the behaviors of individual agents and optimizes the control of different agents iteratively based on local and limited information exchange this is consistent with the philosophy of decentralized control and thus follows the same mathematical formulation as specified in section 2 2 2 the upper or manager layer represents the behaviors of the manager and optimizes the risk aversion coefficients of all involved agents α i l such that the risk of the holistic nexus can be controlled this manager layer is fundamentally different from both the centralized and decentralized optimization models and is described as follows the manager is expected to optimize the risk aversion coefficients α i l and the optimal risk aversion coefficients remain unchanged for a prescribed time length specifically the decision horizon is divided into several stages within each of which the risk aversion coefficients remain constant the objective of the manager is to minimize the risk of the holistic nexus and the control costs the problem is formulated as follows 13 min α τ j u τ h α τ l α u h p τ k h α τ l g u h α τ l α τ 1 l where j u τ h α τ l is the objective of the manager in stage τ τ 1 2 τ where t is the total number of the stages during the control horizon and α τ l is the vector of risk aversion coefficients of all agents in stage τ i e α τ l α i τ l i 1 2 n where α i τ l is the risk aversion coefficient of agent i in stage τ α u h is the risk aversion coefficient of the manager which indicates the manager s preference for controlling the risk compared with the cost p τ k h α τ l is the risk of the holistic nexus in stage τ given the vector α τ l and g u h is the cost function of the manager for adjusting the risk aversion coefficients of different agents the risk of the holistic nexus and the control cost are first converted into dimensionless values and then summed to form the weighted objective function in eq 13 this weighted objective essentially quantifies the comprehensive performance risk and control cost of the manager given the manager s control effort α τ l α τ 1 l here the operator computes the difference between the vectors of risk aversion coefficients in two consecutive stages i e α τ l and α τ 1 l in the hybrid control model the decision processes are divided into several consecutive stages and the manager and agent layers of the model are implemented iteratively such that both the decisions and risk aversion coefficients of all agents can be optimized the stage wise decision process is as follows 1 at the beginning of a specific stage the manager s model is implemented to optimize the risk aversion coefficients of all agents 2 within each stage the risk aversion coefficients are set to the optimal values obtained in step 1 and then the agents models are implemented to optimize the control actions 3 steps 1 and 2 are iterated until the decision process ends 2 4 penalty functions the constraints in the three models increase the difficulty of finding optimal solutions but the optimization procedure can be simplified greatly by using penalty function methods feng et al 2017 yang et al 2009 in the case of centralized control the penalty function at time t denoted as f t h u t quantifies how far the agents risks are from the acceptable level and is thus termed the constraint violation extent or simply constraint violation based on eq 6 the detailed formula of this penalty function can be established as follows 14 f t h u t i k max s i min z i r p s i t k ds i r 0 2 thus the objective function for centralized control i e eq 1 can be modified as follows 15 min u t u t i k j t h u t α h p t k h u t f t k h u t β h f t h u t where α h is the global risk aversion coefficient reflecting the manager s attitude toward risk aversion versus cost reduction and β h is the global penalty coefficient reflecting the manager s attitude toward mitigating the risks of individual agents in the case of decentralized control the penalty function of agent i at time t denoted as f i t l u i u j v i quantifies how far the risk of all agents except agent i is from the acceptable level based on eq 12 this penalty function is established as follows 16 f i t l u i u j v i j k max s j min z j r p s j t k ds j r 0 2 j i thus the objective function for decentralized control i e eq 7 can be modified as follows 17 min u i j i t l u t i u t j v i α i l p i t k l u t i u t j v i f i t k l u t i u t j v i β i l f i t l u t i u t j v i where α i l is the risk aversion coefficient of agent i reflecting the i th agent s preference for risk aversion over cost reduction and β i l is the penalty coefficient of agent i reflecting the i th agent s preference for sacrificing other agents security to reduce its own risk called the i th agent s selfishness coefficient in the case of hybrid control the penalty functions of the manager and agent layers follow eqs 14 and 16 respectively because the corresponding constraints are the same as those in the centralized and decentralized models respectively by considering the penalty function the modified objective function of the agent layer is the same as that of the decentralized model i e eq 17 whereas the modified objective of the manager layer is slightly different from that of the centralized model and can be formulated as follows 18 min α τ j u τ h α τ l α u h p τ k h α τ l g u h α τ l α τ 1 l β u h f τ h α τ l where α τ l is the risk aversion vector consisting of all agents risk aversion coefficients in stage τ α u h and β u h are risk aversion and penalty coefficients respectively for the manager as shown in eqs 15 17 and 18 the objectives modified by penalty functions can be divided into three parts i e risk cost and constraint violation the extent of system risk away from its acceptable level the performance of the three control strategies depends on the risk aversion coefficients α including α h α i l and α u h and the selfishness coefficients β including β h β i l and β u h varying these coefficients could result in all pareto solutions for the three competing parts risk cost and constraint violation in the objectives when the risk aversion and selfishness coefficients are equal the decision maker i e manager or agents has equal preference for optimizing the risk control cost and constraint violation considering that the normalized dimensionless values of the system risk control cost and constraint violation are comparable these coefficients are set to 1 in this study i e risk aversion coefficient selfishness coefficient 1 if the risk aversion coefficient is greater than the selfishness coefficient and both are greater than 1 the decision maker has a preference for controlling the system risk if the selfishness coefficient is greater than the risk aversion coefficient and both are greater than 1 the decision maker has a preference for constraint violation if the risk aversion and selfishness coefficients are less than 1 the decision maker has a preference for reducing the control cost analyzing the effects of the risk aversion and selfishness coefficients allows us to investigate the roles of the agents and manager in the optimization models 3 case study the hehuang region of qinghai province china fig 3 is selected for a case study because it plays a key role in the social and economic development of qinghai province this region covers only 21 of the area of qinghai province 15 2 72 1 104 km2 but provides water power and other basic living conditions for 60 of the province s total population following the work of feng et al 2016 the wpe systems in hehuang are increasingly interconnected such that they can be considered as a wpe nexus the activities of this wpe nexus can be represented as six subsystems 1 hydrology 2 water supply 3 power generation 4 population 5 biology and 6 environment the state variables of these six subsystems can be represented by water storage s w water use per capita s u power use per capita s g population s n biomass s b and environmental awareness s e respectively in addition to these six state variables another five assistant variables are introduced to describe the socio economic states of wpe systems wealth m w living conditions l technology t pollution c and power deficit g d compared with the work of feng et al 2016 we incorporate five decision variables into the wpe nexus such that the control actions can be optimized within the smpc framework details presented in supplementary information s1 based on these human control decisions the wpe nexus is divided into five controllable agents 1 water agent w whose control variable is the ratio of water supply to water demand u w 2 biology agent b whose control variable is the biological harvest rate u b 3 environment agent c whose control variable is the wealth invested to deal with pollution u c 4 energy agent g whose control variable is the scale of photovoltaic pv power plants compared to current power plants u g and 5 society agent l whose control variable is the population growth rate u l note that this study assumes that the population growth rate can be manipulated by national policies the agents control variables symbols and their optimal values are summarized in table 1 with these five agents the concepts of centralized decentralized and hybrid control in the hehuang region are compared in fig 4 moreover the random variable ξ k k w u g n b e is introduced to account for the uncertainty of the k th state and ϕ i k i k w u g n b e is the response function of the i th system state to the k th random variable these uncertainties can be classified into two types 1 the variability of natural processes such as inflow precipitation and biomass growth 2 the uncertainties of human activities which reflect the diverse responses from individuals of different ages genders incomes and education backgrounds such as the uncertainties embedded in the per capita uses of power and water and environmental awareness the above natural processes and human activities are all affected by numerous factors so the associated uncertainties can be assumed to follow a gaussian distribution according to the central limit theorem bierkens 1998 leduc et al 1986 the uncertainty of water storage comes from the regional inflow and precipitation which are highly correlated and thus the intensity of ξ w is assumed to be proportional to the mean value of inflow i e ξ i n 0 cv i i 2 the other uncertainties originate from system characteristics and so the intensity ξ k k u g n b e is assumed to be proportional to the system state i e ξ k n 0 cv k s k 2 to reduce the model complexity the matrix of response functions is set as a diagonal matrix i e φ diag 1 1 1 1 1 1 this assumes that a particular system state can only have direct response from its own stochasticity and respond to other stochasticities through interconnections by incorporating the control actions of five agents and the stochasticities of system states the original dynamics of the wpe nexus considered by feng et al 2016 are extended to a stochastic dynamical system details in supplementary information s1 the interconnections of the associated variables state variables assistant variables and control variables can be described in terms of positive and negative feedback as shown in fig 5 the mathematical representation of this new version of the wpe nexus is represented as follows 19 d s w dt i p e u w s u s n f γ s g s n o k ϕ w k ξ

respectively b is the growth rate of biomass which depends on water storage and contamination c is the contaminant level and g d is the power deficit together these functions intrinsically determine the coevolution of system states and are thus referred to as the constitutive relationships detailed formulas can be found in tables 2 and 3 of feng et al 2016 specifically the technology t and power deficit g d can be formulated as follows 20 t 10 1 e 3 10 4 u c m w g d 1 γ gn min 1 u g ψ o 1 γ gn where u c is the fraction of wealth decision variable used for developing technology and u c m w is the resultant absolute wealth for technology development u g is the matched pv power capacity specified as the fraction of hydropower capacity decision variable ψ o is the actual hydropower generation and 1 u g ψ o is the total power generation i e the sum of hydropower and solar power based on the assumption that solar power generation is proportional to hydropower generation with the proportion specified as u g the implementation procedures of centralized decentralized and hybrid control strategies for the wpe nexus is described in supplementary information s2 and the details for the parametrization for the three control strategies are explained as follows within the smpc framework the control actions for the wpe nexus in the hehuang region are optimized for a 30 year period the forecast horizon is set as ten periods years based on our empirical experiences that the realistic regional short term planning is usually conducted for a ten year period the sensitivity of the optimal performances of centralized decentralized and hybrid control models to the forecast horizon has been conducted in supplementary information s3 and it is shown that the main conclusions remain the same for different levels of forecast horizon the forecast and control horizons are set to be equal i e all decisions in the forecast horizon should be optimized by centralized decentralized and hybrid control models for the hybrid model the manager is expected to change the risk aversion coefficients of the agents every five years i e the whole 30 year period is divided into six stages the common parameters involved in the centralized decentralized and hybrid control models are summarized in table 2 the acceptable risk is determined by negotiation between the manager and the agents while the thresholds for the key variables of different agents are identified by the procedures stated in appendix a the choice of the risk aversion and selfishness coefficients weights applied to risk and constraint violation respectively for the three control models is summarized in table 3 the uncertainty of these coefficients is assessed in section 4 2 which also reflects the roles of the agents and manager in the control strategies 4 results 4 1 comparison of tradeoffs of three control strategies in this section we compare the tradeoffs across system risk control cost and constraint violation for all five agents under centralized decentralized and hybrid strategies figs 6 and 7 these tradeoffs are obtained by varying the risk aversion coefficients fig 6 and selfishness coefficients fig 7 although the tradeoffs or pareto fronts across system risk control cost and constraint violation would shift with acceptable risk all agents could be classified into selfish and generous categories and the classification of these agents is insensitive to the acceptable risk supplementary information s4 moreover the other involved analysis is also insensitive to the choice of acceptable risk and thus the following analysis is conducted with the acceptable level at 25 as shown in fig 6 according to the risk the agents can be classified into two categories 1 selfish agents i e biology b and society l agents whose risks are far below the acceptable risk 25 and 2 generous agents i e water w environment c and energy g agents whose risks are above and can be quite close to the acceptable risk as defined in eqs 14 and 16 the concept of constraint violation quantifies the distance between the actual risk and acceptable risk under all three control strategies the selfish agents have constraint violations very close to zero in contrast with the generous agents whose constraint violations are quite high this implies that all three control strategies are more likely to sacrifice the safety of generous agents and reduce the risks of selfish agents i e the safety of generous agents is sacrificed with priority hence the term generous while the safety of selfish agents is protected with priority hence selfish for generous agents the hybrid control drives the local agent s risk from inferior far above the acceptable risk to superior close to the acceptable risk for the energy g agent the centralized control has the lowest risk but the highest cost while the decentralized control has the highest risk but the lowest cost in the case of hybrid control the risk is close to that of centralized control while the cost is close to that of decentralized control this implies that hybrid control can significantly decrease the risk without notably increasing the control cost for the environment c agent the control costs of all three strategies are approximately the same while the risk of hybrid control is between that of the centralized and decentralized strategies this implies that hybrid control drives the system risk from a high level close to that of centralized control to a low level close to that of decentralized control such that it becomes closer to the acceptable level for the water w agent centralized control has the highest risk and the highest control cost whereas hybrid control has the lowest risk and the lowest control cost decentralized control has a medium level of risk and its cost is close to that of hybrid control this implies that hybrid control can reach a low risk at a relatively low cost overall the hybrid control strategy always reduces the system risk of generous agents obtained from a worse strategy either centralized or decentralized to a level close to the acceptable risk without significantly increasing the control cost or constraint violation more importantly hybrid control seems to improve the performance of generous agents by slightly degenerating the performance of selfish agents specifically hybrid control reduces the risks of generous agents still above the acceptable risk at the expense of increasing the risks of selfish agents still below the acceptable risk for the biology b agent hybrid control has the highest risk while the risks of centralized and decentralized control are approximately the same the control costs of all three control strategies are similar for the society l agent hybrid control has the highest risk while the control costs of all three control strategies are similar despite hybrid control producing the highest risks for both the biology b and society l agents their risks remain below the acceptable level therefore the hybrid control model balances the risks between generous and selfish agents by sacrificing some of the safety of selfish agents to reduce the risks of generous agents following the above analysis the properties of optimal control for interconnected systems with the engagement of multiple agents can be summarized as follows 1 the hybrid control model balances the risks across multiple agents and is thus most applicable to real scenarios in particular hybrid control sacrifices some of the security of selfish agents to reduce the risks of generous agents such that the risks of generous agents decrease significantly and become close to the acceptable level while the risks of selfish agents increase slightly but remain below the acceptable level 2 the conventional tradeoff relationship between two conflicting objectives of a single agent can be violated in interconnected systems taking the water w agent as an example centralized control results in the highest risk and the highest control cost with similar constraint violations to the other two control strategies this contrasts with our knowledge of conventional optimization practices which states that the system risk will decrease as the control cost increases this violation of the conventional tradeoff relationship can be interpreted as a complex hedging process across the system risks control costs and constraint violations of multiple agents 4 2 roles of agents and manager the hybrid control model is considered more suitable for realistic cases than the centralized and decentralized models thus we now investigate how the agents and manager work and function in the hybrid control model specifically the manager s role can be quantified by the changes in the risk aversion coefficients in two consecutive stages fig 8 fig 8a and b show the changes in risk aversion coefficients under different levels of initial risk aversion and selfishness respectively as shown in fig 8a a the risk aversion coefficient increases for the environment agent c but decreases significantly for the other agents this implies that to achieve a better control effect the manager expects the environment agent to increase its preference for risk aversion and the other agents to decrease their preference for risk aversion the changes in the risk aversion coefficients shown in fig 8 can be interpreted as follows in most panels of fig 8a except fig 8a b and 8a c the risk aversion coefficients of selfish agents b and l decreases while the risk aversion coefficients of generous agents w g and c may either increase or decrease this implies that in most scenarios the manager expects selfish agents to relax their control on the system risk and reduce their control cost such that the other agents have more space to reduce their risk moreover the manager expects some generous agents to increase their risk aversion coefficients such that their security is sacrificed to a higher extent to protect the other agents security therefore the manager plays a crucial role in hedging the risks between selfish and generous agents such hedging of risks can also be observed within between selfish agents fig 8a b and 8a c i e the risk aversion coefficient of the biology b agent decreases while that of the society l agent increases however in fig 8b the changes in risk aversion coefficients are not consistent across agents of the same type selfish or generous i e for selfish or generous agents the coefficient can either increase or decrease this implies that the hedging of risks within either selfish or generous agents is more popular than the hedging of risks between selfish and generous agents as the selfishness coefficient varies therefore the manager plays a critical role in adjusting the decision preferences relating to system risks control costs and constraint violations such that the risks of selfish and generous agents can be hedged or balanced moreover multiple combinations of risk aversion and selfishness coefficients could result in almost the same control effect i e the role of the manager is complicated by the equifinality of decision preferences in optimization problems with multiple objectives and multiple agents by varying the risk aversion and selfishness coefficients artificially the role of generous and selfish agents in the decentralized optimization strategy can be verified three scenarios for decision preferences risk aversion and selfishness coefficients are designed in table 4 1 high preference scenario h1 h4 to investigate how high risk aversion or selfishness coefficients affect the control effects 2 low preference scenario l1 l4 to investigate how low levels of the risk aversion or selfishness coefficient affect the control effects 3 combined preference scenario c1 c4 to investigate how different combinations of high and low levels of the risk aversion and selfishness coefficients affect the control effects corresponding to the scenario settings in table 4 the risks control costs and constraint violations for the five agents are compared in fig 9 specifically a high level of decision preference either risk aversion or selfishness coefficient affects the risks costs and constraint violations significantly for the energy and environment agents but has limited effects on the other agents fig 9a however a low and or combined decision preference could have relatively large effects on the water energy and environment agents generous agents but minor effects on the other agents fig 9b and c thus varying the decision preferences effectively changes the system risks of generous agents especially the energy agent but has a minor effect on selfish agents moreover the impacts of varying the selfishness coefficient β i l are much greater than when the risk aversion coefficient α i l is varied compared with the system risks the control costs of different agents are more sensitive to changes in the decision preferences thus the control cost responses to different decision preference scenarios are summarized in table 5 fig 9 and table 5 indicate that alterations in the decision preferences will obviously change the control costs of the society and environment agents selfish agents but have smaller effects on the control costs of the water energy and environment agents generous agents in summary changes in the decision preferences are more effective in modifying the risks of generous agents and the control costs of selfish agents this implies that generous and selfish agents play different roles in the case of decentralized control i e to achieve the nash optimal solution generous agents are more likely to change their risks while selfish agents are more likely to change their control costs 4 3 bottleneck shift under the three control strategies this section explores the existence of bottlenecks and the possibility of shifting these bottlenecks under the three control strategies which may provide a deeper understanding of the optimal control of interconnected systems first a bottleneck is defined as the subsystem or agent that makes the largest contribution to the overall risk i e the risk contribution ratio χ i i w b c g and l see details in appendix b the changes in the risk contribution ratio of the different agents under the three control strategies are compared in fig 10 two main observations can be summarized as follows 1 the evolving trajectories of the risk contribution ratios are relatively smooth in the case of centralized control but have large oscillations under decentralized and hybrid control in the decentralized control model the oscillations in the risk contribution ratios can be interpreted as the bargaining process before all agents reach their nash optimal solutions this bargaining process is reflected by iterative applications of the local optimization algorithm for different agents specifically in each round of bargaining a particular agent corrects its decisions from the previous bargaining process irrespective of the other agents risks and costs and the corrections cause large oscillations in the system states and risk contribution ratios in the centralized control strategy the optimal decisions obtained from a global optimization model with a single objective result in relatively smooth trajectories of system states such that the oscillations in the risk contribution ratios are effectively improved in the hybrid control model the oscillations are improved to some extent because this strategy combines the advantages of centralized and decentralized control 2 although the evolution of the highest and lowest risk contribution ratios varies with the different control strategies the bottleneck seldom changes the roles of the agents in shifting the bottleneck can be identified by comparing the risk contribution ratios from centralized and decentralized control whereas the role of the manager can be identified by comparing the risk contribution ratios from decentralized and hybrid control as shown in fig 10 compared with centralized control the decentralized strategy increases the risk contribution of the energy g agent but decreases the risk contributions of the environment c and biology b agents compared with decentralized control the hybrid control model decreases the risk contribution of the energy e agent but increases the risk contributions of the biology b agent thus fig 10 shows that the agents and manager play almost contrasting roles in affecting the potential to shift the bottleneck the bargaining process across agents is more likely to protect the environment and biology agents whereas the manager s decision is more likely to sacrifice the safety of the environment and biology agents while protecting the energy agent although the bargaining process across agents and the optimal decisions of the manager can change the trajectories of the risk contribution ratios the bottleneck and its shifts appear to have only minor differences in the three control strategies in the centralized and decentralized control models the bottleneck shifts from the water w to the energy g agent in the case of hybrid control the bottleneck shifts from the water w to the energy g agent and then on to the environment c agent this can be explained by the decentralized and hybrid models having greater effects on agents with the largest and lowest risk contribution ratios but little effect on the other agents 5 conclusion this study has examined the performance of centralized decentralized and hybrid control strategies within the smpc framework for the wpe nexus by extending the wpe nexus developed by feng et al 2016 into controllable stochastic dynamical systems the three control models were implemented and compared in a case study of the hehuang region of china by comparing the tradeoffs among five agents across system risks control costs and constraint violations the hybrid control model was identified as the most suitable of the three control strategies for realistic cases scenario analysis verified the roles of different agents and the regional manager and the impacts of the three control strategies on shifting bottlenecks in the wpe system were analyzed the main conclusions from this study can be summarized as follows 1 the agents in hehuang could be grouped into two categories a selfish agents including biology and society agents and b generous agents including water energy and environment agents the selfish agents were more likely to satisfy their own safety requirements by sacrificing the safety of other agents such that their own system risks were always below the acceptable level the generous agents were more likely to sacrifice their own safety to satisfy the safety requirements of other agents such that their system risks were always above the acceptable level 2 hybrid control was found to be the most suitable control strategy for realistic cases because it combines the advantages of centralized and decentralized control and improves the performance of generous agents at the expense of selfish agents for generous agents hybrid control can always decrease the risks from a worse strategy centralized or decentralized control without significantly increasing the control costs and constraint violations for selfish agents despite hybrid control having comparable control costs to centralized and decentralized control it achieves the highest risks that are still below the acceptable level 3 adopting different control strategies has a somewhat limited effect on the process of shifting bottlenecks because decentralized and hybrid control only have significant impacts on the trajectories of the risk contribution ratios with the highest environment and biology and lowest energy values specifically in the decentralized control model the bargaining process across agents is more likely to protect the environment and biology agents by sacrificing the safety of energy agents in centralized control the global optimal decision is more likely to protect the energy agent by sacrificing the safety of environment and biology agents the minor changes in the risk contribution ratios have limited impacts on shifting the bottleneck in this study the adaption of three control strategies especially decentralized and hybrid control to the wpe nexus has enabled us to develop more effective policies or rules to examine the tradeoff and synergy effects and prevent system failure in the field of nexus modelling and or interconnected systems moreover the comparison of three control strategies for the wpe nexus has provided useful suggestions for regional management first the various policies or management rules should be tailored for generous or selfish agents in realistic scenarios second a better allocation scheme for the multiple resources involved in the wpe nexus should be achieved through negotiation between the regional manager and the involved agents third identifying possible bottlenecks and its shifting process could help the manager to reduce the risk of large scale system failure overall examining the performance of three control strategies for the wpe nexus has helped to advance our understanding and practices of optimization and control for large scale interconnected systems credit authorship contribution statement maoyuan feng conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original

optimization model for deriving the thresholds of state variables in the centralized decentralized and hybrid control models the system risks are defined based on the thresholds of state variables below which the systems or agents are exposed to the risk of failure empirically determining these thresholds through existing knowledge or expertise may lead to large uncertainties to overcome this shortcoming we defined these thresholds of system states according to the quantiles of stationary probability density functions pdfs of state variables corresponding to prescribed acceptable risks moreover we developed an optimization model to derive the thresholds of system states with stationary pdfs obtained with optimal control actions that minimize accumulated uncertainties the detailed procedures of deriving the thresholds of state variables are as follows first the concept of the accumulation ratio ar is introduced to quantify the uncertainty accumulation within interconnected systems originally the concept of ar was defined in pharmacokinetics to quantify drug accumulation in the human body when a specific drug is applied in multiple doses greenblatt et al 1979 hu et al 2015 scheerans et al 2015 in pharmacokinetics the most widely used definition of ar is the ratio of average drug concentration at the final steady level to that during the first application scheerans et al 2015 analogously ar for uncertainty accumulation can be defined as the ratio of uncertainties in the system states at a particular time to the average uncertainties of interruptions introduced during a given time interval by quantifying uncertainty using the variances and covariances of state variables ar can be represented as follows a1 ar i var s i t var δ i a2 ar i j cov s i s j t cov δ i δ j where ar i quantifies the uncertainty accumulation in system i var s i t is the variance of state i at time t and var δ i is the average variance of the introduced interruptions on state i ar i j quantifies the accumulation in the likelihood of the coincidence of deviations in states i and j from their expectations cov s i s j t is the covariance of states i and j and cov δ i δ j is the average covariance of the introduced interruptions on states i and j next the control actions of the interconnected systems are optimized with the objective of minimizing the norm of the ar matrix the objective function of this optimization model can be established as follows a3 min u ω ar ar i j i j 1 2 n where u is the vector of control variables which are time invariant in this model ω ar is the norm of the ar matrix e g 1 2 or norm is the operator that computes the norm of a specific vector or matrix and ar i j i j 1 2 n is the n n matrix composed of ars next the stationary joint pdf of state variables p s s and the marginal pdf p s s i i 1 2 n are derived with the optimal control actions obtained in the previous step specifically the stationary pdfs are obtained by substituting the optimal control actions into the stochastic dynamical systems of the wpe nexus i e eq 19 and simulating the model until the steady condition is achieved finally the thresholds of state variables denoted by z i r i 1 2 n are derived with the stationary joint pdf p s s or marginal pdf p s s i using the prescribed acceptable risk r specifically the relationship between the thresholds of state variables z i r and acceptable risk r can be represented as follows a4 s i min z i r p s s i ds i r i 1 2 n where s i min is the minimum of state variable s i the acceptable risk r is usually determined through negotiation between the manager and multiple stakeholders according to their empirical experience appendix b definition of system bottleneck within the wpe nexus or other interconnected systems even a small input uncertainty may be transferred through various interconnections and accumulate to reach a large level eventually causing the failure of the overall system across all subsystems some specific subsystem is likely to accumulate uncertainty faster than the others such that this subsystem has a greater probability of triggering the system failure than other subsystems this particular subsystem makes the largest contribution to the holistic risk of system failure and can be defined as the bottleneck a concept borrowed from the field of supply chain networks mizgier et al 2013 wang et al 2005 denoting the failures of subsystem i and the holistic nexus as events a i and a respectively the contribution of the risk of subsystem i to that of the holistic nexus can be represented by the following risk contribution ratio b1 χ i p a a i p a i a p a where p quantifies the risk or probability of the event specified in parentheses specifically p a a i is the likelihood of the holistic nexus failing given the failure of subsystem i p a i a is the probability of the simultaneous failure of subsystem i and the holistic nexus and p a is the probability of the holistic nexus failing following these specifications the bottleneck of the holistic nexus can be identified as follows b2 j arg max i χ i i k χ k χ i k 1 2 n where arg max is the operator that returns the maximum of the argument in this case the subsystem with the largest risk contribution ratio χ i in this study the holistic nexus fails when the storage or output of any subsystem is below its target or threshold as determined by the optimization model described in appendix a this means that the failure of any subsystem could result in the failure of the holistic nexus i e a i is a subset of a denoted bya i a and p a a i p a i in this manner the risk contribution ratio defined in eq b1 can be further formulated as b3 χ i p a a i p a i p a assuming that the system safety requires the state variables to remain above the thresholds z r z i r i 1 2 n the holistic risk can be quantified as follows b4 p a p i s i z i r 1 prob i s i z i r 1 z r s max p s d s 1 z i r s 1 max z i r s n max p s 1 s 2 s n ds 1 ds n where is the logical operator that links all possible cases of system failure i e either state variable falls below its threshold while is the logical operator that links all the necessary conditions to maintain the safety of the wpe nexus i e each state variable should be above the threshold s max s i max i 1 2 n is the vector of the maxima where s i max is the maximum of system state i furthermore the risk of failure of a particular subsystem i p a i can be quantified as follows b5 p a i p s i z i r s i min s i max s i min z i r p s 1 s 2 s n ds 1 ds n where s i min is the minimum of system state i s i max and s i min are the maximum and minimum for all states except system i by incorporating eqs b4 and b5 into eq b3 the risk contribution ratios can be obtained and used to identify bottlenecks appendix c supplementary data supplementary data to this article can be found online at https doi org 10 1016 j jhydrol 2022 128609

2688,the propagation and accumulation of uncertainty within the water supply power generation and environment wpe nexus may induce unexpected failures effective control strategies are needed to reduce the failure risks optimal control of the wpe nexus is challenging because of the complex interconnections and the multiple stakeholders this study employs stochastic dynamical systems to simulate interconnected wpe systems and compares the performance of centralized decentralized and hybrid control strategies the wpe nexus within the hehuang region of china is selected as a case study the results show that all controllable agents are either selfish or generous protecting or sacrificing their own security respectively hybrid control is the most suitable strategy for realistic cases because it balances the risks of selfish and generous agents the manager s role is to balance or hedge the risks and costs across agents by adjusting their decision preferences this involves changing the risks of generous agents and the control costs of selfish agents the three control strategies have little impact on system bottlenecks despite obvious changes in the trajectories of the highest and lowest risk contribution ratios overall this study advances the understanding of different control strategies for the wpe nexus helping to mitigate the failure risk and improve the management of real systems keywords wpe nexus control strategies stochastic model predictive control risk aversion bottleneck shifts data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the water supply power generation and environment wpe nexus is increasingly interconnected within a basin or region cai et al 2018 yaeger et al 2014 forming a large scale interconnected system feng et al 2019 feng et al 2016 in an interconnected wpe nexus any small uncertainty or interruption e g droughts storms or power shortages from a given subsystem can propagate to other subsystems and the interruptions introduced at different times could accumulate to induce a failure in a particular subsystem ghadge et al 2011 peters et al 2009 tang et al 2016 this emergent failure status can be transferred across subsystems so that a minor local failure may induce system wide cascade failures webber 2015 these unexpected or unintended failures caused by the propagation and accumulation of uncertainties through interconnections increase the difficulty of managing the wpe nexus moreover management is challenged by the engagement of multiple stakeholders and decision makers which have their own goals and strive to pursue contradictory benefits waslander et al 2004 this drives the system management to change from a conventional top down pattern to a bottom up one yang et al 2009 therefore there is an urgent need to develop effective control strategies for policy making within the wpe nexus with the purpose of risk aversion and damage mitigation control algorithms are widely applied in large scale interconnected systems including water resources systems yang et al 2009 you and yu 2013 irrigation canal systems schutter et al 2009 zheng et al 2019 power networks schreck 2016 sekine 1963 shukla and mili 2017 and supply chain networks sahin et al 2013 generally these control strategies algorithms can be classified as either feedback or feedforward algorithms heirung et al 2018 mesbah 2016 zheng et al 2019 feedback control e g classical proportional integral control isapoor et al 2011 and centralized linear quadratic control balogun et al 1988 are designed to correct the deviations between actual and predefined reference values targets such that the system states eventually reach the expected targets however the deviations are always corrected after their appearance i e there are time delays between the deviations and the corrections clemmens and schuurmans 2004 lozano et al 2010 thus feedback algorithms cannot prevent failures from occurring in an unexpected or unintended manner liu et al 2007 vasilakopoulos and marshall 2015 feedforward control also called model predictive control mpc should overcome this problem because the control actions are implemented in advance by taking the predicted future system states into account schreck 2016 zheng et al 2019 in mpc cases the future system states are usually predicted by deterministic models however such models would fail to capture the characteristics of the uncertainty propagation and accumulation within the wpe nexus this problem can be solved by extending deterministic mpcs to stochastic mpcs smpcs where the future states are predicted in a stochastic or probabilistic way heirung et al 2018 mesbah 2016 within the smpc framework interconnected systems are generally optimized through a system of systems concept housh et al 2015 yaeger et al 2014 where a centralized approach is used to find the global or system wide optimal solution it is assumed that there exists a central executor that collects information from and sends orders to all subsystems feng et al 2019 housh et al 2015 it is also assumed that the economic efficiency is perfect across all subsystems yaeger et al 2014 yang et al 2009 however these assumptions are violated in realistic cases especially when multiple stakeholders are engaged in the decision making process inalhan et al 2002 sekine 1963 this leads to a decentralized approach where each subsystem or agent optimizes its own decisions based on local system dynamics and limited information exchange based on the decomposition of a large scale interconnected system sekine 1963 developed a decentralized optimization algorithm that exchanges information between the center and subsystems or components after decomposition yang et al 2009 applied a penalty based decentralized optimization algorithm to multiagent system based watershed management and proposed a bargaining procedure that achieves the nash optimal solution however these methods ignore the dynamical variations of the interconnected system focusing only on static equilibrium states thus the present study focuses on the simulation of the wpe nexus and its optimal control in a dynamical scheme furthermore this study examines whether centralized decentralized or hybrid control within the smpc framework is effective in controlling interconnected systems such as the wpe nexus feng et al 2019 additionally the roles of the coordinator manager and local subsystems in mitigating possible failures are investigated and any subsystem that plays a critical role in the failure of the overall system a so called bottleneck is identified overall the goal is to examine the performance of various smpc strategies in mitigating risks within the wpe nexus first the wpe nexus considered by feng et al 2016 is extended to a stochastic scheme stochastic dynamical system similar to that of an et al 2021 to capture both the interconnections and multiple source uncertainties next within the smpc framework the centralized and decentralized control models are formulated to minimize the risks of system failure and the control costs at global and local scales respectively hybrid control is established by combining the structures of centralized and decentralized control i e the lower layer aims to optimize the subsystem behavior using local information while the upper layer aims to optimize the manager behavior i e attitudes of subsystems such that the global objective can be improved the relevant constraints are formulated in a probabilistic way and incorporated into the optimization process through penalty based reasoning following yang et al 2009 and inalhan et al 2002 unlike yang et al 2009 and inalhan et al 2002 however the decentralized control strategy is implemented in a dynamic scheme the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we formulate the centralized decentralized and hybrid control models within the smpc framework in section 3 we describe a case study of the hehuang region in china and introduce the stochastic scheme for the wpe nexus extended from feng et al 2016 in section 4 we compare the performance of the three control strategies reveal the behavior of different agents and the manager and explore the possibility of shifting any bottlenecks under the three control strategies finally the main conclusions from this study are summarized in section 5 2 methods in this study the centralized decentralized and hybrid control models for the wpe nexus are established within a common smpc framework fig 1 the framework consists of three main parts 1 stochastic model based prediction 2 stochastic optimization and 3 receding horizon as shown in fig 1 at a particular time t the system states of the wpe nexus in the near future can be predicted with possible future inputs and control actions during a certain time period i e the so called forecast horizon q f the stochasticity of the system states is accounted for by an ensemble of trajectories the prediction of the wpe nexus depends on site or region specific stochastic dynamical systems which depict how different subsystems co evolve herein we focus on the wpe nexus in the hehuang region of china details of the stochastic dynamical systems are described in section 3 once the ensemble based predictions have been provided optimal control actions within the time period of the so called control horizon q d q d can equal q f but this is not necessary are determined by optimization models that account for both current and predicted information at each time step a sequence of optimal control actions can be obtained but only the optimal control in the first step is implemented the overall horizon is stepped forward during the procedure which is called the receding horizon the objectives and constraints for centralized decentralized and hybrid control models are now formulated for a generic wpe nexus as decentralized and hybrid control models are embedded within the framework of agent based models the concept of an agent is used to describe a subsystem or group of subsystems that has the ability to decide control actions that is the holistic wpe nexus is divided into a number of agents each of which is capable of controlling one or more subsystems and each agent can make its decision to optimize the objective of this single agent the main differences among centralized decentralized and hybrid optimization models are illustrated in fig 2 in centralized control there is a central coordinator manager that collects information from and sends instructions to different agents in decentralized control multiple agents collect local information and make decisions for their own purposes or objectives in hybrid control the agents optimize their own decisions with the local objectives and are regulated by the central coordinator who optimizes the global objective 2 1 centralized control model the centralized control model follows a top down principle and optimizes the control actions of all agents simultaneously the objective of this model is to minimize the risk and control the cost of a holistic nexus at time point t the objective function of the centralized control model can be represented as follows 1 min u t u t i k j t h u t α h p t k h u t f t k h u t i 1 2 n k 1 2 q d where j t h u t is the global objective of the holistic nexus at time t and u t u t i k i 1 2 n k 1 2 q d is the matrix of control actions of n agents at all time points within the control horizon q d specifically the i th row of u t represents the control actions of the i th agent at different time points while the k th column of u t represents the control actions of all agents at the k th time point p t k h u t is the probability or risk of the failure of the holistic nexus at time t k and f t k h u t is the control cost of the overall nexus within the time period t k 1 the weight α h applied to the system risk represents the decision preference of the manager for risk aversion compared with the cost reduction and is thus called the risk aversion coefficient considering that the probability and control cost have different dimensions these two terms are first normalized to be dimensionless values and then summed to form a weighted objective this weighted objective quantifies the comprehensive performance risks and control costs of the holistic nexus given the matrix of control actions u t the operator returns the expectation over the forecast decision horizon the detailed expression of the system risk and control cost can be formulated as follows 2 p t k h u t p i s i z i r t k 1 p i s i z i r t k 1 z r s max p s t k ds 1 z 1 r s 1 max z n r s n max p s 1 s 2 s n t k d s 1 d s n 3 f t k h u t i 1 n u t i k 2 where the function p returns the probability of the argument s i is the state variable of the i th agent and s i max is the corresponding maximum z r is a threshold vector consisting of state variables below which the agent will fail to function as normal p s t k and p s 1 s 2 s n t k are the joint probabilistic density functions pdfs of all states at time t k eq 2 indicates that the risk of the holistic nexus is quantified as the probability of any one agent s state variable falling below its threshold as indicated by eq 3 we assume a quadratic cost function at time t k for the control actions of all agents clemmens and schuurmans 2004 zheng et al 2019 furthermore the expectations of the holistic risk and control cost over the forecast control horizon can be quantified as follows 4 p t k h u t 1 q f k 1 q f p t k h u t 5 f t k h u t 1 q f k 1 q f f t k h u t where q f is the forecast horizon which is set to the decision horizon q d in our analysis while minimizing the system risk and control cost as defined above the centralized optimization model should simultaneously ensure that the risk of each agent falls below a prescribed acceptable level this is formulated by the following constraints 6 p i t k l u t s i min z i r p s i t k ds i r i 1 2 n k 1 2 q d where p s i t k is the marginal pdf with respective to state s i and p i t k l u t specifies the probability or risk of failure of the i th agent note that eq 6 provides n q d constraints 2 2 decentralized control model in contrast to centralized control the decentralized control model follows a bottom up principle and optimizes the control actions of a particular agent from locally available information the objective of agent i is to minimize its own risk and control cost which can be formulated as follows 7 min u i u j v i j t i l u t i u t j v i α i l p i t k l u t i u t j v i f i t k l u t i u t j v i where j t i l is the objective function of the i th agent at time t u t i i 1 2 n is the vector of the i th agent s control actions at time t i e u t i u t i k k 1 2 q d v i is the subset of agents that are directly connected with the i th agent thus j t i l u t i u t j v i represents the i th agent s objective with its decision vector u t i given the other agents decisions u t j v i the weight α i l represents the risk aversion of the i th agent i e the decision preference of the i th agent for risk aversion compared with the cost reduction p i t k l u t i u t j v i and f i t k l u t i u t j v i are the i th agent s risk at time t k and control cost during time period t k 1 respectively with its decision vector u t i given the other agents decisions u t j v i similar to centralized control these two terms are first normalized to be dimensionless values and then summed to form a weighted objective as in eq 7 essentially this weighted objective quantifies the comprehensive performance agent s risk and control cost of the i th agent at time t given the control actions u t i and u t j v i the i th agent s risk and control cost can be formulated as follows 8 p i t k l u t i u t j v i s i min z i r p s i t k ds i 9 f i t k l u t i u t j v i u t i k 2 where p s i t k is the marginal pdf with respective to state variable s i at time t k and u t i k is the control action of the i th agent at time t k eq 8 indicates that the risk of the i th agent given decision vectors u t i and u t j v i can be quantified by the probability of state variable s i falling below its safety boundary eq 9 indicates that the control cost of the i th agent during time interval t k 1 is a quadratic function of its control action the expectations of the i th agent s risk and control cost over the forecast control horizon can be quantified as follows 10 p i t k l u t i u t j v i 1 q f k 1 q f p i t k l u t i u t j v i 11 f i t k l u t i u t j v i 1 q f k 1 q f f i t k l u t i u t j v i while minimizing the above two terms the decentralized control model of agent i should simultaneously ensure that the risks of the other agents fall below the acceptable level which can be formulated as the following constraints 12 p j t k l u t i u t j v i s j min z j r p s j t k ds j r j 1 2 n j i k 1 2 q d where p s j t k is the marginal pdf with respect to state s j at time t k p j t k l u t i u t j v i is the risk of the failure of agent j given the decisions of the other agents note that eq 12 specifies n 1 q d constraints 2 3 hybrid control model the hybrid control model consists of two optimization layers 1 the lower or agent layer represents the behaviors of individual agents and optimizes the control of different agents iteratively based on local and limited information exchange this is consistent with the philosophy of decentralized control and thus follows the same mathematical formulation as specified in section 2 2 2 the upper or manager layer represents the behaviors of the manager and optimizes the risk aversion coefficients of all involved agents α i l such that the risk of the holistic nexus can be controlled this manager layer is fundamentally different from both the centralized and decentralized optimization models and is described as follows the manager is expected to optimize the risk aversion coefficients α i l and the optimal risk aversion coefficients remain unchanged for a prescribed time length specifically the decision horizon is divided into several stages within each of which the risk aversion coefficients remain constant the objective of the manager is to minimize the risk of the holistic nexus and the control costs the problem is formulated as follows 13 min α τ j u τ h α τ l α u h p τ k h α τ l g u h α τ l α τ 1 l where j u τ h α τ l is the objective of the manager in stage τ τ 1 2 τ where t is the total number of the stages during the control horizon and α τ l is the vector of risk aversion coefficients of all agents in stage τ i e α τ l α i τ l i 1 2 n where α i τ l is the risk aversion coefficient of agent i in stage τ α u h is the risk aversion coefficient of the manager which indicates the manager s preference for controlling the risk compared with the cost p τ k h α τ l is the risk of the holistic nexus in stage τ given the vector α τ l and g u h is the cost function of the manager for adjusting the risk aversion coefficients of different agents the risk of the holistic nexus and the control cost are first converted into dimensionless values and then summed to form the weighted objective function in eq 13 this weighted objective essentially quantifies the comprehensive performance risk and control cost of the manager given the manager s control effort α τ l α τ 1 l here the operator computes the difference between the vectors of risk aversion coefficients in two consecutive stages i e α τ l and α τ 1 l in the hybrid control model the decision processes are divided into several consecutive stages and the manager and agent layers of the model are implemented iteratively such that both the decisions and risk aversion coefficients of all agents can be optimized the stage wise decision process is as follows 1 at the beginning of a specific stage the manager s model is implemented to optimize the risk aversion coefficients of all agents 2 within each stage the risk aversion coefficients are set to the optimal values obtained in step 1 and then the agents models are implemented to optimize the control actions 3 steps 1 and 2 are iterated until the decision process ends 2 4 penalty functions the constraints in the three models increase the difficulty of finding optimal solutions but the optimization procedure can be simplified greatly by using penalty function methods feng et al 2017 yang et al 2009 in the case of centralized control the penalty function at time t denoted as f t h u t quantifies how far the agents risks are from the acceptable level and is thus termed the constraint violation extent or simply constraint violation based on eq 6 the detailed formula of this penalty function can be established as follows 14 f t h u t i k max s i min z i r p s i t k ds i r 0 2 thus the objective function for centralized control i e eq 1 can be modified as follows 15 min u t u t i k j t h u t α h p t k h u t f t k h u t β h f t h u t where α h is the global risk aversion coefficient reflecting the manager s attitude toward risk aversion versus cost reduction and β h is the global penalty coefficient reflecting the manager s attitude toward mitigating the risks of individual agents in the case of decentralized control the penalty function of agent i at time t denoted as f i t l u i u j v i quantifies how far the risk of all agents except agent i is from the acceptable level based on eq 12 this penalty function is established as follows 16 f i t l u i u j v i j k max s j min z j r p s j t k ds j r 0 2 j i thus the objective function for decentralized control i e eq 7 can be modified as follows 17 min u i j i t l u t i u t j v i α i l p i t k l u t i u t j v i f i t k l u t i u t j v i β i l f i t l u t i u t j v i where α i l is the risk aversion coefficient of agent i reflecting the i th agent s preference for risk aversion over cost reduction and β i l is the penalty coefficient of agent i reflecting the i th agent s preference for sacrificing other agents security to reduce its own risk called the i th agent s selfishness coefficient in the case of hybrid control the penalty functions of the manager and agent layers follow eqs 14 and 16 respectively because the corresponding constraints are the same as those in the centralized and decentralized models respectively by considering the penalty function the modified objective function of the agent layer is the same as that of the decentralized model i e eq 17 whereas the modified objective of the manager layer is slightly different from that of the centralized model and can be formulated as follows 18 min α τ j u τ h α τ l α u h p τ k h α τ l g u h α τ l α τ 1 l β u h f τ h α τ l where α τ l is the risk aversion vector consisting of all agents risk aversion coefficients in stage τ α u h and β u h are risk aversion and penalty coefficients respectively for the manager as shown in eqs 15 17 and 18 the objectives modified by penalty functions can be divided into three parts i e risk cost and constraint violation the extent of system risk away from its acceptable level the performance of the three control strategies depends on the risk aversion coefficients α including α h α i l and α u h and the selfishness coefficients β including β h β i l and β u h varying these coefficients could result in all pareto solutions for the three competing parts risk cost and constraint violation in the objectives when the risk aversion and selfishness coefficients are equal the decision maker i e manager or agents has equal preference for optimizing the risk control cost and constraint violation considering that the normalized dimensionless values of the system risk control cost and constraint violation are comparable these coefficients are set to 1 in this study i e risk aversion coefficient selfishness coefficient 1 if the risk aversion coefficient is greater than the selfishness coefficient and both are greater than 1 the decision maker has a preference for controlling the system risk if the selfishness coefficient is greater than the risk aversion coefficient and both are greater than 1 the decision maker has a preference for constraint violation if the risk aversion and selfishness coefficients are less than 1 the decision maker has a preference for reducing the control cost analyzing the effects of the risk aversion and selfishness coefficients allows us to investigate the roles of the agents and manager in the optimization models 3 case study the hehuang region of qinghai province china fig 3 is selected for a case study because it plays a key role in the social and economic development of qinghai province this region covers only 21 of the area of qinghai province 15 2 72 1 104 km2 but provides water power and other basic living conditions for 60 of the province s total population following the work of feng et al 2016 the wpe systems in hehuang are increasingly interconnected such that they can be considered as a wpe nexus the activities of this wpe nexus can be represented as six subsystems 1 hydrology 2 water supply 3 power generation 4 population 5 biology and 6 environment the state variables of these six subsystems can be represented by water storage s w water use per capita s u power use per capita s g population s n biomass s b and environmental awareness s e respectively in addition to these six state variables another five assistant variables are introduced to describe the socio economic states of wpe systems wealth m w living conditions l technology t pollution c and power deficit g d compared with the work of feng et al 2016 we incorporate five decision variables into the wpe nexus such that the control actions can be optimized within the smpc framework details presented in supplementary information s1 based on these human control decisions the wpe nexus is divided into five controllable agents 1 water agent w whose control variable is the ratio of water supply to water demand u w 2 biology agent b whose control variable is the biological harvest rate u b 3 environment agent c whose control variable is the wealth invested to deal with pollution u c 4 energy agent g whose control variable is the scale of photovoltaic pv power plants compared to current power plants u g and 5 society agent l whose control variable is the population growth rate u l note that this study assumes that the population growth rate can be manipulated by national policies the agents control variables symbols and their optimal values are summarized in table 1 with these five agents the concepts of centralized decentralized and hybrid control in the hehuang region are compared in fig 4 moreover the random variable ξ k k w u g n b e is introduced to account for the uncertainty of the k th state and ϕ i k i k w u g n b e is the response function of the i th system state to the k th random variable these uncertainties can be classified into two types 1 the variability of natural processes such as inflow precipitation and biomass growth 2 the uncertainties of human activities which reflect the diverse responses from individuals of different ages genders incomes and education backgrounds such as the uncertainties embedded in the per capita uses of power and water and environmental awareness the above natural processes and human activities are all affected by numerous factors so the associated uncertainties can be assumed to follow a gaussian distribution according to the central limit theorem bierkens 1998 leduc et al 1986 the uncertainty of water storage comes from the regional inflow and precipitation which are highly correlated and thus the intensity of ξ w is assumed to be proportional to the mean value of inflow i e ξ i n 0 cv i i 2 the other uncertainties originate from system characteristics and so the intensity ξ k k u g n b e is assumed to be proportional to the system state i e ξ k n 0 cv k s k 2 to reduce the model complexity the matrix of response functions is set as a diagonal matrix i e φ diag 1 1 1 1 1 1 this assumes that a particular system state can only have direct response from its own stochasticity and respond to other stochasticities through interconnections by incorporating the control actions of five agents and the stochasticities of system states the original dynamics of the wpe nexus considered by feng et al 2016 are extended to a stochastic dynamical system details in supplementary information s1 the interconnections of the associated variables state variables assistant variables and control variables can be described in terms of positive and negative feedback as shown in fig 5 the mathematical representation of this new version of the wpe nexus is represented as follows 19 d s w dt i p e u w s u s n f γ s g s n o k ϕ w k ξ

the coevolution of system states and are thus referred to as the constitutive relationships detailed formulas can be found in tables 2 and 3 of feng et al 2016 specifically the technology t and power deficit g d can be formulated as follows 20 t 10 1 e 3 10 4 u c m w g d 1 γ gn min 1 u g ψ o 1 γ gn where u c is the fraction of wealth decision variable used for developing technology and u c m w is the resultant absolute wealth for technology development u g is the matched pv power capacity specified as the fraction of hydropower capacity decision variable ψ o is the actual hydropower generation and 1 u g ψ o is the total power generation i e the sum of hydropower and solar power based on the assumption that solar power generation is proportional to hydropower generation with the proportion specified as u g the implementation procedures of centralized decentralized and hybrid control strategies for the wpe nexus is described in supplementary information s2 and the details for the parametrization for the three control strategies are explained as follows within the smpc framework the control actions for the wpe nexus in the hehuang region are optimized for a 30 year period the forecast horizon is set as ten periods years based on our empirical experiences that the realistic regional short term planning is usually conducted for a ten year period the sensitivity of the optimal performances of centralized decentralized and hybrid control models to the forecast horizon has been conducted in supplementary information s3 and it is shown that the main conclusions remain the same for different levels of forecast horizon the forecast and control horizons are set to be equal i e all decisions in the forecast horizon should be optimized by centralized decentralized and hybrid control models for the hybrid model the manager is expected to change the risk aversion coefficients of the agents every five years i e the whole 30 year period is divided into six stages the common parameters involved in the centralized decentralized and hybrid control models are summarized in table 2 the acceptable risk is determined by negotiation between the manager and the agents while the thresholds for the key variables of different agents are identified by the procedures stated in appendix a the choice of the risk aversion and selfishness coefficients weights applied to risk and constraint violation respectively for the three control models is summarized in table 3 the uncertainty of these coefficients is assessed in section 4 2 which also reflects the roles of the agents and manager in the control strategies 4 results 4 1 comparison of tradeoffs of three control strategies in this section we compare the tradeoffs across system risk control cost and constraint violation for all five agents under centralized decentralized and hybrid strategies figs 6 and 7 these tradeoffs are obtained by varying the risk aversion coefficients fig 6 and selfishness coefficients fig 7 although the tradeoffs or pareto fronts across system risk control cost and constraint violation would shift with acceptable risk all agents could be classified into selfish and generous categories and the classification of these agents is insensitive to the acceptable risk supplementary information s4 moreover the other involved analysis is also insensitive to the choice of acceptable risk and thus the following analysis is conducted with the acceptable level at 25 as shown in fig 6 according to the risk the agents can be classified into two categories 1 selfish agents i e biology b and society l agents whose risks are far below the acceptable risk 25 and 2 generous agents i e water w environment c and energy g agents whose risks are above and can be quite close to the acceptable risk as defined in eqs 14 and 16 the concept of constraint violation quantifies the distance between the actual risk and acceptable risk under all three control strategies the selfish agents have constraint violations very close to zero in contrast with the generous agents whose constraint violations are quite high this implies that all three control strategies are more likely to sacrifice the safety of generous agents and reduce the risks of selfish agents i e the safety of generous agents is sacrificed with priority hence the term generous while the safety of selfish agents is protected with priority hence selfish for generous agents the hybrid control drives the local agent s risk from inferior far above the acceptable risk to superior close to the acceptable risk for the energy g agent the centralized control has the lowest risk but the highest cost while the decentralized control has the highest risk but the lowest cost in the case of hybrid control the risk is close to that of centralized control while the cost is close to that of decentralized control this implies that hybrid control can significantly decrease the risk without notably increasing the control cost for the environment c agent the control costs of all three strategies are approximately the same while the risk of hybrid control is between that of the centralized and decentralized strategies this implies that hybrid control drives the system risk from a high level close to that of centralized control to a low level close to that of decentralized control such that it becomes closer to the acceptable level for the water w agent centralized control has the highest risk and the highest control cost whereas hybrid control has the lowest risk and the lowest control cost decentralized control has a medium level of risk and its cost is close to that of hybrid control this implies that hybrid control can reach a low risk at a relatively low cost overall the hybrid control strategy always reduces the system risk of generous agents obtained from a worse strategy either centralized or decentralized to a level close to the acceptable risk without significantly increasing the control cost or constraint violation more importantly hybrid control seems to improve the performance of generous agents by slightly degenerating the performance of selfish agents specifically hybrid control reduces the risks of generous agents still above the acceptable risk at the expense of increasing the risks of selfish agents still below the acceptable risk for the biology b agent hybrid control has the highest risk while the risks of centralized and decentralized control are approximately the same the control costs of all three control strategies are similar for the society l agent hybrid control has the highest risk while the control costs of all three control strategies are similar despite hybrid control producing the highest risks for both the biology b and society l agents their risks remain below the acceptable level therefore the hybrid control model balances the risks between generous and selfish agents by sacrificing some of the safety of selfish agents to reduce the risks of generous agents following the above analysis the properties of optimal control for interconnected systems with the engagement of multiple agents can be summarized as follows 1 the hybrid control model balances the risks across multiple agents and is thus most applicable to real scenarios in particular hybrid control sacrifices some of the security of selfish agents to reduce the risks of generous agents such that the risks of generous agents decrease significantly and become close to the acceptable level while the risks of selfish agents increase slightly but remain below the acceptable level 2 the conventional tradeoff relationship between two conflicting objectives of a single agent can be violated in interconnected systems taking the water w agent as an example centralized control results in the highest risk and the highest control cost with similar constraint violations to the other two control strategies this contrasts with our knowledge of conventional optimization practices which states that the system risk will decrease as the control cost increases this violation of the conventional tradeoff relationship can be interpreted as a complex hedging process across the system risks control costs and constraint violations of multiple agents 4 2 roles of agents and manager the hybrid control model is considered more suitable for realistic cases than the centralized and decentralized models thus we now investigate how the agents and manager work and function in the hybrid control model specifically the manager s role can be quantified by the changes in the risk aversion coefficients in two consecutive stages fig 8 fig 8a and b show the changes in risk aversion coefficients under different levels of initial risk aversion and selfishness respectively as shown in fig 8a a the risk aversion coefficient increases for the environment agent c but decreases significantly for the other agents this implies that to achieve a better control effect the manager expects the environment agent to increase its preference for risk aversion and the other agents to decrease their preference for risk aversion the changes in the risk aversion coefficients shown in fig 8 can be interpreted as follows in most panels of fig 8a except fig 8a b and 8a c the risk aversion coefficients of selfish agents b and l decreases while the risk aversion coefficients of generous agents w g and c may either increase or decrease this implies that in most scenarios the manager expects selfish agents to relax their control on the system risk and reduce their control cost such that the other agents have more space to reduce their risk moreover the manager expects some generous agents to increase their risk aversion coefficients such that their security is sacrificed to a higher extent to protect the other agents security therefore the manager plays a crucial role in hedging the risks between selfish and generous agents such hedging of risks can also be observed within between selfish agents fig 8a b and 8a c i e the risk aversion coefficient of the biology b agent decreases while that of the society l agent increases however in fig 8b the changes in risk aversion coefficients are not consistent across agents of the same type selfish or generous i e for selfish or generous agents the coefficient can either increase or decrease this implies that the hedging of risks within either selfish or generous agents is more popular than the hedging of risks between selfish and generous agents as the selfishness coefficient varies therefore the manager plays a critical role in adjusting the decision preferences relating to system risks control costs and constraint violations such that the risks of selfish and generous agents can be hedged or balanced moreover multiple combinations of risk aversion and selfishness coefficients could result in almost the same control effect i e the role of the manager is complicated by the equifinality of decision preferences in optimization problems with multiple objectives and multiple agents by varying the risk aversion and selfishness coefficients artificially the role of generous and selfish agents in the decentralized optimization strategy can be verified three scenarios for decision preferences risk aversion and selfishness coefficients are designed in table 4 1 high preference scenario h1 h4 to investigate how high risk aversion or selfishness coefficients affect the control effects 2 low preference scenario l1 l4 to investigate how low levels of the risk aversion or selfishness coefficient affect the control effects 3 combined preference scenario c1 c4 to investigate how different combinations of high and low levels of the risk aversion and selfishness coefficients affect the control effects corresponding to the scenario settings in table 4 the risks control costs and constraint violations for the five agents are compared in fig 9 specifically a high level of decision preference either risk aversion or selfishness coefficient affects the risks costs and constraint violations significantly for the energy and environment agents but has limited effects on the other agents fig 9a however a low and or combined decision preference could have relatively large effects on the water energy and environment agents generous agents but minor effects on the other agents fig 9b and c thus varying the decision preferences effectively changes the system risks of generous agents especially the energy agent but has a minor effect on selfish agents moreover the impacts of varying the selfishness coefficient β i l are much greater than when the risk aversion coefficient α i l is varied compared with the system risks the control costs of different agents are more sensitive to changes in the decision preferences thus the control cost responses to different decision preference scenarios are summarized in table 5 fig 9 and table 5 indicate that alterations in the decision preferences will obviously change the control costs of the society and environment agents selfish agents but have smaller effects on the control costs of the water energy and environment agents generous agents in summary changes in the decision preferences are more effective in modifying the risks of generous agents and the control costs of selfish agents this implies that generous and selfish agents play different roles in the case of decentralized control i e to achieve the nash optimal solution generous agents are more likely to change their risks while selfish agents are more likely to change their control costs 4 3 bottleneck shift under the three control strategies this section explores the existence of bottlenecks and the possibility of shifting these bottlenecks under the three control strategies which may provide a deeper understanding of the optimal control of interconnected systems first a bottleneck is defined as the subsystem or agent that makes the largest contribution to the overall risk i e the risk contribution ratio χ i i w b c g and l see details in appendix b the changes in the risk contribution ratio of the different agents under the three control strategies are compared in fig 10 two main observations can be summarized as follows 1 the evolving trajectories of the risk contribution ratios are relatively smooth in the case of centralized control but have large oscillations under decentralized and hybrid control in the decentralized control model the oscillations in the risk contribution ratios can be interpreted as the bargaining process before all agents reach their nash optimal solutions this bargaining process is reflected by iterative applications of the local optimization algorithm for different agents specifically in each round of bargaining a particular agent corrects its decisions from the previous bargaining process irrespective of the other agents risks and costs and the corrections cause large oscillations in the system states and risk contribution ratios in the centralized control strategy the optimal decisions obtained from a global optimization model with a single objective result in relatively smooth trajectories of system states such that the oscillations in the risk contribution ratios are effectively improved in the hybrid control model the oscillations are improved to some extent because this strategy combines the advantages of centralized and decentralized control 2 although the evolution of the highest and lowest risk contribution ratios varies with the different control strategies the bottleneck seldom changes the roles of the agents in shifting the bottleneck can be identified by comparing the risk contribution ratios from centralized and decentralized control whereas the role of the manager can be identified by comparing the risk contribution ratios from decentralized and hybrid control as shown in fig 10 compared with centralized control the decentralized strategy increases the risk contribution of the energy g agent but decreases the risk contributions of the environment c and biology b agents compared with decentralized control the hybrid control model decreases the risk contribution of the energy e agent but increases the risk contributions of the biology b agent thus fig 10 shows that the agents and manager play almost contrasting roles in affecting the potential to shift the bottleneck the bargaining process across agents is more likely to protect the environment and biology agents whereas the manager s decision is more likely to sacrifice the safety of the environment and biology agents while protecting the energy agent although the bargaining process across agents and the optimal decisions of the manager can change the trajectories of the risk contribution ratios the bottleneck and its shifts appear to have only minor differences in the three control strategies in the centralized and decentralized control models the bottleneck shifts from the water w to the energy g agent in the case of hybrid control the bottleneck shifts from the water w to the energy g agent and then on to the environment c agent this can be explained by the decentralized and hybrid models having greater effects on agents with the largest and lowest risk contribution ratios but little effect on the other agents 5 conclusion this study has examined the performance of centralized decentralized and hybrid control strategies within the smpc framework for the wpe nexus by extending the wpe nexus developed by feng et al 2016 into controllable stochastic dynamical systems the three control models were implemented and compared in a case study of the hehuang region of china by comparing the tradeoffs among five agents across system risks control costs and constraint violations the hybrid control model was identified as the most suitable of the three control strategies for realistic cases scenario analysis verified the roles of different agents and the regional manager and the impacts of the three control strategies on shifting bottlenecks in the wpe system were analyzed the main conclusions from this study can be summarized as follows 1 the agents in hehuang could be grouped into two categories a selfish agents including biology and society agents and b generous agents including water energy and environment agents the selfish agents were more likely to satisfy their own safety requirements by sacrificing the safety of other agents such that their own system risks were always below the acceptable level the generous agents were more likely to sacrifice their own safety to satisfy the safety requirements of other agents such that their system risks were always above the acceptable level 2 hybrid control was found to be the most suitable control strategy for realistic cases because it combines the advantages of centralized and decentralized control and improves the performance of generous agents at the expense of selfish agents for generous agents hybrid control can always decrease the risks from a worse strategy centralized or decentralized control without significantly increasing the control costs and constraint violations for selfish agents despite hybrid control having comparable control costs to centralized and decentralized control it achieves the highest risks that are still below the acceptable level 3 adopting different control strategies has a somewhat limited effect on the process of shifting bottlenecks because decentralized and hybrid control only have significant impacts on the trajectories of the risk contribution ratios with the highest environment and biology and lowest energy values specifically in the decentralized control model the bargaining process across agents is more likely to protect the environment and biology agents by sacrificing the safety of energy agents in centralized control the global optimal decision is more likely to protect the energy agent by sacrificing the safety of environment and biology agents the minor changes in the risk contribution ratios have limited impacts on shifting the bottleneck in this study the adaption of three control strategies especially decentralized and hybrid control to the wpe nexus has enabled us to develop more effective policies or rules to examine the tradeoff and synergy effects and prevent system failure in the field of nexus modelling and or interconnected systems moreover the comparison of three control strategies for the wpe nexus has provided useful suggestions for regional management first the various policies or management rules should be tailored for generous or selfish agents in realistic scenarios second a better allocation scheme for the multiple resources involved in the wpe nexus should be achieved through negotiation between the regional manager and the involved agents third identifying possible bottlenecks and its shifting process could help the manager to reduce the risk of large scale system failure overall examining the performance of three control strategies for the wpe nexus has helped to advance our understanding and practices of optimization and control for large scale interconnected systems credit authorship contribution statement maoyuan feng conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original

optimization model for deriving the thresholds of state variables in the centralized decentralized and hybrid control models the system risks are defined based on the thresholds of state variables below which the systems or agents are exposed to the risk of failure empirically determining these thresholds through existing knowledge or expertise may lead to large uncertainties to overcome this shortcoming we defined these thresholds of system states according to the quantiles of stationary probability density functions pdfs of state variables corresponding to prescribed acceptable risks moreover we developed an optimization model to derive the thresholds of system states with stationary pdfs obtained with optimal control actions that minimize accumulated uncertainties the detailed procedures of deriving the thresholds of state variables are as follows first the concept of the accumulation ratio ar is introduced to quantify the uncertainty accumulation within interconnected systems originally the concept of ar was defined in pharmacokinetics to quantify drug accumulation in the human body when a specific drug is applied in multiple doses greenblatt et al 1979 hu et al 2015 scheerans et al 2015 in pharmacokinetics the most widely used definition of ar is the ratio of average drug concentration at the final steady level to that during the first application scheerans et al 2015 analogously ar for uncertainty accumulation can be defined as the ratio of uncertainties in the system states at a particular time to the average uncertainties of interruptions introduced during a given time interval by quantifying uncertainty using the variances and covariances of state variables ar can be represented as follows a1 ar i var s i t var δ i a2 ar i j cov s i s j t cov δ i δ j where ar i quantifies the uncertainty accumulation in system i var s i t is the variance of state i at time t and var δ i is the average variance of the introduced interruptions on state i ar i j quantifies the accumulation in the likelihood of the coincidence of deviations in states i and j from their expectations cov s i s j t is the covariance of states i and j and cov δ i δ j is the average covariance of the introduced interruptions on states i and j next the control actions of the interconnected systems are optimized with the objective of minimizing the norm of the ar matrix the objective function of this optimization model can be established as follows a3 min u ω ar ar i j i j 1 2 n where u is the vector of control variables which are time invariant in this model ω ar is the norm of the ar matrix e g 1 2 or norm is the operator that computes the norm of a specific vector or matrix and ar i j i j 1 2 n is the n n matrix composed of ars next the stationary joint pdf of state variables p s s and the marginal pdf p s s i i 1 2 n are derived with the optimal control actions obtained in the previous step specifically the stationary pdfs are obtained by substituting the optimal control actions into the stochastic dynamical systems of the wpe nexus i e eq 19 and simulating the model until the steady condition is achieved finally the thresholds of state variables denoted by z i r i 1 2 n are derived with the stationary joint pdf p s s or marginal pdf p s s i using the prescribed acceptable risk r specifically the relationship between the thresholds of state variables z i r and acceptable risk r can be represented as follows a4 s i min z i r p s s i ds i r i 1 2 n where s i min is the minimum of state variable s i the acceptable risk r is usually determined through negotiation between the manager and multiple stakeholders according to their empirical experience appendix b definition of system bottleneck within the wpe nexus or other interconnected systems even a small input uncertainty may be transferred through various interconnections and accumulate to reach a large level eventually causing the failure of the overall system across all subsystems some specific subsystem is likely to accumulate uncertainty faster than the others such that this subsystem has a greater probability of triggering the system failure than other subsystems this particular subsystem makes the largest contribution to the holistic risk of system failure and can be defined as the bottleneck a concept borrowed from the field of supply chain networks mizgier et al 2013 wang et al 2005 denoting the failures of subsystem i and the holistic nexus as events a i and a respectively the contribution of the risk of subsystem i to that of the holistic nexus can be represented by the following risk contribution ratio b1 χ i p a a i p a i a p a where p quantifies the risk or probability of the event specified in parentheses specifically p a a i is the likelihood of the holistic nexus failing given the failure of subsystem i p a i a is the probability of the simultaneous failure of subsystem i and the holistic nexus and p a is the probability of the holistic nexus failing following these specifications the bottleneck of the holistic nexus can be identified as follows b2 j arg max i χ i i k χ k χ i k 1 2 n where arg max is the operator that returns the maximum of the argument in this case the subsystem with the largest risk contribution ratio χ i in this study the holistic nexus fails when the storage or output of any subsystem is below its target or threshold as determined by the optimization model described in appendix a this means that the failure of any subsystem could result in the failure of the holistic nexus i e a i is a subset of a denoted bya i a and p a a i p a i in this manner the risk contribution ratio defined in eq b1 can be further formulated as b3 χ i p a a i p a i p a assuming that the system safety requires the state variables to remain above the thresholds z r z i r i 1 2 n the holistic risk can be quantified as follows b4 p a p i s i z i r 1 prob i s i z i r 1 z r s max p s d s 1 z i r s 1 max z i r s n max p s 1 s 2 s n ds 1 ds n where is the logical operator that links all possible cases of system failure i e either state variable falls below its threshold while is the logical operator that links all the necessary conditions to maintain the safety of the wpe nexus i e each state variable should be above the threshold s max s i max i 1 2 n is the vector of the maxima where s i max is the maximum of system state i furthermore the risk of failure of a particular subsystem i p a i can be quantified as follows b5 p a i p s i z i r s i min s i max s i min z i r p s 1 s 2 s n ds 1 ds n where s i min is the minimum of system state i s i max and s i min are the maximum and minimum for all states except system i by incorporating eqs b4 and b5 into eq b3 the risk contribution ratios can be obtained and used to identify bottlenecks appendix c supplementary data supplementary data to this article can be found online at https doi org 10 1016 j jhydrol 2022 128609

2689,drought is known as a complex natural phenomenon because of its multifaceted effect on the environment composite drought indices have been considered a useful tool to capture the compound drought impacts however few of them are capable of operating at multi timescales moreover the vast of composite drought indices fail to depict the whole water deficit on terrestrial because of the ignoring of groundwater in this study we linearly combined two satellite observed variables tws terrestrial water storage and vpd vapor pressure deficit to develop a new index wddi water deficit drought index it can provide the global composite drought conditions at multi timescales by different weight combinations the global multiscalar spei standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index from 2002 to 2011 and 2012 to 2017 were selected to train and assess the weights respectively weights assessment results showed that spei and wddi reached moderate correlations r 0 4 over the globe especially stronger in the summer season 0 5 r 0 88 good agreements between wddi and scpdsi self calibrated palmer drought severity index spei were found in the global historical drought area statistics especially in area statistics of severe or worse drought conditions wddi at short and long timescales were found to be sensitive to drought signals in the meteorological and hydrological system respectively as it produced moderate or stronger correlations with vsmci volumetric soil moisture condition index and rci runoff condition index in most parts of the world the application of wddi in the specific drought events the 2010 russian drought and the 2012 2016 california drought further reinforced the above inferences and revealed the unique superiority of considering groundwater deficit in hydrological drought monitoring the new proposed multiscalar wddi could help practitioners better identify the drought conditions and understand the drought propagation mechanism from the meteorological to the hydrological system keywords drought indicator water deficit drought index drought monitoring terrestrial water storage vapor pressure deficit data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought a common natural disaster caused by regional abnormalities in the global water cycle has always been a highly concerned topic for the scientific community aghakouchak et al 2015 lewis et al 2011 livneh and badger 2020 xu et al 2019 it poses a significant threat to the available water resources and food security frappart et al 2012 castle et al 2014 under future warmer climates the occurrence of drought has been projected to increase by several studies dai 2012 sheffield and wood 2007 dai et al 2018 lu et al 2019 pokhrel et al 2021 this urges humans to build a drought early warning and monitoring system to transform a reactive society that responds to impacts into a proactive society that is resilient and adapted to drought risk pendergrass et al 2020 which will put forward higher requirements for the design of the drought index as it can quantify the severity and spatial extent of the drought by numerical values drought events can be classified into four types which include meteorological agricultural hydrological and socio economic drought mishra and singh 2010 generally the first three represent the drought impact on the atmospheric vegetation and hydrological system respectively which are corresponding to the specific components of the spac soil plant atmosphere continuum however the boundary between drought types is indistinct in reality jiao et al 2019a because of the aggregated attenuated lagged or prolonged drought propagation process van loon et al 2012 ma et al 2019 in other words the impact of drought on the spac system may be multifaceted plenty of drought indices have been developed however most of them only capture the single realm of water condition in the spac system and lead to the problem that a non optimal drought index can depict the multifaceted drought van loon 2015 for example precipitation based indicators may arise incorrect diagnosis if they are applied to reflect the vegetation water stress in well developed irrigation areas owing to the propagation of meteorological drought to agricultural drought can be prevented by human irrigation although practitioners and policymakers can choose a series of single variable drought indices to track the diverse impacts of drought challenges are still existed by the associated diversity of choice and logistically difficulty of accessing information from multiple platforms jiao et al 2019a building a composite or integrated index by combining a series of hydrometeorological variables or different drought indices in either a weighted or a modeled fashion would provide a new path to descript the multifaceted comprehensive impacts of drought hao and aghakouchak 2013 chang et al 2016 shah and mishra 2020 recently the application of remote sensing observations has further promoted the prosperity of research on composite drought monitoring as it overcomes the limitation of sparse station observations that account for the majority of the world igbawua et al 2018 strides have been made by several studies in the past decade which are listed in table 1 however there are still some lacks in the applications of the existing composite drought indices one is that most indices are only suitable for monitoring drought at a fixed inflexible timescale for example the combination of land surface temperature surface soil moisture and precipitation named midi microwave integrated drought index zhang and jia 2013 zhang et al 2019 is proposed for monitoring meteorological drought which only represents the drought condition at a short timescale given that drought events often occur with high frequency and moist periods of short duration at a short timescale while with low frequency and longer duration at a long timescale drought is considered a phenomenon of multi scalar vicente serrano et al 2010a this explains the wide acceptance and recommendation of drought indices that can be calculated at different timescales for instance spi standardized precipitation index mckee et al 1993 and spei standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index vicente serrano et al 2010a on the one hand monitoring of drought at various timescales allows the identification of short term wet periods within long term droughts or short term dry spells within long term wet periods if the indicator shows continued drought conditions at a long timescale policymakers may pay more attention to the sustainable utilization of water resources on the other hand it ensures the indicator tracks the drought propagation process because the response of hydrological systems to precipitation varies as a function of time vicente serrano et al 2010a however spi and spei are meteorological drought indices that do not provide any insight into soil moisture and hydrological drought information in a direct way xu et al 2020 moreover despite a few composite drought indices can operate at flexible timescales they are usually developed at a regional scale with homogenized environmental conditions which limits their applications across a continental scale or a global scale jiao et al 2019b son et al 2021 for example the mcdis multivariable composite drought index are only developed for monitoring the drought that occurred in shandong china in addition the complex and time consuming calculation may also hinder their applications for example the multiscalar spesmi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration and soil moisture index puts forward higher requirements of professional skills in data assimilation for practitioners and policymakers last but most important groundwater would have good potential in quantifying overall water deficits xu et al 2020 while the vast of the indices ignore this compartment as well as others such as surface reservoir river and deep soil which makes them impossible to assess the overall water shortage of the whole spac system therefore our goal is to develop a new remote sensing composite drought index to address the above challenges while taking into account the ability of multiscalar drought monitoring the index must consider as few variables as possible to reduce the calculation complexity the combination of tws terrestrial water storage and vpd vapor pressure deficit offers the chance to achieve the goal tws represents the column integrated water stored on land including canopy despite this portion being negligible surface water soil groundwater and snow and has been proved to be good at large scale hydrological drought monitoring yirdaw et al 2008 chen et al 2009 frappart et al 2012 long et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 sinha et al 2019 vpd defined as the difference between saturated and actual atmospheric vapor pressures for a given temperature directly represents the water required for the atmosphere to reach saturation atmospheric thirsty several studies have found its potential in the meteorological drought early detection and prediction behrangi et al 2015 behrangi et al 2016 farahmand et al 2015 aghakouchak et al 2015 farahmand et al 2021 more important droughts on short timescales are mainly related to soil moisture content vicente serrano et al 2010a which means the high frequency of its changes monthly vpd has a higher frequency of change in comparison to tws and has a close coupling relationship with surface soil moisture seneviratne et al 2010 liu et al 2020a indicating the potential of vpd tws in monitoring drought at a short long timescale therefore the combination of tws and vpd is expected to be good in describing the composite water deficit condition of the spac system at short long timescales if the greater weight are assigned to vpd tws in this study we aim to combine tws and vpd to build a new index named wddi water deficit drought index through a linearly weighted method the constrained optimization method guo et al 2019 hao et al 2015 and the newly proposed vpa vector projection analysis son et al 2021 method were selected to integrate the components the performance of the new index would be evaluated by traditional drought indices including scpdsi self calibrating palmer drought severity index palmer 1965 multiscalar spei vsmci volumetric soil moisture condition index vci vegetation condition index and rci runoff condition index respectively 2 data 2 1 tws observation from grace since the grace gravity recovery and climate experiment mission has been launched in march 2002 it brought a new era that enlightened our view of the quantified trend and fluctuation of terrestrial water storage with an accuracy approaching 2 cm tapley et al 2019 in this study we used the monthly jpl jet propulsion laboratory mascon solutions rl06m mscnv02 for the period from june 2002 to june 2017 the values of missing months were filled by linear interpolation the raw data is represented on a half degree grid with a coarse native spatial resolution of 3 degrees it should be noted that grace provides the terrestrial water storage anomaly but not the absolute magnitude estimates 2 2 vpd and vsm observations from lpdrv2 0 the lpdr v2 0 version 2 0 university of montana land parameter data record retrieved from amsr advanced microwave scanning radiometer and amsr2 advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 sensors is a 25 km global daily record of key terrestrial environmental parameters including open water fraction surface air temperature vertically integrated atmospheric water vapor vegetation optical depth near surface vpd and vsm volumetric soil moisture du et al 2017 du et al 2018 it has already been applied in several drought monitoring studies brandt et al 2018 du et al 2019 tian et al 2018 in this study the ascending vpd and vsm products were chosen daily vpd and vsm with a timespan consistent with grace were averaged into monthly composite data and resampled to a half degree respectively 2 3 vegetation observation from modis the global monthly vegetation information mod13c2 observed by modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer from june 2002 to june 2017 was downloaded from the laads the level 1 and atmosphere archive distribution system daac distributed active archive center the ndvi normalized difference vegetation index data was chosen to construct the vegetation based drought index vci with a half degree resolution 2 4 global gridded runoff estimation the global monthly gridded runoff data from june 2002 to december 2014 with a half degree resolution was obtained from https figshare com articles dataset grun global runoff reconstruction 9228176 it was predicted by a machine learning algorithm based on antecedent precipitation and temperature from an atmospheric reanalysis ghiggi et al 2019 2 5 drought indices datasets the monthly multiscalar spei from june 2002 to june 2017 were obtained from the csic institutional repository of the spanish national research council including 1 month spei 3 month spei 6 month spei 9 month spei and 12 month spei marked as spei01 spei03 spei06 spei09 and spei12 respectively the spatial resolution of the spei database speibase v2 6 is half degree vicente serrano et al 2010b it was calculated utilizing the global gridded cru climate research unit ts 4 03 monthly dataset fao 56 penman monteith was selected to estimate potential evapotranspiration in spei calculation similarly we also selected a monthly scpdsi dataset provided by the cru with the same period and spatial resolution the scpdsi runs from january 1901 to december 2017 driven by a preliminary version of the cru ts 3 26 monthly climate dataset hartfield et al 2018 van der schrier et al 2013 besides we used the cru ts 4 03 monthly climate data from 1980 to 2018 to calculate the precipitation and temperature anomalies only precipitation and temperature anomalies from 2010 to 2015 were used in the analysis 2 6 ancillary data given the impact of the climate on the determination of weights we used the climate zone data köppen geiger climate classification to train the weights for each climate zone climate zone data was supported by beck et al 2018 according to its scheme the globe has been divided into 30 climate zones with different climatic characteristics such as dry summer or wet hot summer or cold however in its half degree gridded dataset two climate zones csc and cwc were excluded we also excluded the climate zone ef because it is characterized as polar and frost figure s1 shows the spatial patterns and area statistics of climate zones to investigate the relationship between meteorological drought and vpd over a longer time series 1980 2019 40 years variables including precipitation potential evaporation dew point temperature and air temperature were obtained from era5 european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis v5 3 development of wddi 3 1 calculation of wddi since grace tws supported by jpl is the anomaly data relative to the 2004 2009 time mean baseline we first removed the corresponding time mean baseline from vpd data then the standardized z scores tws and vpd were calculated as follows 1 x z i j x i j x i σ i where x i j is tws or vpd for the month i ranges from 0 to 12 and year j ranges from 2002 to 2017 x i and σ i are the 15 year mean and standard deviation of tws or vpd for month i for tws z the negative value represents a drought condition while for vpd z is wet wddi is defined as a linear weighted result of t w s z and v p d z eq 2 two weight determination methods the constrained optimization method guo et al 2019 hao et al 2015 and the newly proposed vpa vector projection analysis son et al 2021 method were selected to estimate α and β the multiscalar spei including spei01 spei03 spei06 spei09 and spei12 were chose as the target which is a common way in the composite drought index development liu et al 2020b guo et al 2019 meng et al 2016 hao et al 2015 because of the none absolute realistic drought measurement choosing the traditional drought index provides an expedient solution 2 wddi i j α t w s z ij β v p d z i j in the constrained optimization scheme the α and β sets were iteratively estimated by computing the correlation between temporary wddi and spei with the value of α varying from 0 to 1 in steps of 0 01 the optimal α and β were determined when the maximum correlation was obtained eq 3 note that α and β both follow the rule of eq 4 3 f s p e i wddi t m a x c o r r s p e i wddi t 4 0 α 1 0 β 1 α β 1 where f s p e i wddi t represents the function to find the maximum pearson correlation between spei and wddi t wddi t is the temporary wddi calculated with a specific set of α and β in the vpa scheme α and β were estimated similarly by correlation but did not need to look for the maximum correlation iteratively instead correlation coefficient values between the tws z and vpd z with spei were first used as vector components to determine the direction of wddi 5 wddidirection c o r r s p e i t w s z c o r r s p e i v p d z c o r r s p e i t w s z 2 corr s p e i v p d z 2 an orthogonal projection of observed anomaly values onto the wddi direction was then used to calculate wddi because the direction was determined as a unit vector with a magnitude always equal to 1 the orthogonal projection onto the unit vector was equal to the inner product between the wddi direction and the observation vector the inner product was further formed as a linear weighted combination in which weights directly come from the correlation coefficients more detail about the vpa method can be obtained from son et al 2021 because of the discontinues between amsr e and amsr2 observations spei and corresponding t w s z and v p d z values from 2002 to 2011 were used to train the weights for two schemes furthermore we considered the effects of climate zone and seasonal changes on weight therefore weights for different seasons and climate zone were trained in this step the correlation coefficient was required according to the above methods only the correlation value that passed the significance test was retained as the final weight value for a grid for each climate zone climate average weights were calculated using the retained significant correlation values and then they were assigned to the grids with no weight values 3 2 classification of wddi according to the seasonal α and β we finally produced two wddi products signed as wddi opt and wddi vpa drought severities were designated as d0 abnormally dry d1 moderate drought d2 severe drought d3 extreme drought and d4 exceptional drought the thresholds used to assess drought severity were then calculated according to the probability standard of spi and spei that is 0 06 for exceptional drought 2 3 for extreme drought 4 4 for severe drought 9 2 for moderate drought and 24 for abnormally dry of the time the threshold results were shown in table 2 3 3 evaluation of wddi values of spei from the rest of the period july 2012 june 2017 were used for weights verification first correlation coefficients were calculated between global mean spei values and corresponding wddi values at multi timescales for each season to evaluate the classification thresholds of wddi the global historical drought area percentages detected by scpdsi multiscalar spei and multiscalar wddi were compared we chose these two indices as metrics because of their widely accepted and used thresholds to investigate the applicable scenarios of wddi we selected three indices including vsmci vci and rci to evaluate the sensitivity of wddi to water stress signals in meteorological agricultural and hydrological systems vsmci is reasonable as a metric for assessing short term drought caused by meteorological conditions since the soil moisture observed from amsr only reflects the top soil dryness vci and rci represent the vegetation or agricultural drought and hydrological drought respectively vsmci and rci were calculated according to eq 1 while vci was calculated according to bento et al 2020 in addition two cases which represent the seasonal drought the 2010 russian drought and prolonged drought the 2012 2016 california drought that occurred in regions with dense stations were applied to examine the application performance of wddi 4 results 4 1 weights variation and assessment the rationale behind the multiscalar wddi is that we assume vpd tws plays a dominant role in monitoring drought at a short long timescale due to its higher lower frequency of variations results of weights changing over timescales support our hypothesis fig 1 whether it is the scheme that uses the constrained optimization method fig 1a or the vpa method fig 1b α is much smaller than β at short timescales and it is gradually increasing to be greater than β as the timescale increases the feature of weights varying over timescales is more prominent in fig 1a because the sum of α and β is constrained to the numerical one the changes in correlations between vpd z and tws z with spei at different timescales provide an explanation generally vpd z tws z has a gradually decreased increased correlation with spei as the timescale increases figure s2 these results imply that the weights can play a role as a controller to make wddi adaptive to different application scenarios table 3 shows the weights assessment results in most cases the correlations between wddi opt and spei are greater than that between wddi vpa and spei besides correlations vary from seasons and timescales in spring mam moderate correlations were observed at timescales of 1 month 9 month and 12 month implying the consistency between spei and wddi at short and long timescales weights in summer produce the best performance for wddi at all timescales except for 12 month wddi generally has a correlation of nearly 0 5 with spei in autumn son and winter djf with the highest correlation obtained at timescales of 6 month in autumn and 12 month in winter in general spei and wddi reach a moderate r 0 4 correlation which preliminarily proves the reliability of weights at the global scale fig 2 the correlations of spei with two wddi products show little discrepancies in the spatial pattern at the same timescale at short timescales 3 months more than half of the world shows a significant moderate correlation in which a few regions show high correlations which are distributed in central and southern north america southern and eastern south america central and southern asia and most of oceania as the timescale increases the number of grids with moderate correlation increases particularly located in central and eastern north america europe and northern and southeastern asia whereas it decreases in northern africa and oceania it should be noted that the correlations in northern north america canada central and western asia and most of africa always stay at a poor level regardless of the increased timescales the sparse observation networks that resulted in poor precision of cru climate data in these regions may contribute to these non significance correlations 4 2 thresholds evaluation by comparing the historical drought area we have measured the monthly global drought area percentages of different drought severities monitored by spei wddi and scpdsi to evaluate the classification thresholds of wddi temporal variation results are shown in fig 3 a little differences are found between the two wddi products thus we only quantified the difference between wddi opt vs spei and wddi opt vs scpdsi in the following quantitative discussion it should be noted that the gap around 2012 is caused by the discontinues of amsr data generally the sum of global drought area detected by wddi is underestimated compared to spei and scpdsi the row marked as d in fig 3a nearly 70 of the months show an absolute deviation 5 between wddi and spei with a relatively larger mae mean absolute error ranging from 6 74 to 7 51 and rmse root mean square error ranging from 7 92 to 8 72 the deviation between wddi and scpdsi becomes larger owing to the increased mae ranging from 10 1 to 10 77 and rmse ranging from 11 16 to 11 79 the underestimation of the sum of drought area may bring by the discrepancies found in detecting the areas that suffered abnormally dry d0 or moderate drought d1 however the deviation has been controlled as the drought severity increased to d2 d3 or d4 with low mae and rmse results of 2 5 fig 3b it should not be ignored that wddi shows similar fluctuation characteristics to spei results especially at short and medium timescales this indicates the consistency of indices in identifying the oscillation of dry or wet periods over the globe for example both scpdsi spei and wddi at medium timescales show a wet trend in the period of 2002 to 2004 as well as 2012 to 2014 owing to a decline in global drought area percentages especially in drought with the categories of d0 d1 d2 seasonality features are found in the wddi time series results the reason may be the combined effects of the realistic existing seasonalities and the underestimated drought area percentages which are caused by the missing values in djf frozen areas of amsr vpd product 4 3 investigation of the applicable scenarios for wddi we further evaluated the sensitivities of wddi to meteorological agricultural and hydrological drought signals by comparing it with other single drought indices including vsmci vci and rci this would help us understand the applicable scenarios of wddi as mentioned above owing to the lack of a standard definition and ground truth observations an inter comparison between the developed index and other drought indices is an expedient evaluation the maximum correlations of spei and wddi opt with the three indices for specific land cover types and climatic zones were obtained fig 4 a and the corresponding timescales were also recorded fig 4b vsmci produces stronger correlations with wddi01 than spei in almost all climatic regions and land cover types implying that wddi01 is more suitable than spei for monitoring short term drought represented by surface soil moisture vci generally shows higher correlations with wddi than spei in the climate regions of equatorial af am aw hot arid bwh bsh and mediterranean cwa cwb while lower correlations in the other climate regions however the gap between the correlation of spei and wddi with vci is narrow note that in energy limited regions the decreased spei and wddi may cause an increase in et and further promote the growth of vegetation leading to a negative correlation between spei and wddi with vci these negative correlations are found in the climate regions of ds dw and dfc dfd the poor correlation between spei and vci is consistent with the research by liu et al 2018 which used the cru ts based spei and modis based net primary production npp the overall low correlations between wddi and spei with vci suggest that both spei and wddi may not be suitable for monitoring vegetation or agricultural drought rci generally exhibits stronger correlations with long term spei spei06 spei09 spei12 than wddi mainly because the global grid runoff data used to build the rci dataset is generated based on the precipitation and temperature data which are the constituent variables of spei even so wddi at long timescales 6 month shows a moderate correlation with rci in most parts of the world indicating that wddi is capable of monitoring hydrological drought 4 4 performance of wddi in monitoring specific drought events the advantage of remote sensing drought index in global drought monitoring is well emphasized in the results of fig 5 and figure s3 both two wddi01 products capture drought features similar to spei01 and vsmci fig 5 for example the drought in russia june to august 2010 southern america april to june 2011 europe april 2011 eastern asia june december 2010 however in south america and africa they show different results wddi01 monitors the remarkable drought that occurred in south america from june to december 2010 as well as the drought in africa in october 2010 and april 2011 but spei does not similar drought results are obtained by wddi06 and spei figure s3 such as the europe drought june to december 2015 the south africa drought october 2015 to february 2016 and the eastern asia drought august to october 2015 drought in south america is also captured by both but spei shows discontinuous drought patches especially in the month of april to june 2016 we then applied wddi in two specific drought events which represent seasonal drought and long term drought that occurred in the area with dense meteorological observation sites respectively time series of wddi06 spei06 scpdsi and vci from 2002 to 2017 were compared besides the detailed evolution characteristics of drought monitored by different indices during the specific drought period were exhibited through a heat map 4 4 1 the 2010 russian drought at the end of june 2010 russia was hit by a devastating drought due to a persistent blocking anticyclone over european russia the exceptional drought accompanied by widespread wildfires caused a serious loss of crop yield the caspian sea level has also been affected decreasing by about 27 to 28 cm arpe et al 2012 here we choose the volga basin as the study area fig 6 a which suffered the most from drought the time series results for the volga basin are shown in fig 6b and it demonstrates the ability of wddi to capture the 2010 drought event in the volga basin the correlation coefficients between wddi06 spei06 and scpdsi are all above 0 7 which proves the good consistency between these indices fig 6c shows the evolution pattern of the drought event from january 2010 to december 2010 the hydrological background exhibits that the tws of the volga has been a negative anomaly since january 2010 for the whole year wddi01 provides the earliest warning in march and more similar to vsmci it captures the same onset time for meteorological drought in april which is also earlier than other indices june for spei01 july for scpdsi the persistent blocking anticyclone leads to the cloudless sky influencing the formation process of precipitation continued precipitation anomaly triggers spei01 to show the information of drought occurrence in june which is delayed for two months compared to wddi01 and vsmci both wddi01 and spei01 show that meteorological drought exacerbates to the worst in july owing to the greatest gap between water supply maximum negative anomaly of precipitation and demand maximum positive anomaly of vpd but they show disagreement on the judgment of the recovery time spei01 shows the earliest recovery signal of meteorological drought in august due to the near normal precipitation however wddi01 shows a lagging recovery signal in september because of the continued thermal stress the monitoring results of scpdsi and vsmci are even later precipitation temperature vpd and vsm gradually recover to normal in october which implies the gradual disappearance of meteorological drought wddi01 shows a similar diagnosis to spei01 the ecological system starts to respond to the extreme meteorological condition in july and then it continues to worsen until august these features are miss captured by the spei and wddi at medium timescales drought signal propagates to the hydrological system in may according to the results of wddi at long timescales which is also earlier than the result of spei july however spei and wddi have made a consistent judgment on the end time of hydrological drought that is it will continue and is expected to last until the next year 4 4 2 the 2012 2016 california drought the 2012 2016 drought event in california is the most severe drought over the last millennium resulting from both anomalously negative precipitation and positive temperature griffin and anchukaitis 2014 the continuous drought has put tremendous pressure on the regional water resources especially on groundwater which has been well documented asner et al 2016 stampoulis et al 2019 thomas et al 2017 the reason for choosing it as a case is to give an insight into the difference in long term drought or hydrological drought monitoring between scpdsi spei and wddi the time series results in california are shown in fig 7 b and good correlations between spei06 wddi06 and scpdsi are observed r 0 65 for the long term drought event wddi06 shows excellent consistency with spei06 and vci at the beginning 2012 2013 yet a big difference in the middle period especially in 2015 therefore we focus on the years from january 2014 to december 2015 we exhibited the evolution patterns to give a glimpse of drought conditions in the middle period of this long term event fig 7c wddi opt generally shows a tiny difference with wddi vpa but obvious differences with others both spei01 wddi01 and vsmci capture the multiple recurrences of meteorological drought but they show differences in identifying the duration and severity especially for the drought that occurs from january to april 2015 spei01 seems to be more affected by precipitation given that spei01 mostly shows a normal or humid condition regardless of the high positive temperature anomaly when the precipitation anomaly is close to 0 or 0 on the contrary wddi01 is mainly influenced by vpd according to vci results the vegetation shows the most severe drought stress in 2014 from june to september probably attributes to a delayed response to the negative anomaly in surface soil moisture this feature is also failed captured by the medium timescales spei and wddi since water deficit condition in the surface soil compartment is generally slight during the two years the continued negative tws anomaly indicates a massive deficit of deep soil water and groundwater which may contribute to the discrepancy between wddi09 and spei09 as well as wddi12 and spei12 spei12 shows a recovery signal of hydrological drought in december 2014 but wddi12 does not wddi at long timescales may be more suitable for long term drought or hydrological drought monitoring owing to its incorporation of water deficit information of deep soil water content and groundwater 5 discussions 5 1 the connection between vpd and meteorological drought the strong connection between vpd and meteorological drought is the key for the short timescale wddi to monitor meteorological drought however the former studies have not been deeply investigated yet generally the stable dry conditions that lead to meteorological drought associated with large scale atmospheric ridging often result in extremely warm temperatures the 2010 russian drought which has been studied as a case of flash drought christian et al 2020 is a good example of a drought caused by an extreme heatwave wddi01 which is dominated by vpd provides the earliest warning in march it also captures an earlier onset signal of meteorological drought similar to the vsmci result which may be attributed to the synergistic response of vpd and vsm to the thermal stress caused by the remarkable temperature anomaly on the contrary indices based on precipitation failed to characterize thermal stress during this heatwave event we further analyzed the relationship between spi01 and spei01 with vpd by using era5 data instead of cru and amsr owing to its long time series 40 years 1980 2019 to provide more substantial evidence of connections between vpd and meteorological drought a close relationship between vpd and meteorological drought indices has been found in most regions figure s4 the negative correlation between spei01 and vpd z has been emphasized again on the climate scale fig 8 interestingly the sensitivity of vpd z to the decreased spei varies across climate zones vpd z responds to spei01 rapidly in most of the climate zones which accounts for 71 of the land excluded polar climate in the remaining climate zones mainly located in high latitudes vpd z shows a relatively slower response rate to spei01 5 2 factors that influence wddi evaluation it is important to note that several factors affect the evaluation of the wddi first is the accuracy of cru precipitation and temperature data little stations can be found in africa south america and high latitude regions harris et al 2020 which affects the accuracy of cru precipitation and temperature data and further affects the weights training and the comparison results the poor accuracy of the amsr vsm product over higher vegetation biomass areas including forests is also found due to the loss of soil sensitivity these contribute to the insignificant or poor correlations between wddi and spei with vsmci in tropical regions with climate zone of af aw am and land cover of ebf osh and high latitude regions the second is the available length of data for tws and vpd is too short the determination of the drought category thresholds depends on the distribution of the historical values spei and scpdsi show a relatively dry spell in the world from 2002 to 2017 compared to the conditions over the past 100 years which is not exhibited by wddi figure s5 the short data length of tws and vpd that cannot capture the complete oscillations between dry and wet spells of the world may contribute to the suboptimal thresholds and further lead to the underestimation of drought area percentages however with the stable operation of satellites in orbit the shortcoming of short time series will be overcome gradually 5 3 advantages and limitations of wddi note that we do not emphasize that the new index is designed to be a single and best indicator to monitor drought the combination of tws and vpd provides a panoptic photograph of water conditions in spac a drought event in spac is either attributed entirely by a deficiency in tws or superfluities in vpd or by partial contributions from both this is determined by the complex relationship between tws and vpd generally the increased vpd leads to a decrease in tws and vice versa fig 6 however the accompanying relationship is not absolute vegetations may close their stomata and reduce evapotranspiration in response to high vpd in addition tws may also decrease independently of the vpd variations due to the anthropogenic effects fig 7 analyses of changes in tws and vpd help to the attribution of drought events besides both tws and vpd can be obtained from satellite observations which means wddi does not rely on station observations and reanalysis data the advantage of data collection platforms contributes to its capability of drought monitoring on a global scale another advantage is that wddi can be operated at different timescales at a short timescale wddi is sensitive to meteorological drought for example the wddi01 results in fig 6 and fig 7 when it operates at a long timescale it captures the continued long term water deficit condition for example the wddi12 results in fig 6 and fig 7 these results imply that practitioners can better understand the drought state at different timescales and the mechanism of drought propagation between meteorological and hydrological systems by using the new index alone the weights in wddi are determined by the correlation between tws and vpd with spei which is a commonly used method with straightforward calculation hao et al 2015 guo et al 2019 son et al 2021 generally the weight of tws is gradually increasing as the timescale increases under all climate conditions fig 1 however given that spei does not consider the human induced groundwater deficit information tws is expected to always have a poor correlation with spei in some regions where tws changes are dominated by human activities mainly irrigation to explore the impact of human irrigation on tws weights we chose two basins in china for comparison figure s6 one is the haihe basin where irrigation mainly depends on groundwater resulting in groundwater overexploitation and long term decreased tws trend the other is the adjacent huaihe basin where irrigation mainly depends on surface water wddi09 shows consistent changes with tws z in the huaihe basin while remarkable differences in the haihe basin which indicate the dominant and negligible role of tws in the long term wddi over huaihe and haihe respectively therefore it should be cautious when applying wddi in the regions where tws shows a long term decreasing trend solely driven by human exploitation of groundwater according to previous studies the haihe basin in china and ganges basin in india are the representatives of these regions rodell et al 2018 rodell et al 2009 6 conclusions this study developed a remote sensing composite drought index wddi by combining tws and vpd to provide the integrated water deficit information in spac two different weight schemes including the constrained optimization method and the vpa method were selected to determine the weights of tws and vpd by adjusting the weights between components wddi is endowed with a multiscalar capability similar to spi or spei which allows it to operate at short or long timescales the global multiscalar spei standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index from 2002 to 2011 and 2012 to 2017 were selected to train and assess the weights respectively weight assessment results showed moderate correlations 0 4 r p 0 05 between wddi and spei over the global particularly higher correlations 0 50 r 0 88 p 0 05 in the summer season little difference was observed between wddi products from the two schemes furthermore the drought classification thresholds were evaluated through a comparative analysis of historical drought area statistics detected by spei scpdsi and wddi and good agreements were found in the area statistics of severe to exceptional droughts to investigate the applicable scenarios of wddi we selected three indices including vsmci vci and rci to evaluate the sensitivity of wddi to water stress signals in meteorological agricultural and hydrological systems the short timescale wddi was evaluated to be good at monitoring meteorological drought while the long timescale wddi was good at hydrological drought finally the comparison results of the indices application in typical drought events emphasized the considerable sensitivity of wddi to meteorological drought signals and the unique superiority of considering groundwater

2689,drought is known as a complex natural phenomenon because of its multifaceted effect on the environment composite drought indices have been considered a useful tool to capture the compound drought impacts however few of them are capable of operating at multi timescales moreover the vast of composite drought indices fail to depict the whole water deficit on terrestrial because of the ignoring of groundwater in this study we linearly combined two satellite observed variables tws terrestrial water storage and vpd vapor pressure deficit to develop a new index wddi water deficit drought index it can provide the global composite drought conditions at multi timescales by different weight combinations the global multiscalar spei standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index from 2002 to 2011 and 2012 to 2017 were selected to train and assess the weights respectively weights assessment results showed that spei and wddi reached moderate correlations r 0 4 over the globe especially stronger in the summer season 0 5 r 0 88 good agreements between wddi and scpdsi self calibrated palmer drought severity index spei were found in the global historical drought area statistics especially in area statistics of severe or worse drought conditions wddi at short and long timescales were found to be sensitive to drought signals in the meteorological and hydrological system respectively as it produced moderate or stronger correlations with vsmci volumetric soil moisture condition index and rci runoff condition index in most parts of the world the application of wddi in the specific drought events the 2010 russian drought and the 2012 2016 california drought further reinforced the above inferences and revealed the unique superiority of considering groundwater deficit in hydrological drought monitoring the new proposed multiscalar wddi could help practitioners better identify the drought conditions and understand the drought propagation mechanism from the meteorological to the hydrological system keywords drought indicator water deficit drought index drought monitoring terrestrial water storage vapor pressure deficit data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought a common natural disaster caused by regional abnormalities in the global water cycle has always been a highly concerned topic for the scientific community aghakouchak et al 2015 lewis et al 2011 livneh and badger 2020 xu et al 2019 it poses a significant threat to the available water resources and food security frappart et al 2012 castle et al 2014 under future warmer climates the occurrence of drought has been projected to increase by several studies dai 2012 sheffield and wood 2007 dai et al 2018 lu et al 2019 pokhrel et al 2021 this urges humans to build a drought early warning and monitoring system to transform a reactive society that responds to impacts into a proactive society that is resilient and adapted to drought risk pendergrass et al 2020 which will put forward higher requirements for the design of the drought index as it can quantify the severity and spatial extent of the drought by numerical values drought events can be classified into four types which include meteorological agricultural hydrological and socio economic drought mishra and singh 2010 generally the first three represent the drought impact on the atmospheric vegetation and hydrological system respectively which are corresponding to the specific components of the spac soil plant atmosphere continuum however the boundary between drought types is indistinct in reality jiao et al 2019a because of the aggregated attenuated lagged or prolonged drought propagation process van loon et al 2012 ma et al 2019 in other words the impact of drought on the spac system may be multifaceted plenty of drought indices have been developed however most of them only capture the single realm of water condition in the spac system and lead to the problem that a non optimal drought index can depict the multifaceted drought van loon 2015 for example precipitation based indicators may arise incorrect diagnosis if they are applied to reflect the vegetation water stress in well developed irrigation areas owing to the propagation of meteorological drought to agricultural drought can be prevented by human irrigation although practitioners and policymakers can choose a series of single variable drought indices to track the diverse impacts of drought challenges are still existed by the associated diversity of choice and logistically difficulty of accessing information from multiple platforms jiao et al 2019a building a composite or integrated index by combining a series of hydrometeorological variables or different drought indices in either a weighted or a modeled fashion would provide a new path to descript the multifaceted comprehensive impacts of drought hao and aghakouchak 2013 chang et al 2016 shah and mishra 2020 recently the application of remote sensing observations has further promoted the prosperity of research on composite drought monitoring as it overcomes the limitation of sparse station observations that account for the majority of the world igbawua et al 2018 strides have been made by several studies in the past decade which are listed in table 1 however there are still some lacks in the applications of the existing composite drought indices one is that most indices are only suitable for monitoring drought at a fixed inflexible timescale for example the combination of land surface temperature surface soil moisture and precipitation named midi microwave integrated drought index zhang and jia 2013 zhang et al 2019 is proposed for monitoring meteorological drought which only represents the drought condition at a short timescale given that drought events often occur with high frequency and moist periods of short duration at a short timescale while with low frequency and longer duration at a long timescale drought is considered a phenomenon of multi scalar vicente serrano et al 2010a this explains the wide acceptance and recommendation of drought indices that can be calculated at different timescales for instance spi standardized precipitation index mckee et al 1993 and spei standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index vicente serrano et al 2010a on the one hand monitoring of drought at various timescales allows the identification of short term wet periods within long term droughts or short term dry spells within long term wet periods if the indicator shows continued drought conditions at a long timescale policymakers may pay more attention to the sustainable utilization of water resources on the other hand it ensures the indicator tracks the drought propagation process because the response of hydrological systems to precipitation varies as a function of time vicente serrano et al 2010a however spi and spei are meteorological drought indices that do not provide any insight into soil moisture and hydrological drought information in a direct way xu et al 2020 moreover despite a few composite drought indices can operate at flexible timescales they are usually developed at a regional scale with homogenized environmental conditions which limits their applications across a continental scale or a global scale jiao et al 2019b son et al 2021 for example the mcdis multivariable composite drought index are only developed for monitoring the drought that occurred in shandong china in addition the complex and time consuming calculation may also hinder their applications for example the multiscalar spesmi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration and soil moisture index puts forward higher requirements of professional skills in data assimilation for practitioners and policymakers last but most important groundwater would have good potential in quantifying overall water deficits xu et al 2020 while the vast of the indices ignore this compartment as well as others such as surface reservoir river and deep soil which makes them impossible to assess the overall water shortage of the whole spac system therefore our goal is to develop a new remote sensing composite drought index to address the above challenges while taking into account the ability of multiscalar drought monitoring the index must consider as few variables as possible to reduce the calculation complexity the combination of tws terrestrial water storage and vpd vapor pressure deficit offers the chance to achieve the goal tws represents the column integrated water stored on land including canopy despite this portion being negligible surface water soil groundwater and snow and has been proved to be good at large scale hydrological drought monitoring yirdaw et al 2008 chen et al 2009 frappart et al 2012 long et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 sinha et al 2019 vpd defined as the difference between saturated and actual atmospheric vapor pressures for a given temperature directly represents the water required for the atmosphere to reach saturation atmospheric thirsty several studies have found its potential in the meteorological drought early detection and prediction behrangi et al 2015 behrangi et al 2016 farahmand et al 2015 aghakouchak et al 2015 farahmand et al 2021 more important droughts on short timescales are mainly related to soil moisture content vicente serrano et al 2010a which means the high frequency of its changes monthly vpd has a higher frequency of change in comparison to tws and has a close coupling relationship with surface soil moisture seneviratne et al 2010 liu et al 2020a indicating the potential of vpd tws in monitoring drought at a short long timescale therefore the combination of tws and vpd is expected to be good in describing the composite water deficit condition of the spac system at short long timescales if the greater weight are assigned to vpd tws in this study we aim to combine tws and vpd to build a new index named wddi water deficit drought index through a linearly weighted method the constrained optimization method guo et al 2019 hao et al 2015 and the newly proposed vpa vector projection analysis son et al 2021 method were selected to integrate the components the performance of the new index would be evaluated by traditional drought indices including scpdsi self calibrating palmer drought severity index palmer 1965 multiscalar spei vsmci volumetric soil moisture condition index vci vegetation condition index and rci runoff condition index respectively 2 data 2 1 tws observation from grace since the grace gravity recovery and climate experiment mission has been launched in march 2002 it brought a new era that enlightened our view of the quantified trend and fluctuation of terrestrial water storage with an accuracy approaching 2 cm tapley et al 2019 in this study we used the monthly jpl jet propulsion laboratory mascon solutions rl06m mscnv02 for the period from june 2002 to june 2017 the values of missing months were filled by linear interpolation the raw data is represented on a half degree grid with a coarse native spatial resolution of 3 degrees it should be noted that grace provides the terrestrial water storage anomaly but not the absolute magnitude estimates 2 2 vpd and vsm observations from lpdrv2 0 the lpdr v2 0 version 2 0 university of montana land parameter data record retrieved from amsr advanced microwave scanning radiometer and amsr2 advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 sensors is a 25 km global daily record of key terrestrial environmental parameters including open water fraction surface air temperature vertically integrated atmospheric water vapor vegetation optical depth near surface vpd and vsm volumetric soil moisture du et al 2017 du et al 2018 it has already been applied in several drought monitoring studies brandt et al 2018 du et al 2019 tian et al 2018 in this study the ascending vpd and vsm products were chosen daily vpd and vsm with a timespan consistent with grace were averaged into monthly composite data and resampled to a half degree respectively 2 3 vegetation observation from modis the global monthly vegetation information mod13c2 observed by modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer from june 2002 to june 2017 was downloaded from the laads the level 1 and atmosphere archive distribution system daac distributed active archive center the ndvi normalized difference vegetation index data was chosen to construct the vegetation based drought index vci with a half degree resolution 2 4 global gridded runoff estimation the global monthly gridded runoff data from june 2002 to december 2014 with a half degree resolution was obtained from https figshare com articles dataset grun global runoff reconstruction 9228176 it was predicted by a machine learning algorithm based on antecedent precipitation and temperature from an atmospheric reanalysis ghiggi et al 2019 2 5 drought indices datasets the monthly multiscalar spei from june 2002 to june 2017 were obtained from the csic institutional repository of the spanish national research council including 1 month spei 3 month spei 6 month spei 9 month spei and 12 month spei marked as spei01 spei03 spei06 spei09 and spei12 respectively the spatial resolution of the spei database speibase v2 6 is half degree vicente serrano et al 2010b it was calculated utilizing the global gridded cru climate research unit ts 4 03 monthly dataset fao 56 penman monteith was selected to estimate potential evapotranspiration in spei calculation similarly we also selected a monthly scpdsi dataset provided by the cru with the same period and spatial resolution the scpdsi runs from january 1901 to december 2017 driven by a preliminary version of the cru ts 3 26 monthly climate dataset hartfield et al 2018 van der schrier et al 2013 besides we used the cru ts 4 03 monthly climate data from 1980 to 2018 to calculate the precipitation and temperature anomalies only precipitation and temperature anomalies from 2010 to 2015 were used in the analysis 2 6 ancillary data given the impact of the climate on the determination of weights we used the climate zone data köppen geiger climate classification to train the weights for each climate zone climate zone data was supported by beck et al 2018 according to its scheme the globe has been divided into 30 climate zones with different climatic characteristics such as dry summer or wet hot summer or cold however in its half degree gridded dataset two climate zones csc and cwc were excluded we also excluded the climate zone ef because it is characterized as polar and frost figure s1 shows the spatial patterns and area statistics of climate zones to investigate the relationship between meteorological drought and vpd over a longer time series 1980 2019 40 years variables including precipitation potential evaporation dew point temperature and air temperature were obtained from era5 european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis v5 3 development of wddi 3 1 calculation of wddi since grace tws supported by jpl is the anomaly data relative to the 2004 2009 time mean baseline we first removed the corresponding time mean baseline from vpd data then the standardized z scores tws and vpd were calculated as follows 1 x z i j x i j x i σ i where x i j is tws or vpd for the month i ranges from 0 to 12 and year j ranges from 2002 to 2017 x i and σ i are the 15 year mean and standard deviation of tws or vpd for month i for tws z the negative value represents a drought condition while for vpd z is wet wddi is defined as a linear weighted result of t w s z and v p d z eq 2 two weight determination methods the constrained optimization method guo et al 2019 hao et al 2015 and the newly proposed vpa vector projection analysis son et al 2021 method were selected to estimate α and β the multiscalar spei including spei01 spei03 spei06 spei09 and spei12 were chose as the target which is a common way in the composite drought index development liu et al 2020b guo et al 2019 meng et al 2016 hao et al 2015 because of the none absolute realistic drought measurement choosing the traditional drought index provides an expedient solution 2 wddi i j α t w s z ij β v p d z i j in the constrained optimization scheme the α and β sets were iteratively estimated by computing the correlation between temporary wddi and spei with the value of α varying from 0 to 1 in steps of 0 01 the optimal α and β were determined when the maximum correlation was obtained eq 3 note that α and β both follow the rule of eq 4 3 f s p e i wddi t m a x c o r r s p e i wddi t 4 0 α 1 0 β 1 α β 1 where f s p e i wddi t represents the function to find the maximum pearson correlation between spei and wddi t wddi t is the temporary wddi calculated with a specific set of α and β in the vpa scheme α and β were estimated similarly by correlation but did not need to look for the maximum correlation iteratively instead correlation coefficient values between the tws z and vpd z with spei were first used as vector components to determine the direction of wddi 5 wddidirection c o r r s p e i t w s z c o r r s p e i v p d z c o r r s p e i t w s z 2 corr s p e i v p d z 2 an orthogonal projection of observed anomaly values onto the wddi direction was then used to calculate wddi because the direction was determined as a unit vector with a magnitude always equal to 1 the orthogonal projection onto the unit vector was equal to the inner product between the wddi direction and the observation vector the inner product was further formed as a linear weighted combination in which weights directly come from the correlation coefficients more detail about the vpa method can be obtained from son et al 2021 because of the discontinues between amsr e and amsr2 observations spei and corresponding t w s z and v p d z values from 2002 to 2011 were used to train the weights for two schemes furthermore we considered the effects of climate zone and seasonal changes on weight therefore weights for different seasons and climate zone were trained in this step the correlation coefficient was required according to the above methods only the correlation value that passed the significance test was retained as the final weight value for a grid for each climate zone climate average weights were calculated using the retained significant correlation values and then they were assigned to the grids with no weight values 3 2 classification of wddi according to the seasonal α and β we finally produced two wddi products signed as wddi opt and wddi vpa drought severities were designated as d0 abnormally dry d1 moderate drought d2 severe drought d3 extreme drought and d4 exceptional drought the thresholds used to assess drought severity were then calculated according to the probability standard of spi and spei that is 0 06 for exceptional drought 2 3 for extreme drought 4 4 for severe drought 9 2 for moderate drought and 24 for abnormally dry of the time the threshold results were shown in table 2 3 3 evaluation of wddi values of spei from the rest of the period july 2012 june 2017 were used for weights verification first correlation coefficients were calculated between global mean spei values and corresponding wddi values at multi timescales for each season to evaluate the classification thresholds of wddi the global historical drought area percentages detected by scpdsi multiscalar spei and multiscalar wddi were compared we chose these two indices as metrics because of their widely accepted and used thresholds to investigate the applicable scenarios of wddi we selected three indices including vsmci vci and rci to evaluate the sensitivity of wddi to water stress signals in meteorological agricultural and hydrological systems vsmci is reasonable as a metric for assessing short term drought caused by meteorological conditions since the soil moisture observed from amsr only reflects the top soil dryness vci and rci represent the vegetation or agricultural drought and hydrological drought respectively vsmci and rci were calculated according to eq 1 while vci was calculated according to bento et al 2020 in addition two cases which represent the seasonal drought the 2010 russian drought and prolonged drought the 2012 2016 california drought that occurred in regions with dense stations were applied to examine the application performance of wddi 4 results 4 1 weights variation and assessment the rationale behind the multiscalar wddi is that we assume vpd tws plays a dominant role in monitoring drought at a short long timescale due to its higher lower frequency of variations results of weights changing over timescales support our hypothesis fig 1 whether it is the scheme that uses the constrained optimization method fig 1a or the vpa method fig 1b α is much smaller than β at short timescales and it is gradually increasing to be greater than β as the timescale increases the feature of weights varying over timescales is more prominent in fig 1a because the sum of α and β is constrained to the numerical one the changes in correlations between vpd z and tws z with spei at different timescales provide an explanation generally vpd z tws z has a gradually decreased increased correlation with spei as the timescale increases figure s2 these results imply that the weights can play a role as a controller to make wddi adaptive to different application scenarios table 3 shows the weights assessment results in most cases the correlations between wddi opt and spei are greater than that between wddi vpa and spei besides correlations vary from seasons and timescales in spring mam moderate correlations were observed at timescales of 1 month 9 month and 12 month implying the consistency between spei and wddi at short and long timescales weights in summer produce the best performance for wddi at all timescales except for 12 month wddi generally has a correlation of nearly 0 5 with spei in autumn son and winter djf with the highest correlation obtained at timescales of 6 month in autumn and 12 month in winter in general spei and wddi reach a moderate r 0 4 correlation which preliminarily proves the reliability of weights at the global scale fig 2 the correlations of spei with two wddi products show little discrepancies in the spatial pattern at the same timescale at short timescales 3 months more than half of the world shows a significant moderate correlation in which a few regions show high correlations which are distributed in central and southern north america southern and eastern south america central and southern asia and most of oceania as the timescale increases the number of grids with moderate correlation increases particularly located in central and eastern north america europe and northern and southeastern asia whereas it decreases in northern africa and oceania it should be noted that the correlations in northern north america canada central and western asia and most of africa always stay at a poor level regardless of the increased timescales the sparse observation networks that resulted in poor precision of cru climate data in these regions may contribute to these non significance correlations 4 2 thresholds evaluation by comparing the historical drought area we have measured the monthly global drought area percentages of different drought severities monitored by spei wddi and scpdsi to evaluate the classification thresholds of wddi temporal variation results are shown in fig 3 a little differences are found between the two wddi products thus we only quantified the difference between wddi opt vs spei and wddi opt vs scpdsi in the following quantitative discussion it should be noted that the gap around 2012 is caused by the discontinues of amsr data generally the sum of global drought area detected by wddi is underestimated compared to spei and scpdsi the row marked as d in fig 3a nearly 70 of the months show an absolute deviation 5 between wddi and spei with a relatively larger mae mean absolute error ranging from 6 74 to 7 51 and rmse root mean square error ranging from 7 92 to 8 72 the deviation between wddi and scpdsi becomes larger owing to the increased mae ranging from 10 1 to 10 77 and rmse ranging from 11 16 to 11 79 the underestimation of the sum of drought area may bring by the discrepancies found in detecting the areas that suffered abnormally dry d0 or moderate drought d1 however the deviation has been controlled as the drought severity increased to d2 d3 or d4 with low mae and rmse results of 2 5 fig 3b it should not be ignored that wddi shows similar fluctuation characteristics to spei results especially at short and medium timescales this indicates the consistency of indices in identifying the oscillation of dry or wet periods over the globe for example both scpdsi spei and wddi at medium timescales show a wet trend in the period of 2002 to 2004 as well as 2012 to 2014 owing to a decline in global drought area percentages especially in drought with the categories of d0 d1 d2 seasonality features are found in the wddi time series results the reason may be the combined effects of the realistic existing seasonalities and the underestimated drought area percentages which are caused by the missing values in djf frozen areas of amsr vpd product 4 3 investigation of the applicable scenarios for wddi we further evaluated the sensitivities of wddi to meteorological agricultural and hydrological drought signals by comparing it with other single drought indices including vsmci vci and rci this would help us understand the applicable scenarios of wddi as mentioned above owing to the lack of a standard definition and ground truth observations an inter comparison between the developed index and other drought indices is an expedient evaluation the maximum correlations of spei and wddi opt with the three indices for specific land cover types and climatic zones were obtained fig 4 a and the corresponding timescales were also recorded fig 4b vsmci produces stronger correlations with wddi01 than spei in almost all climatic regions and land cover types implying that wddi01 is more suitable than spei for monitoring short term drought represented by surface soil moisture vci generally shows higher correlations with wddi than spei in the climate regions of equatorial af am aw hot arid bwh bsh and mediterranean cwa cwb while lower correlations in the other climate regions however the gap between the correlation of spei and wddi with vci is narrow note that in energy limited regions the decreased spei and wddi may cause an increase in et and further promote the growth of vegetation leading to a negative correlation between spei and wddi with vci these negative correlations are found in the climate regions of ds dw and dfc dfd the poor correlation between spei and vci is consistent with the research by liu et al 2018 which used the cru ts based spei and modis based net primary production npp the overall low correlations between wddi and spei with vci suggest that both spei and wddi may not be suitable for monitoring vegetation or agricultural drought rci generally exhibits stronger correlations with long term spei spei06 spei09 spei12 than wddi mainly because the global grid runoff data used to build the rci dataset is generated based on the precipitation and temperature data which are the constituent variables of spei even so wddi at long timescales 6 month shows a moderate correlation with rci in most parts of the world indicating that wddi is capable of monitoring hydrological drought 4 4 performance of wddi in monitoring specific drought events the advantage of remote sensing drought index in global drought monitoring is well emphasized in the results of fig 5 and figure s3 both two wddi01 products capture drought features similar to spei01 and vsmci fig 5 for example the drought in russia june to august 2010 southern america april to june 2011 europe april 2011 eastern asia june december 2010 however in south america and africa they show different results wddi01 monitors the remarkable drought that occurred in south america from june to december 2010 as well as the drought in africa in october 2010 and april 2011 but spei does not similar drought results are obtained by wddi06 and spei figure s3 such as the europe drought june to december 2015 the south africa drought october 2015 to february 2016 and the eastern asia drought august to october 2015 drought in south america is also captured by both but spei shows discontinuous drought patches especially in the month of april to june 2016 we then applied wddi in two specific drought events which represent seasonal drought and long term drought that occurred in the area with dense meteorological observation sites respectively time series of wddi06 spei06 scpdsi and vci from 2002 to 2017 were compared besides the detailed evolution characteristics of drought monitored by different indices during the specific drought period were exhibited through a heat map 4 4 1 the 2010 russian drought at the end of june 2010 russia was hit by a devastating drought due to a persistent blocking anticyclone over european russia the exceptional drought accompanied by widespread wildfires caused a serious loss of crop yield the caspian sea level has also been affected decreasing by about 27 to 28 cm arpe et al 2012 here we choose the volga basin as the study area fig 6 a which suffered the most from drought the time series results for the volga basin are shown in fig 6b and it demonstrates the ability of wddi to capture the 2010 drought event in the volga basin the correlation coefficients between wddi06 spei06 and scpdsi are all above 0 7 which proves the good consistency between these indices fig 6c shows the evolution pattern of the drought event from january 2010 to december 2010 the hydrological background exhibits that the tws of the volga has been a negative anomaly since january 2010 for the whole year wddi01 provides the earliest warning in march and more similar to vsmci it captures the same onset time for meteorological drought in april which is also earlier than other indices june for spei01 july for scpdsi the persistent blocking anticyclone leads to the cloudless sky influencing the formation process of precipitation continued precipitation anomaly triggers spei01 to show the information of drought occurrence in june which is delayed for two months compared to wddi01 and vsmci both wddi01 and spei01 show that meteorological drought exacerbates to the worst in july owing to the greatest gap between water supply maximum negative anomaly of precipitation and demand maximum positive anomaly of vpd but they show disagreement on the judgment of the recovery time spei01 shows the earliest recovery signal of meteorological drought in august due to the near normal precipitation however wddi01 shows a lagging recovery signal in september because of the continued thermal stress the monitoring results of scpdsi and vsmci are even later precipitation temperature vpd and vsm gradually recover to normal in october which implies the gradual disappearance of meteorological drought wddi01 shows a similar diagnosis to spei01 the ecological system starts to respond to the extreme meteorological condition in july and then it continues to worsen until august these features are miss captured by the spei and wddi at medium timescales drought signal propagates to the hydrological system in may according to the results of wddi at long timescales which is also earlier than the result of spei july however spei and wddi have made a consistent judgment on the end time of hydrological drought that is it will continue and is expected to last until the next year 4 4 2 the 2012 2016 california drought the 2012 2016 drought event in california is the most severe drought over the last millennium resulting from both anomalously negative precipitation and positive temperature griffin and anchukaitis 2014 the continuous drought has put tremendous pressure on the regional water resources especially on groundwater which has been well documented asner et al 2016 stampoulis et al 2019 thomas et al 2017 the reason for choosing it as a case is to give an insight into the difference in long term drought or hydrological drought monitoring between scpdsi spei and wddi the time series results in california are shown in fig 7 b and good correlations between spei06 wddi06 and scpdsi are observed r 0 65 for the long term drought event wddi06 shows excellent consistency with spei06 and vci at the beginning 2012 2013 yet a big difference in the middle period especially in 2015 therefore we focus on the years from january 2014 to december 2015 we exhibited the evolution patterns to give a glimpse of drought conditions in the middle period of this long term event fig 7c wddi opt generally shows a tiny difference with wddi vpa but obvious differences with others both spei01 wddi01 and vsmci capture the multiple recurrences of meteorological drought but they show differences in identifying the duration and severity especially for the drought that occurs from january to april 2015 spei01 seems to be more affected by precipitation given that spei01 mostly shows a normal or humid condition regardless of the high positive temperature anomaly when the precipitation anomaly is close to 0 or 0 on the contrary wddi01 is mainly influenced by vpd according to vci results the vegetation shows the most severe drought stress in 2014 from june to september probably attributes to a delayed response to the negative anomaly in surface soil moisture this feature is also failed captured by the medium timescales spei and wddi since water deficit condition in the surface soil compartment is generally slight during the two years the continued negative tws anomaly indicates a massive deficit of deep soil water and groundwater which may contribute to the discrepancy between wddi09 and spei09 as well as wddi12 and spei12 spei12 shows a recovery signal of hydrological drought in december 2014 but wddi12 does not wddi at long timescales may be more suitable for long term drought or hydrological drought monitoring owing to its incorporation of water deficit information of deep soil water content and groundwater 5 discussions 5 1 the connection between vpd and meteorological drought the strong connection between vpd and meteorological drought is the key for the short timescale wddi to monitor meteorological drought however the former studies have not been deeply investigated yet generally the stable dry conditions that lead to meteorological drought associated with large scale atmospheric ridging often result in extremely warm temperatures the 2010 russian drought which has been studied as a case of flash drought christian et al 2020 is a good example of a drought caused by an extreme heatwave wddi01 which is dominated by vpd provides the earliest warning in march it also captures an earlier onset signal of meteorological drought similar to the vsmci result which may be attributed to the synergistic response of vpd and vsm to the thermal stress caused by the remarkable temperature anomaly on the contrary indices based on precipitation failed to characterize thermal stress during this heatwave event we further analyzed the relationship between spi01 and spei01 with vpd by using era5 data instead of cru and amsr owing to its long time series 40 years 1980 2019 to provide more substantial evidence of connections between vpd and meteorological drought a close relationship between vpd and meteorological drought indices has been found in most regions figure s4 the negative correlation between spei01 and vpd z has been emphasized again on the climate scale fig 8 interestingly the sensitivity of vpd z to the decreased spei varies across climate zones vpd z responds to spei01 rapidly in most of the climate zones which accounts for 71 of the land excluded polar climate in the remaining climate zones mainly located in high latitudes vpd z shows a relatively slower response rate to spei01 5 2 factors that influence wddi evaluation it is important to note that several factors affect the evaluation of the wddi first is the accuracy of cru precipitation and temperature data little stations can be found in africa south america and high latitude regions harris et al 2020 which affects the accuracy of cru precipitation and temperature data and further affects the weights training and the comparison results the poor accuracy of the amsr vsm product over higher vegetation biomass areas including forests is also found due to the loss of soil sensitivity these contribute to the insignificant or poor correlations between wddi and spei with vsmci in tropical regions with climate zone of af aw am and land cover of ebf osh and high latitude regions the second is the available length of data for tws and vpd is too short the determination of the drought category thresholds depends on the distribution of the historical values spei and scpdsi show a relatively dry spell in the world from 2002 to 2017 compared to the conditions over the past 100 years which is not exhibited by wddi figure s5 the short data length of tws and vpd that cannot capture the complete oscillations between dry and wet spells of the world may contribute to the suboptimal thresholds and further lead to the underestimation of drought area percentages however with the stable operation of satellites in orbit the shortcoming of short time series will be overcome gradually 5 3 advantages and limitations of wddi note that we do not emphasize that the new index is designed to be a single and best indicator to monitor drought the combination of tws and vpd provides a panoptic photograph of water conditions in spac a drought event in spac is either attributed entirely by a deficiency in tws or superfluities in vpd or by partial contributions from both this is determined by the complex relationship between tws and vpd generally the increased vpd leads to a decrease in tws and vice versa fig 6 however the accompanying relationship is not absolute vegetations may close their stomata and reduce evapotranspiration in response to high vpd in addition tws may also decrease independently of the vpd variations due to the anthropogenic effects fig 7 analyses of changes in tws and vpd help to the attribution of drought events besides both tws and vpd can be obtained from satellite observations which means wddi does not rely on station observations and reanalysis data the advantage of data collection platforms contributes to its capability of drought monitoring on a global scale another advantage is that wddi can be operated at different timescales at a short timescale wddi is sensitive to meteorological drought for example the wddi01 results in fig 6 and fig 7 when it operates at a long timescale it captures the continued long term water deficit condition for example the wddi12 results in fig 6 and fig 7 these results imply that practitioners can better understand the drought state at different timescales and the mechanism of drought propagation between meteorological and hydrological systems by using the new index alone the weights in wddi are determined by the correlation between tws and vpd with spei which is a commonly used method with straightforward calculation hao et al 2015 guo et al 2019 son et al 2021 generally the weight of tws is gradually increasing as the timescale increases under all climate conditions fig 1 however given that spei does not consider the human induced groundwater deficit information tws is expected to always have a poor correlation with spei in some regions where tws changes are dominated by human activities mainly irrigation to explore the impact of human irrigation on tws weights we chose two basins in china for comparison figure s6 one is the haihe basin where irrigation mainly depends on groundwater resulting in groundwater overexploitation and long term decreased tws trend the other is the adjacent huaihe basin where irrigation mainly depends on surface water wddi09 shows consistent changes with tws z in the huaihe basin while remarkable differences in the haihe basin which indicate the dominant and negligible role of tws in the long term wddi over huaihe and haihe respectively therefore it should be cautious when applying wddi in the regions where tws shows a long term decreasing trend solely driven by human exploitation of groundwater according to previous studies the haihe basin in china and ganges basin in india are the representatives of these regions rodell et al 2018 rodell et al 2009 6 conclusions this study developed a remote sensing composite drought index wddi by combining tws and vpd to provide the integrated water deficit information in spac two different weight schemes including the constrained optimization method and the vpa method were selected to determine the weights of tws and vpd by adjusting the weights between components wddi is endowed with a multiscalar capability similar to spi or spei which allows it to operate at short or long timescales the global multiscalar spei standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index from 2002 to 2011 and 2012 to 2017 were selected to train and assess the weights respectively weight assessment results showed moderate correlations 0 4 r p 0 05 between wddi and spei over the global particularly higher correlations 0 50 r 0 88 p 0 05 in the summer season little difference was observed between wddi products from the two schemes furthermore the drought classification thresholds were evaluated through a comparative analysis of historical drought area statistics detected by spei scpdsi and wddi and good agreements were found in the area statistics of severe to exceptional droughts to investigate the applicable scenarios of wddi we selected three indices including vsmci vci and rci to evaluate the sensitivity of wddi to water stress signals in meteorological agricultural and hydrological systems the short timescale wddi was evaluated to be good at monitoring meteorological drought while the long timescale wddi was good at hydrological drought finally the comparison results of the indices application in typical drought events emphasized the considerable sensitivity of wddi to meteorological drought signals and the unique superiority of considering groundwater
