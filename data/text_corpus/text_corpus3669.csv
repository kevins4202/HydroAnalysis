p pools by releasing the poly p from the cell during experimental optimization it was observed that two different methods resulted in the highest phosphate release acetate addition at a ph of 4 8 and exposure to edta solution with a concentration of 1 w v treatment with edta resulted in a higher amount of phosphate release from all sludge samples this was characterized by p release of 1 5 2 5 times higher than the control tests in contrast treatments with acetate addition at a low ph exhibited that p release depended upon the types of the sludge samples the highest p release amount and rate were found in highly enriched pao sludge samples but with fewer influences on the sludge collected from wwtp which may be attributed to the lower fraction of paos in the sludge overall the proposed approaches to quantify the poly p concentration can be applied in simple user friendly and cost effective ways graphical abstract image 1 keywords polyphosphate poly p enhanced biological

of forms either in organic or inorganic forms and as a monomer phosphate or as a constituent part of macromolecules polyphosphates referred to poly p enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr has been recognized as the most sustainable and economical process to remove p from wastewater oehmen et al 2007 van loosdrecht et al 1997 ebpr relies on the enrichment of phosphate accumulating organisms paos by alternating anaerobic feast and aerobic or anoxic famine conditions the ebpr process imposes a selective pressure favoring the growth of paos under anaerobic conditions paos are capable of taking up carbon substrates primarily volatile fatty acids vfas and storing them in the form of polyhydroxyalkanoate pha comeau et al 1986 martin et al 2006 mino et al 1998 oehmen et al 2007 wentzel et al 1985 fig 1 a the energy required for this metabolic process is primarily gained from the degradation of intracellular poly p which releases ortho p to the bulk liquid the reduction equivalents for the conversion of vfa into pha are generated through glycolysis of intracellularly stored glycogen in the subsequent aerobic phase paos take up ortho p to recover the poly p level using the stored pha as the energy source glycogen is a key component in pao metabolism poly p is composed of three to several hundred phosphate units fig 1b as indicated above poly p plays a significant role in p storage reservoirs one constitute of nucleic acids and in energy storage for atp formation kulakovskaya et al 2012 serafim et al 2002 the poly p content in sludge is an important parameter to study at a fundamental level including its role in the metabolism of specific pao and the niche differentiation of different pao clades moreover reliable quantification of the poly p content is of great importance to understand process performance and nutrient recovery potential of wastewater treatment systems to investigate the effect of poly p on the metabolism of different types of pao clades in laboratory studies and modelling approaches saia et al 2017 reliable methods for the determination of poly p are needed during the application of ebpr in full scale wastewater treatment systems or nutrient reclamation facilities the p removal capacity of the process can be indicated by the level of poly p content poly p also shows the potential for p recovery using biological and or chemical physical methods to facilitate future studies and optimization of full scale processes developing simple and user friendly methods are required for quantification of intracellular poly p for a comprehensive evaluation of a technique several elements in terms of reliability cost complexity and pre treatment steps should be considered the development of fast simple and feasible poly p analytical and quantitative tools is impending for this researchers need to elucidate the nature of the biochemistry and the roles and dynamics of various phosphorus containing molecules in vitro and in vivo table 1 summarizes the principle advantages and disadvantages of techniques related to poly p quantification the reported techniques have their limitations for poly p quantification in general conventional p analysis methods involve fastidious extraction and pre treatment procedures hupfer et al 2008 includes conversion of poly p to ortho p through chemical digestion followed by ortho p analysis on the other hand due to the strong acid perchloric acid and nitric sulfuric acid etc used during the digestion process all forms of p can be converted to ortho p resulting in overestimation poly p amount most chemical fractionation methods are laborious and not efficient at separation of poly p organic p and precipitated p glycogen plays a role in maximal p release in biological methods brdjanovic et al 1997 1998 welles et al 2015 and for this complicated experimental systems are needed acevedo et al 2012 biological methods have the potential of releasing poly p from the cells but there is a need for methods that uncouple the energy consumption from the consumption of reduction equivalents biological methods can be achieved by creating conditions where cells will use the poly p for maintenance properties by inducing atp consuming processes anaerobic metabolism of paos relies on the hydrolysis of internally stored poly p for atp generation microorganisms exposed to adverse environments consume more energy in order to resist the environmental stress conditions thus inducing greater p release from ebpr cultures fig 1a depicts the mechanism for two potential methods i e edta treatment and acetic acid hac presence at low ph of stress induced energy consumption for poly p quantification by uncoupling hac uptake and p release previous studies liu et al 1996 mino et al 1998 have shown that vfa uptake at low ph causes an uncoupling effect which can uncouple the p release from the vfa uptake and thereby allow rapid release of all biologically available poly p a low ph leads to an accumulation of hac in the cells and subsequent ph decrease which the cell activity tries to counteract by producing extra energy in the form of atp an alternative method is the use of a compound that affects membrane integrity such as ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta and thereby disrupts the proton motive force which the cells try to restore by atp usage derived from poly p the current study focusses on two different methods for poly p quantification i hac addition ii edta presence the principle of poly p quantification relies on uncoupling p release and hac uptake which arise from environmental stresses the objectives of this study were 3 fold 1 to develop easily performable non destructive and cost effective methods to quantify poly p 2 to optimize the experimental procedure including edta concentration reaction time and ph 3 to define and validate the protocol for poly p quantitation using different sludge types 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge sources and characterization to compare the reliability and availability of the proposed methods flocculent sludge fs and granular sludge gs samples were harvested from lab scale and full scale reactors treating domestic sewage 4 different types of samples the samples included gs sample 1 and fs sample 2 collected from pao enriched lab scale ebpr system sample 3 was aerobic gs collected from a full scale nereda plant epe nl and sample 4 was fs collected from a local waste water treatment plant wwtp harnaschpolder in the netherlands after collection of the fresh granules for gs samples from the lab scale sbr reactors or wwtp the granules were instantly and gently rinsed for 2 3 times using tap water for 2 3 min each time on a fine sieve with a mesh aperture of 0 1 mm afterwards a piece of quantitative filter paper was put beneath the fine sieve for 5 min to absorb excessive moisture following this the wet granules were harvested fresh sludge for the flocculent samples was firstly centrifuged at 3000 rpm and the supernatant was decanted then the pellets were rinsed using the same amount of tap water as decanted supernatant for 2 3 min finally we obtained the mixture of biomass pellets and tap water which was sparged with air for mixing 2 2 procedures for poly p determination the procedures for detecting and quantifying poly p are shown in fig 2 the whole process consists of three stages i optimization of pre treatment conditions ii protocol optimization and improvement iii demonstration and validation using wwtp sludge stage i includes three steps step 1 assessed the sensitivity of granular biomass to stress conditions the physical pre treatment resulted in destabilizing the compact structure thereby making the biomass more sensitive to environmental stress step 2 involved the optimization of the concentration of edta and verification of its biodegradability edta is as an ideal aminopolycarboxylic acid chelating agent for this test because it binds with cations calcium magnesium and therefore it avoids chemical precipitation of released ortho p the function of edta in p release in this study was not only to stress the bacteria but also to avoid complete disintegration of the bacteria hence three different levels of edta from low to high concentrations of 0 1 3 mm 1 30 mm and 1 5 50 mm were examined to determine the suitable edta concentration for the experiments previous studies have reported that edta can be utilized as a carbon source specially by enriched bacterial cultures nörtemann 1999 thomas et al 1998 details of the procedures are listed under section 2 3 to demonstrate its biodegradability in the present study we also compared p release with the edta addition under anaerobic and aerobic conditions using gs finally step 3 involved the assessment of the effects of undissociated hac concentrations on p release by adjusting ph in stage ii p release was investigated by the two methods developed from stage i with optimized edta concentration and ph using two types of pao enriched sludge gs and fs a general concern of these tests was potential cell lysis of the microorganisms exposed to the extreme conditions e g presence of vfa at low ph edta or other adverse environments cell lysis could disrupt the stress induced p release response and thereby result in underestimated poly p levels to prevent poly p underestimation as a consequence of cell lysis it was important to assess whether the cells were still active however the extent of cell lysis during batch tests is difficult to evaluate to demonstrate the bacteria were still alive an aerobic p uptake test was performed after the anaerobic test stage ii in the final stage stage iii the sludge collected from full scale installations treating domestic sewage was used to further demonstrate the feasibility of the protocol 2 3 optimization of physical and chemical pre treatment and edta treatment due to the compact matrices of gs the granules were first treated using combined physical methods i e mechanical grinding and sonication to evaluate the effect of the pre treatment as described next for each test 0 15 g fresh wet granules were added to a 50 ml falcon tube containing 20 ml tap water then the sludge water mixture was homogenized for 10 s at 800 w labgen tissue homogenizer cole parmer usa and then subjected to pulsed sonication on ice for 1 min at 36 w edta was then added to the mixture with final concentrations of 0 1 1 and 1 5 w v finally air or n2 were sparged to maintain aerobic or anaerobic conditions respectively for 3 h solution ph was kept constant at ph of 8 0 using 0 1 m naoh samples were taken at 0 and 3 h respectively for ortho p measurement for the control tests the same procedures were carried out without edta addition 2 4 anaerobic p release batch test by edta treatment or acetate addition under various low ph conditions after physical and chemical treatment the optimum concentration of edta for the following anaerobic phosphate release test was chosen given that the prevailing ph of anaerobic phase affects anaerobic metabolism mulkerrins et al 2004 it is important to understand the behaviour of p release at various ph values during acetate addition for each test 2 g of wet gs was transferred into a bottle which was filled with 80 ml of tap water or 80 ml of fs was transferred after rinsing it as described in section 2 1 then the mixture was continually sparged with n2 to maintain the strictly anaerobic conditions the carbon source ch3coona 3h2o was quickly added to obtain a final concentration of 860 mg l 400 mg l cod 6 3 mm welles et al 2015 for the edta test the final concentration of edta was 1 w v 30 mm and the ph was maintained at 8 0 for acetate addition tests the ph was manually controlled at various low ph conditions 4 8 5 5 6 0 6 5 and 7 0 using 1m hcl during stage ii for stage iii the ph values were 4 8 and 7 0 samples for ortho p measurement were collected at 0 1 5 3 6 9 12 21 24 and 30 h 2 5 aerobic p uptake batch test for bioactivity study at the end of anaerobic p release gs or fs was immediately washed for three times with a buffer containing 120 mg p l phosphate without carbon source under anaerobic conditions liquid ph was controlled at 7 0 zhou et al 2008 subsequently all the groups were instantly sparged with air for 2 h initial and final samples were collected for ortho p concentration detection 2 6 chemical analysis samples for the determination of soluble components were immediately filtered using membrane filters with a pore size of 0 45 μm the sludge samples were collected for the analysis of total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss the measurements of tss vss total phosphorus tp and ortho p po4 3 p were carried out according to the standard ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric methods apha 2005 samples were digested using potassium peroxodisulfate to convert various forms of phosphorus among biomass and bulk liquid to ortho p for tp measurements tss and vss were determined by triplicate to calculate the phosphate release per g tss vss cations including ca mg al and fe were detected by icp ms xseries ii thermo scientific germany acetate was measured by the gas chromatograph agilent 6890 usa three replicates were performed for each analysis 2 7 phreeqc program modelling theory phosphorus in sludge is composed of poly p assimilation and chemical precipitant ph is a key factor that influences the p formation at low ph precipitated forms in sludge matrix in particular for gs could be solubilized under the conditions of the tests while at high ph released ortho p could precipitate besides edta addition may release chemically precipitated p e g ferric or aluminium phosphates due to the chelating function of edta on cations zou et al 2017 to clarify whether the chemical precipitation formation or re dissolution would occur in batch tests model predictions or simulations were performed using phreeqc program version 3 1 4 parkhurst and appelo 1999 which can serve as a theoretical guide for the effects of reaction conditions by examining saturation index si si is defined as si l o g i a p k s p where iap is the free ionic activities product and k sp is the thermodynamic solubility product si can be selected as an indicator of equilibrium and the thermodynamic basis for crystallization reaction the solution is in equilibrium si 0 undersaturated si 0 or supersaturated si 0 parkhurst and appelo 1999 song et al 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of edta presence on p release under anaerobic and aerobic conditions using pao enriched granular sludge the presence of edta causes p release regardless of aerobic or anaerobic conditions as shown in fig 3 a thus supporting the hypothesis that edta has a stressful effect on paos the initial ortho p concentration was 0 9 0 1 mg p g tss under aerobic conditions substantial p release occurred in the edta addition tests where the p release amount rose in the tests with increased edta addition ranging from 1 3 to 10 4 mg p g tss the p release amounts under anaerobic conditions were slightly higher than those observed under aerobic conditions ranging from 5 5 to 12 0 mg p g tss the results indicated that in general anaerobic conditions were the most favorable for increased p release however under the most favorable conditions anaerobic with edta the soluble p concentration at the end of the tests accounted for only 7 20 of tp and thus we did not observe a substantial p release in the duration of the test suggesting that the edta could not be utilized by paos as a substrate furthermore more phosphate was released from mechanically pre treated pao sludge i e grind and sonication under aerobic conditions indicating that under these conditions edta penetrated the cell wall of bacteria and resulted in p release differences arising from mechanical treatment also imply that the robust and compact matrix of aerobic granules plays significant roles in protecting the cells against the stressful conditions due to the extracellular polymeric substances particularly exopolysaccharides lin et al 2010 however under anaerobic conditions for the mechanical treatment group pre treatment showed no substantial influences on p release more specifically final p concentrations at 3 h were 12 mg p g tss with both 1 and 1 5 edta tests given that there were no significant differences in p release with the high level of edta under anaerobic conditions with or without pre treatment 1 edta without pre treatment was selected as the optimal condition to carry out the subsequent batch tests in agreement with previous studies brdjanovic et al 1998 hesselmann et al 2000 typical curves of p release and acetate consumption were obtained under anaerobic conditions in our study fig 3b generally edta treatment significantly boosted the anaerobic p release it was observed that gs with the edta treatment gs edta acetate showed a higher p release capacity characterized by the final p release amount of 31 1 0 8 mg p g tss 70 0 0 2 mg l within 24 h which was 1 8 fold of the amount released in the no edta test gs acetate also acetate uptake was incomplete and stopped within 3 h with the presence of edta this led to a higher ratio of p release and acetate uptake p hac up to 0 93 p mol c mol for the edta addition than the control test up to 0 57 p mol c mol and typical p hac ratios as high as 0 75 p mol c mol schuler and jenkins 2003 of highly enriched pao cultures the increased p hac ratio demonstrated a significant contribution of poly p in the anaerobic conversions attributing to stressful effects of edta on anaerobic p release of paos in addition the results indicated that the edta treatment successfully uncoupled p depletion from the acetate uptake according to the anaerobic metabolism of paos internally stored poly p were hydrolyzed for atp generation fig 1 thus the cultures resisting environmentally stressful conditions require more energy thus inducing more p release from ebpr cultures in this regard the released p using 1 edta is considered as a fraction of poly p 3 2 p release from pao enriched granular sludge with acetate addition at different ph values in order to investigate the influence of un dissociated acetic acid on the anaerobic metabolism of p release of paos the sludge was exposed to hac at different ph values ranging from 4 8 to 7 0 according to pka value of hac pka 4 8 the ratios of hac hac a were 0 50 0 16 0 06 0 02 and 0 01 under ph values of 4 8 5 5 6 0 6 5 and 7 0 respectively seemingly phosphate concentration increased linearly during the first 3 h for the tests with ph conducted at all ph values fig 4 a subsequently the concentration gradually rose to different maximum levels in individual tests previous literature has reported that ph presents substantial influences on the amount and specific rate of p release boswell et al 1999 liu et al 1996 hac of approximately 4 2 6 1 mm was still detected after 30 h indicating that in these tests vfa did not become limiting fig 4b shows the sludge specific p release amount under anaerobic conditions at the different ph values as well as the release ortho p to total p fraction an increase in phosphate concentration was observed under low ph conditions in particular the highest p concentration of around 48 5 2 4 mg p g tss 84 5 4 2 mg p l 98 of tp was detected at a ph of 4 8 the corresponding fractions at ph 5 5 6 0 6 5 and 7 0 represented approximately 86 78 71 and 66 of tp in pao enriched granular sludge w w respectively as reported previously boswell et al 1999 liu et al 1996 smolders et al 1994 acidic conditions ph lower than 6 5 inactivate the acetate metabolism thereby inhibiting p release when exposure time is shorter than 1 5 h similarly boswell et al 1999 found that anaerobic p release at 30 c for 30 h continuously increased with ph incrementally increasing from 5 0 to 8 0 however our study indicated that low ph enhanced the p release even at ph 4 8 these differences are attributed to toxification arising from undissociated hac at low ph which allowed undissociated hac to penetrate the cell membrane freely at such a high rate that it became toxic smolders et al 1994 in this case paos were forced to pump out the excess hac which could consume more energy finally resulting in massive p release at low ph after the anaerobic release test the sludge was washed under anaerobic conditions in a phosphate buffer containing 120 mg p l and no vfa or cod and subjected to aerobic conditions for 2 h to test the aerobic uptake activity and thereby the cell integrity as shown in fig 4c and 5 of phosphate was taken in at ph of 4 8 while the corresponding proportion accounted for 12 16 in other tests the uptake of phosphate suggested that the metabolic activity of paos was still present and that cells were not disintegrated on the basis of the results ph of 4 8 and 7 0 were chosen to conduct the subsequent tests 3 3 comparison of two strategies to uncouple p release and hac uptake acetate addition at low ph and edta treatment to further demonstrate the feasibility of the two methods i e acetate addition at low ph and the presence of edta p release tests were carried out using granular and flocculent ebpr sludge without mechanical pre treatment as demonstrated above treatments with ph 4 8 ph 7 0 ph 8 0 as a positive control for aerobic uptake activity with addition of 1 edta ph 8 0 versus control without adjusting ph were used to evaluate the level of p release fig 5 a and b shows the batch tests of pao enriched granular and flocculent ebpr sludge under stressful conditions both ph 4 8 and edta addition spherical granules were largely intact after 30 h further indicating the robust structure of aerobic granular sludge fig 5c and e depict the anaerobic phosphate release into the solution in the five groups using granular sludge during 30 h after sparging with n2 gas phosphate was immediately released into the solution by the pao enriched cultures in fig 5c the released phosphate initially presented a linear increase for 3 h afterwards the phosphate concentration rose gradually to a stable level after 9 h the phosphate profiles in all the tests became stable except for the phosphate profile from the test conducted at ph 4 8 the edta treatment presented the highest initial specific p release rate reaching 21 9 mg p g tss h presumably underlying the stronger stressful effects of edta presence on the anaerobic p release behaviour of paos with respect to the phosphate release amount fig 5e at ph 4 8 the phosphate concentration in the solution accounted for 96 of tp after 30 h indicating that the amorphous phosphate precipitate dissolved into the solution the highest released p concentration was 68 4 2 7 mg p g tss 90 1 8 mg l which was 2 2 folds of that in the control test final p concentrations resulted from edta treatment were the second highest representing 54 5 2 1 mg p g tss 69 5 3 5 mg l 78 of tp in agreement with p release results of gs phosphate was released from cells instantly by flocculent sludge particularly edta tests witnessed the highest p release rate of 16 mg p g tss h within 3 h fig 5d and f edta treatment resulted in the highest phosphate release but it took a longer time to release phosphate over 9 h in comparison with gs to further identify the negative impact on sludge activity a p uptake test under aerobic conditions was performed after the anaerobic release tests fig 5g and h the results illustrate that paos were still active after an edta exposure of 30 h because partial phosphate for edta group was taken up by paos in granular sludge in line with disrupted hac uptake after 3 h in fig 3b a quite small fraction of phosphate 0 653 mg p g tss was taken in with ph at 4 8 which inhibited the paos activity at low ph overall p release and uptake tests demonstrated that the edta treatment was superior and can be an effective way of uncoupling acetate uptake and p release fig 6 illustrates the simulated and calculated si values which could be used to simulate the possibility of chemical precipitation formation of ortho p at high ph and the dissolution of intrinsic chemical precipitation in the sludge at low ph at ph 4 8 the si values of phosphate precipitants were lower than zero ranging from 3 6 to 11 indicating the aqueous phase was undersaturated and the chemical precipitant can dissolve into the aqueous phase at low ph po4 3 could be released along with cations such as mg2 and ca2 which are responsible for sludge p precipitation latif et al 2017 regarding the edta treatment the si value of fepo4 2h2o was 8 3 si values for other chemical precipitants were above and near zero indicating that the chemical precipitants may occur under these reaction conditions however the phenomenon of dissolution or chemical precipitation largely depends on the ion concentration in the supernatant and the composition of chemical precipitants in the sludge although sludge matrix composition is unknown the relevant counter ions ca mg al and fe were observed at a very low level in the initial and final samples for acetate or edta addition for two kinds of sludge table a1 in supplementary information therefore it was speculated that the influence of chemical precipitants was relatively small on p release determination meanwhile it should be noticed that the edta method has limitations to study the p release behaviour of sludge samples which were subjected to chemical precipitation because of the chelating effects of edta on chemical p precipitation zou et al 2017 poly p values may be overestimated in this regard the sludge samples were recommended to be taken from ebpr plants without chemical addition to precipitate p 3 4 application of the proposed methods using real sludge samples from wwtps to further demonstrate the capability of the proposed methods two kinds of sludge samples were taken from wwtps i e gs wwtp and fs wwtp fig 7 a and b presents results for the p release under anaerobic conditions during a period of 30 h in line with the aforementioned results a higher p release rate for both sludge samples was witnessed with edta treatment compared with other groups particularly p release rate for edta groups was up to 13 4 mg p g tss h within 3 h while the corresponding data in other groups were 2 3 10 8 mg p g tss h the final p release amounts after 30 h are displayed in fig 7c and d as the figures indicate the presence of edta resulted in the maximum p release for both granular sludge and floc sludge representing 29 and 31 mg p g tss which were 1 8 2 5 fold the values from control tests notably fs is more sensitive than gs given that the p release amount and rate at ph 4 8 were lower than other tests which is likely associated with toxic effects of over intracellular acid accumulation 3 5 feasibility of two methods and suggestions for future experiment comparison of the two methods indicates that the observed p release in the tests with 9 h exposure to edta 1 w v 30 mm at ph 8 is considered to be the biological available poly p the edta treatment resulted in the highest p release amount and highest release rate less than 9 h in most sludge types with an exception for gs samples from a lab scale sbr system for which the highest p release was observed with extremely high fraction of 98 tp in accordance with the previous study zhang et al 2013 this present study showed that the tp contents in gs or fs from ebpr systems took a fraction of 4 14 of the dry solids poly p represented the main form with a content ranging from 77 to 89 of tp by the edta treatment leaving 8 16 mg p g tss which is considered as a minimal organic bound p content associated with active biomass finally aerobic activity tests confirmed that the bacteria were still active and that the p release is not caused by cell disintegration regarding the method of ph treatment it seems very effective for gs from the lab scale sbr with a high p release amount accounting for 98 of tp fig 5e which was even higher than that of the edta treatment however this finding suggests that other phosphate forms have contributed to this number considering that various other forms of p including ortho p inorganic phosphates pyro meta and poly p organic phosphates also exist in the sludge for instance a recent study reported that the p content in extracted extracellular polymeric substances eps of ebpr sludge took an unneglectable fraction of 6 7 1 1 of tp zhang et al 2013 especially the p release amount was observed to approach to that of edta test at 9 h reaching 54 2 mg p g tss however the p release amount gradually increased with a very low release rate of 1 4 mg p g tss h after 9 h which could be attributed to dissolution of inert precipitates as supported by the si and cell lysis during the long time exposure to low ph treatment thus leading to the hydrolysis of long chain poly p released from cells overall edta treatment was found effective to quantify the poly p concentration based on the kinetic analysis and p release amount the method of acetate addition at low ph values depended upon the sludge types in which gs due to a robust structure was more applicable than fs but the experimental time should be less than 9 h for further use of the ph treatment method for granular sludge it is required to validate if it is applicable to different types of aerobic gs for confirmation of the results the poly p content in the cells was also estimated using the equation below 1 p cell content g p g tss tss vss tss 1 3 23 assuming that the ash content is mainly poly p mg0 33 k0 33 po3 brdjanovic et al 1996 marcelino et al 2009 tayà et al 2013 as shown in table a2 the measured poly p contents 0 030 0 123 g p g tss by edta treatment for all samples were much lower than the calculated data 0 070 0 204 g p g tss in particular calculated poly p was even unreasonably higher than tp indicating a substantial part of the ash is not poly p moreover the results indicate that the method of ash content dependent calculation exists limitations many factors including operational conditions hrt srt sludge types sludge compositions e g eps and microbial communities may influence the poly p concentration which should be taken into account for the poly p calculations welles et al 2015 however the edta treatment developed in this study showed robustness which can achieve excess anaerobic p release with limited influences of other factors 4 conclusions in this study practical implementable strategies to quantify the poly p content in the paos were investigated the strategies were based on uncoupling p release from vfa uptake under extreme environmental conditions including i acetate addition at low ph and ii the presence of edta in the aqueous solution a protocol associated with poly p quantification was developed the proposed strategies demonstrated improvement in degradation of poly p and subsequent release of ortho p into the bulk liquid under stressful conditions poly p consumption is not stoichiometrically limited by the vfa uptake and therefore full hydrolysis of poly p to ortho phosphate under anaerobic conditions can be achieved edta treatment is a feasible method to quantify the poly p concentration in both flocculent and granular sludge exposure to 1 w v of edta at ph 8 0 is optimal for maximized anaerobic p release the recommended experimental time for anaerobic p release treatment should not be over 9 h given that longer exposure at stressful conditions inhibits the bioactivity of paos tp in gs or fs samples of biological phosphate removal system takes a fraction of 4 14 of dry solids and mainly represents in the forms of poly p ranging from 77 to 89 of tp as determined by the edta treatment test

pha as the energy source glycogen is a key component in pao metabolism poly p is composed of three to several hundred phosphate units fig 1b as indicated above poly p plays a significant role in p storage reservoirs one constitute of nucleic acids and in energy storage for atp formation kulakovskaya et al 2012 serafim et al 2002 the poly p content in sludge is an important parameter to study at a fundamental level including its role in the metabolism of specific pao and the niche differentiation of different pao clades moreover reliable quantification of the poly p content is of great importance to understand process performance and nutrient recovery potential of wastewater treatment systems to investigate the effect of poly p on the metabolism of different types of pao clades in laboratory studies and modelling approaches saia et al 2017 reliable methods for the determination of poly p are needed during the application of ebpr in full scale wastewater treatment systems or nutrient reclamation facilities the p removal capacity of the process can be indicated by the level of poly p content poly p also shows the potential for p recovery using biological and or chemical physical methods to facilitate future studies and optimization of full scale processes developing simple and user friendly methods are required for quantification of intracellular poly p for a comprehensive evaluation of a technique several elements in terms of reliability cost complexity and pre treatment steps should be considered the development of fast simple and feasible poly p analytical and quantitative tools is impending for this researchers need to elucidate the nature of the biochemistry and the roles and dynamics of various phosphorus containing molecules in vitro and in vivo table 1 summarizes the principle advantages and disadvantages of techniques related to poly p quantification the reported techniques have their limitations for poly p quantification in general conventional p analysis methods involve fastidious extraction and pre treatment procedures hupfer et al 2008 includes conversion of poly p to ortho p through chemical digestion followed by ortho p analysis on the other hand due to the strong acid perchloric acid and nitric sulfuric acid etc used during the digestion process all forms of p can be converted to ortho p resulting in overestimation poly p amount most chemical fractionation methods are laborious and not efficient at separation of poly p organic p and precipitated p glycogen plays a role in maximal p release in biological methods brdjanovic et al 1997 1998 welles et al 2015 and for this complicated experimental systems are needed acevedo et al 2012 biological methods have the potential of releasing poly p from the cells but there is a need for methods that uncouple the energy consumption from the consumption of reduction equivalents biological methods can be achieved by creating conditions where cells will use the poly p for maintenance properties by inducing atp consuming processes anaerobic metabolism of paos relies on the hydrolysis of internally stored poly p for atp generation microorganisms exposed to adverse environments consume more energy in order to resist the environmental stress conditions thus inducing greater p release from ebpr cultures fig 1a depicts the mechanism for two potential methods i e edta treatment and acetic acid hac presence at low ph of stress induced energy consumption for poly p quantification by uncoupling hac uptake and p release previous studies liu et al 1996 mino et al 1998 have shown that vfa uptake at low ph causes an uncoupling effect which can uncouple the p release from the vfa uptake and thereby allow rapid release of all biologically available poly p a low ph leads to an accumulation of hac in the cells and subsequent ph decrease which the cell activity tries to counteract by producing extra energy in the form of atp an alternative method is the use of a compound that affects membrane integrity such as ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta and thereby disrupts the proton motive force which the cells try to restore by atp usage derived from poly p the current study focusses on two different methods for poly p quantification i hac addition ii edta presence the principle of poly p quantification relies on uncoupling p release and hac uptake which arise from environmental stresses the objectives of this study were 3 fold 1 to develop easily performable non destructive and cost effective methods to quantify poly p 2 to optimize the experimental procedure including edta concentration reaction time and ph 3 to define and validate the protocol for poly p quantitation using different sludge types 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge sources and characterization to compare the reliability and availability of the proposed methods flocculent sludge fs and granular sludge gs samples were harvested from lab scale and full scale reactors treating domestic sewage 4 different types of samples the samples included gs sample 1 and fs sample 2 collected from pao enriched lab scale ebpr system sample 3 was aerobic gs collected from a full scale nereda plant epe nl and sample 4 was fs collected from a local waste water treatment plant wwtp harnaschpolder in the netherlands after collection of the fresh granules for gs samples from the lab scale sbr reactors or wwtp the granules were instantly and gently rinsed for 2 3 times using tap water for 2 3 min each time on a fine sieve with a mesh aperture of 0 1 mm afterwards a piece of quantitative filter paper was put beneath the fine sieve for 5 min to absorb excessive moisture following this the wet granules were harvested fresh sludge for the flocculent samples was firstly centrifuged at 3000 rpm and the supernatant was decanted then the pellets were rinsed using the same amount of tap water as decanted supernatant for 2 3 min finally we obtained the mixture of biomass pellets and tap water which was sparged with air for mixing 2 2 procedures for poly p determination the procedures for detecting and quantifying poly p are shown in fig 2 the whole process consists of three stages i optimization of pre treatment conditions ii protocol optimization and improvement iii demonstration and validation using wwtp sludge stage i includes three steps step 1 assessed the sensitivity of granular biomass to stress conditions the physical pre treatment resulted in destabilizing the compact structure thereby making the biomass more sensitive to environmental stress step 2 involved the optimization of the concentration of edta and verification of its biodegradability edta is as an ideal aminopolycarboxylic acid chelating agent for this test because it binds with cations calcium magnesium and therefore it avoids chemical precipitation of released ortho p the function of edta in p release in this study was not only to stress the bacteria but also to avoid complete disintegration of the bacteria hence three different levels of edta from low to high concentrations of 0 1 3 mm 1 30 mm and 1 5 50 mm were examined to determine the suitable edta concentration for the experiments previous studies have reported that edta can be utilized as a carbon source specially by enriched bacterial cultures nörtemann 1999 thomas et al 1998 details of the procedures are listed under section 2 3 to demonstrate its biodegradability in the present study we also compared p release with the edta addition under anaerobic and aerobic conditions using gs finally step 3 involved the assessment of the effects of undissociated hac concentrations on p release by adjusting ph in stage ii p release was investigated by the two methods developed from stage i with optimized edta concentration and ph using two types of pao enriched sludge gs and fs a general concern of these tests was potential cell lysis of the microorganisms exposed to the extreme conditions e g presence of vfa at low ph edta or other adverse environments cell lysis could disrupt the stress induced p release response and thereby result in underestimated poly p levels to prevent poly p underestimation as a consequence of cell lysis it was important to assess whether the cells were still active however the extent of cell lysis during batch tests is difficult to evaluate to demonstrate the bacteria were still alive an aerobic p uptake test was performed after the anaerobic test stage ii in the final stage stage iii the sludge collected from full scale installations treating domestic sewage was used to further demonstrate the feasibility of the protocol 2 3 optimization of physical and chemical pre treatment and edta treatment due to the compact matrices of gs the granules were first treated using combined physical methods i e mechanical grinding and sonication to evaluate the effect of the pre treatment as described next for each test 0 15 g fresh wet granules were added to a 50 ml falcon tube containing 20 ml tap water then the sludge water mixture was homogenized for 10 s at 800 w labgen tissue homogenizer cole parmer usa and then subjected to pulsed sonication on ice for 1 min at 36 w edta was then added to the mixture with final concentrations of 0 1 1 and 1 5 w v finally air or n2 were sparged to maintain aerobic or anaerobic conditions respectively for 3 h solution ph was kept constant at ph of 8 0 using 0 1 m naoh samples were taken at 0 and 3 h respectively for ortho p measurement for the control tests the same procedures were carried out without edta addition 2 4 anaerobic p release batch test by edta treatment or acetate addition under various low ph conditions after physical and chemical treatment the optimum concentration of edta for the following anaerobic phosphate release test was chosen given that the prevailing ph of anaerobic phase affects anaerobic metabolism mulkerrins et al 2004 it is important to understand the behaviour of p release at various ph values during acetate addition for each test 2 g of wet gs was transferred into a bottle which was filled with 80 ml of tap water or 80 ml of fs was transferred after rinsing it as described in section 2 1 then the mixture was continually sparged with n2 to maintain the strictly anaerobic conditions the carbon source ch3coona 3h2o was quickly added to obtain a final concentration of 860 mg l 400 mg l cod 6 3 mm welles et al 2015 for the edta test the final concentration of edta was 1 w v 30 mm and the ph was maintained at 8 0 for acetate addition tests the ph was manually controlled at various low ph conditions 4 8 5 5 6 0 6 5 and 7 0 using 1m hcl during stage ii for stage iii the ph values were 4 8 and 7 0 samples for ortho p measurement were collected at 0 1 5 3 6 9 12 21 24 and 30 h 2 5 aerobic p uptake batch test for bioactivity study at the end of anaerobic p release gs or fs was immediately washed for three times with a buffer containing 120 mg p l phosphate without carbon source under anaerobic conditions liquid ph was controlled at 7 0 zhou et al 2008 subsequently all the groups were instantly sparged with air for 2 h initial and final samples were collected for ortho p concentration detection 2 6 chemical analysis samples for the determination of soluble components were immediately filtered using membrane filters with a pore size of 0 45 μm the sludge samples were collected for the analysis of total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss the measurements of tss vss total phosphorus tp and ortho p po4 3 p were carried out according to the standard ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric methods apha 2005 samples were digested using potassium peroxodisulfate to convert various forms of phosphorus among biomass and bulk liquid to ortho p for tp measurements tss and vss were determined by triplicate to calculate the phosphate release per g tss vss cations including ca mg al and fe were detected by icp ms xseries ii thermo scientific germany acetate was measured by the gas chromatograph agilent 6890 usa three replicates were performed for each analysis 2 7 phreeqc program modelling theory phosphorus in sludge is composed of poly p assimilation and chemical precipitant ph is a key factor that influences the p formation at low ph precipitated forms in sludge matrix in particular for gs could be solubilized under the conditions of the tests while at high ph released ortho p could precipitate besides edta addition may release chemically precipitated p e g ferric or aluminium phosphates due to the chelating function of edta on cations zou et al 2017 to clarify whether the chemical precipitation formation or re dissolution would occur in batch tests model predictions or simulations were performed using phreeqc program version 3 1 4 parkhurst and appelo 1999 which can serve as a theoretical guide for the effects of reaction conditions by examining saturation index si si is defined as si l o g i a p k s p where iap is the free ionic activities product and k sp is the thermodynamic solubility product si can be selected as an indicator of equilibrium and the thermodynamic basis for crystallization reaction the solution is in equilibrium si 0 undersaturated si 0 or supersaturated si 0 parkhurst and appelo 1999 song et al 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of edta presence on p release under anaerobic and aerobic conditions using pao enriched granular sludge the presence of edta causes p release regardless of aerobic or anaerobic conditions as shown in fig 3 a thus supporting the hypothesis that edta has a stressful effect on paos the initial ortho p concentration was 0 9 0 1 mg p g tss under aerobic conditions substantial p release occurred in the edta addition tests where the p release amount rose in the tests with increased edta addition ranging from 1 3 to 10 4 mg p g tss the p release amounts under anaerobic conditions were slightly higher than those observed under aerobic conditions ranging from 5 5 to 12 0 mg p g tss the results indicated that in general anaerobic conditions were the most favorable for increased p release however under the most favorable conditions anaerobic with edta the soluble p concentration at the end of the tests accounted for only 7 20 of tp and thus we did not observe a substantial p release in the duration of the test suggesting that the edta could not be utilized by paos as a substrate furthermore more phosphate was released from mechanically pre treated pao sludge i e grind and sonication under aerobic conditions indicating that under these conditions edta penetrated the cell wall of bacteria and resulted in p release differences arising from mechanical treatment also imply that the robust and compact matrix of aerobic granules plays significant roles in protecting the cells against the stressful conditions due to the extracellular polymeric substances particularly exopolysaccharides lin et al 2010 however under anaerobic conditions for the mechanical treatment group pre treatment showed no substantial influences on p release more specifically final p concentrations at 3 h were 12 mg p g tss with both 1 and 1 5 edta tests given that there were no significant differences in p release with the high level of edta under anaerobic conditions with or without pre treatment 1 edta without pre treatment was selected as the optimal condition to carry out the subsequent batch tests in agreement with previous studies brdjanovic et al 1998 hesselmann et al 2000 typical curves of p release and acetate consumption were obtained under anaerobic conditions in our study fig 3b generally edta treatment significantly boosted the anaerobic p release it was observed that gs with the edta treatment gs edta acetate showed a higher p release capacity characterized by the final p release amount of 31 1 0 8 mg p g tss 70 0 0 2 mg l within 24 h which was 1 8 fold of the amount released in the no edta test gs acetate also acetate uptake was incomplete and stopped within 3 h with the presence of edta this led to a higher ratio of p release and acetate uptake p hac up to 0 93 p mol c mol for the edta addition than the control test up to 0 57 p mol c mol and typical p hac ratios as high as 0 75 p mol c mol schuler and jenkins 2003 of highly enriched pao cultures the increased p hac ratio demonstrated a significant contribution of poly p in the anaerobic conversions attributing to stressful effects of edta on anaerobic p release of paos in addition the results indicated that the edta treatment successfully uncoupled p depletion from the acetate uptake according to the anaerobic metabolism of paos internally stored poly p were hydrolyzed for atp generation fig 1 thus the cultures resisting environmentally stressful conditions require more energy thus inducing more p release from ebpr cultures in this regard the released p using 1 edta is considered as a fraction of poly p 3 2 p release from pao enriched granular sludge with acetate addition at different ph values in order to investigate the influence of un dissociated acetic acid on the anaerobic metabolism of p release of paos the sludge was exposed to hac at different ph values ranging from 4 8 to 7 0 according to pka value of hac pka 4 8 the ratios of hac hac a were 0 50 0 16 0 06 0 02 and 0 01 under ph values of 4 8 5 5 6 0 6 5 and 7 0 respectively seemingly phosphate concentration increased linearly during the first 3 h for the tests with ph conducted at all ph values fig 4 a subsequently the concentration gradually rose to different maximum levels in individual tests previous literature has reported that ph presents substantial influences on the amount and specific rate of p release boswell et al 1999 liu et al 1996 hac of approximately 4 2 6 1 mm was still detected after 30 h indicating that in these tests vfa did not become limiting fig 4b shows the sludge specific p release amount under anaerobic conditions at the different ph values as well as the release ortho p to total p fraction an increase in phosphate concentration was observed under low ph conditions in particular the highest p concentration of around 48 5 2 4 mg p g tss 84 5 4 2 mg p l 98 of tp was detected at a ph of 4 8 the corresponding fractions at ph 5 5 6 0 6 5 and 7 0 represented approximately 86 78 71 and 66 of tp in pao enriched granular sludge w w respectively as reported previously boswell et al 1999 liu et al 1996 smolders et al 1994 acidic conditions ph lower than 6 5 inactivate the acetate metabolism thereby inhibiting p release when exposure time is shorter than 1 5 h similarly boswell et al 1999 found that anaerobic p release at 30 c for 30 h continuously increased with ph incrementally increasing from 5 0 to 8 0 however our study indicated that low ph enhanced the p release even at ph 4 8 these differences are attributed to toxification arising from undissociated hac at low ph which allowed undissociated hac to penetrate the cell membrane freely at such a high rate that it became toxic smolders et al 1994 in this case paos were forced to pump out the excess hac which could consume more energy finally resulting in massive p release at low ph after the anaerobic release test the sludge was washed under anaerobic conditions in a phosphate buffer containing 120 mg p l and no vfa or cod and subjected to aerobic conditions for 2 h to test the aerobic uptake activity and thereby the cell integrity as shown in fig 4c and 5 of phosphate was taken in at ph of 4 8 while the corresponding proportion accounted for 12 16 in other tests the uptake of phosphate suggested that the metabolic activity of paos was still present and that cells were not disintegrated on the basis of the results ph of 4 8 and 7 0 were chosen to conduct the subsequent tests 3 3 comparison of two strategies to uncouple p release and hac uptake acetate addition at low ph and edta treatment to further demonstrate the feasibility of the two methods i e acetate addition at low ph and the presence of edta p release tests were carried out using granular and flocculent ebpr sludge without mechanical pre treatment as demonstrated above treatments with ph 4 8 ph 7 0 ph 8 0 as a positive control for aerobic uptake activity with addition of 1 edta ph 8 0 versus control without adjusting ph were used to evaluate the level of p release fig 5 a and b shows the batch tests of pao enriched granular and flocculent ebpr sludge under stressful conditions both ph 4 8 and edta addition spherical granules were largely intact after 30 h further indicating the robust structure of aerobic granular sludge fig 5c and e depict the anaerobic phosphate release into the solution in the five groups using granular sludge during 30 h after sparging with n2 gas phosphate was immediately released into the solution by the pao enriched cultures in fig 5c the released phosphate initially presented a linear increase for 3 h afterwards the phosphate concentration rose gradually to a stable level after 9 h the phosphate profiles in all the tests became stable except for the phosphate profile from the test conducted at ph 4 8 the edta treatment presented the highest initial specific p release rate reaching 21 9 mg p g tss h presumably underlying the stronger stressful effects of edta presence on the anaerobic p release behaviour of paos with respect to the phosphate release amount fig 5e at ph 4 8 the phosphate concentration in the solution accounted for 96 of tp after 30 h indicating that the amorphous phosphate precipitate dissolved into the solution the highest released p concentration was 68 4 2 7 mg p g tss 90 1 8 mg l which was 2 2 folds of that in the control test final p concentrations resulted from edta treatment were the second highest representing 54 5 2 1 mg p g tss 69 5 3 5 mg l 78 of tp in agreement with p release results of gs phosphate was released from cells instantly by flocculent sludge particularly edta tests witnessed the highest p release rate of 16 mg p g tss h within 3 h fig 5d and f edta treatment resulted in the highest phosphate release but it took a longer time to release phosphate over 9 h in comparison with gs to further identify the negative impact on sludge activity a p uptake test under aerobic conditions was performed after the anaerobic release tests fig 5g and h the results illustrate that paos were still active after an edta exposure of 30 h because partial phosphate for edta group was taken up by paos in granular sludge in line with disrupted hac uptake after 3 h in fig 3b a quite small fraction of phosphate 0 653 mg p g tss was taken in with ph at 4 8 which inhibited the paos activity at low ph overall p release and uptake tests demonstrated that the edta treatment was superior and can be an effective way of uncoupling acetate uptake and p release fig 6 illustrates the simulated and calculated si values which could be used to simulate the possibility of chemical precipitation formation of ortho p at high ph and the dissolution of intrinsic chemical precipitation in the sludge at low ph at ph 4 8 the si values of phosphate precipitants were lower than zero ranging from 3 6 to 11 indicating the aqueous phase was undersaturated and the chemical precipitant can dissolve into the aqueous phase at low ph po4 3 could be released along with cations such as mg2 and ca2 which are responsible for sludge p precipitation latif et al 2017 regarding the edta treatment the si value of fepo4 2h2o was 8 3 si values for other chemical precipitants were above and near zero indicating that the chemical precipitants may occur under these reaction conditions however the phenomenon of dissolution or chemical precipitation largely depends on the ion concentration in the supernatant and the composition of chemical precipitants in the sludge although sludge matrix composition is unknown the relevant counter ions ca mg al and fe were observed at a very low level in the initial and final samples for acetate or edta addition for two kinds of sludge table a1 in supplementary information therefore it was speculated that the influence of chemical precipitants was relatively small on p release determination meanwhile it should be noticed that the edta method has limitations to study the p release behaviour of sludge samples which were subjected to chemical precipitation because of the chelating effects of edta on chemical p precipitation zou et al 2017 poly p values may be overestimated in this regard the sludge samples were recommended to be taken from ebpr plants without chemical addition to precipitate p 3 4 application of the proposed methods using real sludge samples from wwtps to further demonstrate the capability of the proposed methods two kinds of sludge samples were taken from wwtps i e gs wwtp and fs wwtp fig 7 a and b presents results for the p release under anaerobic conditions during a period of 30 h in line with the aforementioned results a higher p release rate for both sludge samples was witnessed with edta treatment compared with other groups particularly p release rate for edta groups was up to 13 4 mg p g tss h within 3 h while the corresponding data in other groups were 2 3 10 8 mg p g tss h the final p release amounts after 30 h are displayed in fig 7c and d as the figures indicate the presence of edta resulted in the maximum p release for both granular sludge and floc sludge representing 29 and 31 mg p g tss which were 1 8 2 5 fold the values from control tests notably fs is more sensitive than gs given that the p release amount and rate at ph 4 8 were lower than other tests which is likely associated with toxic effects of over intracellular acid accumulation 3 5 feasibility of two methods and suggestions for future experiment comparison of the two methods indicates that the observed p release in the tests with 9 h exposure to edta 1 w v 30 mm at ph 8 is considered to be the biological available poly p the edta treatment resulted in the highest p release amount and highest release rate less than 9 h in most sludge types with an exception for gs samples from a lab scale sbr system for which the highest p release was observed with extremely high fraction of 98 tp in accordance with the previous study zhang et al 2013 this present study showed that the tp contents in gs or fs from ebpr systems took a fraction of 4 14 of the dry solids poly p represented the main form with a content ranging from 77 to 89 of tp by the edta treatment leaving 8 16 mg p g tss which is considered as a minimal organic bound p content associated with active biomass finally aerobic activity tests confirmed that the bacteria were still active and that the p release is not caused by cell disintegration regarding the method of ph treatment it seems very effective for gs from the lab scale sbr with a high p release amount accounting for 98 of tp fig 5e which was even higher than that of the edta treatment however this finding suggests that other phosphate forms have contributed to this number considering that various other forms of p including ortho p inorganic phosphates pyro meta and poly p organic phosphates also exist in the sludge for instance a recent study reported that the p content in extracted extracellular polymeric substances eps of ebpr sludge took an unneglectable fraction of 6 7 1 1 of tp zhang et al 2013 especially the p release amount was observed to approach to that of edta test at 9 h reaching 54 2 mg p g tss however the p release amount gradually increased with a very low release rate of 1 4 mg p g tss h after 9 h which could be attributed to dissolution of inert precipitates as supported by the si and cell lysis during the long time exposure to low ph treatment thus leading to the hydrolysis of long chain poly p released from cells overall edta treatment was found effective to quantify the poly p concentration based on the kinetic analysis and p release amount the method of acetate addition at low ph values depended upon the sludge types in which gs due to a robust structure was more applicable than fs but the experimental time should be less than 9 h for further use of the ph treatment method for granular sludge it is required to validate if it is applicable to different types of aerobic gs for confirmation of the results the poly p content in the cells was also estimated using the equation below 1 p cell content g p g tss tss vss tss 1 3 23 assuming that the ash content is mainly poly p mg0 33 k0 33 po3 brdjanovic et al 1996 marcelino et al 2009 tayà et al 2013 as shown in table a2 the measured poly p contents 0 030 0 123 g p g tss by edta treatment for all samples were much lower than the calculated data 0 070 0 204 g p g tss in particular calculated poly p was even unreasonably higher than tp indicating a substantial part of the ash is not poly p moreover the results indicate that the method of ash content dependent calculation exists limitations many factors including operational conditions hrt srt sludge types sludge compositions e g eps and microbial communities may influence the poly p concentration which should be taken into account for the poly p calculations welles et al 2015 however the edta treatment developed in this study showed robustness which can achieve excess anaerobic p release with limited influences of other factors 4 conclusions in this study practical implementable strategies to quantify the poly p content in the paos were investigated the strategies were based on uncoupling p release from vfa uptake under extreme environmental conditions including i acetate addition at low ph and ii the presence of edta in the aqueous solution a protocol associated with poly p quantification was developed the proposed strategies demonstrated improvement in degradation of poly p and subsequent release of ortho p into the bulk liquid under stressful conditions poly p consumption is not stoichiometrically limited by the vfa uptake and therefore full hydrolysis of poly p to ortho phosphate under anaerobic conditions can be achieved edta treatment is a feasible method to quantify the poly p concentration in both flocculent and granular sludge exposure to 1 w v of edta at ph 8 0 is optimal for maximized anaerobic p release the recommended experimental time for anaerobic p release treatment should not be over 9 h given that longer exposure at stressful conditions inhibits the bioactivity of paos tp in gs or fs samples of biological phosphate removal system takes a fraction of 4 14 of dry solids and mainly represents in the forms of poly p ranging from 77 to 89 of tp as determined by the edta treatment test

grassland i e chernozems and kastanozems was 1 2 mg n g soil compared with 0 7 mg n g soil for high nutrient well drained soil i e luvisols at the depth of 0 100 cm batjes 2014 previous research has shown the variation in soil nitrogen levels in residential areas due to anthropogenic activities it was found that non labile organic nitrogen on in soil nearly doubled in selected residential areas 1 2 mg n g soil over the past century after agricultural areas were urbanized lewis et al 2014 considering the incomplete removal of organic contaminants biochemical oxygen demand i e bod and nitrogen in conventional owtss boyer and rock 1992 aerobic treatment units atus have been proposed as a potential solution for onsite wastewater treatment atus work as a secondary biological treatment unit to improve the removal of bod and oxidize ammonium nh4 to nitrate no3 via biological nitrification hazen and sawyer 2015 smith et al 2008 it has been estimated that advanced owtss atus with passive nitrogen reduction systems with nitrification and denitrification stages can remove more tn 96 7 100 over their lifetime in comparison to conventional septic systems with drain fields 61 65 diaz elsayed et al 2017 one prospective configuration would channel treated effluent from a newly installed aerated onsite treatment system back into the pre existing leaching pool for dispersal to groundwater a potential concern in such a design arises how installation of an atu may impact the composition of released legacy nitrogen when the atu effluent is discharged to existing leaching pools furthermore little is known about the potential release of legacy nitrogen from owtss to groundwater during rain events especially in coastal areas in this study we hypothesized that the legacy nitrogen remaining around existing leaching pools could be released to groundwater when i an atu is added to the owts and ii during water flushes through system at high flow rate such as during a heavy rain event we also hypothesize that the level of nitrogen present in the soil matrix depends on the amount of organic matter present to test these hypotheses the objectives of this study were 1 investigate the level and composition of legacy nitrogen remaining in the soil matrix of owtss with neutral and low ph 2 evaluate the effect of soil matrix properties e g ph on nitrogen adsorption capacity and 3 determine the extent of nitrogen leaching under different environmentally related scenarios e g atu effluent and heavy rain events 2 materials and methods 2 1 sites description and samples collection two field sites were selected for this study both of which consisted of single family homes utilizing concrete leaching pools as owtss since 1972 all the onsite wastewater dispersal systems on long island consisted of concrete leaching pools and septic tanks therefore the field sites were representative of typical owtss in suffolk county ny the owts at site a pool a was receiving wastewater and had neutral ph while the other owts at site b pool b had been acid washed to alleviate a pipe clogging issue before the sampling event site descriptions and boring test results are summarized in tables s1 and s2 soil cores length 61 cm i e 24 inch were collected at the center of and beneath the leaching pool at each site fig 1 additional soil cores surrounding the leaching pools

conducted as soon as the samples were transported to the lab to minimize exposure to atmospheric oxygen n2 gas was flushed through a 1l de ionized water bottle and for each sample a volume of 20 ml of prepared anoxic de ionized water was mixed with 10 g samples from each 15 2 cm 6 inch depth interval and incubated at room temperature for 15 min on a shaker table at 200 rpm samples were then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min and the supernatant was removed for nh4 and no3 no2 measurement laima 1992 morin and morse 1999 anoxic potassium chloride kcl solution 2n was then added to the remaining sample the samples were then shaken at 200 rpm for 60 min centrifuged and the supernatant was extracted and filtered 0 45 μm millipore for nh4 and no3 no2 measurement this extraction process was repeated twice to recover all inorganic nitrogen species adsorbed on the soil matrix nh4 and nox were measured colorimetrically using a spectrophotometer polarstar omega bmg in brief nh4 was measured by the phenolhypochlorite method solorzano 1969 and combined no3 no2 was measured as no2 with griess reagent after previously reducing all no3 to no2 with vanadium chloride doane and horwath 2003 total carbon tc total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn were also measured in core samples 40 g of wet soil sample at each depth was dried over night at 70 c and then was ground and homogenized to fine powder schumacher 2002 10 g dried sample was used for tc and tn measurement an additional 10 g of sample was further treated in a heated water bath 40 c with 10 hydrochloric acid hcl v v 1 5 for 5 h to remove carbonate schumacher 2002 the samples were then washed with distilled water three times and dried overnight at 70 c for toc measurement schumacher 2002 elemental analyzer carbon nitrogen sulfur cns carlo erba was used to measure tc toc and tn in the samples 2 4 nitrogen leaching tests nitrogen leaching tests were performed to investigate the extent of nitrogen release from the soil matrix under two scenarios i when an owts is upgraded with an atu unit and the original leaching pool serves as the final dispersal unit for the atu effluent and ii when water flushes through the leaching pool and surrounding soil soil samples were homogenized under an n2 environment to minimize the exposure to atmospheric oxygen and the samples were transferred to sealed containers and maintained at 4 c before the leaching test two identical glass desorption columns d 22 mm length 300 mm chromaflex were packed with the soil matrix collected from sites a and b fig s2 every 6 cm of the column was packed with the homogeneous soil sample to represent every 15 2 cm of onsite soil detailed column packing information is summarized in table s3 tn in the experimental columns was calculated based on the measurements of in situ tn at 15 2 cm 6 inch depth intervals table s3 the hydraulic loading rate for scenario i was selected to be 1 2 gal ft 2 d 1 18 6 ml d the typical design loading rate for residential leaching pool systems based on the new york state design standard new york state and department of environmental conservation 2014 suffolk county department of health services 2017 the columns were dosed six times a day at 2 0 ml min 1 of 3 1ml dose with a peristaltic pump ismatech reglo cole parmer the synthetic atu effluent table s4 contained 3 6 mg nh4 n l 28 0 mg nox n l and 100 mg caco3 l alkalinity representing typical nitrogen and alkalinity levels of an aeration treatment unit from what we have observed in field monitoring unpublished data the leaching test was conducted for 92 h and the eluent samples were collected from the outlet of the columns at 4 h intervals the supernatant was filtered for ph nh4 no3 no2 measurement tn was measured by the persulfate digestion tnt plus 826 method with a hach spectrophotometer dr6000 hach to investigate the effect of rain water on the leaching of legacy nitrogen from the soil scenario ii synthetic rain water was prepared at ph 4 6 similar to hps high purity standard sr 1 simulated rainwater rothert 1999 and contained 0 7 mg n l tn 0 2 mg n l nox and 0 5 mg n l on tanner 1999 the continuous flow

site a was fed with the synthetic rain water for 24 h and the eluent aqueous samples were collected at 1 h intervals for nitrogen species analyses 2 5 statistical analysis two tail t test was used in order to compare a the total nitrogen level measured beneath sites a and site b and b the total nitrogen leached from column a in two scenarios ibm spss statistics 25 was used in the statistical analysis 3 results 3 1 physical and chemical properties of soil cores grain size distribution analyses of samples collected beneath and surrounding pool a showed uniform composition with a majority of the samples consisting of sand 96 97 with a small amount of gravel 0 8 1 6 and clay silt 2 0 2 8 table 1 the soil type and the physical properties of the samples at the two sites were similar to a soil survey conducted in the study area by us department of agriculture soil conservation service cornell agriculture experiment station warner et al 1975 indicating the fine loam sand soil type table s2 the soil bulk densities measured at both sites and various depths ranged from 1 1 to 1 8 g cm3 table 1 slightly lower than the reported maximum dry densities of soil in the study area 1 7 2 0 g cm3 brookhaven suffolk county ny warner et al 1975 the moisture content beneath pool a at sampling location a 1 21 6 29 7 was higher than a 2 a 3 and a 4 8 2 18 1 due to continuous application of wastewater from the leaching pool samples collected below 30 5 cm 12 at site a and b were below the ground water table fig 1 over the duration of this study the moisture content of samples directly under both pools pool a 21 6 29 7 pool b 24 2 34 9 were close to those expected for saturated sand 33 9 7 3 cosbyg et al 1984 neutral ph was observed in cores collected beneath and surrounding pool a 6 5 7 4 while cores collected beneath pool b showed acidic ph 3 2 3 4 due to previous acid washing table 1 soil cores collected directly beneath the pools a 1 and b 1 contained the highest toc 1 2 7 9 mg toc g soil and 1 2 8 8 mg toc g soil respectively in general the toc content decreased with increased sampling depth and lateral distance from the leaching pool table 1 at pool a as the sampling depth increased to 45 7 61 cm beneath the pool toc level was 1 22 mg g soil about 26 of that at 0 15 2 cm 4 74 mg g soil the toc level at the edge of pool a a 2 was 2 30 mg g soil at 0 15 2 cm about 50 of that right beneath the pool when the lateral distance further increased to 1 foot 30 5 cm from the edge of the pool a 3 the toc level was 0 27 mg g soil at 0 15 2 cm which was 5 7 of that right beneath the pool in the up gradient reference soil cores a 4 toc was undetected at all sampling depths table 1 dna extraction of a 1 and b 1 showed that the number of bacterial cells was around 108 cell g 1 soil with the assumption of 1 5 fg dna in one bacteria cell christensen et al 1995 table s5 the level of microbial cells previously reported was 2 9 108 10 108 cell g 1 soil for typical grasslands polyanskaya et al 2015 which is in the same range of our study the legacy nitrogen in the form of microbial biomass was negligible 1 of the tn measured in the core samples supplementary material microbial analysis 3 2 the presence and composition of legacy nitrogen the highest total legacy nitrogen tn level was observed at 0 15 2 cm beneath the pool 1 7 mg g soil for pool a and 1 3 mg g soil for pool b and the level decreased as the sampling depth increased fig 2 although the soil ph was different at site a and b table 1 there was no statistically significant difference in the amount of tn beneath the pool at each depth every 15 2 cm between the two sites two tail t test p 0 77 the tn level also decreased as the sample radial distance increased from the pool no tn was detected at the depth of 30 5 61 cm 12 24 from the cores surrounding the pool a 2 and a 3 and no tn was detected in the reference core a 4 fig 2 therefore in the defined study area for pool a from a 1 a 2 a 3 to a 4 excavated radius 701 0 cm depth 61 cm volume 94 1 m3 at site a the majority of tn 87 2 measured was present directly beneath the leaching pool compared to the surrounding environment the average tn beneath the leaching pool 0 61 cm 0 24 was calculated to be 4 1 0 6 mg n g soil and 3 0 0 4 mg n g soil for a 1 and b 1 respectively more than 95 of tn in the soil beneath the pools a 1 and b 1 was in organic form table 1 the major form of total inorganic nitrogen tin 99 in samples collected beneath the pools was nh4 fig 3 the level of tin beneath pool a 0 12 mg tin g soil was about 10 times higher than that beneath pool b 0 01 mg tin g soil fig 3 nox was undetected beneath the leaching pools at both sites but accounted for a higher portion of tin outside the leaching pool at site a where the level of nox increased from a range of 0 0 33 3 of tn at the edge of the pool a 2 to 50 0 100 0 of tn at 1 foot away from the leaching pool a 3 in the reference cores a 4 no nh4 was detected while about 0 01 mg nox n g soil was observed a level similar to the nitrate concentration in uncontaminated sandy soils 0 014 mg nox n g soil weil and brady 2016 3 3 nitrogen leaching from bench scale columns leaching tests were performed to investigate the extent of legacy nitrogen release from the soil matrix when an owts is upgraded with an atu and the leaching pool serves as the final dispersal unit for atu effluent the hydraulic conductivity of the soil was approximately 0 7 1 0 mm s d10 0 0297 cm from grain size analysis on the soil from each sample which is in the range of previous studies of 0 5 1 1 mm s in sand and gravel aquifer hess et al 1992 warren et al 1996 the calculated average hydraulic retention time for the 24 cm soil packed column was 35 3 41 2 h in scenario i and 1 2 1 4 h in scenario ii 3 3 1 scenario i nitrogen leaching with synthetic atu effluent when an existing owts i e septic tank with leaching pool in this study is upgraded the existing leaching pool can potentially serve as the final dispersal unit for the atu effluent e g the effluent from the aeration tank at the designed loading rate this option would reduce the capital cost of excavating a new dispersal unit for the atu effluent and could potentially be a more cost effective option for the owts upgrade tn in the soil of leaching column a 122 3 mg n and column b 107 3 mg n were calculated based on the tn measurement at each depth table s3 the leaching experiment was conducted for 92 h until the effluent tn concentration reached the same level as that in the influent fig 4 as the synthetic atu effluent passed through column a tn concentration in the eluent reached the highest level 398 mg l at 12 h then gradually decreased after 48 h fig 4 a indicating 92 7 of the leached legacy tn 10 74 mg n occurred in the first 48 h table 2 nh4 concentration in the eluent 26 2 52 2 mg n l was higher than that in the influent 3 6 mg nh4 n l during the first 48 h reflecting the elution of pore water in soil at the beginning of the experiment and then gradually decreased to stable level of 14 1 mg n l at the end of the experiment nox concentration was below 1 mg n l during the first 24 h and gradually increased to the level of 23 0 31 1 mg n l close to that in the influent 28 0 mg n l after 44 h nox concentration decreased and was under the detection limit by the end of the experiment fig 4 a accordingly the ph of the eluent from column a was 6 2 7 0 during the first 42 h and then increased to 7 4 8 3 indicating the no x loss was likely due to the denitrification process fig s3 in column b the tn concentration in eluent was stable 33 74 mg l throughout the experiment fig 4b nh4 was released during the first 24 h at 28 3 45 4 mg n l similar to that in column a however nox was under the detection limit for the first 24 h and then gradually increased to 3 1 mg n l after 48 h both nh4 and nox reached the influent level and tn was the same as that in the influent indicating no further nitrogen leaching occurred in the column the accumulative masses of legacy nitrogen leached were 10 7 mg n from column a 8 7 of the tn stored in the column and 2 8 mg n from column b 2 6 of the tn stored in the column respectively the tin leached from column a was 2 7 mg n 76 9 of tin in the column and tin leached from column b 1 8 mg n was higher than the tin initially present in column b 0 39 mg n table 2 3 3 2 scenario ii nitrogen leaching during heavy rain event the leaching test was conducted with soil packed column from pool a trace cations and anions in rain water have very low concentration based on hps high purity standard sr 1 simulated rainwater rothert 1999 and they have little effect on the desorption test due to their low concentrations 0 5 mg l the leaching experiment lasted for 24 h until the eluent tn level reached the influent level indicating no further nitrogen leaching occurred fig s5 eluent tn concentration increased rapidly and peaked in the first 2 h 194 0 mg n l then decreased to undetectable values after 12 h indicating 75 0 of the leached legacy tn occurred in the first 4 h after first dosing nh4 and nox leaching from the column accounted for 36 4 and 2 7 of tn leached in the eluent during the experiment period the effluent ph was between 6 5 and 7 5 throughout the experiment fig s3 total nitrogen leached from column a reached a constant value after accumulation of 60 ml of eluent for both scenarios twice the porous volume of the column fig 5 the comparison between these two scenarios normalized by eluent volume 60 ml showed that tn in the eluent was 10 7 mg n in scenario i and 6 9 mg n in scenario ii nh4 level in the eluent reached 2 0 mg n 18 7 of tn in scenario i and 2 9 mg n 42 0 of tn in scenario ii and nox in the eluent was 0 7 mg n in scenario i and 0 04 mg n in scenario ii fig 5 4 discussion the majority of legacy nitrogen in the soil was found to be present beneath the leaching pool and organic nitrogen was the major form of legacy nitrogen present table 1 this latter result is consistent with previous observations that the largest pool of nitrogen in most terrestrial environments is organic nitrogen soil organic nitrogen accumulation has been observed in agricultural soils of grasslands at a rate of 62 g n m2 per year meter et al 2016 the organic nitrogen in soil increased up to 1 2 mg n g soil after agricultural areas were urbanized lewis et al 2014 in our microbial analysis of the core samples microbial biomass only accounted for a small portion of the tn 0 03 0 2 suggesting the organic nitrogen is majorly from the organic contaminants in the wastewater toc beneath the pool showed a positive relation r 0 78 with the tn content in the soil matrix with exception of 0 15 2 cm of a 1 fig s1 such correlations between toc and tn have been observed in samples collected at different agricultural sites and the toc tn ratios were higher 25 than samples collected in this study 0 2 10 2 reeves 1997 lower toc tn ratios 2 5 10 were usually found for domestic wastewater zhao et al 2010 and the observed toc tn ratio in the soil samples a 1 2 2 8 8 b 1 6 3 13 1 of this study can be the result of the presence of domestic wastewater in the environment ammonium was the major form of inorganic nitrogen beneath the pools due to the redox conditions of the anoxic environment that prevented nitrification the increased nox levels observed farther from the pools was likely due to the higher oxygen levels in less saturated soil soil type may have a significant impact on nh4 adsorption abdulgawad et al 2009 kucic et al 2012 lumbanraja and evangelou 1994 yu et al 2011 for example the nh4 adsorption to soil such as volcanic ash peat clay silt and sandy soil was reported to be in the range of 0 6 1 9 mg nh4 n g soil mitsui et al 1960 while 0 08 0 10 mg nh4 n g soil were reported for silt loam and sand sieczka and koda 2016 clay silt particles accounted for 3 of samples at all depths from both sites therefore the soil s adsorption capacity for nh4 likely depended mostly on the organic matter content in the soil low ph of the soils beneath pool b 3 2 5 1 may result in a competition between protons h and nh4 for the adsorption sites on organic matter as the soil cation exchange capacity cec drops at acidic ph ross and ketterings 2011 therefore it was reasonable that much lower nh4 levels were observed in the cores collected beneath pool b fig 3 however due to the predominance of organic nitrogen at both sites no significant difference in total legacy nitrogen level was observed at site b and site a indicating acid washing of the pool did not affect the overall level of legacy nitrogen stored surrounding the pool the tn beneath the leaching pools pool a 4 1 0 6 mg n g soil and pool b 3 0 0 4 mg n g soil were comparable to the tn levels in agricultural soil 4 5 mg n g soil meter et al 2016 and wetlands 3 6 4 2 mg n g soil craft et al 2018 but much higher than typical tn levels in residential areas 0 5 mg n g soil with lawns covered on the surface raciti et al 2011 table 3 therefore the legacy nitrogen stored beneath the leaching pool can be considered a nitrogen source with the potential similar to agricultural and wetland environments based on the volume of soil beneath a leaching pool in the study area diameter 183 cm depth 61 0 cm and soil densities ρbulk dry soil a 1 3 g cm3 ρbulk dry soil b 1 6 g cm3 the typical nitrogen concentration in domestic wastewater of 40 60 mg n l hulsen et al 2014 mccarty et al 2011 and a minimum design wastewater flow of 110 gallons day 1 per bedroom state of new york department of health 2016 number of bedrooms at a 5 number of bedrooms at b 3 the measured legacy nitrogen accumulated beneath the leaching pool was equivalent to 17 39 days of domestic onsite wastewater nitrogen loading calculation explained in detail in supplementary material the total nitrogen in the mentioned volume beneath the leaching pool was 2 2 kg n and 1 9 kg n for site a and b respectively calculation in supplementary material based on these data the 340 000 leaching pools in suffolk county ny can store up to about 714 tons of legacy nitrogen the rate of legacy nitrogen accumulation in the surrounding soil of a leaching pool is hard to estimate due to unknown operational age of the leaching pool and the environmental conditions the calculated total legacy nitrogen accumulated beneath the leaching pools based on the results obtained in this study 714 000 kg n for 340 000 households tnave 2 1 kg n for pool a and b suggests the legacy nitrogen levels from leaching pools in suffolk county ny is equivalent to nearly half of the yearly tn contributed to great south bay from atmospheric deposition and fertilizers application kinney and valiela 2011 when the synthetic atu effluent was applied to the leaching columns at the designed loading rate scenario i it was possible that heterotrophic denitrification occurred in column a neutral ph with toc stored in the soils as the carbon source the calculated hydraulic retention time of 35 3 41 2 h in the column resulted in 0 02 kg n m 3 d 1 of no3 loading on the columns which could be removed based on the denitrification rates reported in the literature 0 03 kg n m 3 d 1 no3 removal rate in submerged sand filters forbis stokes et al 2018 no3 was completely removed for each sampling 28 mg n l which indicated the hydraulics of the column provided enough time for complete denitrification the loss of nox during the first 24 h 22 ml in column a and 36 h 35 ml in column b was likely due to the dilution of nox with the pore water in the soil matrix the void space in the columns was approximately 30 ml porosity 0 3 0 35 that can be filled with water under saturated conditions the soil was saturated with pore water therefore the initial measurements likely revealed the nox concentrations in the pore water the low ph 4 in column b likely decreased the abundance and the activity of microorganisms in the soil rousk et al 2010 since the ph of the eluent from column b was below 4 throughout the experiment fig s3 it was less likely that nitrification or denitrification occurred in column b total leached nh4 from column b 1 1 mg n during the leaching period was more than the sum of total nh4 in the column and that in the influent 0 50 mg n since ammonification has been reported to occur at low ph 4 5 huang and chen 2009 kemmitt et al 2006 it was likely some organic nitrogen in the column was mineralized to nh4 fig s5 tn leached from column a was 3 8 times higher than tn leached from column b and the difference was mostly attributed by the on labile organic compounds more hydrophilic are more easily leached compared with the non labile organic compounds more hydrophobic that are adsorbed on the soil particles in previous studies it is reported that the hydrophobic organic compounds have a preference in adsorption to soil compared to hydrophilic compounds jardine et al 1989 the adsorption rate in the soil and hydrophobicity of soil was increased with lowering the ph alizadeh pasdar and li chan 2000 chaplain et al 2008 quiquampoix et al 1995 which can cause the organic nitrogen in column b to be more resistant to leaching although the environmental impact of dissolved on released from the soil to the waterbodies depends on the bioavailability of the organic compounds liu et al 2012 the leached on from the soil can contribute to eutrophication in coastal regions and should be considered for the simulated heavy rain event scenario ii nox leached from column a 0 25 mg n during the leaching period 24 h was more than the sum of total nox available in the column and that in the influent 0 12 mg n indicating 7 1 of nh4 in the column was nitrified during the leaching test table 2 there was no statistically significant difference two tail t test p 0 64 observed in the tn leached between two scenarios and the flow pattern intermittent dosing in scenario i or continuous flow in scenario ii through the column has little effect on the level of accumulated nitrogen in the eluent tn leached from column a accounted for 8 8 and 7 5 of tn in the soil at two scenarios respectively table 2 this small portion of leached legacy nitrogen from the soil was majorly due to the strong physical adsorption of organic compounds to the soil particles as discussed above our observation is also consistent with previous reports regarding the slow legacy nitrogen leaching estimations it was reported that the nitrogen loss from water drainage over the life of a forest was very little and dissolved organic nitrogen leached from forest soil was estimated to be 30 mg n m2 richtera et al 2000 meter at al found out there was a growing pool of soil organic nitrogen 142 10 12 g n over 30 years in agricultural soils of mississippi river basin that will have a 35 years lag time to deplete even if the addition of organic nitrogen was stopped at the time of study meter et al 2016 incubation of grassland soils over 350 days showed that 80 of soil bulk nitrogen was stable regardless of the soil texture or amount of nitrogen addition and nitrogen leached from the soils decreased rapidly and reached to a constant level 0 1 g n m2 d kaye et al 2002 nitrogen loading to the subsurface water at great south bay new york was estimated to be 1 074 595 kg n y and 507 187 kg n y from atmospheric deposition and fertilizer respectively kinney and valiela 2011 while nitrogen loading from wastewater treatment plant as point sources to long island sound was estimated to be 2 212 995 kg n y ammerman 2018 it is extremely difficult to estimate the overall leaching rate of legacy nitrogen from leaching pools to the groundwater due to the fact that the strongly adsorbed organic compounds may be leached out at a much slower rate compared with the rate observed in this study in addition the unknown operation conditions of each leaching pool may significantly affect our estimation of the leaching rate for example whether the leaching pool is continuously receiving wastewater or is abandoned and exposed to atmospheric oxygen i e aerobic anaerobic condition will affect the nitrogen transformations in the soil surrounding the pool at aerobic condition more on could be further hydrolyzed to ammonium and the soil microorganisms could use the ammonium as the energy and nitrogen source to proliferate furthermore the leaching tests were conducted for a relative short period of time 92 h the remaining on may be continuously ammonified and leached from the soil when oxidized atu effluent flows through in scenario ii our goal was to estimate how much legacy nitrogen could be leached out from current leaching pools during rain storm events the legacy nitrogen leached out during the experiment 7 5 of tn will be replenished with new wastewater as the leaching pool is constantly in use therefore based on the average of rainfall in new york state 117 4 cm y us climate data and the results of our leaching test 7 5 of legacy nitrogen was leached out from the column in 70 ml effluent 334 744 kg n y is expected to be leached out from the legacy nitrogen of current leaching pools which is comparable to the fertilizer contribution 507 187 kg n y at great south bay kinney and valiela 2011 but much lower 15 1 compared with the loading from wastewater treatment plant ammerman 2018 based on this study existing leaching pools have a potential to leach 62 832 kg n 8 8 of tn stored beneath all the 340 000 pools over 3 8 days when an atu is added to the owts and the current pool serves as the final disposal unit however the leaching of remaining legacy nitrogen would likely occur over many years i given the slow leaching rate of the organic compounds strongly adsorbed to the soil particles and ii the leached nitrogen may end up in various coastal water bodies in the north i e long island sound or south i e great south bay and other coastal estuaries on the south shore surrounding long island when considering legacy nitrogen leaching from current leaching pools since the nitrogen accumulation and leaching happen simultaneously in the soil the tn leached from rain event would be replenished from wastewater the tn loading rate to the coastal waters would be heavily affected by the weather the frequency and duration of rain storm event 5 conclusion the main findings presented in this study are summarized as follows the level of legacy nitrogen accumulated beneath the leaching pools was comparable to reported legacy nitrogen stored in the agricultural soil the level of ln decreased with increased depth and radial distance from the pool most of the legacy nitrogen ln in soil surrounding the leaching pool is in organic form while microbial biomass contributed to a negligible portion of the overall legacy nitrogen the major composition of tin in the soil beneath the pool was nh4 while nox level increased as the depth and lateral distance from the pool increased the total legacy nitrogen accumulated in soil beneath leaching pools were estimated to be 714 000 kg n for 340 000 households in suffolk county ny was equivalent to 17 39 days of domestic onsite wastewater nitrogen loading a small portion of ln 10 was leached from the soil during leaching tests there was no statistically significant difference of the tn leached at the two scenarios two tail t test p 0 64 and the pattern of flow intermittent dosing or continuous flow did not affect the level of accumulated nitrogen in the eluent ph has a significant impact on nitrogen transformations of ln in the soil it was possible that

18346,this study examined whether the accumulation of nitrogen legacy nitrogen within and surrounding leaching pools for onsite wastewater treatment may act as a source of nitrogen contamination to groundwater upon changes to the quantity and or composition of the influent to the pool in this study one concrete leaching pool with neutral ph a ph 6 9 and one leaching pool after acid washing b ph 3 7 were selected to examine the quantity and composition of legacy nitrogen in the surrounding soil as well as evaluate the potential release of this nitrogen under two environmentally relevant leaching scenarios i the concrete leaching pool serves as the final discharge unit for aerobic treatment unit atu effluent ii extreme weather events flash flood heavy rains act to increase the quantity and dilute the composition of flow to the pool core sample analysis showed that organic nitrogen accounts for the majority 97 3 99 7 of the total nitrogen tn at site a 4 1 0 6 mg n g soil and site b 3 0 0 4 mg n g soil while ammonium was the major form of inorganic nitrogen present at the sites the tn accumulated under the two leaching pools was equivalent to approximately 17 39 days of nitrogen loading to the system ph had a significant impact on the mass of tn leached from the soil while no significant difference in leached tn was observed for the two leaching scenarios the amount of tn leached from the soil matrix was not affected by the flow rate 18 6 ml d in scenario i vs 547 2 ml d in scenario ii or flow pattern intermittent dosing vs continuous flow the quantity of tn leached from soils in both scenario i and ii was low and accounted for 2 6 8 9 of the total nitrogen in the soil graphical abstract image 1 keywords owts legacy nitrogen adsorption leaching

wolfe and patz 2002 more than 40 of the residents in new england states and more than 60 million people in the us rely on onsite wastewater treatment systems owts epa 2002 regulatory authorities are incentivizing upgrades of owtss such as leaching pools which is a large concrete ring with holes on the wall and it is usually installed in the ground to receive septic tank effluent and septic systems which are not designed to remove nitrogen to advanced owtss capable of removing total nitrogen tn in many regions owtss consist of septic tanks and drain field systems epa 2002 however in suffolk county ny more than 340 000 houses rely on septic tanks and leaching pools as the major form of the owts borchardt et al 2003 munster 2004 the other challenge in reducing nitrogen loading to coastal groundwater is the accumulation of nitrogen within these watersheds due to past disposal practices van meter et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 this accumulated nitrogen so called legacy nitrogen has been shown to hinder efforts to alleviate water quality problems in coastal waters basu et al 2010 as well as the mississippi river basin van meter et al 2017 we know little about the amount and composition of legacy nitrogen remaining in the soil surrounding owtss gill et al 2008 showed the potential nitrogen loading to the groundwater from the soil receiving septic effluent 3 2 5 5 g n d per person was significantly higher than the soil receiving secondary treated effluent 0 3 4 2 g n d per person gill et al 2008 in another study van breemen et al evaluated the nitrogen inputs to large watershed in the northeastern u s a they reported the difference between the per capita waste excretion and the per capita intake was 1 9 kg n year per person this amount of nitrogen was either retained or denitrified during the septic and sewage treatment process van breemen et al 2002 few studies have focused on the presence of legacy nitrogen and its level in current owtss and the surrounding soil while a few studies were conducted to investigate the quantity of legacy nitrogen in other types of soil the tn in abandoned agricultural fields was reported to be 0 17 mg n g soil depth 10 60 cm johaness m h knops 2000 an estimation of nitrogen content using the database from world inventory of soil emission potential wise showed that the nitrogen content in humus rich

shown the variation in soil nitrogen levels in residential areas due to anthropogenic activities it was found that non labile organic nitrogen on in soil nearly doubled in selected residential areas 1

in conventional owtss boyer and rock 1992 aerobic treatment units atus have been proposed as a potential solution for onsite wastewater treatment atus work as a secondary biological treatment unit to improve the removal of bod and oxidize ammonium nh4 to nitrate no3 via biological nitrification hazen and sawyer 2015 smith et al 2008 it has been estimated that advanced owtss atus with passive nitrogen reduction systems with nitrification and denitrification stages can remove more tn 96 7 100 over their lifetime in comparison to conventional septic systems with drain fields 61 65 diaz elsayed et al 2017 one prospective configuration would channel treated effluent from a newly installed aerated onsite treatment system back into the pre existing leaching pool for dispersal to groundwater a potential concern in such a design arises how installation of an atu may impact the composition of released legacy nitrogen when the atu effluent is discharged to existing leaching pools furthermore little is known about the potential release of legacy nitrogen from owtss to groundwater during rain events especially in coastal areas in this study we hypothesized that the legacy nitrogen remaining around existing leaching pools could be released to groundwater when i an atu is added to the owts and ii during water flushes through system at high flow rate such as during a heavy rain event we also hypothesize that the level of nitrogen present in the soil matrix depends on the amount of organic matter present to test these hypotheses the objectives of this study were 1 investigate the level and composition of legacy nitrogen remaining in the soil matrix of owtss with neutral and low ph 2 evaluate the effect of soil matrix properties e g ph on nitrogen adsorption capacity and 3 determine the extent of nitrogen leaching under different environmentally related scenarios e g atu effluent and heavy rain events 2 materials and methods 2 1 sites description and samples collection two field sites were selected for this study both of which consisted of single family homes utilizing concrete leaching pools as owtss since 1972 all the onsite wastewater dispersal systems on long island consisted of concrete leaching pools and septic tanks therefore the field sites were representative of typical owtss in suffolk county ny the owts at site a pool a was receiving wastewater and had neutral ph while the other owts at site b pool b had been acid washed to alleviate a pipe clogging issue before the sampling event site descriptions and boring test results are summarized in tables s1 and s2 soil cores length 61 cm i e 24 inch were collected at the center of and beneath the leaching pool at each site fig 1 additional soil cores surrounding the leaching pools up gradient and down gradient of the groundwater flow were collected at site a core samples were taken using a geoprobe consisting of a dual tube direct pushing sampling system the samples were sealed

conducted as soon as the samples were transported to the lab to minimize exposure to atmospheric oxygen n2 gas was flushed through a 1l de ionized water bottle and for each sample a volume of 20 ml of prepared anoxic de ionized water was mixed with 10 g samples from each 15 2 cm 6 inch depth interval and incubated at room temperature for 15 min on a shaker table at 200 rpm samples were then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min and the supernatant was removed for nh4 and no3 no2 measurement laima 1992 morin and morse 1999 anoxic potassium chloride kcl solution 2n was then added to the remaining sample the samples were then shaken at 200 rpm for 60 min centrifuged and the supernatant was extracted and filtered 0 45 μm millipore for nh4 and no3 no2 measurement this extraction process was repeated twice to recover all inorganic nitrogen species adsorbed on the soil matrix nh4 and nox were measured colorimetrically using a spectrophotometer polarstar omega bmg in brief nh4 was measured by the phenolhypochlorite method solorzano 1969 and combined no3 no2 was measured as no2 with griess reagent after previously reducing all no3 to no2 with vanadium chloride doane and horwath 2003 total carbon tc total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn were also measured in core samples 40 g of wet soil sample at each depth was dried over night at 70 c and then was ground and homogenized to fine powder schumacher 2002 10 g dried sample was used for tc and tn measurement an additional 10 g of sample was further treated in a heated water bath 40 c with 10 hydrochloric acid hcl v v 1 5 for 5 h to remove carbonate schumacher 2002 the samples were then washed with distilled water three times and dried overnight at 70 c for toc measurement schumacher 2002 elemental analyzer carbon nitrogen sulfur cns carlo erba was used to measure tc toc and tn in the samples 2 4 nitrogen leaching tests nitrogen leaching tests were performed to investigate the extent of nitrogen release from the soil matrix under two scenarios i when an owts is upgraded with an atu unit and the original leaching pool serves as the final dispersal unit for the atu effluent and ii when water flushes through the leaching pool and surrounding soil soil samples were homogenized under an n2 environment to minimize the exposure to atmospheric oxygen and the samples were transferred to sealed containers and maintained at 4 c before the leaching test two identical glass desorption columns d 22 mm length 300 mm chromaflex were packed with the soil matrix collected from sites a and b fig s2 every 6 cm of the column was packed with the homogeneous soil sample to represent every 15 2 cm of onsite soil detailed column packing information is summarized in table s3 tn in the experimental columns was calculated based on the measurements of in situ tn at 15 2 cm 6 inch depth intervals table s3 the hydraulic loading rate for scenario i was selected to be 1 2 gal ft 2 d 1 18 6 ml d the typical design loading rate for residential leaching pool systems based on the new york state design standard new york state and department of environmental conservation 2014 suffolk county department of health services 2017 the columns were dosed six times a day at 2 0 ml min 1 of 3 1ml dose with a peristaltic pump ismatech reglo cole parmer the synthetic atu effluent table s4 contained 3 6 mg nh4 n l 28 0 mg nox n l and 100 mg caco3 l alkalinity representing typical nitrogen and alkalinity levels of an aeration treatment unit from what we have observed in field monitoring unpublished data the leaching test was conducted for 92 h and the eluent samples were collected from the outlet of the columns at 4 h intervals the supernatant was filtered for ph nh4 no3 no2 measurement tn was measured by the persulfate digestion tnt plus 826 method with a hach spectrophotometer dr6000 hach to investigate the effect of rain water on the leaching of legacy nitrogen from the soil scenario ii synthetic rain water was prepared at ph 4 6 similar to hps high purity standard sr 1 simulated rainwater rothert 1999 and contained 0 7 mg n l tn 0 2 mg n l nox and 0 5 mg n l on tanner 1999 the continuous flow

site a was fed with the synthetic rain water for 24 h and the eluent aqueous samples were collected at 1 h intervals for nitrogen species analyses 2 5 statistical analysis two tail t test was used in order to compare a the total nitrogen level measured beneath sites a and site b and b the total nitrogen leached from column a in two scenarios ibm spss statistics 25 was used in the statistical analysis 3 results 3 1 physical and chemical properties of soil cores grain size distribution analyses of samples collected beneath and surrounding pool a showed uniform composition with a majority of the samples consisting of sand 96 97 with a small amount of gravel 0 8 1 6 and clay silt 2 0 2 8 table 1 the soil type and the physical properties of the samples at the two sites were similar to a soil survey conducted in the study area by us department of agriculture soil conservation service cornell agriculture experiment station warner et al 1975 indicating the fine loam sand soil type table s2 the soil bulk densities measured at both sites and various depths ranged from 1 1 to 1 8 g cm3 table 1 slightly lower than the reported maximum dry densities of soil in the study area 1 7 2 0 g cm3 brookhaven suffolk county ny warner et al 1975 the moisture content beneath pool a at sampling location a 1 21 6 29 7 was higher than a 2 a 3 and a 4 8 2 18 1 due to continuous application of wastewater from the leaching pool samples collected below 30 5 cm 12 at site a and b were below the ground water table fig 1 over the duration of this study the moisture content of samples directly under both pools pool a 21 6 29 7 pool b 24 2 34 9 were close to those expected for saturated sand 33 9 7 3 cosbyg et al 1984 neutral ph was observed in cores collected beneath and surrounding pool a 6 5 7 4 while cores collected beneath pool b showed acidic ph 3 2 3 4 due to previous acid washing table 1 soil cores collected directly beneath the pools a 1 and b 1 contained the highest toc 1 2 7 9 mg toc g soil and 1 2 8 8 mg toc g soil respectively in general the toc content decreased with increased sampling depth and lateral distance from the leaching pool table 1 at pool a as the sampling depth increased to 45 7 61 cm beneath the pool toc level was 1 22 mg g soil about 26 of that at 0 15 2 cm 4 74 mg g soil the toc level at the edge of pool a a 2 was 2 30 mg g soil at 0 15 2 cm about 50 of that right beneath the pool when the lateral distance further increased to 1 foot 30 5 cm from the edge of the pool a 3 the toc level was 0 27 mg g soil at 0 15 2 cm which was 5 7 of that right beneath the pool in the up gradient reference soil cores a 4 toc was undetected at all sampling depths table 1 dna extraction of a 1 and b 1 showed that the number of bacterial cells was around 108 cell g 1 soil with the assumption of 1 5 fg dna in one bacteria cell christensen et al 1995 table s5 the level of microbial cells previously reported was 2 9 108 10 108 cell g 1 soil for typical grasslands polyanskaya et al 2015 which is in the same range of our study the legacy nitrogen in the form of microbial biomass was negligible 1 of the tn measured in the core samples supplementary material microbial analysis 3 2 the presence and composition of legacy nitrogen the highest total legacy nitrogen tn level was observed at 0 15 2 cm beneath the pool 1 7 mg g soil for pool a and 1 3 mg g soil for pool b and the level decreased as the sampling depth increased fig 2 although the soil ph was different at site a and b table 1 there was no statistically significant difference in the amount of tn beneath the pool at each depth every 15 2 cm between the two sites two tail t test p 0 77 the tn level also decreased as the sample radial distance increased from the pool no tn was detected at the depth of 30 5 61 cm 12 24 from the cores surrounding the pool a 2 and a 3 and no tn was detected in the reference core a 4 fig 2 therefore in the defined study area for pool a from a 1 a 2 a 3 to a 4 excavated radius 701 0 cm depth 61 cm volume 94 1 m3 at site a the majority of tn 87 2 measured was present directly beneath the leaching pool compared to the surrounding environment the average tn beneath the leaching pool 0 61 cm 0 24 was calculated to be 4 1 0 6 mg n g soil and 3 0 0 4 mg n g soil for a 1 and b 1 respectively more than 95 of tn in the soil beneath the pools a 1 and b 1 was in organic form table 1 the major form of total inorganic nitrogen tin 99 in samples collected beneath the pools was nh4 fig 3 the level of tin beneath pool a 0 12 mg tin g soil was about 10 times higher than that beneath pool b 0 01 mg tin g soil fig 3 nox was undetected beneath the leaching pools at both sites but accounted for a higher portion of tin outside the leaching pool at site a where the level of nox increased from a range of 0 0 33 3 of tn at the edge of the pool a 2 to 50 0 100 0 of tn at 1 foot away from the leaching pool a 3 in the reference cores a 4 no nh4 was detected while about 0 01 mg nox n g soil was observed a level similar to the nitrate concentration in uncontaminated sandy soils 0 014 mg nox n g soil weil and brady 2016 3 3 nitrogen leaching from bench scale columns leaching tests were performed to investigate the extent of legacy nitrogen release from the soil matrix when an owts is upgraded with an atu and the leaching pool serves as the final dispersal unit for atu effluent the hydraulic conductivity of the soil was approximately 0 7 1 0 mm s d10 0 0297 cm from grain size analysis on the soil from each sample which is in the range of previous studies of 0 5 1 1 mm s in sand and gravel aquifer hess et al 1992 warren et al 1996 the calculated average hydraulic retention time for the 24 cm soil packed column was 35 3 41 2 h in scenario i and 1 2 1 4 h in scenario ii 3 3 1 scenario i nitrogen leaching with synthetic atu effluent when an existing owts i e septic tank with leaching pool in this study is upgraded the existing leaching pool can potentially serve as the final dispersal unit for the atu effluent e g the effluent from the aeration tank at the designed loading rate this option would reduce the capital cost of excavating a new dispersal unit for the atu effluent and could potentially be a more cost effective option for the owts upgrade tn in the soil of leaching column a 122 3 mg n and column b 107 3 mg n were calculated based on the tn measurement at each depth table s3 the leaching experiment was conducted for 92 h until the effluent tn concentration reached the same level as that in the influent fig 4 as the synthetic atu effluent passed through column a tn concentration in the eluent reached the highest level 398 mg l at 12 h then gradually decreased after 48 h fig 4 a indicating 92 7 of the leached legacy tn 10 74 mg n occurred in the first 48 h table 2 nh4 concentration in the eluent 26 2 52 2 mg n l was higher than that in the influent 3 6 mg nh4 n l during the first 48 h reflecting the elution of pore water in soil at the beginning of the experiment and then gradually decreased to stable level of 14 1 mg n l at the end of the experiment nox concentration was below 1 mg n l during the first 24 h and gradually increased to the level of 23 0 31 1 mg n l close to that in the influent 28 0 mg n l after 44 h nox concentration decreased and was under the detection limit by the end of the experiment fig 4 a accordingly the ph of the eluent from column a was 6 2 7 0 during the first 42 h and then increased to 7 4 8 3 indicating the no x loss was likely due to the denitrification process fig s3 in column b the tn concentration in eluent was stable 33 74 mg l throughout the experiment fig 4b nh4 was released during the first 24 h at 28 3 45 4 mg n l similar to that in column a however nox was under the detection limit for the first 24 h and then gradually increased to 3 1 mg n l after 48 h both nh4 and nox reached the influent level and tn was the same as that in the influent indicating no further nitrogen leaching occurred in the column the accumulative masses of legacy nitrogen leached were 10 7 mg n from column a 8 7 of the tn stored in the column and 2 8 mg n from column b 2 6 of the tn stored in the column respectively the tin leached from column a was 2 7 mg n 76 9 of tin in the column and tin leached from column b 1 8 mg n was higher than the tin initially present in column b 0 39 mg n table 2 3 3 2 scenario ii nitrogen leaching during heavy rain event the leaching test was conducted with soil packed column from pool a trace cations and anions in rain water have very low concentration based on hps high purity standard sr 1 simulated rainwater rothert 1999 and they have little effect on the desorption test due to their low concentrations 0 5 mg l the leaching experiment lasted for 24 h until the eluent tn level reached the influent level indicating no further nitrogen leaching occurred fig s5 eluent tn concentration increased rapidly and peaked in the first 2 h 194 0 mg n l then decreased to undetectable values after 12 h indicating 75 0 of the leached legacy tn occurred in the first 4 h after first dosing nh4 and nox leaching from the column accounted for 36 4 and 2 7 of tn leached in the eluent during the experiment period the effluent ph was between 6 5 and 7 5 throughout the experiment fig s3 total nitrogen leached from column a reached a constant value after accumulation of 60 ml of eluent for both scenarios twice the porous volume of the column fig 5 the comparison between these two scenarios normalized by eluent volume 60 ml showed that tn in the eluent was 10 7 mg n in scenario i and 6 9 mg n in scenario ii nh4 level in the eluent reached 2 0 mg n 18 7 of tn in scenario i and 2 9 mg n 42 0 of tn in scenario ii and nox in the eluent was 0 7 mg n in scenario i and 0 04 mg n in scenario ii fig 5 4 discussion the majority of legacy nitrogen in the soil was found to be present beneath the leaching pool and organic nitrogen was the major form of legacy nitrogen present table 1 this latter result is consistent with previous observations that the largest pool of nitrogen in most terrestrial environments is organic nitrogen soil organic nitrogen accumulation has been observed in agricultural soils of grasslands at a rate of 62 g n m2 per year meter et al 2016 the organic nitrogen in soil increased up to 1 2 mg n g soil after agricultural areas were urbanized lewis et al 2014 in our microbial analysis of the core samples microbial biomass only accounted for a small portion of the tn 0 03 0 2 suggesting the organic nitrogen is majorly from the organic contaminants in the wastewater toc beneath the pool showed a positive relation r 0 78 with the tn content in the soil matrix with exception of 0 15 2 cm of a 1 fig s1 such correlations between toc and tn have been observed in samples collected at different agricultural sites and the toc tn ratios were higher 25 than samples collected in this study 0 2 10 2 reeves 1997 lower toc tn ratios 2 5 10 were usually found for domestic wastewater zhao et al 2010 and the observed toc tn ratio in the soil samples a 1 2 2 8 8 b 1 6 3 13 1 of this study can be the result of the presence of domestic wastewater in the environment ammonium was the major form of inorganic nitrogen beneath the pools due to the redox conditions of the anoxic environment that prevented nitrification the increased nox levels observed farther from the pools was likely due to the higher oxygen levels in less saturated soil soil type may have a significant impact on nh4 adsorption abdulgawad et al 2009 kucic et al 2012 lumbanraja and evangelou 1994 yu et al 2011 for example the nh4 adsorption to soil such as volcanic ash peat clay silt and sandy soil was reported to be in the range of 0 6 1 9 mg nh4 n g soil mitsui et al 1960 while 0 08 0 10 mg nh4 n g soil were reported for silt loam and sand sieczka and koda 2016 clay silt particles accounted for 3 of samples at all depths from both sites therefore the soil s adsorption capacity for nh4 likely depended mostly on the organic matter content in the soil low ph of the soils beneath pool b 3 2 5 1 may result in a competition between protons h and nh4 for the adsorption sites on organic matter as the soil cation exchange capacity cec drops at acidic ph ross and ketterings 2011 therefore it was reasonable that much lower nh4 levels were observed in the cores collected beneath pool b fig 3 however due to the predominance of organic nitrogen at both sites no significant difference in total legacy nitrogen level was observed at site b and site a indicating acid washing of the pool did not affect the overall level of legacy nitrogen stored surrounding the pool the tn beneath the leaching pools pool a 4 1 0 6 mg n g soil and pool b 3 0 0 4 mg n g soil were comparable to the tn levels in agricultural soil 4 5 mg n g soil meter et al 2016 and wetlands 3 6 4 2 mg n g soil craft et al 2018 but much higher than typical tn levels in residential areas 0 5 mg n g soil with lawns covered on the surface raciti et al 2011 table 3 therefore the legacy nitrogen stored beneath the leaching pool can be considered a nitrogen source with the potential similar to agricultural and wetland environments based on the volume of soil beneath a leaching pool in the study area diameter 183 cm depth 61 0 cm and soil densities ρbulk dry soil a 1 3 g cm3 ρbulk dry soil b 1 6 g cm3 the typical nitrogen concentration in domestic wastewater of 40 60 mg n l hulsen et al 2014 mccarty et al 2011 and a minimum design wastewater flow of 110 gallons day 1 per bedroom state of new york department of health 2016 number of bedrooms at a 5 number of bedrooms at b 3 the measured legacy nitrogen accumulated beneath the leaching pool was equivalent to 17 39 days of domestic onsite wastewater nitrogen loading calculation explained in detail in supplementary material the total nitrogen in the mentioned volume beneath the leaching pool was 2 2 kg n and 1 9 kg n for site a and b respectively calculation in supplementary material based on these data the 340 000 leaching pools in suffolk county ny can store up to about 714 tons of legacy nitrogen the rate of legacy nitrogen accumulation in the surrounding soil of a leaching pool is hard to estimate due to unknown operational age of the leaching pool and the environmental conditions the calculated total legacy nitrogen accumulated beneath the leaching pools based on the results obtained in this study 714 000 kg n for 340 000 households tnave 2 1 kg n for pool a and b suggests the legacy nitrogen levels from leaching pools in suffolk county ny is equivalent to nearly half of the yearly tn contributed to great south bay from atmospheric deposition and fertilizers application kinney and valiela 2011 when the synthetic atu effluent was applied to the leaching columns at the designed loading rate scenario i it was possible that heterotrophic denitrification occurred in column a neutral ph with toc stored in the soils as the carbon source the calculated hydraulic retention time of 35 3 41 2 h in the column resulted in 0 02 kg n m 3 d 1 of no3 loading on the columns which could be removed based on the denitrification rates reported in the literature 0 03 kg n m 3 d 1 no3 removal rate in submerged sand filters forbis stokes et al 2018 no3 was completely removed for each sampling 28 mg n l which indicated the hydraulics of the column provided enough time for complete denitrification the loss of nox during the first 24 h 22 ml in column a and 36 h 35 ml in column b was likely due to the dilution of nox with the pore water in the soil matrix the void space in the columns was approximately 30 ml porosity 0 3 0 35 that can be filled with water under saturated conditions the soil was saturated with pore water therefore the initial measurements likely revealed the nox concentrations in the pore water the low ph 4 in column b likely decreased the abundance and the activity of microorganisms in the soil rousk et al 2010 since the ph of the eluent from column b was below 4 throughout the experiment fig s3 it was less likely that nitrification or denitrification occurred in column b total leached nh4 from column b 1 1 mg n during the leaching period was more than the sum of total nh4 in the column and that in the influent 0 50 mg n since ammonification has been reported to occur at low ph 4 5 huang and chen 2009 kemmitt et al 2006 it was likely some organic nitrogen in the column was mineralized to nh4 fig s5 tn leached from column a was 3 8 times higher than tn leached from column b and the difference was mostly attributed by the on labile organic compounds more hydrophilic are more easily leached compared with the non labile organic compounds more hydrophobic that are adsorbed on the soil particles in previous studies it is reported that the hydrophobic organic compounds have a preference in adsorption to soil compared to hydrophilic compounds jardine et al 1989 the adsorption rate in the soil and hydrophobicity of soil was increased with lowering the ph alizadeh pasdar and li chan 2000 chaplain et al 2008 quiquampoix et al 1995 which can cause the organic nitrogen in column b to be more resistant to leaching although the environmental impact of dissolved on released from the soil to the waterbodies depends on the bioavailability of the organic compounds liu et al 2012 the leached on from the soil can contribute to eutrophication in coastal regions and should be considered for the simulated heavy rain event scenario ii nox leached from column a 0 25 mg n during the leaching period 24 h was more than the sum of total nox available in the column and that in the influent 0 12 mg n indicating 7 1 of nh4 in the column was nitrified during the leaching test table 2 there was no statistically significant difference two tail t test p 0 64 observed in the tn leached between two scenarios and the flow pattern intermittent dosing in scenario i or continuous flow in scenario ii through the column has little effect on the level of accumulated nitrogen in the eluent tn leached from column a accounted for 8 8 and 7 5 of tn in the soil at two scenarios respectively table 2 this small portion of leached legacy nitrogen from the soil was majorly due to the strong physical adsorption of organic compounds to the soil particles as discussed above our observation is also consistent with previous reports regarding the slow legacy nitrogen leaching estimations it was reported that the nitrogen loss from water drainage over the life of a forest was very little and dissolved organic nitrogen leached from forest soil was estimated to be 30 mg n m2 richtera et al 2000 meter at al found out there was a growing pool of soil organic nitrogen 142 10 12 g n over 30 years in agricultural soils of mississippi river basin that will have a 35 years lag time to deplete even if the addition of organic nitrogen was stopped at the time of study meter et al 2016 incubation of grassland soils over 350 days showed that 80 of soil bulk nitrogen was stable regardless of the soil texture or amount of nitrogen addition and nitrogen leached from the soils decreased rapidly and reached to a constant level 0 1 g n m2 d kaye et al 2002 nitrogen loading to the subsurface water at great south bay new york was estimated to be 1 074 595 kg n y and 507 187 kg n y from atmospheric deposition and fertilizer respectively kinney and valiela 2011 while nitrogen loading from wastewater treatment plant as point sources to long island sound was estimated to be 2 212 995 kg n y ammerman 2018 it is extremely difficult to estimate the overall leaching rate of legacy nitrogen from leaching pools to the groundwater due to the fact that the strongly adsorbed organic compounds may be leached out at a much slower rate compared with the rate observed in this study in addition the unknown operation conditions of each leaching pool may significantly affect our estimation of the leaching rate for example whether the leaching pool is continuously receiving wastewater or is abandoned and exposed to atmospheric oxygen i e aerobic anaerobic condition will affect the nitrogen transformations in the soil surrounding the pool at aerobic condition more on could be further hydrolyzed to ammonium and the soil microorganisms could use the ammonium as the energy and nitrogen source to proliferate furthermore the leaching tests were conducted for a relative short period of time 92 h the remaining on may be continuously ammonified and leached from the soil when oxidized atu effluent flows through in scenario ii our goal was to estimate how much legacy nitrogen could be leached out from current leaching pools during rain storm events the legacy nitrogen leached out during the experiment 7 5 of tn will be replenished with new wastewater as the leaching pool is constantly in use therefore based on the average of rainfall in new york state 117 4 cm y us climate data and the results of our leaching test 7 5 of legacy nitrogen was leached out from the column in 70 ml effluent 334 744 kg n y is expected to be leached out from the legacy nitrogen of current leaching pools which is comparable to the fertilizer contribution 507 187 kg n y at great south bay kinney and valiela 2011 but much lower 15 1 compared with the loading from wastewater treatment plant ammerman 2018 based on this study existing leaching pools have a potential to leach 62 832 kg n 8 8 of tn stored beneath all the 340 000 pools over 3 8 days when an atu is added to the owts and the current pool serves as the final disposal unit however the leaching of remaining legacy nitrogen would likely occur over many years i given the slow leaching rate of the organic compounds strongly adsorbed to the soil particles and ii the leached nitrogen may end up in various coastal water bodies in the north i e long island sound or south i e great south bay and other coastal estuaries on the south shore surrounding long island when considering legacy nitrogen leaching from current leaching pools since the nitrogen accumulation and leaching happen simultaneously in the soil the tn leached from rain event would be replenished from wastewater the tn loading rate to the coastal waters would be heavily affected by the weather the frequency and duration of rain storm event 5 conclusion the main findings presented in this study are summarized as follows the level of legacy nitrogen accumulated beneath the leaching pools was comparable to reported legacy nitrogen stored in the agricultural soil the level of ln decreased with increased depth and radial distance from the pool most of the legacy nitrogen ln in soil surrounding the leaching pool is in organic form while microbial biomass contributed to a negligible portion of the overall legacy nitrogen the major composition of tin in the soil beneath the pool was nh4 while nox level increased as the depth and lateral distance from the pool increased the total legacy nitrogen accumulated in soil beneath leaching pools were estimated to be 714 000 kg n for 340 000 households in suffolk county ny was equivalent to 17 39 days of domestic onsite wastewater nitrogen loading a small portion of ln 10 was leached from the soil during leaching tests there was no statistically significant difference of the tn leached at the two scenarios two tail t test p 0 64 and the pattern of flow intermittent dosing or continuous flow did not affect the level of accumulated nitrogen in the eluent ph has a significant impact on nitrogen transformations of ln in the soil it was possible that heterotrophic denitrification occurred during the leaching test with toc stored in the soils as the carbon source in the leaching column with neutral ph declaration of competing interest the authors

18347,algal and bacterial communities play a major role in the treatment performance and efficiency of waste stabilisation ponds wsps however the study of these wsp microbial communities has been challenging flow cytometry fcm has been used widely as a rapid culture independent method of characterising algae and or bacteria in a range of freshwater and marine environments and in conventional wastewater treatment processes but its application to wsp wastewater has been underexplored in this study a method for the characterisation of both algal and bacterial microbial populations in wsp wastewater is presented and standardised using cultures and field samples we show that syto 16 dye is more effective than sybr green i for the concurrent detection of both algae and bacteria in samples through gating and phenotypic diversity analysis the fcm results show both spatial and temporal shifts in pond microbial communities the ability to rapidly determine the spatiotemporal shifts in pond populations is not only important for the improvement of pond operation and monitoring strategies but also for the planning and management flow cytometry has the potential to become a diagnostic tool for ponds to assess treatment performance and determine the most optimal operating conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords waste stabilisation ponds flow cytometry wastewater characterization microbial communities 1 introduction microorganisms such as algae and bacteria control the treatment efficiency and quality in waste stabilisation ponds wsps and understanding the complex dynamics between algae and bacteria is fundamental in both the design and operation of these systems pearson 2003 mara 2004 daims et al 2006 a mutualistic relationship exists between algae and bacteria in wsps oxygen produced through photosynthesis of algae is used by bacteria to oxidise wastewater biological oxygen demand bod while the carbon dioxide needed for the algae to photosynthesise is provided by the metabolism of pond bacteria mara 2004 bacteria are also responsible for nitrification and denitrification processes in ponds mara 2004 however the fact that pond design criteria have not significantly evolved over the past half century thirumurthi 1974 mara 2004 is an indication that there is still much to learn about wsp microbiology therefore it is clear that there is a need for both the detailed characterisation of microbial communities in wsps and an understanding of their role in treatment performance coggins et al 2019 understanding the occurrence and variability of wsp microbial communities will ensure better informed management and operation of sustainable water systems this is even more relevant considering the knowledge gap surrounding the role played by microbial communities in antibiotic resistance e g pruden 2014 the study of microbial communities is complicated due to their ability to evolve and respond to their environment over short time scales lautenschlager et al 2010 guenther et al 2012 besmer et al 2014 koch et al 2014 props et al 2016 this makes understanding the microbiology within wsps challenging the ability to monitor microbial communities in treatment plants is essential for maintenance for predicting or mitigating incidents and for informing improvements in plant design brown et al 2019 culture dependent methods can only detect a small fraction of bacteria found in aquatic environments staley and konopka 1985 which is evident in recent research in drinking water networks bartram et al 2003 allen et al 2004 hammes et al 2008 hammes and egli 2010 over time traditional culture based methods for detecting wastewater microbiology have been replaced with epifluorescence microscopy and quantitative real time pcr however these methods both have biases and limitations in their quantification brown et al 2019 the rapid characterisation of microbial communities in marine and fresh water environments has improved in recent years through the use of flow cytometry fcm gasol and del giorgio 2000 veldhuis and kraay 2000 hammes and egli 2010 wang et al 2010 flow cytometry is a culture independent analysis technique first developed in the 1960s and due to its ability to rapidly provide a broad range of information at the single cell level fcm has been successfully applied to the characterisation of microbial communities hammes and egli 2010 wang et al 2010 van nevel et al 2013 in the past decade fcm has been used widely in the assessment and monitoring of drinking water quality e g berney et al 2008 hammes et al 2008 de roy et al 2012 prest et al 2016 and is now a recognised guideline method for drinking water analysis in switzerland slmb 2012 moving from drinking water to wastewater over the past decade there have been in increasing number of studies reporting the use of fcm to study the microbiology of activated sludge processes used in conventional wastewater treatment plants e g foladori et al 2010 lee et al 2016 brown et al 2019 safford and bischel 2019 however due to the nature of the activated sludge process these studies are limited to the detection of wastewater bacteria only this leaves the study of microbial communities involved in wastewater treatment in wsps unexplored despite their critical role in treatment wastewater from wsps having high algal populations in addition to bacteria adds another layer of complexity to fcm analysis flow cytometry can be performed on organisms that are auto fluorescent such as phytoplankton algae while non fluorescent species such as bacteria require staining to distinguish them from background noise in previous studies sybr green i the most commonly used dye to distinguish bacterial communities in water and has been applied to develop a reproducible bacterial staining method for water quality monitoring prest et al 2013 the majority of past aquatic microbiological studies with fcm have focussed on algal and bacterial populations in isolation drinking water studies have focussed on the detection of bacteria only e g hammes et al 2008 prest et al 2016 while other marine and freshwater based studies have focussed on the detection of phytoplankton populations e g gasol and del giorgio 2000 crosbie et al 2003 dennis et al 2011 or viruses e g marie et al 1999 brussaard 2004 more recently we have seen examples of fcm being used to detect both algae and bacteria in marine samples e g patten et al 2018 von scheibner et al 2018 compared to these freshwater and marine environments the concentrations of algae and bacteria are orders of magnitude higher in wsps and even higher than those found in hypereutrophic lakes there is only one previous study using fcm to characterise wsp samples where it was used for the detection and sorting of photosynthetic and non photosynthetic events for further microbial analysis eland et al 2019 under normal operating conditions ponds can have different visual characteristics and some of the diversity can be found in western australian wsps fig 1 facultative ponds have a darker green grey colour fig 1e while a pond with a cyanobacterial bloom can be bright green with water having a thicker consistency and scum formation around the pond banks fig 1f furthermore wsps may also contain non biological inorganic and organic particles onto which bacteria and algae have the ability to attach and or to form biofilms on proctor and hammes 2015 proctor et al 2016 sgier et al 2016 this could interfere with fcm detection along with potentially fluorescent substances such as dissolved organic carbon doc hammes et al 2007 vital et al 2012 as previous wastewater studies have focussed on the characterisation of bacterial communities at conventional wastewater treatment plants only there is a need to develop a fcm method for analysing water from more biologically diverse environments such as wsps which are rich in both algae and bacteria the development of such a method will not only increase the accuracy and efficiency of characterisation of wsp microbiology but also act as a diagnostic tool to aid in the management of wsp assets the overall objective of this study is to develop a method for characterising wastewater autotrophic and heterotrophic microbial communities using fcm specifically the aims of this study are to 1 develop an optimal fluorescent staining protocol to distinguish both algae and bacterial groups in wsps and 2 determine the suitability of fcm for the assessment of variability of wsp microbiology on spatial and temporal scales 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites wastewater samples were collected from six treatment plants with varying pond layouts and loads all located south of perth western australia a summary of each site is included in table 1 each site has a different pond layout with various configurations of primary facultative and maturation ponds fig 1 at the pin fig 1b and 1d in particular the dimensions of the two primary facultative ponds are identical however pond 2 also has three baffles installed perpendicular to the flow to control the pond hydraulics while pond 1 does not 2 2 wastewater sampling incoming raw wastewater was sampled from the flow splitter prior to entering the ponds at pin only while in pond samples were collected from approximately 20 cm below the surface near the inlet and outlet of each study pond as the overall purpose of this study was to assess if fcm could be applied to the characterisation of wastewater samples one sample was collected from each location sampling at five of the sites bdt cran mtb tam and wag table 1 was carried out in september 2012 sampling at the sixth site pin was conducted in june august and october 2015 the samples at all of the sites were taken in winter spring when we expect algal growth to be lower due to less daylight hours and cooler temperatures all samples were collected using a motorised pump with careful attention to avoid stirring of the water and the collection of sludge samples were first collected into 1 l acid washed schott glass bottles of which 10 ml was transferred into 15 ml sample tubes and immediately fixed on site with 500 μl glutaraldehyde glutaraldehyde grade i 25 in h2o sigma aldrich sample tubes were then immediately stored on ice for transportation back to the laboratory upon arrival at the lab all samples were immediately stored in the freezer at 20 c until required for analysis 2 3 spectrofluorometry a fluoroprobe bbe moldaenke germany in bench top mode which uses light emitting diodes at five wavelengths to excite auto fluorescing photosynthetic cells beutler et al 2002 barrington and ghadouani 2008 was used to measure chlorophyll a chl a in all samples through spectrofluorometry this instrument not only determines the total phytoplankton chl a concentration but can also distinguish between chl a concentrations μg l 1 of four different phytoplankton groups chlorophyta green algae cyanobacteria blue green algae diatoms cryptophyta based on unique fluorescence patterns due to the high concentrations of chlorophyll a present in wastewater samples were diluted with milli q water to ensure concentrations within working range of the fluoroprobe 2 4 auto fluorescence protocol initially to assess the viability of flow cytometry for wastewater analysis only auto fluorescent characteristics of wastewater were investigated samples were not diluted in this part of the study but where samples exhibited some floc formation they were sonicated for 2 min in an ultrasonic bath at a frequency of 50 hz the effect of sonication on the algal flocs was investigated concurrently by sonicating some samples for 1 min 1 5 min and 2 min and then investigating them under a microscope it was found that sonicating samples up to 2 min did not damage the algae as after sonication for this amount of time there were still noticeable algal flocs present in the sample samples were then filtered through 35 μm nylon mesh into sterile 5 ml round bottom tubes bd falcon product 352235 2 5 cultures three cultures were used for reference in this study to develop fluorescence fingerprints bacteria algae and wsp wastewater the purpose of the cultures in this study was twofold to ensure that the flow cytometer could be calibrated for the acquisition of data and for the optimisation of the dye staining protocol with known entities the bacteria used was escherichia coli b strain m715 school of pathology and laboratory medicine the university of western australia cultured in tryptone soya broth cm0129 thermo fisher scientific usa at 35 c overnight 10 ml aliquots of the culture were centrifuged and washed with 1 phosphate buffered saline pbs solution twice then resuspended in 10 ml gf f 0 7 μm filtered milli q water and immediately fixed with 500 μl glutaraldehyde the green alga desmodesmus sp cs 899 csiro tasmania australia was grown in 1 l aerated flasks in wc medium at 19 1 c and 10 ml aliquots fixed with 500 μl glutaraldehyde a culture of wsp wastewater was fed with settled raw wastewater and aerated with co2 at 19 1 c 10 ml aliquots of this culture were fixed with 500 μl glutaraldehyde this wsp culture was established using a sample of in pond wastewater collected at pin site several months before this experiment this culture was maintained as described for use in other experiments not related to this study all fixed culture samples were immediately stored in the freezer at 20 c until required for analysis 2 6 fluorescence staining protocols due to the collected wastewater samples and cultures being highly concentrated it was necessary to dilute all samples prior to staining all samples were diluted with gf f 0 7 μm filtered milli q water samples were first filtered through 35 μm nylon mesh into sterile 5 ml round bottom tubes and then diluted with the pre filtered water a 1 50 dilution was used for the e coli and desmodesmus sp cultures while a 1 10 dilution was used for the wastewater culture and field samples in this study two dyes were used in order to compare their effectiveness with wastewater these dyes were sybr green i 10000 concentrate in dmso molecular probes and the newer generation syto 16 1 mm solution in dmso molecular probes syto 16 s16 was chosen as the emission maxima for this dye 518 nm is very similar to that of sybr green i 520 nm when using sybr green i sg samples were stained using 1 100 stock diluted in dmso with either 1 10 μl ml 1 or 5 concentration 50 μl ml 1 as described in prest et al 2013 samples were preheated to 35 c for 5 min and then sg stained before being incubated at 35 c in the dark for a further 10 min before measurement as there were no pre existing protocols for using s16 on water samples titrations were performed to determine the optimal dye concentration samples stained with s16 were vortexed to mix and then incubated in the dark for 30 min before measurement 2 7 flow cytometry samples were acquired on a bd facscanto ii flow cytometer bd biosciences new jersey usa using bd facsdiva software version 8 0 1 bd biosciences new jersey usa the instrument is equipped with three excitation lasers blue 488 nm 20 mw solid state red 633 nm 17 mw hene and violet 405 nm 30 mw solid state and sets of octagon and trigon detector arrays containing with various band pass and long pass filters for detection of algae only the instrument was set to threshold on far red off the blue laser 488 nm 695 40bp at 200 detector voltages were set at the following forward scatter fsc at 230 side scatter ssc at 314 488 nm 530 30bp at 509 488 nm 695 40bp at 260 and 633 nm 660 20bp at 420 for the detection of bacteria and algae the instrument was set to threshold on fsc log at 200 detector voltages were set at following fsc log at 285 ssc log at 314 488 nm 530 30bp at 269 488 nm 585 42bp at 324 488 nm 780 60bp at 420 and 633 nm 660 20bp at 313 for this instrument it should be noted that it is not possible to quantify the number cells without the use of counting beads counting beads were not used in this study all data was analysed using flowjo software version 10 flowjo llc oregon usa and gating was used to separate data from background noise 2 8 phenotypic analysis we performed an advanced computational analysis of the flow cytometry data in order to detect differences between the flow cytometry fingerprints of various sample locations and time points phenoflow package v1 0 available from https github com rprops phenoflow package props et al 2016 this approach computes so called phenotypic fingerprints of the microbial community by placing the measured cells into an equal spaced binning grid 128 128 and performing kernel density estimations on all bivariate parameter combinations of the selected fluorescence and scatter parameters i e 488 nm 530 30bp a 488 nm 780 60bp a ssc a fsc a the phenotypic fingerprints were calculated with default settings and were compared through principal coordinates analysis pcoa bray curtis dissimilarity the full analysis workflow can be found as an r markdown file at https github com rprops wsp coggins 2019 3 results 3 1 phytoplankton population the photosynthesising groups present in the wsps studied fig 2 are dominated by the presence of green algae co occurring with diatoms and less commonly with cryptophyta and cyanobacteria most notable is the variability of these spectral groups from site to site fig 2a and within a site fig 2b the total phytoplankton community concentrations expressed in chl a equivalent have a wide range of variability across the study sites the lowest concentration was measured at mtb fig 2a which was four times less than that at the site with the highest concentration pin fig 2b this result shows that these communities are highly variable between sites and within the same site as shown by the significant difference between splitter water raw wastewater and pond water fig 2b 3 2 auto fluorescent flow cytometric analysis auto fluorescent populations were identified at different sites fig 3 and are displayed through filtering via red 633 nm 660 20bp and green 488 nm 530 30bp band pass filters through gating one clear algal population was identified at tam at the inlet fig 3a and outlet of pond 2 fig 3b this is reflected in the spectrofluorometric analysis for the site fig 2a looking at the mean fluorescence intensity mfi at tam for the 488 nm 530 30bp the values were 1005 and 1333 at the inlet and outlet respectively and for the 633 nm 660 20bp the mfis were 3246 and 3977 at the inlet and outlet respectively this shows that the populations present at the inlet and outlet are the same the sample for bdt shows two distinct populations fig 3c along with cran fig 3d however the bdt populations are more excited by both the blue 488 nm and red 633 nm lasers with higher emission and better resolution in both red and green channels compared to cran there appears to be one distinct population present at mtb fig 3e which is bright in both channels the highest number of distinct populations is at wag fig 3f where four distinct populations are observed without the use of staining the results of this analysis show the ability of fcm to distinguish possible groups and sub groups of auto fluorescent microbial communities in wastewater 3 3 best staining protocol for wastewater samples further distinction in the wastewater microbial communities can be achieved with the application of stains a comparison of the efficacy of sg and s16 dyes is shown in fig 4 the emissions for the two different stains at various concentrations were compared for use with the e coli and desmodesmus sp cultures both dyes perform similarly in staining e coli fig 4a with all concentrations showing same staining intensity however when applied to the desmodesmus culture fig 4b it is clear that s16 at 1 μm and 2 μm concentrations result in better separation and as such resolution of population from the background i e unstained sample in comparison to 5 sg to further illustrate the performance of the staining the mfis for the dyes and concentrations tested are shown in table 2 based on this analysis it was determined that 1 μm s16 provided the best staining of both bacteria e coli and algae desmodesmus sp and was most suitable to apply for distinguishing bacterial and algal groups in wastewater samples 3 4 algal and bacterial populations in wastewater results of the identification of algal and bacterial groups at pin in october 2015 are shown in figs 5 7 with s16 stain detected in green channel 488 nm 530 30bp and autofluorescence of algae in far red 488 nm 780 60bp as well as forward scatter log for bacteria showing both stained red and unstained blue samples the gating strategy used here is qualitative only and are not the same between figures for pond 1 fig 5 the inlet shows the presence of three distinct algal groups fig 5a and four distinct bacterial groups fig 5b by the time the water has moved towards the outlet the number of distinct algal groups has decreased to two fig 5c while the bacterial populations remains unchanged fig 5d in pond 2 fig 6 the inlet has two distinct algal populations fig 6a and three distinct bacterial groups fig 6b like pond 1 the algal community diversity has decreased at the outlet of pond 2 where there is only one distinct algal group fig 6c while there are still three bacterial communities present fig 6d overall the signatures of ponds 1 and 2 are fairly similar moving to the raw wastewater in the splitter fig 7 there are two distinct bacterial groups which can be identified in the green channel fig 7a and b there is a small algal population present in the splitter water however overall the signature of the splitter water fig 7 is vastly different to that in pond figs 5 and 6 most importantly for all samples the shift of the populations from unstained blue to when the sample is stained with s16 red is very clear and demonstrates that 1 μm s16 enables resolution and identification here quantitative of bacterial and algal populations within the same sample comparing this spatial difference further the splitter signal was compared to the pond 1 inlet signal fig 8 a through green 488 nm 530 30bp and yellow orange 488 nm 585 42bp band pass filters the distinct splitter population is gated and shows that the shift in the in pond population at the inlet blue compared to the splitter orange the temporal change in wsp communities is shown in fig 8b where the distinct splitter population is gated and the results of analysis from june and august at the pond 2 outlet are compared the signals of splitter population black and the population at the outlet in june green are very similar while the october population blue has shifted similar to fig 7a this result clearly shows the temporal variability in the population the spatiotemporal variability in populations between and within sites is further confirmed through the principal coordinate pcoa analysis figs 9 10 across the five study sites fig 9 assessed using auto fluorescence only there is a higher degree of similarity between wag and bdt populations while tam is dissimilar from the other sites and in particular shows low diversity in population throughout the treatment train at each of the sites the populations show a high degree of variability along the treatment train ranging from the primary facultative ponds through to maturation ponds for this analysis sonication explained 13 7 of the variance p 0 001 while the site sample location explained 37 0 of the variance p 0 001 however it is important to note that the five sites have different design configurations and operational characteristics table 1 which will become important in the interpretation of these results within the same study site pin fig 10 the variability of the populations at the inlet and outlet were analysed for june august and october 2015 the differences between the populations at the inlet and outlet samples increase over time where location explained 30 5 of the variance p 0 01 and the time point explained 23 4 of the variance p 0 023 in june t1 fig 10 the pin communities are similar but become more different in august t2 and october t3 temporally shifts in populations are noticeable in the splitter as well as the ponds the pond 2 community is very similar to the splitter community in june 2015 this is shown also shown in fig 8b over time the diversity seen in pond 1 decreased to be comparable to that seen in pond 2 overall the communities present in the splitter remain stable over time 4 discussion 4 1 suitability of fcm for analysis of wastewater samples this study shows that fcm can be used for the concurrent detection and analysis of wsp wastewater samples that are rich in both algae and bacteria through the use of s16 dye sg has become the standard dye used in the analysis of water from various aquatic environments e g prest et al 2013 and is often used in combination with propidium iodide pi to assess the presence of dead cells however the results of this study show that while sg is very proficient in the staining of bacterial cells it is less effective at staining algal cells when compared to the newer generation s16 dye fig 4 the properties of these two cyanine dyes are similar each having higher fluorescence when bound to dna compared to rna while the cell permeant s16 may also stain mitochondria molecular probes 2010 with the highly concentrated samples run in this study the s16 dye provided a much better contrast between bacteria and algae allowing the clear distinction between the groups on the same axes figs 5 7 future studies should investigate the reasons for the better efficacy of s16 in these samples other than the introduction of staining for bacterial groups in the second experiment the other difference was that better contrast between bacteria and algae provided by s16 dye was achieved with only sample dilution and without sonication unlike the auto fluorescent algae only based experiment fig 4 another avenue for future study should focus more broadly on the effect of sonication on samples both unstained and stained should sonication be required in terms of sonication the highly aggregated structure of activated sludge flocs from conventional wastewater treatment has led to the successful use of ultrasonication to detach bacterial cells e g foladori et al 2007 ma et al 2013 frossard et al 2016 a more recent protocol for the assessment of activated sludge samples has also introduced a chemical treatment step along with the sonication brown et al 2019 with regard to the wide variety and composition of solids present in raw wastewater inorganic particles themselves should not be stained by dyes such as sg and s16 however staining could capture viral particles and extracellular dna and result in false positives frossard et al 2016 however this could be overcome by using fixed gating prest et al 2013 and proper experimental controls it should be noted that during the course of this study we did not observe any inorganic particles in the samples and if they were large they would have been removed in the filtering step before fcm analysis furthermore and more importantly we need to establish standardised staining measurement and data analysis protocols for wsp samples in order to have high quality data that can be compared across various studies a standardised protocol will among other things allow for more quantitative analysis of identified populations including fixed gating strategies cell sorting and identification via microscopy the use of counting beads and comparison to a more diverse range of bacterial and algal cultures fingerprints flow cytometry has already been demonstrated to have tremendous potential in the field of wastewater microbiology as demonstrated by its application in the analysis of water treated using activated sludge processes ziglio et al 2002 foladori et al 2010 muela et al 2011 ma et al 2013 lee et al 2016 brown et al 2019 safford and bischel 2019 and the findings of this study in wsp system also confirm this overall our ability to detect both algal and bacterial populations simultaneously in highly concentrated wastewater samples is a step forward for the use of fcm in the characterisation of a wide range of wastewaters and the findings may also be applied to the study of highly eutrophic environmental systems 4 2 spatiotemporal variability in wsps the ability to detect spatiotemporal variability in pond populations figs 8 10 has important implications for pond operation and management in addition to the obvious benefits it would provide in regular monitoring regimes the further development of fcm for use in wsps could lead to its use as a diagnostic tool to assess system health such as cell viability testing the ability of fcm to rapidly detect the changes in ponds is particularly important with operational challenges such as the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms fig 1f combined with cell sorting and electron microscopy and the assistance of environmental microbiologists and phycologists fcm could aid in the identification of algal populations present in ponds which could aid in the optimisation of systems for better treatment performance this is particularly important as microbial communities are a fundamental part of the treatment process in wsps and providing sustainable water systems pruden 2014 as such a better understanding of these communities and their structure is important for performance analysis to ensure the expectations of treatment are met in light of the rising concerns about antibiotic resistance pruden 2014 proctor and hammes 2015 lee et al 2016 fcm could also help in the detection of pathogens of concern or other organisms that may be related to antibiotic resistance in treated wastewater overall fcm provides a platform for the more detailed characterisation of microbial communities in wsps and specifically how they evolve both spatially and temporally in the immediate future the further development of this technique in wastewater systems in general will assist in the operation and maintenance of these systems and will improve responses to operational challenges such as cyanobacterial blooms beyond this the additional information on microbial communities present in pond provided by fcm analysis will not only improve our overall understanding of pond microbiology by moving away from the black box approach but it will also inform better planning and management frameworks to help work towards more sustainable water systems into the future 5 conclusions in this study we have for the first time demonstrated that flow cytometry fcm can be used for the characterisation of microbial cells both algal and bacterial in wsp wastewater the method developed in this study has shown that syto 16 dye is more effective than the commonly used sybr green i in distinguishing the microbial communities particularly algae in wsp wastewater the reason for the better performance of syto 16 needs to be investigated further along with the effect of sonication on samples through gating and phenotypic analyses we have shown that spatiotemporal variability in ponds can be detected using fcm the further development of fcm in wastewater systems and wsps in particular will assist

18347,algal and bacterial communities play a major role in the treatment performance and efficiency of waste stabilisation ponds wsps however the study of these wsp microbial communities has been challenging flow cytometry fcm has been used widely as a rapid culture independent method of characterising algae and or bacteria in a range of freshwater and marine environments and in conventional wastewater treatment processes but its application to wsp wastewater has been underexplored in this study a method for the characterisation of both algal and bacterial microbial populations in wsp wastewater is presented and standardised using cultures and field samples we show that syto 16 dye is more effective than sybr green i for the concurrent detection of both algae and bacteria in samples through gating and phenotypic diversity analysis the fcm results show both spatial and temporal shifts in pond microbial communities the ability to rapidly determine the spatiotemporal shifts in pond populations is not only important for the improvement of pond operation and monitoring strategies but also for the planning and management flow cytometry has the potential to become a diagnostic tool for ponds to assess treatment performance and determine the most optimal operating conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords waste stabilisation ponds flow cytometry wastewater characterization microbial communities 1 introduction microorganisms such as algae and bacteria control the treatment efficiency and quality in waste stabilisation ponds wsps and understanding the complex dynamics between algae and bacteria is fundamental in both the design and operation of these systems pearson 2003 mara 2004 daims et al 2006 a mutualistic relationship exists between algae and bacteria in wsps oxygen produced through photosynthesis of algae is used by bacteria to oxidise wastewater biological oxygen demand bod while the carbon dioxide needed for the algae to photosynthesise is provided by the metabolism of pond bacteria mara 2004 bacteria are also responsible for nitrification and denitrification processes in ponds mara 2004 however the fact that pond design criteria have not significantly evolved over the past half century thirumurthi 1974 mara 2004 is an indication that there is still much to learn about wsp microbiology therefore it is clear that there is a need for both the detailed characterisation of microbial communities in wsps and an understanding of their role in treatment performance coggins et al 2019 understanding the occurrence and variability of wsp microbial communities will ensure better informed management and operation of sustainable water systems this is even more relevant considering the knowledge gap surrounding the role played by microbial communities in antibiotic resistance e g pruden 2014 the study of microbial communities is complicated due to their ability to evolve and respond to their environment over short time scales lautenschlager et al 2010 guenther et al 2012 besmer et al 2014 koch et al 2014 props et al 2016 this makes understanding the microbiology within wsps challenging the ability to monitor microbial communities in treatment plants is essential for maintenance for predicting or mitigating incidents and for informing improvements in plant design brown et al 2019 culture dependent methods can only detect a small fraction of bacteria found in aquatic environments staley and konopka 1985 which is evident in recent research in drinking water networks bartram et al 2003 allen et al 2004 hammes et al 2008 hammes and egli 2010 over time traditional culture based methods for detecting wastewater microbiology have been replaced with epifluorescence microscopy and quantitative real time pcr however these methods both have biases and limitations in their quantification brown et al 2019 the rapid characterisation of microbial communities in marine and fresh water environments has improved in recent years through the use of flow cytometry fcm gasol and del giorgio 2000 veldhuis and kraay 2000 hammes and egli 2010 wang et al 2010 flow cytometry is a culture independent analysis technique first developed in the 1960s and due to its ability to rapidly provide a broad range of information at the single cell level fcm has been successfully applied to the characterisation of microbial communities hammes and egli 2010 wang et al 2010 van nevel et al 2013 in the past decade fcm has been used widely in the assessment and monitoring of drinking water quality e g berney et al 2008 hammes et al 2008 de roy et al 2012 prest et al 2016 and is now a recognised guideline method for drinking water analysis in switzerland slmb 2012 moving from drinking water to wastewater over the past decade there have been in increasing number of studies reporting the use of fcm to study the microbiology of activated sludge processes used in conventional wastewater treatment plants e g foladori et al 2010 lee et al 2016 brown et al 2019 safford and bischel 2019 however due to the nature of the activated sludge process these studies are limited to the detection of wastewater bacteria only this leaves the study of microbial communities involved in wastewater treatment in wsps unexplored despite their critical role in treatment wastewater from wsps having high algal populations in addition to bacteria adds another layer of complexity to fcm analysis flow cytometry can be performed on organisms that are auto fluorescent such as phytoplankton algae while non fluorescent species such as bacteria require staining to distinguish them from background noise in previous studies sybr green i the most commonly used dye to distinguish bacterial communities in water and has been applied to develop a reproducible bacterial staining method for water quality monitoring prest et al 2013 the majority of past aquatic microbiological studies with fcm have focussed on algal and bacterial populations in isolation drinking water studies have focussed on the detection of bacteria only e g hammes et al 2008 prest et al 2016 while other marine and freshwater based studies have focussed on the detection of phytoplankton populations e g gasol and del giorgio 2000 crosbie et al 2003 dennis et al 2011 or viruses e g marie et al 1999 brussaard 2004 more recently we have seen examples of fcm being used to detect both algae and bacteria in marine samples e g patten et al 2018 von scheibner et al 2018 compared to these freshwater and marine environments the concentrations of algae and bacteria are orders of magnitude higher in wsps and even higher than those found in hypereutrophic lakes there is only one previous study using fcm to characterise wsp samples where it was used for the detection and sorting of photosynthetic and non photosynthetic events for further microbial analysis eland et al 2019 under normal operating conditions ponds can have different visual characteristics and some of the diversity can be found in western australian wsps fig 1 facultative ponds have a darker green grey colour fig 1e while a pond with a cyanobacterial bloom can be bright green with water having a thicker consistency and scum formation around the pond banks fig 1f furthermore wsps may also contain non biological inorganic and organic particles onto which bacteria and algae have the ability to attach and or to form biofilms on proctor and hammes 2015 proctor et al 2016 sgier et al 2016 this could interfere with fcm detection along with potentially fluorescent substances such as dissolved organic carbon doc hammes et al 2007 vital et al 2012 as previous wastewater studies have focussed on the characterisation of bacterial communities at conventional wastewater treatment plants only there is a need to develop a fcm method for analysing water from more biologically diverse environments such as wsps which are rich in both algae and bacteria the development of such a method will not only increase the accuracy and efficiency of characterisation of wsp microbiology but also act as a diagnostic tool to aid in the management of wsp assets the overall objective of this study is to develop a method for characterising wastewater autotrophic and heterotrophic microbial communities using fcm specifically the aims of this study are to 1 develop an optimal fluorescent staining protocol to distinguish both algae and bacterial groups in wsps and 2 determine the suitability of fcm for the assessment of variability of wsp microbiology on spatial and temporal scales 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites wastewater samples were collected from six treatment plants with varying pond layouts and loads all located south of perth western australia a summary of each site is included in table 1 each site has a different pond layout with various configurations of primary facultative and maturation ponds fig 1 at the pin fig 1b and 1d in particular the dimensions of the two primary facultative ponds are identical however pond 2 also has three baffles installed perpendicular to the flow to control the pond hydraulics while pond 1 does not 2 2 wastewater sampling incoming raw wastewater was sampled from the flow splitter prior to entering the ponds at pin only while in pond samples were collected from approximately 20 cm below the surface near the inlet and outlet of each study pond as the overall purpose of this study was to assess if fcm could be applied to the characterisation of wastewater samples one sample was collected from each location sampling at five of the sites bdt cran mtb tam and wag table 1 was carried out in september 2012 sampling at the sixth site pin was conducted in june august and october 2015 the samples at all of the sites were taken in winter spring when we expect algal growth to be lower due to less daylight hours and cooler temperatures all samples were collected using a motorised pump with careful attention to avoid stirring of the water and the collection of sludge samples were first collected into 1 l acid washed schott glass bottles of which 10 ml was transferred into 15 ml sample tubes and immediately fixed on site with 500 μl glutaraldehyde glutaraldehyde grade i 25 in h2o sigma aldrich sample tubes were then immediately stored on ice for transportation back to the laboratory upon arrival at the lab all samples were immediately stored in the freezer at 20 c until required for analysis 2 3 spectrofluorometry a fluoroprobe bbe moldaenke germany in bench top mode which uses light emitting diodes at five wavelengths to excite auto fluorescing photosynthetic cells beutler et al 2002 barrington and ghadouani 2008 was used to measure chlorophyll a chl a in all samples through spectrofluorometry this instrument not only determines the total phytoplankton chl a concentration but can also distinguish between chl a concentrations μg l 1 of four different phytoplankton groups chlorophyta green algae cyanobacteria blue green algae diatoms cryptophyta based on unique fluorescence patterns due to the high concentrations of chlorophyll a present in wastewater samples were diluted with milli q water to ensure concentrations within working range of the fluoroprobe 2 4 auto fluorescence protocol initially to assess the viability of flow cytometry for wastewater analysis only auto fluorescent characteristics of wastewater were investigated samples were not diluted in this part of the study but where samples exhibited some floc formation they were sonicated for 2 min in an ultrasonic bath at a frequency of 50 hz the effect of sonication on the algal flocs was investigated concurrently by sonicating some samples for 1 min 1 5 min and 2 min and then investigating them under a microscope it was found that sonicating samples up to 2 min did not damage the algae as after sonication for this amount of time there were still noticeable algal flocs present in the sample samples were then filtered through 35 μm nylon mesh into sterile 5 ml round bottom tubes bd falcon product 352235 2 5 cultures three cultures were used for reference in this study to develop fluorescence fingerprints bacteria algae and wsp wastewater the purpose of the cultures in this study was twofold to ensure that the flow cytometer could be calibrated for the acquisition of data and for the optimisation of the dye staining protocol with known entities the bacteria used was escherichia coli b strain m715 school of pathology and laboratory medicine the university of western australia cultured in tryptone soya broth cm0129 thermo fisher scientific usa at 35 c overnight 10 ml aliquots of the culture were centrifuged and washed with 1 phosphate buffered saline pbs solution twice then resuspended in 10 ml gf f 0 7 μm filtered milli q water and immediately fixed with 500 μl glutaraldehyde the green alga desmodesmus sp cs 899 csiro tasmania australia was grown in 1 l aerated flasks in wc medium at 19 1 c and 10 ml aliquots fixed with 500 μl glutaraldehyde a culture of wsp wastewater was fed with settled raw wastewater and aerated with co2 at 19 1 c 10 ml aliquots of this culture were fixed with 500 μl glutaraldehyde this wsp culture was established using a sample of in pond wastewater collected at pin site several months before this experiment this culture was maintained as described for use in other experiments not related to this study all fixed culture samples were immediately stored in the freezer at 20 c until required for analysis 2 6 fluorescence staining protocols due to the collected wastewater samples and cultures being highly concentrated it was necessary to dilute all samples prior to staining all samples were diluted with gf f 0 7 μm filtered milli q water samples were first filtered through 35 μm nylon mesh into sterile 5 ml round bottom tubes and then diluted with the pre filtered water a 1 50 dilution was used for the e coli and desmodesmus sp cultures while a 1 10 dilution was used for the wastewater culture and field samples in this study two dyes were used in order to compare their effectiveness with wastewater these dyes were sybr green i 10000 concentrate in dmso molecular probes and the newer generation syto 16 1 mm solution in dmso molecular probes syto 16 s16 was chosen as the emission maxima for this dye 518 nm is very similar to that of sybr green i 520 nm when using sybr green i sg samples were stained using 1 100 stock diluted in dmso with either 1 10 μl ml 1 or 5 concentration 50 μl ml 1 as described in prest et al 2013 samples were preheated to 35 c for 5 min and then sg stained before being incubated at 35 c in the dark for a further 10 min before measurement as there were no pre existing protocols for using s16 on water samples titrations were performed to determine the optimal dye concentration samples stained with s16 were vortexed to mix and then incubated in the dark for 30 min before measurement 2 7 flow cytometry samples were acquired on a bd facscanto ii flow cytometer bd biosciences new jersey usa using bd facsdiva software version 8 0 1 bd biosciences new jersey usa the instrument is equipped with three excitation lasers blue 488 nm 20 mw solid state red 633 nm 17 mw hene and violet 405 nm 30 mw solid state and sets of octagon and trigon detector arrays containing with various band pass and long pass filters for detection of algae only the instrument was set to threshold on far red off the blue laser 488 nm 695 40bp at 200 detector voltages were set at the following forward scatter fsc at 230 side scatter ssc at 314 488 nm 530 30bp at 509 488 nm 695 40bp at 260 and 633 nm 660 20bp at 420 for the detection of bacteria and algae the instrument was set to threshold on fsc log at 200 detector voltages were set at following fsc log at 285 ssc log at 314 488 nm 530 30bp at 269 488 nm 585 42bp at 324 488 nm 780 60bp at 420 and 633 nm 660 20bp at 313 for this instrument it should be noted that it is not possible to quantify the number cells without the use of counting beads counting beads were not used in this study all data was analysed using flowjo software version 10 flowjo llc oregon usa and gating was used to separate data from background noise 2 8 phenotypic analysis we performed an advanced computational analysis of the flow cytometry data in order to detect differences between the flow cytometry fingerprints of various sample locations and time points phenoflow package v1 0 available from https github com rprops phenoflow package props et al 2016 this approach computes so called phenotypic fingerprints of the microbial community by placing the measured cells into an equal spaced binning grid 128 128 and performing kernel density estimations on all bivariate parameter combinations of the selected fluorescence and scatter parameters i e 488 nm 530 30bp a 488 nm 780 60bp a ssc a fsc a the phenotypic fingerprints were calculated with default settings and were compared through principal coordinates analysis pcoa bray curtis dissimilarity the full analysis workflow can be found as an r markdown file at https github com rprops wsp coggins 2019 3 results 3 1 phytoplankton population the photosynthesising groups present in the wsps studied fig 2 are dominated by the presence of green algae co occurring with diatoms and less commonly with cryptophyta and cyanobacteria most notable is the variability of these spectral groups from site to site fig 2a and within a site fig 2b the total phytoplankton community concentrations expressed in chl a equivalent have a wide range of variability across the study sites the lowest concentration was measured at mtb fig 2a which was four times less than that at the site with the highest concentration pin fig 2b this result shows that these communities are highly variable between sites and within the same site as shown by the significant difference between splitter water raw wastewater and pond water fig 2b 3 2 auto fluorescent flow cytometric analysis auto fluorescent populations were identified at different sites fig 3 and are displayed through filtering via red 633 nm 660 20bp and green 488 nm 530 30bp band pass filters through gating one clear algal population was identified at tam at the inlet fig 3a and outlet of pond 2 fig 3b this is reflected in the spectrofluorometric analysis for the site fig 2a looking at the mean fluorescence intensity mfi at tam for the 488 nm 530 30bp the values were 1005 and 1333 at the inlet and outlet respectively and for the 633 nm 660 20bp the mfis were 3246 and 3977 at the inlet and outlet respectively this shows that the populations present at the inlet and outlet are the same the sample for bdt shows two distinct populations fig 3c along with cran fig 3d however the bdt populations are more excited by both the blue 488 nm and red 633 nm lasers with higher emission and better resolution in both red and green channels compared to cran there appears to be one distinct population present at mtb fig 3e which is bright in both channels the highest number of distinct populations is at wag fig 3f where four distinct populations are observed without the use of staining the results of this analysis show the ability of fcm to distinguish possible groups and sub groups of auto fluorescent microbial communities in wastewater 3 3 best staining protocol for wastewater samples further distinction in the wastewater microbial communities can be achieved with the application of stains a comparison of the efficacy of sg and s16 dyes is shown in fig 4 the emissions for the two different stains at various concentrations were compared for use with the e coli and desmodesmus sp cultures both dyes perform similarly in staining e coli fig 4a with all concentrations showing same staining intensity however when applied to the desmodesmus culture fig 4b it is clear that s16 at 1 μm and 2 μm concentrations result in better separation and as such resolution of population from the background i e unstained sample in comparison to 5 sg to further illustrate the performance of the staining the mfis for the dyes and concentrations tested are shown in table 2 based on this analysis it was determined that 1 μm s16 provided the best staining of both bacteria e coli and algae desmodesmus sp and was most suitable to apply for distinguishing bacterial and algal groups in wastewater samples 3 4 algal and bacterial populations in wastewater results of the identification of algal and bacterial groups at pin in october 2015 are shown in figs 5 7 with s16 stain detected in green channel 488 nm 530 30bp and autofluorescence of algae in far red 488 nm 780 60bp as well as forward scatter log for bacteria showing both stained red and unstained blue samples the gating strategy used here is qualitative only and are not the same between figures for pond 1 fig 5 the inlet shows the presence of three distinct algal groups fig 5a and four distinct bacterial groups fig 5b by the time the water has moved towards the outlet the number of distinct algal groups has decreased to two fig 5c while the bacterial populations remains unchanged fig 5d in pond 2 fig 6 the inlet has two distinct algal populations fig 6a and three distinct bacterial groups fig 6b like pond 1 the algal community diversity has decreased at the outlet of pond 2 where there is only one distinct algal group fig 6c while there are still three bacterial communities present fig 6d overall the signatures of ponds 1 and 2 are fairly similar moving to the raw wastewater in the splitter fig 7 there are two distinct bacterial groups which can be identified in the green channel fig 7a and b there is a small algal population present in the splitter water however overall the signature of the splitter water fig 7 is vastly different to that in pond figs 5 and 6 most importantly for all samples the shift of the populations from unstained blue to when the sample is stained with s16 red is very clear and demonstrates that 1 μm s16 enables resolution and identification here quantitative of bacterial and algal populations within the same sample comparing this spatial difference further the splitter signal was compared to the pond 1 inlet signal fig 8 a through green 488 nm 530 30bp and yellow orange 488 nm 585 42bp band pass filters the distinct splitter population is gated and shows that the shift in the in pond population at the inlet blue compared to the splitter orange the temporal change in wsp communities is shown in fig 8b where the distinct splitter population is gated and the results of analysis from june and august at the pond 2 outlet are compared the signals of splitter population black and the population at the outlet in june green are very similar while the october population blue has shifted similar to fig 7a this result clearly shows the temporal variability in the population the spatiotemporal variability in populations between and within sites is further confirmed through the principal coordinate pcoa analysis figs 9 10 across the five study sites fig 9 assessed using auto fluorescence only there is a higher degree of similarity between wag and bdt populations while tam is dissimilar from the other sites and in particular shows low diversity in population throughout the treatment train at each of the sites the populations show a high degree of variability along the treatment train ranging from the primary facultative ponds through to maturation ponds for this analysis sonication explained 13 7 of the variance p 0 001 while the site sample location explained 37 0 of the variance p 0 001 however it is important to note that the five sites have different design configurations and operational characteristics table 1 which will become important in the interpretation of these results within the same study site pin fig 10 the variability of the populations at the inlet and outlet were analysed for june august and october 2015 the differences between the populations at the inlet and outlet samples increase over time where location explained 30 5 of the variance p 0 01 and the time point explained 23 4 of the variance p 0 023 in june t1 fig 10 the pin communities are similar but become more different in august t2 and october t3 temporally shifts in populations are noticeable in the splitter as well as the ponds the pond 2 community is very similar to the splitter community in june 2015 this is shown also shown in fig 8b over time the diversity seen in pond 1 decreased to be comparable to that seen in pond 2 overall the communities present in the splitter remain stable over time 4 discussion 4 1 suitability of fcm for analysis of wastewater samples this study shows that fcm can be used for the concurrent detection and analysis of wsp wastewater samples that are rich in both algae and bacteria through the use of s16 dye sg has become the standard dye used in the analysis of water from various aquatic environments e g prest et al 2013 and is often used in combination with propidium iodide pi to assess the presence of dead cells however the results of this study show that while sg is very proficient in the staining of bacterial cells it is less effective at staining algal cells when compared to the newer generation s16 dye fig 4 the properties of these two cyanine dyes are similar each having higher fluorescence when bound to dna compared to rna while the cell permeant s16 may also stain mitochondria molecular probes 2010 with the highly concentrated samples run in this study the s16 dye provided a much better contrast between bacteria and algae allowing the clear distinction between the groups on the same axes figs 5 7 future studies should investigate the reasons for the better efficacy of s16 in these samples other than the introduction of staining for bacterial groups in the second experiment the other difference was that better contrast between bacteria and algae provided by s16 dye was achieved with only sample dilution and without sonication unlike the auto fluorescent algae only based experiment fig 4 another avenue for future study should focus more broadly on the effect of sonication on samples both unstained and stained should sonication be required in terms of sonication the highly aggregated structure of activated sludge flocs from conventional wastewater treatment has led to the successful use of ultrasonication to detach bacterial cells e g foladori et al 2007 ma et al 2013 frossard et al 2016 a more recent protocol for the assessment of activated sludge samples has also introduced a chemical treatment step along with the sonication brown et al 2019 with regard to the wide variety and composition of solids present in raw wastewater inorganic particles themselves should not be stained by dyes such as sg and s16 however staining could capture viral particles and extracellular dna and result in false positives frossard et al 2016 however this could be overcome by using fixed gating prest et al 2013 and proper experimental controls it should be noted that during the course of this study we did not observe any inorganic particles in the samples and if they were large they would have been removed in the filtering step before fcm analysis furthermore and more importantly we need to establish standardised staining measurement and data analysis protocols for wsp samples in order to have high quality data that can be compared across various studies a standardised protocol will among other things allow for more quantitative analysis of identified populations including fixed gating strategies cell sorting and identification via microscopy the use of counting beads and comparison to a more diverse range of bacterial and algal cultures fingerprints flow cytometry has already been demonstrated to have tremendous potential in the field of wastewater microbiology as demonstrated by its application in the analysis of water treated using activated sludge processes ziglio et al 2002 foladori et al 2010 muela et al 2011 ma et al 2013 lee et al 2016 brown et al 2019 safford and bischel 2019 and the findings of this study in wsp system also confirm this overall our ability to detect both algal and bacterial populations simultaneously in highly concentrated wastewater samples is a step forward for the use of fcm in the characterisation of a wide range of wastewaters and the findings may also be applied to the study of highly eutrophic environmental systems 4 2 spatiotemporal variability in wsps the ability to detect spatiotemporal variability in pond populations figs 8 10 has important implications for pond operation and management in addition to the obvious benefits it would provide in regular monitoring regimes the further development of fcm for use in wsps could lead to its use as a diagnostic tool to assess system health such as cell viability testing the ability of fcm to rapidly detect the changes in ponds is particularly important with operational challenges such as the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms fig 1f combined with cell sorting and electron microscopy and the assistance of environmental microbiologists and phycologists fcm could aid in the identification of algal populations present in ponds which could aid in the optimisation of systems for better treatment performance this is particularly important as microbial communities are a fundamental part of the treatment process in wsps and providing sustainable water systems pruden 2014 as such a better understanding of these communities and their structure is important for performance analysis to ensure the expectations of treatment are met in light of the rising concerns about antibiotic resistance pruden 2014 proctor and hammes 2015 lee et al 2016 fcm could also help in the detection of pathogens of concern or other organisms that may be related to antibiotic resistance in treated wastewater overall fcm provides a platform for the more detailed characterisation of microbial communities in wsps and specifically how they evolve both spatially and temporally in the immediate future the further development of this technique in wastewater systems in general will assist in the operation and maintenance of these systems and will improve responses to operational challenges such as cyanobacterial blooms beyond this the additional information on microbial communities present in pond provided by fcm analysis will not only improve our overall understanding of pond microbiology by moving away from the black box approach but it will also inform better planning and management frameworks to help work towards more sustainable water systems into the future 5 conclusions in this study we have for the first time demonstrated that flow cytometry fcm can be used for the characterisation of microbial cells both algal and bacterial in wsp wastewater the method developed in this study has shown that syto 16 dye is more effective than the commonly used sybr green i in distinguishing the microbial communities particularly algae in wsp wastewater the reason for the better performance of syto 16 needs to be investigated further along with the effect of sonication on samples through gating and phenotypic analyses we have shown that spatiotemporal variability in ponds can be detected using fcm the further development of fcm in wastewater systems and wsps in particular will assist in improving our understanding of the microbial communities that are fundamental to treatment and help to improve operation maintenance planning and management frameworks declaration of competing

2015 based on life cycle costs for anmbrs the energy consumption of gas sparging which is a common membrane fouling control technology could possibly take up 86 of overall energy demand of anmbrs ending up with an increased life cycle cost smith et al 2014 therefore for the purpose of enhancing competitiveness of anmbrs in industrial applications the membrane fouling should be minimized quorum sensing qs which is a cell to cell communication mechanism modulated by signal molecules has been found to be involved in bacterial self production of eps shrout and nerenberg 2012 thereby correlated to biofilm formation on membrane surface in membrane bioreactors mbrs yeon et al 2009 among the signal molecules acyl homoserine lactones ahls utilized by gram negative bacteria is the most common type in mbrs kim et al 2013 oh et al 2012 yeon et al 2009 and the increased concentration of ahls in biofilm on membrane surface is proved to have a close relationship to transmembrane pressure tmp rise yeon et al 2009 based on manipulation of qs a cutting edge biological technology in mbrs known as quorum quenching qq has been developed for membrane biofouling control by suppressing ahls which are produced by biomass kim et al 2013 oh et al 2012 yeon et al 2009 single qq bacterium including rhodococcus sp bh4 pseudomonas sp 1a1 and lactobacillus sp sbr04ma had been successfully isolated and was of particular interest for membrane fouling mitigation in mbrs cheong et al 2013 iqbal et al 2018 kampouris et al 2018 kim et al 2013 oh et al 2012 however so far few studies reported pilot scale or full scale qq membrane bioreactors lee et al 2016 the probable reason is that single qq bacterium might not completely block qs system due to the limited degradation range of ahls in comparison to qq consortiums with more expanded qq ability ham et al 2018 oh and lee 2018 additionally competitive indigenous bio community might outcompete single qq bacterium in reactors and eventually reduce their qq efficiency ergön can et al 2017 kim et al 2015 yu et al 2016 considering that consortiums could possibly possess higher stability ambujom 2001 and better performance ambujom 2001 moscoso et al 2012 waheed et al 2018 than single bacterium when applied into bioaugmentation applications it is deemed imperative to isolate novel qq consortiums with functionally heterogeneous species capable to sustainably degrade various ahls and achieve valid qs inhibition with regard to the qq bacteria for membrane fouling control in anmbrs as microbes generally multiply faster under aerobic conditions than anaerobic environments tijhuis et al 1993 we believe that facultative qq bacteria are more favorable from an engineering standpoint than strictly anaerobic qq bacteria due to their ease of cultivation and shorter cultivation period to our best knowledge only one facultative qq bacterium microbacterium sp has been studied for anmbrs liu et al 2019 although it shown its feasibility for membrane fouling retardation in a lab scale anmbr treating synthetic wastewater its qq performance was weakened as illustrated by the declined ahls degradability after 45 d in addition the initial qq bacterium dosages used for the investigation of ahls degradation by microbacterium sp in the study were not reported which is a crucial information for its qq performance therefore the objectives of this study were to isolate facultative qq consortiums fqqs and evaluate their qq performance for anmbrs in terms of ahls degradability growth rate utilizing ahls eps retardation efficiency and membrane fouling management in this work three fqqs were isolated through enrichment culture and anaerobic screening to degrade dominant ahls c6 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl in anmbrs higher utilization rate by fqqs for ahls compared to other substrates by the qq consortiums is deemed necessary for effective qs disruption and fouling abatement in anmbrs therefore the growth rate of fqqs based on different substrates ahls and acetate was characterized and their ahls degradability were studied using a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms microbial communities of fqqs were identified and linked to their qq performance finally to confirm the hypothesis that membrane fouling mitigation can be reflected by the disruption of qs via ahls degradation the impact of these qq on eps production and tmp buildup in anmbrs were assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 isolation of facultative qq consortiums considering that ahls were important qs signals in anaerobic wastewater treatment processes liu et al 2019 ma et al 2018 and over threshold concentration of distinct ahls could promote qs activities leading to serious membrane fouling oh and lee 2018 seet and zhang 2011 preliminary assessment of dominant ahls in anmbrs was deemed important to facilitate appropriate strategies for specific ahls mitigation ahls profiles were thus initially analyzed to investigate ahl based qs system in anmbrs the relative information about the quantification of ahls in anaerobic biomass are shown in supplementary materials as c6 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl were identified as the dominant ahls in anmbrs fig s1 three aerobic qq consortiums aeqqs were initially isolated from activated sludge collected from a local domestic wastewater treatment plant wwtp by enrichment culture revised by a previous study cheong et al 2013 using c6 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl as sole carbon sources respectively identical amount of activated sludge was separately seeded into 3 minimal medium table s1 containing 1 5 mm of c6 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl respectively after 3 d 10 of each enriched culture was transferred to a new minimal medium with the ahl and this process was repeated for a total of 3 times then 3 aeqqs were harvested and named as aeqq c6 aeqq c8 and aeqq c10 accordingly anaerobic screening was then conducted to select for fqqs briefly anaerobic conditions were provided to aeqq c6 aeqq c8 and aeqq c10 in serum bottles by sparging the medium and filling up the headspace with nitrogen gas before sealing with rubber stoppers and aluminum crimp caps the nutrient rich anaerobic culture was conducted by supplementing acetate containing 3 g l of chemical oxygen demand cod and minimal medium in serum bottles to screen for facultative qq bacteria with the expectation of death of strictly aerobic qq bacteria after around 40 d upon which the od600 values for all cultures remained consistent the fqqs were then harvested after centrifuging at 4000 rpm for 10 min the isolated fqqs from aeqq c6 aeqq c8 and aeqq c10 were named as fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 respectively 2 2 unitization rate of fqqs based on acetate and ahls under anaerobic conditions growth rate of fqqs utilizing acetate and ahls were investigated to determine if the fqqs had a substrate specificity for each fqq three serum bottles were prepared by adding an appropriate amount of the fqq to achieve an od600 value of 0 005 and 40 ml of minimal medium 200 ppm of corresponding ahl 200 ppm of acetate and 400 ppm of acetate were separately added into the 3 serum bottles all the above mentioned mass concentrations were presented as cod value c6 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl were the corresponding ahls for fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 respectively under an anaerobic condition od600 was monitored using a spectrophotometer dr6000 hach with respect to time to investigate the growth rate of fqqs in a shaking incubator at 30 c and 150 rpm 2 3 ahls degradability determination under anaerobic conditions each fqq with dosage of 200 mg l as vss was mixed with standard ahls including 10 nm ml of n butyryl dl homoserine lactone c4 hsl 10 nm ml of n hexanoyl dl homoserine lactone c6 hsl 10 nm ml of n heptanoyl dl homoserine lactone c7 hsl 10 nm ml of n octanoyl dl homoserine lactone c8 hsl and 10 nm ml of n decanoyl dl homoserine lactone c10 hsl ahls standards were obtained from sigma aldrich all batch tests for the 3 fqqs were conducted with 3 biological repeats all solutions were then sparged with nitrogen gas to achieve anaerobic conditions in serum bottles after 0 5 1 6 and 18 h liquid samples were extracted subjected to heating at 90 c for a duration of 5 min to inactivate all reactions the relative information about the quantification of ahls by a lc ms ms are shown in supplementary materials 2 4 dna extraction sequencing and bioinformatics analysis genomicdna of aeqq c6 aeqq c8 aeqq c10 fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 were extracted using favorprep soil dna isolation mini kit favorgen according to the manufacturer s instructions concentration and purity of gdna were measured by nanodrop thermo fisher scientific and 1 w v agarose gel electrophoresis 16s v3 v4 region was amplified by a specific primer 515f 806r followed by pcr reactions using phusion high fidelity pcr master mix new england biolabs pcr products with the vaild strip 400 450bp were chosen for illumina high throughput sequencing by ions5tmxl thermofisher after quality filtering each otu was assigned based on 97 similarity of sequences and representative sequence was further annotated against the ssurrna database of silva database http www arb silva de otus abundance were normalized and alpha diversity and beta diversity were carried out based on the normalized sequencing data pcoa analysis was displayed by r software wgcna package stat packages and ggplot2 package and species variance statistic was conducted by lefse analysis using the lefse software 2 5 evaluation of quorum quenching capacity of fqqs in anmbrs two anmbrs were set up under ambient temperature of 30 c and operated in parallel each reactor had a reaction tank with an effective volume of 4 5 l and a membrane tank with a volume of 1 l where a flat sheet ceramic membrane module was installed a sub critical flux of 7 2 lmh was sustained for each anmbr anmbrs were continuously fed with real domestic wastewater collected from the same wwtp the detailed operational parameters are summarized in table s2 a batch eps bioassay was first conducted to investigate the impact of the isolated fqqs on the eps production in lab scale anmbrs as hydrogel beads could serve as protective barriers and enhance qq consortiums metabolic activity herrero and stuckey 2015 free fqqs and bead entrapped fqqs manufactured by a previous method lee et al 2016 were both investigated according to the experiment design fig 1 briefly for free fqqs group appropriate aliquots of free fqqs were added separately into 5 serum bottles to achieve final vss concentrations of 50 mg l 150 mg l and 320 mg l of fqq c6 180 mg l of fqq c8 and 180 mg l of fqq c10 another serum bottle with no dosage of fqq was used as a control subsequently 40 ml of anaerobic biomass obtained from our lab scale anmbr at steady state and same amount of acetate were added into each serum bottle to achieve a final cod of 3 g l for bead entrapped fqqs group appropriate amounts of fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 were added separately into 3 serum bottles to achieve similar vss concentration of 180 mg l same amount of empty beads were added into another serum bottle as a control similar to the free fqqs group same volume of anaerobic biomass but different amount of acetate were added into each serum bottle to achieve a final cod of 2 g l nitrogen gas purging was carried out to achieve anaerobic conditions for each serum bottles all batch tests were conducted with 3 biological repeats at both day 0 and 7 the eps of the sample were extracted by the heat method huang et al 2011 and its protein and carbohydrates concentrations were determined by the modified lowry method fr olund et al 1995 and dubios phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 respectively tmp were recorded by digital pressure gauges smc zse50f to assess membrane fouling propensity the recirculation gas sparing 0 7 l min was deployed for fouling management fouled membrane modules were replaced by new ones after the tmp exceeded 30 kpa after steady state was achieved whereby consistent methane production and cod removal were achieved 50 ml of hydrogel beads entrapped with 70 mg of fqq c6 were introduced to one anmbr i e qqanmbr and 50 ml of similar hydrogel beads without fqq c6 were dosed to the other anmbr i e ebanmbr 3 results and discussion 3 1 substrate specificity of fqqs between acetate and ahls bioaugmentation failure could be possibly attributed to the degradation of other organics instead of the targeted compounds by functional microorganisms tyagi et al 2011 thus it was reasonable to expect that higher utilization rates of fqqs for ahls rather than other substrates in anaerobic conditions would enhance their effective qq performance acetate was considered as an important substrate in anaerobic bio systems because it was commonly utilized by methanogens schönheit et al 1982 therefore under anaerobic environment substrates specificity between ahls and acetate as carbon sources for growth of fqqs was carried out fig 2 to our best knowledge no study has investigated substrate utilization behaviors of qq bacteria between ahls and other substrates before it was surprising that the growth rates of fqq c6 and fqq c10 using ahls were significantly high whilst the consortiums did not multiply with the acetate as the carbon source even at a higher dosage equivalent to 400 ppm of cod fig 2a c this suggests that fqq c6 and fqq c10 had higher specificity towards ahl degradation over acetate and they utilized the latter for survival in other words fqq c6 and fqq c10 prefer to degrade ahls rather than acetate highlighting the workability of fqq c6 and fqq c10 in anmbrs for qs disruption although the isolation method might select for non qq bacteria within qq consortiums because they could survive based on by products resulting from ahls degradation park et al 2003 limited abundance or activity of non qq bacteria within fqqs under anaerobic environments could be expected because of the surviving conditions of fqq c6 and fqq c10 utilizing acetate even with a higher supplement therefore this further suppressed the concern of misselection of counterproductive microorganisms on the contrary for fqq c8 the growth rate for c8 hsl versus acetate did not have much difference and they all exhibited a lower growth rate fig 2b this suggested that fqq c8 did not have specific high degradation rate for the ahl and its qq performance might be reduced in practical applications due to substrate competition as acetate did not induce the growth of fqqs under anaerobic condition fig 2 it offered reasons why od600 of fqqs did not increase continuously in the serum bottles at the end of the anaerobic screening data not shown overall the above findings suggested that fqq c6 and fqq c10 were favored because of potential high expression of qq performance when harnessed in anmbrs otherwise the qq efficiency could be greatly devaluated as might be the case for fqq c8 mistargeting other carbon sources rather than ahls furthermore fqq c6 and fqq c10 would have no adverse effect on methane production since they would not consume much acetate vfa in anmbrs entailing its great potential in full scale anmbr applications 3 2 ahls degradability by fqqs in order to isolate potent fqqs for effective qs inactivation based on specific ahls degradation investigation of dominant ahls in anmbrs was a prerequisite fig s1 it showed that c6 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl had the highest concentrations in anmbrs with 36 21 ng l 64 29 ng l and 45 08 ng l respectively which was in agreement in a previous study revealing that c8 hsl and c10 hsl were the universal ahls in anaerobic sludge and involved in regulation of eps production according to the data obtained from 10 full scale industrial anaerobic bioreactors ma et al 2018 therefore these 3 ahls should be minimized as targeted qs signals in this study while it was shown that our fqqs could survive or multiply in anaerobic nutrient rich condition it was unclear if they could disrupt the ahls based quorum sensing via degradation of ahls in anmbrs therefore ahls degradability by fqqs under anaerobic conditions was analyzed fig 3 the removal percentages of c4 hsl c6 hsl c7 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl by fqq c6 after 18 h were 90 93 79 21 79 86 84 95 and 99 90 respectively on the other hand the loss of c4 hsl c6 hsl c7 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl in the control experiment without any qq consortium fig 3a were only 28 20 26 07 23 85 2 08 and 27 23 respectively meanwhile the removal rates by fqq c8 were 86 14 85 41 87 11 86 82 and 100 00 for c4 hsl c6 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl respectively fig 3b while the removal rates by fqq c10 for c4 hsl c6 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl were 94 02 89 21 90 33 92 15 and 100 00 respectively fig 3c after 18 h interestingly the c10 hsl was degraded fastest among all ahls species by all 3 types of fqqs which might be due to its longer acyl chain oh et al 2013 especially fqq c10 could degrade c10 hsl fastest compared to fqq c6 and fqq c8 and the concentration of c10 hsl was below detection limits within 1 h fig 3c for fqq c10 based on their ahls degradability behaviors all fqqs could effectively minimized dominant ahls c6 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl in this study the qq degradative efficacy of qq consortiums or pure bacterium depends on not only the ability to reduce specific ahls but also the degradation range of ahls considering that there were various ahls in wastewater treatment processes and species in the bioreactors using multiple ahls for biofilm forming oh and lee 2018 parsek and greenberg 2005 effective qq candidates should fulfill the objective of multiple degradation of a wide range of ahls reducing only limited types of ahls might not result in a completely obstruction of qq as might be the case of using single bacterium including rhodococcus sp bh4 that only had high degradability for limited ahls c6 hsl and c10 hsl oh et al 2013 or hemm 1that specifically degraded short chain ahls ham et al 2018 as c4 hsl c6 hsl c7 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl were all found to play important roles in qs in anaerobic wastewater treatment systems liu et al 2019 ma et al 2018 the isolated 3 fqqs with functionally versatile qq species capable to diminish ahls with acyl chains ranging from c4 to c10 under anaerobic environment signified that they would efficiently disrupt the qs system corresponding to a novel method for membrane fouling control in anmbrs 3 3 microbial population evolution from aeqqs to fqqs microbial structures of aeqqs and fqqs were explored by illumina miseq sequencing technique to study the underlying mechanism of qq capabilities by fqqs as illustrated by the high goods coverages for all samples table 1 and the rarefaction curves fig s2 it was determined that there were adequate sequencing depths and the majority of bacterial diversity in all samples had been covered all fqqs were originated from aeqqs and the increase in relative abundances of some microorganisms was believed to result from the growth or survival of facultative qq species during anaerobic screening while corresponding decreases resulted from the death of strictly aerobic microorganisms from aeqq consortiums not surprisingly the overall sequence results table 1 indicated that all fqqs had remarkably decreased community richness ace and chao 1 and operational taxonomic units otus than their original aeqqs corresponding to a re establishment of dominant microbial groups after anaerobic screening unweighted unifrac qualitative and weighted unifrac distances quantitative between aeqqs and fqqs also shown the microbial structure difference and supported the observation that anaerobic screening was the deterministic contributing factor driving the bacterial community alteration figs s3a and s3b lefse analysis cladogram was statistically and biologically performed to represent predominant taxon within aeqqs and fqqs in which the red and green pattern suggested greater microbial diversity of aeqqs and a distinct community structure between the two groups fig s4 overall anaerobic screening might best explain the above findings demonstrating the dominant bacterial assembles shift from aeqqs to fqqs and the enriched microbial membership in fqqs might possess potent qq capacity under anaerobic condition 3 4 facultative quorum quenching species within fqqs three fqqs almost all consisted of phylum proteobacteria firmicutes and actnobacteria which were the 3 major phylum containing qq bacteria reported in previous studies ham et al 2018 proteobacteria had the relative abundance of 93 30 92 30 and 99 0 in fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 respectively firmicutes contributed the relative abundance of 6 10 7 20 and 0 30 to fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 respectively the relative abundance of actnobacteria accounted for 0 50 0 40 and 0 60 in fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 respectively fig 4 a in order to further link the microbial communities to their qq capacities the relative abundance of all genus in these phylum was explored fig 4b the aeqqs had a more diverse microbial community in which lachnospiraceae nk4a136 group klebsiella and unidentified mitochondria were the dominant groups in aeqq c6 aeqq c8 and aeqq c10 respectively which implied that different qq bacterium preferred to degrade different ahls with various chain length in fqqs the genus of comamonas klebsiella stenotrophomonas ochrobactrum achromobacter and bacillus were the majorities reflecting that they survived or grew after the anaerobic screening and possessed qq ability fig 4b remarkably the thriving qq genus comamonas uroz et al 2003 2007 made up 42 65 and 29 03 of the total bacterial communities of fqq c6 and fqq c10 respectively while the percentage of it in aeqq c6 and aeqq c10 were only 0 02 and 0 12 respectively indicating its strong survival ability in anaerobic conditions in addition klebsiella sp was reported to include several facultative species franciscon et al 2009 mandal et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 and was found to exhibit qq abilities with broad spectrum lactonase activity chan et al 2011 kalia et al 2015 the difference in klebsiella sp content between fqq c10 31 10 and aeqq c10 2 04 could be attributed to its survival capacity during anaerobic screening indicating that they were strong facultative qq candidates moreover rapid enrichment of stenotrophomonas was detected which contributed relative abundance of 11 75 28 66 and 10 05 to fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 respectively whilst it only accounted for 0 48 0 08 and 0 08 in aeqq c6 aeqq c8 and aeqq c10 respectively it was also reported to have several metabolic activities under anaerobic environment venkidusamy and megharaj 2016 and exhibit qq performance in terms of various ahls degradation singh et al 2013 ochrobactrum sp was another major group in all fqqs which was detected with relative abundance of 22 50 14 72 and 5 43 in fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 respectively its rising abundance compared to aeqq c6 0 26 aeqq c8 0 09 and aeqq c10 0 11 manifested that they could be enduring or growing under anaerobic environment with the evidence of the found facultative ochrobactrum sp mahmood et al 2009 wang et al 2016 these bacteria could be isolated from soil and excreted ahl acylase encoded by gene aiio that enables them to degrade ahls with acyl chains ranging from c4 to c14 by cleaving the ahl amide bond czajkowski et al 2011 achromobacter was discovered in fqq c6 14 12 and fqq c8 7 86 and it had 2 common qq species achromobacter xylosoxidans and achromobacter denitrificans isolated from activated sludge and environmental samples christiaen et al 2011 khan et al 2016 in particular achromobacter denitrificans accounting for the abundance of 11 41 and 6 81 in fqq c6 and fqq c8 respectively shown its growth ability with nitrite and nitrate as electron acceptors in anaerobic condition doi et al 2014 and it could eradicate c4 hsl and oxo c12 hsl within 24 h christiaen et al 2011 the genus bacillus was one of the most dominant qq genus in previous studies dong et al 2002 liu et al 2005 thomas et al 2005 and it was reported to have facultative species han et al 2010 however no study has reported its qq abilities under anaerobic environment the distribution ratio for bacillus in fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 was 5 98 6 46 and 0 54 respectively while the percentages of it in aeqq c6 aeqq c8 and aeqq c10 were 0 14 0 03 and 0 06 respectively which exhibited its strong withstanding or growing ability during the anaerobic screening therefore it can be said that genus bacillus had promising qq species that could quench ahls under not only aerobic condition but also anaerobic condition overall the above findings indicated that fqqs consisted of various facultative qq species and elucidated the behavior of the broad ahls degradation in anaerobic condition by fqqs fig 3 3 5 bacterial compositions of fqqs qq performance associations facultative qq genus had a different relative abundance in different fqqs comamonas stenotrophomonas and klebsiella were dominant genus in fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 respectively fig 4c it might be due to the competition between qq bacteria when growing or surviving in serum bottles during the anaerobic screening the overall taxonomical configurations of these fqqs could be mirrored in their qq performance in terms of fqqs growth rate utilizing ahls and their degradability for various ahls table 2 showed the pseudo first order rate constants for quenching various ahls by fqqs according to data presented in section 3 2 and the detailed first order kinetics of fqqs for ahls degradation were summarized in fig s5 fig 4c showed the putative functional guilds responsible for different ahls degradability by fqqs the distinctive comamonas sp which occupied 42 65 and 29 03 in fqq c6 and fqq c10 respectively could be responsible for the high growth rates of fqq c6 and fqq c10 using ahls as sole carbon source during anaerobic cultivation fig 2 corresponding to a favorable facultative qq candidate for membrane fouling control in anmbrs when comparing ahls degradability between fqq c6 and fqq c8 the relatively high constants for c4 hsl and c10 hsl by fqq c6 could be attributed to the high relative abundance of comamonas and ochrobactrum table 2 and fig 4c especially considering that ochrobactrum sp could exclusively and completely quench c10 hsl while other ahls could still be detected czajkowski et al 2011 on the other hand the higher abundant of qq stenotrophomonas sp fig 4c in fqq c8 might confer high degradability of c6 hsl c7 hsl and c8 hsl as evidenced by their higher removal rates after 18 h and the high kinetic constants table s3 and table 2 additionally compared to fqq c6 and fqq c8 fqq c10 had relatively higher kinetic constants for c4 hsl c6 hsl c7 hsl and c8 hsl table 2 and it completely degraded c10 hsl in just 1 h table s3 the above findings could be correlated with the high distribution rate of distinctive qq klebsiella in fqq c10 klebsiella sp could show significant qq ability for all ahls with acyl chains ranging from c4 to c10 while acinetobacter sp could only moderately degrade c6 hsl c7 hsl and c8 hsl and achieve weak degradation of c4 hsl in the same ahl inactivation test chan et al 2011 as there is little information in published literature regarding qq performance of facultative qq bacteria liu et al 2019 the above analysis have greatly enriched our knowledge of specific kinetics or metabolic pathways for ahls degradation however it still required cultivation of individual facultative qq species combined with more in depth qq characterization for effective qs inactivation when different dominant ahls mitigation was required from the aspect of comprehensive qq performance by fqqs all ahls were degraded by at least 79 after 18 h fig 3 and table s3 which might be due to the overall comparable bio community compositions for all fqqs indicating that distinctive qq species only slightly determined qq performance by fqqs it could be illustrated by the venn figure fig 4d which indicates that 65 same types of facultative qq species were shared by all fqqs accounting for 67 71 69 15 and 56 03 in fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 respectively it suggested that after anaerobic screening in serum bottles same major facultative qq bacteria in all aeqqs survived after anaerobic screening while other strictly aerobic qq bacteria decayed under the unfavorable anaerobic conditions it could be speculated that majority of ahls were degraded by the 65 facultative qq species among all fqqs pcoa analysis fig s6 also illustrated that fqqs had relatively identical phylotypes regardless of difference in original microbiome membership among aeqqs to conclude this study shows that the overall ahls degradation behaviors of fqqs did not depend on a special bacterium quorum quenching had been reported to help microorganisms to obtain competitive advantages and avoid pathogenic invaders in natural ecosystems dong and zhang 2005 but no studies have been reported on the occurrence of qq behaviors in natural anaerobic ecosystems not to mention their identification and ecological niches overall the high throughput sequencing provided comprehensive insights that isolated fqqs comprised various qq species that could exercise qq potent under anaerobic condition in view of tremendous qq performance in terms of strong degradation for various ahls fig 3 the isolated fqqs were ideal qq candidates for qs disruption in anaerobic systems and could also be applied as a bioaugmentation source for membrane fouling control strategy in continuously operating anmbrs 3 6 implications for membrane fouling control in anmbrs whether fqqs could bring ahl based qq closer to eps retardation was determined because eps matrix was not only an major composition of biofilm flemming et al 2007 but a critical foulant on membrane surface in anmbrs charfi et al 2012b when adding free fqq c6 with different dosage from 50 to 320 mg l into anmbr there was limited effect on the production of proteins and carbohydrates in eps fig 5 a and b which suggested that fqq c6 might have been out competed by other bacteria in mixed liquor leading to the limited qq performance a higher dosage of fqq c6 320 mg l tended to slightly retard the production of eps compared to the control experiment nonetheless such a high dosage was not a practical strategy since it would increase cost and change the functional microbial structure of anmbrs conversely bead entrapped fqqs made a difference on eps retardation compared to that of free qq consortiums fig 5 highlighting the protection effect of this immobilization technology under harsh anaerobic environment hanaki et al 1994 it was found that all bead entrapped fqqs especially for fqq c6 could alleviate the eps production in terms of carbohydrates and proteins in anaerobic biomass compared to the control experiment fig 5c and d the reduction percentage of carbohydrates for qq consortium cultured by c6 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl were 66 53 27 35 and 45 33 respectively for the reduction percentage of proteins by fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 they were 72 13 38 06 and 71 88 respectively considering the highest eps retardation efficiency of fqq c6 followed by that of fqq c10 it could be speculated that distinctive comamonas sp in fqq c6 and fqq c10 played a deterministic role in eps retardation figs 4c 5c and 5d the absolute retardation amount of proteins was higher than carbohydrates which implied that these qq consortiums could retard more proteins than carbohydrates in eps these findings indicated that fqqs needed to be entrapped within hydrogel beads in order to increase their survivability against anaerobic biomass and promote qq lifespans considering that eps was the main factor driving fouling buildup in anmbrs charfi et al 2012b fqqs particularly fqq c6 could endow membrane anti biofouling ability due to their qq activities leading to the significant retardation of eps production detection of eps retardation without careful inspection of membrane fouling mitigation in anmbrs did not warrant efficient qs inhibition as fqq c6 which had a relatively high eps retardation performance fig 5c and d application of fqq c6 as a qq candidate for membrane fouling control in the anmbr treating municipal wastewater was conducted more findings related to biofilm inhabitation through qq by fqqs were realized via tmp profile faster rise of the tmp was observed for ebanmbr where it took 7 d for the tmp to reach 30 kpa fig 6 however it was clear that tmp buildup was postponed in qqanmbr where membrane service period could be extended by around 2 times and this trend was reproducible days 14 28 with consecutive anmbr operation the deposited eps on membrane could be the major cause contributing to the increase of tmp and the improvement could attributed to the lower concentration of proteins and carbohydrates in eps in the mixed liquor fig 5c and d which was in agreement with previous studies indicating that serious membrane fouling was caused by an increase in eps and qq could minimize eps concentration in anmbrs liu et al 2012 2019 to conclude the qq capacity of fqq c6 was further confirmed as it mitigated biofouling by disrupting qs system in a lab scale anmbr with the fact that fqqs were isolated from domestic activated sludge and individual members in consortiums could maintain their combined metabolic processes while withstanding harsh environmental conditions ambujom 2001 higher durability and sustainability of qq consortiums than single qq bacterium would be achieved when applied to anmbrs treating domestic wastewater this study focused on the proof of concept and therefore further studies are needed to characterize the detailed fouling mechanism of qqanmbr stability of fqqs and their long term performance in terms of filtration contaminants removal as well as methane production for domestic wastewater treatment 4 conclusions in this study aiming to minimize dominant ahls in anmbrs we isolated 3 types of fqqs characterized their microbial communities to further elucidate their qq behaviors and presented their implications for countering membrane fouling in anmbrs three approaches for controlling ahls based qs in anmbrs attributed to fqqs had been studied i degradability of ahls signal molecules ii retardation of eps formation and iii tmp buildup delay in a lab scale anmbr the comprehensive conclusions are as follow 1 the higher growth rates of fqq c6 and fqq c10 based on ahls than those using acetate shown their high potential qq performance because there might be no substrate competition 2 all three isolated fqqs significantly degraded various ahls within 18 h whereby c10 hsl was fastest eliminated 3 fqq c6 and fqq c10 could remarkably alleviated extracellular polymeric substances by 72 46 and 65 88 respectively and fqq c6 retarded tmp increase in anmbrs by around 2 times which presented its promising and foreseeable potential for membrane fouling control in continuously operated anmbrs 4 a facultative qq species pool was proposed for membrane fouling control in anmbrs the abundant comamonas sp in fqq c6 and fqq c10 was well implicated to their high growth rates utilizing ahls under anaerobic condition and contributed to their high eps retardation

18348,anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr technology is being recognized as an appealing strategy for wastewater treatment however severity of membrane fouling inhibits its widespread implementations this study engineered novel facultative quorum quenching consortiums fqqs coping with membrane fouling in anmbrs with preliminary analysis for their quorum quenching qq performances herein acyl homoserine lactones ahls based quorum sensing qs in a lab scale anmbr initially revealed that n hexanoyl dl homoserine lactone c6 hsl n octanoyl dl homoserine lactone c8 hsl and n decanoyl dl homoserine lactone c10 hsl were the dominant ahls in anmbrs in this study three fqqs namely fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 were harvested after anaerobic screening of aerobic qq consortiums aeqqs which were isolated by enrichment culture aiming to degrade c6 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl respectively growth of fqq c6 and fqq c10 using ahls as carbon source under anaerobic condition was significantly faster than those using acetate congruously suggesting that their qq performance will not be compromised in anmbrs all fqqs degraded a wide range of ahls pinpointing their extensive qq ability fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 remarkably alleviated extracellular polymeric substances eps production in a lab scale anmbr by 72 46 35 89 and 65 88 respectively and fqq c6 retarded membrane fouling of the anmbr by 2 times bioinformatics analysis indicated that there was a major shift in dominant species from aeqqs to fqqs where comamonas sp klebsiella sp stenotrophomonas sp and ochrobactrum sp survived after anaerobic screening and were the majority in fqqs high growth rate utilizing ahls under anaerobic condition and enormous eps retardation efficiency in fqq c6 and fqq c10 could be attributed to comamonas sp these findings demonstrated that fqqs could be leveraged for qq under anaerobic systems we believe that this was the first work proposing a bacterial pool of facultative qq candidates holding biotechnological promises for membrane fouling control in anmbrs graphical abstract image 1 keywords ahls anaerobic membrane bioreactor biofilm eps facultative quorum quenching consortiums quorum quenching 1 introduction anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbrs with the advantages of reduced foot print high quality effluent and complete biomass retention by membrane compared to conventional anaerobic wastewater treatment processes are receiving increasingly attention for municipal wastewater treatment application huang et al 2011 lin et al 2011 yue et al 2015 nevertheless membrane fouling is considered a perennial challenge for anmbrs in form of organic and inorganic foulants in membrane pores or on membrane surface hampering acceptance of anmbrs li et al 2019 lin et al 2013 notably biologically secreted extracellular polymeric substances eps which contain carbohydrates proteins and other products of microorganism metabolism laspidou and rittmann 2002 sheng et al 2010 teng et al 2019 are critical foulants in anmbrs directly contributing to adherence of microorganisms on membrane surface facilitating biofouling and inducing flux decline charfi et al 2012a ding et al 2015 based on life cycle costs for anmbrs the energy consumption of gas sparging which is a common membrane fouling control technology could possibly take up 86 of overall energy demand of anmbrs ending up with an increased life cycle cost smith et al 2014 therefore for the purpose of enhancing competitiveness of anmbrs in industrial applications the membrane fouling should be minimized quorum sensing qs which is a cell to cell communication mechanism modulated by signal molecules has been found to be involved in bacterial self production of eps shrout and nerenberg 2012 thereby correlated to biofilm formation on membrane surface in membrane bioreactors mbrs yeon et al 2009 among the signal molecules acyl homoserine lactones ahls utilized by gram negative bacteria is the most common type in mbrs kim et al 2013 oh et al 2012 yeon et al 2009 and the increased concentration of ahls in biofilm on membrane surface is proved to have a close relationship to transmembrane pressure tmp rise yeon et al 2009 based on manipulation of qs a cutting edge biological technology in mbrs known as quorum quenching qq has been developed for membrane biofouling control by suppressing ahls which are produced by biomass kim et al 2013 oh et al 2012 yeon et al 2009 single qq bacterium including rhodococcus sp bh4 pseudomonas sp 1a1 and lactobacillus sp sbr04ma had been successfully isolated and was of particular interest for membrane fouling mitigation in mbrs cheong et al 2013 iqbal et al 2018 kampouris et al 2018 kim et al 2013 oh et al 2012 however so far few studies reported pilot scale or full scale qq membrane bioreactors lee et al 2016 the probable reason is that single qq bacterium might not completely block qs system due to the limited degradation range of ahls in comparison to qq consortiums with more expanded qq ability ham et al 2018 oh and lee 2018 additionally competitive indigenous bio community might outcompete single qq bacterium in reactors and eventually reduce their qq efficiency ergön can et al 2017 kim et al 2015 yu et al 2016 considering that consortiums could possibly possess higher stability ambujom 2001 and better performance ambujom 2001 moscoso et al 2012 waheed et al 2018 than single bacterium when applied into bioaugmentation applications it is deemed imperative to isolate novel qq consortiums with functionally heterogeneous species capable to sustainably degrade various ahls and achieve valid qs inhibition with regard to the qq bacteria for membrane fouling control in anmbrs as microbes generally multiply faster under aerobic conditions than anaerobic environments tijhuis et al 1993 we believe that facultative qq bacteria are more favorable from an engineering standpoint than strictly anaerobic qq bacteria due to their ease of cultivation and shorter cultivation period to our best knowledge only one facultative qq bacterium microbacterium sp has been studied for anmbrs liu et al 2019 although it shown its feasibility for membrane fouling retardation in a lab scale anmbr treating synthetic wastewater its qq performance was weakened as illustrated by the declined ahls degradability after 45 d in addition the initial qq bacterium dosages used for the investigation of ahls degradation by microbacterium sp in the study were not reported which is a crucial information for its qq performance therefore the objectives of this study were to isolate facultative qq consortiums fqqs and evaluate their qq performance for anmbrs in terms of ahls degradability growth rate utilizing ahls eps retardation efficiency and membrane fouling management in this work three fqqs were isolated through enrichment culture and anaerobic screening to degrade dominant ahls c6 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl in anmbrs higher utilization rate by fqqs for ahls compared to other substrates by the qq consortiums is deemed necessary for effective qs disruption and fouling abatement in anmbrs therefore the growth rate of fqqs based on different substrates ahls and acetate was characterized and their ahls degradability were studied using a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms microbial communities of fqqs were identified and linked to their qq performance finally to confirm the hypothesis that membrane fouling mitigation can be reflected by the disruption of qs via ahls degradation the impact of these qq on eps production and tmp buildup in anmbrs were assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 isolation of facultative qq consortiums considering that ahls were important qs signals in anaerobic wastewater treatment processes liu et al 2019 ma et al 2018 and over threshold concentration of distinct ahls could promote qs activities leading to serious membrane fouling oh and lee 2018 seet and zhang 2011 preliminary assessment of dominant ahls in anmbrs was deemed important to facilitate appropriate strategies for specific ahls mitigation ahls profiles were thus initially analyzed to investigate ahl based qs system in anmbrs the relative information about the quantification of ahls in anaerobic biomass are shown in supplementary materials as c6 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl were identified as the dominant ahls in anmbrs fig s1 three aerobic qq consortiums aeqqs were initially isolated from activated sludge collected from a local domestic wastewater treatment plant wwtp by enrichment culture revised by a previous study cheong et al 2013 using c6 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl as sole carbon sources respectively identical amount of activated sludge was separately seeded into 3 minimal medium table s1 containing 1 5 mm of c6 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl respectively after 3 d 10 of each enriched culture was transferred to a new minimal medium with the ahl and this process was repeated for a total of 3 times then 3 aeqqs were harvested and named as aeqq c6 aeqq c8 and aeqq c10 accordingly anaerobic screening was then conducted to select for fqqs briefly anaerobic conditions were provided to aeqq c6 aeqq c8 and aeqq c10 in serum bottles by sparging the medium and filling up the headspace with nitrogen gas before sealing with rubber stoppers and aluminum crimp caps the nutrient rich anaerobic culture was conducted by supplementing acetate containing 3 g l of chemical oxygen demand cod and minimal medium in serum bottles to screen for facultative qq bacteria with the expectation of death of strictly aerobic qq bacteria after around 40 d upon which the od600 values for all cultures remained consistent the fqqs were then harvested after centrifuging at 4000 rpm for 10 min the isolated fqqs from aeqq c6 aeqq c8 and aeqq c10 were named as fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 respectively 2 2 unitization rate of fqqs based on acetate and ahls under anaerobic conditions growth rate of fqqs utilizing acetate and ahls were investigated to determine if the fqqs had a substrate specificity for each fqq three serum bottles were prepared by adding an appropriate amount of the fqq to achieve an od600 value of 0 005 and 40 ml of minimal medium 200 ppm of corresponding ahl 200 ppm of acetate and 400 ppm of acetate were separately added into the 3 serum bottles all the above mentioned mass concentrations were presented as cod value c6 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl were the corresponding ahls for fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 respectively under an anaerobic condition od600 was monitored using a spectrophotometer dr6000 hach with respect to time to investigate the growth rate of fqqs in a shaking incubator at 30 c and 150 rpm 2 3 ahls degradability determination under anaerobic conditions each fqq with dosage of 200 mg l as vss was mixed with standard ahls including 10 nm ml of n butyryl dl homoserine lactone c4 hsl 10 nm ml of n hexanoyl dl homoserine lactone c6 hsl 10 nm ml of n heptanoyl dl homoserine lactone c7 hsl 10 nm ml of n octanoyl dl homoserine lactone c8 hsl and 10 nm ml of n decanoyl dl homoserine lactone c10 hsl ahls standards were obtained from sigma aldrich all batch tests for the 3 fqqs were conducted with 3 biological repeats all solutions were then sparged with nitrogen gas to achieve anaerobic conditions in serum bottles after 0 5 1 6 and 18 h liquid samples were extracted subjected to heating at 90 c for a duration of 5 min to inactivate all reactions the relative information about the quantification of ahls by a lc ms ms are shown in supplementary materials 2 4 dna extraction sequencing and bioinformatics analysis genomicdna of aeqq c6 aeqq c8 aeqq c10 fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 were extracted using favorprep soil dna isolation mini kit favorgen according to the manufacturer s instructions concentration and purity of gdna were measured by nanodrop thermo fisher scientific and 1 w v agarose gel electrophoresis 16s v3 v4

illumina high throughput sequencing by ions5tmxl thermofisher after quality filtering each otu was assigned based on 97 similarity of sequences and representative sequence was further annotated against the ssurrna database of silva database http www arb silva de otus abundance were normalized and alpha diversity and beta diversity were carried out based on the normalized sequencing data pcoa analysis was displayed by r software wgcna package stat packages and ggplot2 package and species variance statistic was conducted by lefse analysis using the lefse software 2 5 evaluation of quorum quenching capacity of fqqs in anmbrs two anmbrs were set up under ambient temperature of 30 c and operated in parallel each reactor had a reaction tank with an effective volume of 4 5 l and a membrane tank with a volume of 1 l where a flat sheet ceramic membrane module was installed a sub critical flux of 7 2 lmh was sustained for each anmbr anmbrs were continuously fed with real domestic wastewater collected from the same wwtp the detailed operational parameters are summarized in table s2 a batch eps bioassay was first conducted to investigate the impact of the isolated fqqs on the eps production in lab scale anmbrs as hydrogel beads could serve as protective barriers and enhance qq consortiums metabolic activity herrero and stuckey 2015 free fqqs and bead entrapped fqqs manufactured by a previous method lee et al 2016 were both investigated according to the experiment design fig 1 briefly for free fqqs group appropriate aliquots of free fqqs were added separately into 5 serum bottles to achieve final vss concentrations of 50 mg l 150 mg l and 320 mg l of fqq c6 180 mg l of fqq c8 and 180 mg l of fqq c10 another serum bottle with no dosage of fqq was used as a control subsequently 40 ml of anaerobic biomass obtained from our lab scale anmbr at steady state and same amount of acetate were added into each serum bottle to achieve a final cod of 3 g l for bead entrapped fqqs group appropriate amounts of fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 were added separately into 3 serum bottles to achieve similar vss concentration of 180 mg l same amount of empty beads were added into another serum bottle as a control similar to the free fqqs group same volume of anaerobic biomass but different amount of acetate were added into each serum bottle to achieve a final cod of 2 g l nitrogen gas purging was carried out to achieve anaerobic conditions for each serum bottles all batch tests were conducted with 3 biological repeats at both day 0 and 7 the eps of the sample were extracted by the heat method huang et al 2011 and its protein and carbohydrates concentrations were determined by the modified lowry method fr olund et al 1995 and dubios phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 respectively tmp were recorded by digital pressure gauges smc zse50f to assess membrane fouling propensity the recirculation gas sparing 0 7 l min was deployed for fouling management fouled membrane modules were replaced by new ones after the tmp exceeded 30 kpa after steady state was achieved whereby consistent methane production and cod removal were achieved 50 ml of hydrogel beads entrapped with 70 mg of fqq c6 were introduced to one anmbr i e qqanmbr and 50 ml of similar hydrogel beads without fqq c6 were dosed to the other anmbr i e ebanmbr 3 results and discussion 3 1 substrate specificity of fqqs between acetate and ahls bioaugmentation failure could be possibly attributed to the degradation of other organics instead of the targeted compounds by functional microorganisms tyagi et al 2011 thus it was reasonable to expect that higher utilization rates of fqqs for ahls rather than other substrates in anaerobic conditions would enhance their effective qq performance acetate was considered as an important substrate in anaerobic bio systems because it was commonly utilized by methanogens schönheit et al 1982 therefore under anaerobic environment substrates specificity between ahls and acetate as carbon sources for growth of fqqs was carried out fig 2 to our best knowledge no study has investigated substrate utilization behaviors of qq bacteria between ahls and other substrates before it was surprising that the growth rates of fqq c6 and fqq c10 using ahls were significantly high whilst the consortiums did not multiply with the acetate as the carbon source even at a higher dosage equivalent to 400 ppm of cod fig 2a c this suggests that fqq c6 and fqq c10 had higher specificity towards ahl degradation over acetate and they utilized the latter for survival in other words fqq c6 and fqq c10 prefer to degrade ahls rather than acetate highlighting the workability of fqq c6 and fqq c10 in anmbrs for qs disruption although the isolation method might select for non qq bacteria within qq consortiums because they could survive based on by products resulting from ahls degradation park et al 2003 limited abundance or activity of non qq bacteria within fqqs under anaerobic environments could be expected because of the surviving conditions of fqq c6 and fqq c10 utilizing acetate even with a higher supplement therefore this further suppressed the concern of misselection of counterproductive microorganisms on the contrary for fqq c8 the growth rate for c8 hsl versus acetate did not have much difference and they all exhibited a lower growth rate fig 2b this suggested that fqq c8 did not have specific high degradation rate for the ahl and its qq performance might be reduced in practical applications due to substrate competition as acetate did not induce the growth of fqqs under anaerobic condition fig 2 it offered reasons why od600 of fqqs did not increase continuously in the serum bottles at the end of the anaerobic screening data not shown overall the above findings suggested that fqq c6 and fqq c10 were favored because of potential high expression of qq performance when harnessed in anmbrs otherwise the qq efficiency could be greatly devaluated as might be the case for fqq c8 mistargeting other carbon sources rather than ahls furthermore fqq c6 and fqq c10 would have no adverse effect on methane production since they would not consume much acetate vfa in anmbrs entailing its great potential in full scale anmbr applications 3 2 ahls degradability by fqqs in order to isolate potent fqqs for effective qs inactivation based on specific ahls degradation investigation of dominant ahls in anmbrs was a prerequisite fig s1 it showed that c6 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl had the highest concentrations in anmbrs with 36 21 ng l 64 29 ng l and 45 08 ng l respectively which was in agreement in a previous study revealing that c8 hsl and c10 hsl were the universal ahls in anaerobic sludge and involved in regulation of eps production according to the data obtained from 10 full scale industrial anaerobic bioreactors ma et al 2018 therefore these 3 ahls should be minimized as targeted qs signals in this study while it was shown that our fqqs could survive or multiply in anaerobic nutrient rich condition it was unclear if they could disrupt the ahls based quorum sensing via degradation of ahls in anmbrs therefore ahls degradability by fqqs under anaerobic conditions was analyzed fig 3 the removal percentages of c4 hsl c6 hsl c7 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl by fqq c6 after 18 h were 90 93 79 21 79 86 84 95 and 99 90 respectively on the other hand the loss of c4 hsl c6 hsl c7 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl in the control experiment without any qq consortium fig 3a were only 28 20 26 07 23 85 2 08 and 27 23 respectively meanwhile the removal rates by fqq c8 were 86 14 85 41 87 11 86 82 and 100 00 for c4 hsl c6 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl respectively fig 3b while the removal rates by fqq c10 for c4 hsl c6 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl were 94 02 89 21 90 33 92 15 and 100 00 respectively fig 3c after 18 h interestingly the c10 hsl was degraded fastest among all ahls species by all 3 types of fqqs which might be due to its longer acyl chain oh et al 2013 especially fqq c10 could degrade c10 hsl fastest compared to fqq c6 and fqq c8 and the concentration of c10 hsl was below detection limits within 1 h fig 3c for fqq c10 based on their ahls degradability behaviors all fqqs could effectively minimized dominant ahls c6 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl in this study the qq degradative efficacy of qq consortiums or pure bacterium depends on not only the ability to reduce specific ahls but also the degradation range of ahls considering that there were various ahls in wastewater treatment processes and species in the bioreactors using multiple ahls for biofilm forming oh and lee 2018 parsek and greenberg 2005 effective qq candidates should fulfill the objective of multiple degradation of a wide range of ahls reducing only limited types of ahls might not result in a completely obstruction of qq as might be the case of using single bacterium including rhodococcus sp bh4 that only had high degradability for limited ahls c6 hsl and c10 hsl oh et al 2013 or hemm 1that specifically degraded short chain ahls ham et al 2018 as c4 hsl c6 hsl c7 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl were all found to play important roles in qs in anaerobic wastewater treatment systems liu et al 2019 ma et al 2018 the isolated 3 fqqs with functionally versatile qq species capable to diminish ahls with acyl chains ranging from c4 to c10 under anaerobic environment signified that they would efficiently disrupt the qs system corresponding to a novel method for membrane fouling control in anmbrs 3 3 microbial population evolution from aeqqs to fqqs microbial structures of aeqqs and fqqs were explored by illumina miseq sequencing technique to study the underlying mechanism of qq capabilities by fqqs as illustrated by the high goods coverages for all samples table 1 and the rarefaction curves fig s2 it was determined that there were adequate sequencing depths and the majority of bacterial diversity in all samples had been covered all fqqs were originated from aeqqs and the increase in relative abundances of some microorganisms was believed to result from the growth or survival of facultative qq species during anaerobic screening while corresponding decreases resulted from the death of strictly aerobic microorganisms from aeqq consortiums not surprisingly the overall sequence results table 1 indicated that all fqqs had remarkably decreased community richness ace and chao 1 and operational taxonomic units otus than their original aeqqs corresponding to a re establishment of dominant microbial groups after anaerobic screening unweighted unifrac qualitative and weighted unifrac distances quantitative between aeqqs and fqqs also shown the microbial structure difference and supported the observation that anaerobic screening was the deterministic contributing factor driving the bacterial community alteration figs s3a and s3b lefse analysis cladogram was statistically and biologically performed to represent predominant taxon within aeqqs and fqqs in which the red and green pattern suggested greater microbial diversity of aeqqs and a distinct community structure between the two groups fig s4 overall anaerobic screening might best explain the above findings demonstrating the dominant bacterial assembles shift from aeqqs to fqqs and the enriched microbial membership in fqqs might possess potent qq capacity under anaerobic condition 3 4 facultative quorum quenching species within fqqs three fqqs almost all consisted of phylum proteobacteria firmicutes and actnobacteria which were the 3 major phylum containing qq bacteria reported in previous studies ham et al 2018 proteobacteria had the relative abundance of 93 30 92 30 and 99 0 in fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 respectively firmicutes contributed the relative abundance of 6 10 7 20 and 0 30 to fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 respectively the relative abundance of actnobacteria accounted for 0 50 0 40 and 0 60 in fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 respectively fig 4 a in order to further link the microbial communities to their qq capacities the relative abundance of all genus in these phylum was explored fig 4b the aeqqs had a more diverse microbial community in which lachnospiraceae nk4a136 group klebsiella and unidentified mitochondria were the dominant groups in aeqq c6 aeqq c8 and aeqq c10 respectively which implied that different qq bacterium preferred to degrade different ahls with various chain length in fqqs the genus of comamonas klebsiella stenotrophomonas ochrobactrum achromobacter and bacillus were the majorities reflecting that they survived or grew after the anaerobic screening and possessed qq ability fig 4b remarkably the thriving qq genus comamonas uroz et al 2003 2007 made up 42 65 and 29 03 of the total bacterial communities of fqq c6 and fqq c10 respectively while the percentage of it in aeqq c6 and aeqq c10 were only 0 02 and 0 12 respectively indicating its strong survival ability in anaerobic conditions in addition klebsiella sp was reported to include several facultative species franciscon et al 2009 mandal et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 and was found to exhibit qq abilities with broad spectrum lactonase activity chan et al 2011 kalia et al 2015 the difference in klebsiella sp content between fqq c10 31 10 and aeqq c10 2 04 could be attributed to its survival capacity during anaerobic screening indicating that they were strong facultative qq candidates moreover rapid enrichment of stenotrophomonas was detected which contributed relative abundance of 11 75 28 66 and 10 05 to fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 respectively whilst it only accounted for 0 48 0 08 and 0 08 in aeqq c6 aeqq c8 and aeqq c10 respectively it was also reported to have several metabolic activities under anaerobic environment venkidusamy and megharaj 2016 and exhibit qq performance in terms of various ahls degradation singh et al 2013 ochrobactrum sp was another major group in all fqqs which was detected with relative abundance of 22 50 14 72 and 5 43 in fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 respectively its rising abundance compared to aeqq c6 0 26 aeqq c8 0 09 and aeqq c10 0 11 manifested that they could be enduring or growing under anaerobic environment with the evidence of the found facultative ochrobactrum sp mahmood et al 2009 wang et al 2016 these bacteria could be isolated from soil and excreted ahl acylase encoded by gene aiio that enables them to degrade ahls with acyl chains ranging from c4 to c14 by cleaving the ahl amide bond czajkowski et al 2011 achromobacter was discovered in fqq c6 14 12 and fqq c8 7 86 and it had 2 common qq species achromobacter xylosoxidans and achromobacter denitrificans isolated from activated sludge and environmental samples christiaen et al 2011 khan et al 2016 in particular achromobacter denitrificans accounting for the abundance of 11 41 and 6 81 in fqq c6 and fqq c8 respectively shown its growth ability with nitrite and nitrate as electron acceptors in anaerobic condition doi et al 2014 and it could eradicate c4 hsl and oxo c12 hsl within 24 h christiaen et al 2011 the genus bacillus was one of the most dominant qq genus in previous studies dong et al 2002 liu et al 2005 thomas et al 2005 and it was reported to have facultative species han et al 2010 however no study has reported its qq abilities under anaerobic environment the distribution ratio for bacillus in fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 was 5 98 6 46 and 0 54 respectively while the percentages of it in aeqq c6 aeqq c8 and aeqq c10 were 0 14 0 03 and 0 06 respectively which exhibited its strong withstanding or growing ability during the anaerobic screening therefore it can be said that genus bacillus had promising qq species that could quench ahls under not only aerobic condition but also anaerobic condition overall the above findings indicated that fqqs consisted of various facultative qq species and elucidated the behavior of the broad ahls degradation in anaerobic condition by fqqs fig 3 3 5 bacterial compositions of fqqs qq performance associations facultative qq genus had a different relative abundance in different fqqs comamonas stenotrophomonas and klebsiella were dominant genus in fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 respectively fig 4c it might be due to the competition between qq bacteria when growing or surviving in serum bottles during the anaerobic screening the overall taxonomical configurations of these fqqs could be mirrored in their qq performance in terms of fqqs growth rate utilizing ahls and their degradability for various ahls table 2 showed the pseudo first order rate constants for quenching various ahls by fqqs according to data presented in section 3 2 and the detailed first order kinetics of fqqs for ahls degradation were summarized in fig s5 fig 4c showed the putative functional guilds responsible for different ahls degradability by fqqs the distinctive comamonas sp which occupied 42 65 and 29 03 in fqq c6 and fqq c10 respectively could be responsible for the high growth rates of fqq c6 and fqq c10 using ahls as sole carbon source during anaerobic cultivation fig 2 corresponding to a favorable facultative qq candidate for membrane fouling control in anmbrs when comparing ahls degradability between fqq c6 and fqq c8 the relatively high constants for c4 hsl and c10 hsl by fqq c6 could be attributed to the high relative abundance of comamonas and ochrobactrum table 2 and fig 4c especially considering that ochrobactrum sp could exclusively and completely quench c10 hsl while other ahls could still be detected czajkowski et al 2011 on the other hand the higher abundant of qq stenotrophomonas sp fig 4c in fqq c8 might confer high degradability of c6 hsl c7 hsl and c8 hsl as evidenced by their higher removal rates after 18 h and the high kinetic constants table s3 and table 2 additionally compared to fqq c6 and fqq c8 fqq c10 had relatively higher kinetic constants for c4 hsl c6 hsl c7 hsl and c8 hsl table 2 and it completely degraded c10 hsl in just 1 h table s3 the above findings could be correlated with the high distribution rate of distinctive qq klebsiella in fqq c10 klebsiella sp could show significant qq ability for all ahls with acyl chains ranging from c4 to c10 while acinetobacter sp could only moderately degrade c6 hsl c7 hsl and c8 hsl and achieve weak degradation of c4 hsl in the same ahl inactivation test chan et al 2011 as there is little information in published literature regarding qq performance of facultative qq bacteria liu et al 2019 the above analysis have greatly enriched our knowledge of specific kinetics or metabolic pathways for ahls degradation however it still required cultivation of individual facultative qq species combined with more in depth qq characterization for effective qs inactivation when different dominant ahls mitigation was required from the aspect of comprehensive qq performance by fqqs all ahls were degraded by at least 79 after 18 h fig 3 and table s3 which might be due to the overall comparable bio community compositions for all fqqs indicating that distinctive qq species only slightly determined qq performance by fqqs it could be illustrated by the venn figure fig 4d which indicates that 65 same types of facultative qq species were shared by all fqqs accounting for 67 71 69 15 and 56 03 in fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 respectively it suggested that after anaerobic screening in serum bottles same major facultative qq bacteria in all aeqqs survived after anaerobic screening while other strictly aerobic qq bacteria decayed under the unfavorable anaerobic conditions it could be speculated that majority of ahls were degraded by the 65 facultative qq species among all fqqs pcoa analysis fig s6 also illustrated that fqqs had relatively identical phylotypes regardless of difference in original microbiome membership among aeqqs to conclude this study shows that the overall ahls degradation behaviors of fqqs did not depend on a special bacterium quorum quenching had been reported to help microorganisms to obtain competitive advantages and avoid pathogenic invaders in natural ecosystems dong and zhang 2005 but no studies have been reported on the occurrence of qq behaviors in natural anaerobic ecosystems not to mention their identification and ecological niches overall the high throughput sequencing provided comprehensive insights that isolated fqqs comprised various qq species that could exercise qq potent under anaerobic condition in view of tremendous qq performance in terms of strong degradation for various ahls fig 3 the isolated fqqs were ideal qq candidates for qs disruption in anaerobic systems and could also be applied as a bioaugmentation source for membrane fouling control strategy in continuously operating anmbrs 3 6 implications for membrane fouling control in anmbrs whether fqqs could bring ahl based qq closer to eps retardation was determined because eps matrix was not only an major composition of biofilm flemming et al 2007 but a critical foulant on membrane surface in anmbrs charfi et al 2012b when adding free fqq c6 with different dosage from 50 to 320 mg l into anmbr there was limited effect on the production of proteins and carbohydrates in eps fig 5 a and b which suggested that fqq c6 might have been out competed by other bacteria in mixed liquor leading to the limited qq performance a higher dosage of fqq c6 320 mg l tended to slightly retard the production of eps compared to the control experiment nonetheless such a high dosage was not a practical strategy since it would increase cost and change the functional microbial structure of anmbrs conversely bead entrapped fqqs made a difference on eps retardation compared to that of free qq consortiums fig 5 highlighting the protection effect of this immobilization technology under harsh anaerobic environment hanaki et al 1994 it was found that all bead entrapped fqqs especially for fqq c6 could alleviate the eps production in terms of carbohydrates and proteins in anaerobic biomass compared to the control experiment fig 5c and d the reduction percentage of carbohydrates for qq consortium cultured by c6 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl were 66 53 27 35 and 45 33 respectively for the reduction percentage of proteins by fqq c6 fqq c8 and fqq c10 they were 72 13 38 06 and 71 88 respectively considering the highest eps retardation efficiency of fqq c6 followed by that of fqq c10 it could be speculated that distinctive comamonas sp in fqq c6 and fqq c10 played a deterministic role in eps retardation figs 4c 5c and 5d the absolute retardation amount of proteins was higher than carbohydrates which implied that these qq consortiums could retard more proteins than carbohydrates in eps these findings indicated that fqqs needed to be entrapped within hydrogel beads in order to increase their survivability against anaerobic biomass and promote qq lifespans considering that eps was the main factor driving fouling buildup in anmbrs charfi et al 2012b fqqs particularly fqq c6 could endow membrane anti biofouling ability due to their qq activities leading to the significant retardation of eps production detection of eps retardation without careful inspection of membrane fouling mitigation in anmbrs did not warrant efficient qs inhibition as fqq c6 which had a relatively high eps retardation performance fig 5c and d application of fqq c6 as a qq candidate for membrane fouling control in the anmbr treating municipal wastewater was conducted more findings related to biofilm inhabitation through qq by fqqs were realized via tmp profile faster rise of the tmp was observed for ebanmbr where it took 7 d for the tmp to reach 30 kpa fig 6 however it was clear that tmp buildup was postponed in qqanmbr where membrane service period could be extended by around 2 times and this trend was reproducible days 14 28 with consecutive anmbr operation the deposited eps on membrane could be the major cause contributing to the increase of tmp and the improvement could attributed to the lower concentration of proteins and carbohydrates in eps in the mixed liquor fig 5c and d which was in agreement with previous studies indicating that serious membrane fouling was caused by an increase in eps and qq could minimize eps concentration in anmbrs liu et al 2012 2019 to conclude the qq capacity of fqq c6 was further confirmed as it mitigated biofouling by disrupting qs system in a lab scale anmbr with the fact that fqqs were isolated from domestic activated sludge and individual members in consortiums could maintain their combined metabolic processes while withstanding harsh environmental conditions ambujom 2001 higher durability and sustainability of qq consortiums than single qq bacterium would be achieved when applied to anmbrs treating domestic wastewater this study focused on the proof of concept and therefore further studies are needed to characterize the detailed fouling mechanism of qqanmbr stability of fqqs and their long term performance in terms of filtration contaminants removal as well as methane production for domestic wastewater treatment 4 conclusions in this study aiming to minimize dominant ahls in anmbrs we isolated 3 types of fqqs characterized their microbial communities to further elucidate their qq behaviors and presented their implications for countering membrane fouling in anmbrs three approaches for controlling ahls based qs in anmbrs attributed to fqqs had been studied i degradability of ahls signal molecules ii retardation of eps formation and iii tmp buildup delay in a lab scale anmbr the comprehensive conclusions are as follow 1 the higher growth rates of fqq c6 and fqq c10 based on ahls than those using acetate shown their high potential qq performance because there might be no substrate competition 2 all three isolated fqqs significantly degraded various ahls within 18 h whereby c10 hsl was fastest eliminated 3 fqq c6 and fqq c10 could remarkably alleviated extracellular polymeric substances by 72 46 and 65 88 respectively and fqq c6 retarded tmp increase in anmbrs by around 2 times which presented its promising and foreseeable potential for membrane fouling control in continuously operated anmbrs 4 a facultative qq species pool was proposed for membrane fouling control in anmbrs the abundant comamonas sp in fqq c6 and fqq c10 was well implicated to their high growth rates utilizing ahls under anaerobic condition and contributed to their high eps retardation

18349,the increasing use of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa raises concerns about its potential toxicity to the environment however the interaction between pfoa and aerobic granular sludge has never been documented this work therefore aims to provide such support through investigating the fate of pfoa at environmentally relevant levels in aerobic granular sludge systems and its impact on aerobic granular sludge experimental results showed that 32 0 36 4 of wastewater pfoa was removed by aerobic granular sludge in stable operation when pfoa concentration was ranged from 0 1 to 1 0 mg l mass balance analyses and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy survey scan revealed that the removal of pfoa was dominated by adsorption rather than biodegradation and sorption kinetic analysis indicated that inhomogeneous multilayer adsorption was responsible for this removal the adsorbed pfoa deteriorated the settleability of granular sludge and biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal significantly experimental results showed that 1 0 mg l pfoa inhibited anaerobic phosphate release aerobic phosphate uptake nitrate reduction and nitrite reduction processes by 60 50 13 1 and 5 8 respectively it was observed that pfoa induced large amounts of filamentous villus growing on the surface and increased the extracellular polymeric substances of granular sludge fourier transform infrared spectra and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectrum showed that several function groups in extracellular polymeric substances such as hydroxyl groups amides and polysaccharides were affected by pfoa it was also found that pfoa inhibited the cyclic transformations of polyhydroxyalkanoates and glycogen microbial community analyses showed that pfoa decreased the abundances of nitrosomonas nitrospira accumulibacter and other function microbes such as rhodospirillaceae thauera and azoarcus graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge perfluorooctanoic acid adsorption microbial community 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge is widely considered one of the most promising biotechnologies for wastewater treatment owning to its high biomass retention good settling ability dense and strong microbial structure and high tolerance to organic loading and toxicity adav et al 2008a compared to the conventional activated sludge process the bioreactor volume can be largely reduced and bulky settling devices are not needed therefore aerobic granular sludge technology has been recently attracted growing attention in the past most efforts were dedicated to cultivating aerobic granule optimizing operational parameters or scaling up aerobic granular sludge technology to practical levels for example verawaty et al 2012 found that when activated sludge and crushed aerobic granule sludge were used as inocula to cultivate aerobic granular sludge crushed granules acted as nuclei for attachment of floccular sludge during the initial stage of granule development wang et al 2006 reported that a rapid formation of aerobic granulation could be achieved at high volume exchange ratios varying from 20 to 80 because high volume exchange ratios facilitated excessive production of extracellular polymers and subsequent calcium accumulation to date more than 40 full scale aerobic granule sludge based municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been in operation or under construction worldwide e g netherlands australia brazil poland portugal ireland scotland south africa and switzerland since 2005 pronk et al 2017 these plants demonstrated significant improvements in process stability effluent quality and energy saving as compared to traditional activated sludge processes with total nitrogen 5 mg l and total phosphorus 0 3 mg l being usually achieved in effluent niermans et al 2014 previous investigations demonstrated that aerobic granular sludge was effective in removing the major pollutants in wastewaters such as biological oxygen demand nitrogen and phosphorus even in real situations nancharaiah and reddy 2018 yang et al 2019 apart from these major pollutants wastewaters also contain several emerging pollutants which are detected even at ppm level but overlooked previously to date little information is available to interactions between aerobic granular sludge and these emerging pollutants perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa a class of emerging pollutants which is largely produced and used in various commercial products and industrial processes such as coatings shampoos electroplating fire fighting foams lubricants and pesticides lindstrom et al 2011 gupta and saleh 2013 in addition pfoa is the final degradation product of a variety of precursor perfluorinated chemicals including fluorotelomer alcohols and fluorinated polymers ochoa herrera and sierra alvarez 2008 large quantities of pfoa have been produced and utilized world wide during the last decades li et al 2015 for instance it was documented that approximately 150 t pfoa was used in china in 2013 liu et al 2017 the extensive application of pfoa inevitably leads to its environmental release resulting in substantial accumulations in wwtps the last barriers before its final entrance to natural environment it is reported that pfoa is often detected at substantial levels in both wwtps and natural waterbodies in many areas for example sludge pfoa level was 23 2 298 0 ng g dried weight in different wwtps in shanghai china wang et al 2015 wang et al reported that the average and maximal concentrations of pfoa were 0 11 mg l and 0 97 mg l in xiaoqing river in china respectively wang et al 2016a according to our survey on seven wwtps in central and east china e g changsha and ningbo pfoa concentration in municipal wastewaters was in the range of 0 09 0 92 mg l pfoa is extremely persistent bioaccumulative and very resistant to typical environmental degradation processes due to its carbon fluorine bonds with high bond energy approximately 110 kcal mol vecitis et al 2009 moreover pfoa is a carcinogen a developmental toxicant a liver toxicant and an immune system toxicant and also exerts hormonal impacts including alteration of thyroid hormone levels persson et al 2013 xia et al 2017 thus the fate of pfoa in various environments and its toxicity to environmental microbes have recently attracted increasing concerns qu et al 2010 higgins and schultz schultz et al 2006 found that the mass flows of pfoa were 400 80 mg day in raw influent and 300 40 mg day in final effluent suggesting that conventional activated sludge process could not effectively remove this compound yu et al reported that 20 mg l pfoa had negative impacts on microbial growth and organic carbon removal they found that 16 s rrna gene copy numbers decreased from 8 18 108 to 1 24 108 copies m l while dissolved organic carbon in effluent increased from 5 0 to 17 8 mg c l in steady state operation yu et al 2018 despite these significant advances the interaction between pfoa and aerobic granular sludge has never been documented up to now it is unknown whether pfoa is removed by aerobic granular sludge if it is how is it removed by aerobic granular sludge does pfoa at environmentally relevant levels significantly affect the performances of aerobic granular sludge based on the questions above this work therefore aims to fill this gap through deeply understanding the fate of pfoa at environmentally relevant levels i e 0 1 1 mg l in aerobic granular sludge systems and its impacts on aerobic granular sludge firstly the removal efficiency of pfoa in aerobic granular sludge systems was evaluated then details of how aerobic granular sludge removes pfoa were elucidated through the analyses of mass balance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and sorption kinetics and isotherm models thirdly the effect of pfoa on the performances of aerobic granular sludge such as settleability and biological nutrient removal was assessed finally the mechanisms of pfoa affecting these performances were explored from the aspects of the morphology of aerobic granular sludge surface assayed by scanning electron microscopy sem variations of chemical functional groups by fourier transform infrared spectra ftir and xps the transformations of metabolic intermediates and the abundances of major microorganisms by amplicon sequencing analysis to the best of our knowledge this is the first work clarifying the interaction between pfoa and aerobic granular sludge the findings achieved fill the gap between aerobic granular sludge and the emerging contaminant pfoa 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater synthetic wastewater was used in this work and prepared daily by nh4cl kh2po4 and ch3coona to get average initial nh4 n soluble phosphorus sop and soluble chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations of approximately 56 15 and 418 mg l respectively the synthetic wastewater also contained the following compounds mgso4 74 mg l cacl2 18 mg l znso4 7h2o 0 18 mg l mncl2 2h2o 0 2 mg l nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o 0 13 mg l ki 0 05 mg l h3bo3 0 18 mg

sludge reactors four reproductive sequencing batch reactors were configured with an effective working volume of 13 l each the seed aerobic granule sludge was withdrawn from an aerobic granule sludge reactor operated in our laboratory and was inoculated into the four reactors simultaneously the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and sludge volume index svi of the seed granules were approximately 6300 mg l and 30 ml g respectively all the reactors were placed in a temperature controlled room 21 1 c and operated with three cycles daily each cycle consisted of 5 min feeding 120 min anaerobic and 240 min aerobic periods followed by 5 min settling 5 min decanting and 45 min idle periods during the feeding period each reactor received 7 l synthetic wastewater containing 0 serving as the control 0 1 0 5 or 1 0 mg l pfoa which were prepared by adding relevant volumes of pfoa stock 0 5 g l to wastewater in the decanting period 7 l of the supernatant was decanted from each reactor continuous aeration was carried out by pumping ambient air to each reactor at a rate of 2 5 l min in the aerobic period each reactor was constantly mixed with a magnetic stirrer 150 rpm except for the settling decanting and idle periods the hydraulic retention time and sludge retention time in these reactors were controlled at approximately 6 h and 21 d respectively all the reactors were operated more than 150 days during which the effluent concentrations of pfoa ammonium nitrite nitrate sop and soluble cod were measured twice a week besides svi and mlss in both the reactors and effluent were determined once per week it took about 65 days before these data achieved relatively stable in stable operation cyclic investigations microbial analyses and batch tests were carried out the degradation of pfoa in different periods of aerobic granular sludge systems was indicated by the loss rate of pfoa which was calculated by equation 1 1 the loss rate of pfoa m l i 1 m l i m s m s i 1 m l i 1 m s i 1 where ml i and ml i 1 is the total mass of pfoa in the liquor phase of reactor in the current i and previous time i 1 and ms i and ms i 1 is the total mass of pfoa in the sludge phase of reactor in the current i and previous time i 1 2 3 batch tests for the analyses of sorption kinetics and sorption isotherm in the adsorption kinetics test two reproductive polypropylene flasks with working volume of 1 l each were performed to differentiate the pfoa adsorption kinetics between aerobic granule sludge and conventional flocculent sludge each flask first received 250 ml either granule sludge withdrawn from the control reactor or conventional activated sludge cultivated in our lab then each flask was fed with synthetic wastewater to a final volume of 1 l the mlss and pfoa concentrations in the two flasks were the same and controlled at approximately 3000 mg l and 0 5 mg l respectively afterwards the flasks were placed in a temperature controlled room 21 1 c and mixed at 150 rpm by magnetic stirrers samples were taken from each flask at 5 15 30 45 60 90 120 180 240 and 360 min respectively the collected samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 8000 r min and 4 c and the supernatants were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane before pfoa measurement in the sorption isotherm test six replicate polypropylene flasks with a working volume of 1 l each were performed each received 250 ml aerobic granule sludge taken from the control reactor before being diluted with synthetic wastewater to a final volume of 1 l the pfoa concentration in these flasks was 0 1 0 2 0 5 0 8 1 or 2 mg l whereas mlss concentration in each flask was almost the same 3000 mg l all other operations were the same as described in the sorption kinetics test the adsorption isotherms of freundlich langmuir and temkin please see details below were respectively used to fit the data 2 freundlich isotherm lnq e lnk f 1 n lnc e where ce is the equilibrium concentration of pfoa mg l qe is the

effect of pfoa on nitrifying and denitrifying processes in this set of batch tests 16 reproductive reactors with a working volume of 500 ml each were performed these reactors were divided into four groups namely ammonium oxidation test nitrite oxidation test nitrate reduction test and nitrite reduction test with four in each which were used to assess the effect of pfoa on nitrifying and denitrifying processes respectively it should be noted that the effect of pfoa on the specific rates of phosphorus release and phosphorus uptake could be assessed directly in the parent reactors thus batch tests in terms of phosphorus release and uptake were not performed here ammonium oxidation test a total volume of 0 2 l mixed liquor was respectively withdrawn from the four parent aerobic granule sludge reactors operated above at the end of the aerobic period in stable operation each mixture was first centrifuged 5000 revolutions per min for 5 min at 20 c and washed with tap water to remove the residual nh4 n no3 n and no2 n and then re suspended in tap water with a final volume of 0 2 l then different amounts of pfoa were respectively added into the four reactors to achieve pfoa concentrations of 0 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 mg l which were the same as their parent reactors respectively afterwards 2 0 ml nh4 n stock solution 5 g n l was added into each reactor resulting in an initial nh4 n concentration of 50 mg nh4 n l during the entire experiment period air was adequately supplied to guarantee that dissolved oxygen was not limiting 5 mg l each reactor was operated for 60 min samples were taken at 15 min intervals for nh4 n measurement and the vss concentration was determined at the end of the test the volumetric nh4 n oxidation rate was measured through linear regression of the corresponding profile and the biomass specific nh4 n oxidation rate was then calculated by dividing the volumetric rate by the vss concentration nitrite oxidation test this test was performed the same as described in ammonium oxidation test except that 50 mg nh4 n l was replaced by 50 mg no2 n l in each reactor nitrate reduction test the operation was conducted the same as described in ammonium oxidation test except the following parts in each reactor 50 mg l no3 n was employed to replace 50 mg l nh4 n after no3 n addition 400 mg l cod prepared by 5 g l sodium acetate was added to each reactor to serve as electron donors for denitrification each reactor was constantly mixed with a magnetic stirrer 150 rpm without aeration during the entire test nitrite reduction test this test was carried out as those described in nitrate reduction test except that 50 mg l no2 n was used to replace 50 mg l no3 n 2 5 analytical methods ph was measured using a digital ph meter phs 3c leici co ltd shanghai china the analyses of cod nh4 n no2 n no3 n tn sop mlss and svi were conducted in accordance with standard methods apha 1998 wang et al 2019 morphology of aerobic granular sludge was recorded by a digital camera and the microstructure was probed by a sem hitachi s 570 japan the xps measurement was performed using an escalab 250xi spectrometer with an al kα x ray source a heat extraction method was applied to extract different eps fractions li and yang 2007 and the extraction process was detailed in supporting information text s1 an uplc ms ms was used to determine pfoa concentration and its degradation products using an uplc system waters corp usa equipped with a c18 column 2 1 mm 50 mm 1 7 μm waters usa after lyophilization 0 1 g sludge sample was transferred to a 15 ml polypropylene tube and spiked with methanol 7 5 ml the mixture was sonicated in a water bath for 15 min at 60 c and centrifuged for 15 min at 5000 rpm sonication was repeated for three times yielding a total of 22 5 ml supernatant the supernatant was collected and then concentrated to 1 ml through nitrogen blowing the sample was vortex mixed well and filtered through a 0 22 μm nylon filter the filtrate was used as the sample for uplc ms analysis briefly the extracted sample was injected into a c18 column 2 1 mm 50 mm 1 7 μm waters usa with 2 mm ammonium acetate aqueous solution solvent a and methanol solvent b as mobile phases starting at 3 b the flow rate was set at 0 3 ml min the gradient was held until 0 50 min increased to 95 b until 6 00 min held until 8 50 min revert to original conditions at 8 51 min and was held 3 b until 12 min the column temperature was controlled constantly at 40 c ftir was performed to determine variations in functional groups the sludge sample was analyzed with a nicolet 560 ftir spectrometer under ambient conditions before analysis the wet sample was dried at 105 c and grounded with an agate mortar the sample was blended with kbr and then pressed into a disk for ftir analysis pure kbr disk was used as ftir reference scans wavenumber was in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 variations in microbial community among these reactors were analyzed by amplicon sequencing the total genomic dna was extracted from the withdrawn sludge using the powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio san diego ca usa according to the manufacture s instruction the primers 338 f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag and 806 r ggactachvgggtwtctaat 5 targeting the v3 v4 regions of the bacterial 16 s dna genes were used the raw sequencing data were analyzed using the open source bioinformatics pipeline quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime the combined reads were classified in their operational taxonomic units otus at 97 similarity against the green genes database 2 6 statistical analysis all the measurements were performed in triplicate an analysis of variance was used to evaluate the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfoa removal in aerobic granular sludge systems table 1 outlines pfoa removal in different granule sludge reactors in stable operation it can be seen that influent pfoa level did not bring obvious impacts on pfoa removal efficiency in this work with an increase of influent pfoa concentration from 0 1 to 1 mg l pfoa removal efficiency varied merely from 32 0 1 1 to 36 4 1 2 which was higher than that removed by the conventional activated sludge process schultz et al 2006 by determining the pfoa concentration in influent and effluent higgins and schultz schultz et al 2006 found that 0 1 of pfoa in influent was only removed by the conventional activated sludge process it was reported previously that when aerobic granular sludge was used to remove five types of pharmaceuticals and personal care products the removal efficiencies of prednisolone norfloxacin naproxen sulphamethoxazole and ibuprofen reached 98 5 87 8 84 0 79 8 and 63 3 respectively wang et al 2016b saleh and gupta 2014 each cycle of granule sludge reactor includes an anaerobic period and an aerobic period to further figure out pfoa removal in the two periods pfoa concentration at the end of the two periods was also measured it can be found that 0 066 0 003 0 302 0 015 and 0 578 0 028 mg l pfoa were respectively measured in the liquid phase at the end of anaerobic period in the 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 mg l pfoa reactors while the corresponding concentrations at the end of aerobic period were 0 070 0 003 0 322 0 016 and 0 638 0 031 mg l respectively table 1 this indicates that anaerobic period is mainly responsible for pfoa removal in such granule sludge systems it should be noted that liquid pfoa concentration at the end of aerobic period in all the reactors increased rather than decreased slightly as compared with that measured in the anaerobic end probably due to that the intercepted or adsorbed pfoa in the anaerobic period was partly released from granule sludge during aeration it was also documented that pfoa could be eliminated effectively in lab scale closed loop reactors under anaerobic conditions under aerobic conditions however pfoa could not be eliminated by adsorption degradation or mineralization meesters and schroder 2004 gupta et al 2010 which well supported the data obtained in this work all the facts demonstrated that a portion of pfoa can be removed anaerobically by aerobic granular sludge in the following text details of how aerobic granular sludge removes pfoa were explored 3 2 how was pfoa removed in such aerobic granular sludge systems two behaviors i e adsorption and biodegradation are generally responsible for the removal of organics to identify the major behavior of pfoa removal in aerobic granular sludge systems mass balance analysis of pfoa in liquor and sludge phases in these reactors was performed table 2 it was found that with the decrease of pfoa content in liquor phase pfoa content in sludge phase increased and the sum of pfoa content in liquor and sludge phases did not vary significantly with time for example in the reactor receiving 1 0 mg l pfoa the sum of pfoa content in liquor and sludge phases was 5 14 0 25 mg at the beginning of anaerobic phase 4 78 0 24 mg at the end of anaerobic phase and 4 82 0 25 mg at the end of aerobic phase and these variations were statistically insignificant p 0 05 further calculations showed that less than 7 of total pfoa was lost in the entire treatment process similar observations were also observed in the other two reactors this suggested that influent pfoa was mainly removed through adsorption rather than biodegradation it was documented that perfluoroheptanoic acid perfluorohexanoic acid perfluorovaleric acid perfluorabutyric acid and pentafluoropropionic acid were the major degradation products of pfoa arias espana et al 2015 yan et al 2010 to further confirm the degradation possibility of pfoa in the granular sludge systems uplc ms was employed to identify the presence of these products it can be seen that all the compounds were not found in the uplc ms chromatogram of liquor sample or sludge sample taken from the 1 0 mg l pfoa reactor at the end of anaerobic period fig s1 supporting information suggesting that pfoa was non biodegradable in such aerobic granular sludge systems xps measurement showed that apart from the major elements i e n c and o a small and clear peak of f1s also appeared on the xps spectra of the sludge sample taken from the 0 5 mg l pfoa reactor in stable operation fig 1 a and b compared with the control reactor the fitting peaks at 689 1ev was corresponded to the c f bond in the 0 5 mg l pfoa reactor fig 1c and d which indicated the presence of pfoa in sludge the results confirmed that pfoa was adsorbed by aerobic granular sludge at a molecular level which supported the data presented in table 2 and confirmed again that aerobic granular sludge adsorption instead of biodegradation was responsible for pfoa removal in this work which was consistent with the results reported in the literature as well vecitis et al 2009 yu et al 2009 3 3 details of how aerobic granular sludge adsorbs pfoa to explore the adsorption behavior of pfoa the adsorption kinetics test was first employed using both aerobic granule sludge and conventional flocculent sludge it was found that the pseudo second order model described the experimental data well fig s2 supporting information the equilibrium adsorption capacity and initial adsorption rate of granular sludge were 0 14 mg g and 0 06 mg min respectively which were respectively 2 and 6 times of those of conventional flocculent sludge further analyses showed that the content of eps proteins in aerobic granular sludge was much higher than that in flocculent sludge 147 8 vs 54 92 mg g vss table s1 which may be the reason for the greater equilibrium adsorption capacity and rate adav et al 2008b it was reported that there was a significant correlation between eps proteins and sludge pfoa adsorption and sludge protein composition was favorable for the adsorption of pfoa zhang et al 2013 adsorption isotherm model is often used to describe the adsorption of organic matters from liquid phase to solid phase ochoa herrera and sierra alvarez 2008 to find out a suitable adsorption model for pfoa langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm models were tested with their fitting results being shown in fig s3 supporting information among them freundlich model was found to describe the pfoa adsorption much better than the other two indicating that the process of pfoa adsorption by aerobic granular sludge was mainly inhomogeneous multilayer adsorption 3 4 impact of pfoa on settleability and nutrient removal of aerobic granular sludge after about 65 d all the reactors achieved steady state operation it was found that the presence of pfoa increased svi and effluent suspended solids concentration but decreased mlss in aerobic granular sludge reactors with an increase of pfoa concentration from 0 to 1 0 mg l effluent suspended solids concentration and svi increased respectively from 3 mg l and 40 ml g to 35 mg l and 90 ml g whereas reactor mlss decreased from 4600 mg l to 3300 mg l fig s4 supporting information the results demonstrated that the presence of pfoa deteriorated the settleability of aerobic granular sludge fig 2 shows the cyclic transformations of cod sop tn ammonium nitrite and nitrate it can be seen that cod transformation in both the anaerobic and aerobic periods was affected by the presence of pfoa with an increase of pfoa concentration from 0 to 1 0 mg l cod concentration in the anaerobic and aerobic end increased from 28 06 5 70 and 24 02 5 38 to 156 96 4 86 and 42 07 4 28 mg l mg l respectively fig 2a accompanied with the decrease of anaerobic cod uptake anaerobic sop release also decreased the sop concentration at the end of anaerobic period decreased from 62 44 1 53 to 31 45 1 37 mg l with pfoa concentration increasing from 0 to 1 0 mg l subsequently sop concentration at the end of aerobic period increased from 0 54 0 02 to 4 56 0 54 mg l fig 2b it is known that the energy generated from polyphosphate cleavage anaerobically is mainly used for polyphosphate accumulating organisms to take up cod while the stored carbon is majorly used to provide energy or electron donors for aerobic sop uptake or denitrifying sop uptake the results suggested that pfoa addition deteriorated obviously anaerobic sop release and aerobic sop uptake further investigations showed that the specific anaerobic sop release rate and aerobic sop uptake rate decreased respectively from 9 5 0 5 and 4 6 0 2 to 3 8 0 1 and 2 3 0 1 mg p g vss min with pfoa increasing from 0 to 1 0 mg l table 3 this suggested that 1 0 mg l pfoa inhibited anaerobic sop release and aerobic sop uptake processes by 60 and 50 respectively the addition of pfoa also deteriorated tn removal efficiency and tn removal efficiency decreased from 99 4 0 5 to 80 1 2 5 with pfoa dosage increasing from 0 to 1 0 mg l fig 2c compared with the control the presence of 0 1 and 0 5 mg l pfoa did not cause obvious variations in ammonium oxidation with 0 mg l ammonium being measured at the end of the aerobic period in the three reactors fig 2d however 2 2 0 65 mg l ammonium was determined at the end of the aerobic period in the reactor with 1 0 mg l pfoa addition suggesting that this level of pfoa inhibit ammonium oxidation process it was also found that the presence of pfoa resulted in the accumulations of nitrite and nitrate fig 2e and f indicating that nitrifying and or denitrifying processes were inhibited to figure out the specific effect of pfoa on both the nitrifying and denitrifying processes a series of batch tests was operated and the results were summarized in table 3 nh4 n oxidation rate was measured at 5 2 mg n g vss min in the reactors with 0 0 1 and 0 5 mg l pfoa addition confirming again that pfoa at such levels did not affect ammonium oxidation process further increase of pfoa concentration to 1 0 mg l reduced it to 4 6 mg n g vss min suggesting that this dosage of pfoa inhibited ammonium oxidation process by 11 5 compared with ammonium oxidation process nitrite oxidation process however was inhibited much severer by pfoa with an increase of pfoa from 0 to 1 0 mg l no2 n oxidation rate decreased from 3 5 to 2 1 mg n g vss min indicating that 1 0 mg l pfoa inhibited nitrite oxidation process by 40 similar to ammonium oxidation process low levels of pfoa e g 0 1 and 0 5 mg l did not inhibit nitrate and nitrite reduction processes while 1 0 mg l pfoa inhibited these processes by 13 1 and 5 8 respectively in the following text mechanisms of how pfoa affects nitrogen and phosphorus removal were further explored 3 5 mechanisms of how pfoa affects the settleability and nitrogen and phosphorus removal of aerobic granular sludge the sludge in the control reactor showed a typical aerobic granular phenotype with its yellow surface being smooth and soft fig s5 after 20 d exposure to pfoa the granules became while with large amounts of filamentous villus growing on their surfaces fig s5a similar observations were also observed on 60 d operation this could be further supported by sem analysis shown in fig 3 a it can be seen that large numbers of cocci shaped and bacilli shaped cells were observed in the control reactor with the increase of pfoa concentration the cocci shaped and bacilli shaped cells decreased or even disappeared whereas filamentous sharped cells increased on the surface of aerobic granular sludge suggesting the presence of filamentous villus outside aerobic granular sludge filamentous microorganisms including fungi have a competitive advantage over non filamentous because they are able to take up more nutrients from media at low substrate levels owing to their high surface area to volume ratio and preferential growth in a single direction once filamentous growth dominated the surface of aerobic granular sludge deterioration of aerobic granular sludge structure and settleability occurred leading to subsequent biomass washout yu and liu 2006 eps are the major components of granule sludge playing crucial roles in the structure and functions of microbial aggregates and providing a protective barrier for microorganisms inside granule sludge to environmental toxins henriques and love 2007 as shown in fig 3b the content of proteins in all the s eps lb eps and tb eps increased respectively from 76 4 17 5 and 15 2 to 117 2 58 7 and 28 7 mg g vss with pfoa concentration increasing from 0 to 1 0 mg l it was indicated that eps was essential for maintaining the structural stability of aerobic granular sludge and deterioration of aerobic granular sludge settleability was mainly attributed to a sharp increase in lb eps content chen et al 2010 liu et al 2019 all the facts demonstrated that pfoa affected the surface structure and eps content of aerobic granular sludge which thereby deteriorated its settleability the functional groups in eps are closely relevant to the function of aerobic granule sludge thus we used ftir to investigate the effect of pfoa on the possible functional groups dominated in eps with the results being shown in fig 4 a compared with the control there were some changes decrease and shift in the bands of 1642 and 1546 cm 1 after pfoa addition they are assigned to amido i and ii bands of proteins table s2 supporting information indicating the changes closely related to the increase of eps proteins the band at 1072 cm 1 representing c o c of polysaccharides showed a shift to 1053 cm 1 in addition the signals in the range of 3440 3449 cm 1 belonging to the stretching of o h showed a significant increase in transmission intensities clearly when aerobic granular sludge was exposed to pfoa the main changes occurred in hydroxyl groups amides and polysaccharides it is known that these three groups are important compositions of enzymes in aerobic granule sludge which are mainly responsible for nutrient removal previous investigations demonstrated that pfoa could produce oxidative stress and cause protein dysfunction in organisms he et al 2016 liu et al 2016 it was documented that pfoa could affect the permeability of cell membranes and bind to proteins and other cell components in cells thereby inactivating the enzymes or leading to malfunction of the enzymes he et al 2016 to obtain more information regarding the function groups xps spectra were also used in this work four fitting peaks at 284 8 286 3 287 9 and 288 6 ev were detected in c1s high resolution spectrum fig 4b i and 4b ii which were reported to represent c c c o co and cooh bonds respectively liu et al 2010 in n1s high resolution spectrum two different characteristic peaks were also determined at 399 9 and 401 6 ev respectively fig 4b iii and 4 b iv the former peak is thought as nh2 while the latter peak is indicated as nh4 jansen and van bekkum 1995 compared with the control the presence of pfoa respectively decreased c element content of c c and cooh by 4 13 and 47 64 but increased c element content of c o and co by 0 43 and 23 34 respectively table s3 supporting information it was also found that pfoa increased the content of n element in nh2 group by 1 75 but decreased the content of n element in nh4 group by 22 04 table s3 supporting information all the facts confirmed again that pfoa affected the function groups in granular eps which thereby affected the performance of granules it was reported that polar functionalities dipoles such as nh and oh could develop relatively weak ion dipole interaction to anionic pfoa molecules punyapalakul et al 2013 it is well documented that biological nutrient especially phosphorus removal is related to the transformations of intermediate metabolites such as intracellular polyhydroxyalkanoates pha and glycogen chen et al 2012 oehmen et al 2007 generally the influent organics were consumed with pha synthesis and glycogen degradation in the anaerobic period while the stored pha was oxidized for phosphorus uptake denitrification and glycogen replenishment in the subsequent aerobic period compared with the control the presence of pfoa decreased the cyclic transformations of both pha and glycogen fig s6 for example the amounts of anaerobic pha accumulation and glycogen degradation were 4 4 and 2 9 mmol c g vss in the control whereas the corresponding values were 1 3 and 1 4 mmol c g vss in the 1 0 mg l pfoa reactor respectively fig s6 supporting information it is documented that in biological phosphorus removal systems the cyclic transformations of pha and glycogen are closely associated with the activities of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos the higher the transformations of pha and glycogen the greater metabolism activities of paos mino et al 1998 it seems that the presence of pfoa inhibited the intracellular metabolite transformations of paos and or denitrifying paos this inhibition decreased the activities of paos or denitrifying paos which might be one reason for pfoa deteriorating nitrogen and phosphorus removal the structure of microbial community and the abundance of functional bacteria are relevant to the performance of aerobic granule sludge thus the microbial communities among the four reactors were finally compared using the amplicon sequencing proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi were the three main phyla in all the four reactors but the presence of pfoa caused substantial changes in the abundances of microorganisms in these phyla fig s7 supporting information for example compared with the control the abundances of microbes affiliated to proteobacteria in the 1 0 mg l pfoa reactor increased by 41 76 whereas the populations of microbes affiliated to bacteroidetes and chloroflexi decreased by 1 35 and 35 24 respectively many types of microbes belonged to these phyla were reported to contribute to the removals of antimicrobial substances and nutrient zhao et al 2015 yang et al 2018a fig 5 further shows the difference in microbial community among the four reactors at genus level it was reported that rhodospirillaceae uncultured could secrete eps which played important roles in stabilizing granule structure wang et al 2018 yang et al 2018b with an increase of pfoa concentration from 0 to 1 0 mg l the relative abundances of rhodospirillaceae uncultured decreased from 2 91 to 1 13 which was in accord with the results shown in figs s4 and s5 in the control reactor two types of ammonia oxidizing bacteria namely nitrosomonas and nitrosomonadaceae uncultured were detected which accounted for 1 29 and 0 26 of the total bacterial sequences respectively in the 1 0 mg l pfoa reactor however nitrosomonadaceae uncultured was non detectable meanwhile the abundance of nitrosomonas decreased to 1 07 of the total bacterial sequences this suggested that the presence of pfoa inhibited ammonium oxidizing bacteria significantly and nitrosomonadaceae uncultured seemed to be more sensitive to pfoa than nitrosomonas it was also measured that nitrospira one typical nitrite oxidizing bacteria accounted for 0 95 of the total bacterial sequences in the control reactor whereas the corresponding value was merely 0 22 in the 1 0 mg l pfoa reactor confirming again that nitrite oxidizing process was severely inhibited by pfoa the relative abundance of candidatus accumulibacter one representative paos decreased from 20 82 to 10 09 with pfoa concentration increasing from 0 to 1 0 mg l which was mainly responsible for the deterioration of phosphorus removal in the pfoa added reactors apart from these bacteria several denitrifying bacteria such as azoarcus thauera and zoogloea chen et al 2012 were also detected in these reactors expectably the relative abundances of these denitrifying bacteria decreased with an increase of pfoa concentration from 0 to 1 0 mg l the relative abundances of azoarcus thauera and zoogloea decreased from 1 18 1 39 and 1 23 0 93 1 07 and 1 02 respectively all these variations in microbial communities supported well the chemical analyses regarding the settleability and nutrient removal of aerobic granular sludge performed above 4 conclusions in this study the fate of pfoa in aerobic granular sludge and its effect on aerobic granular sludge were investigated for the first time the main conclusions are 1 about 32 0 36 4 of pfoa in wastewater was removed by aerobic granular sludge after stable operation when pfoa concentration was ranged from 0 1 to 1 0 mg l sorption kinetic analysis indicated that inhomogeneous multilayer adsorption was responsible for this removal 2 the adsorbed pfoa deteriorated the settleability and biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal of granular sludge significantly with an increase of pfoa from 0 to 1 mg l sop and tn removal efficiencies decreased from 94 2 0 2 and 99 4 0 5 to 55 1 1 7 and 80 1 2 5 respectively 3 pfoa affected several function groups in extracellular polymeric substances such as hydroxyl groups amides and polysaccharides and pfoa inhibited the transformations of polyhydroxyalkanoates and glycogen 4 microbial community analysis showed that pfoa decreased the abundances of nitrosomonas nitrospira accumulibacter and other function microbes such as rhodospirillaceae thauera and azoarcus declaration of competing interest the authors

18349,the increasing use of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa raises concerns about its potential toxicity to the environment however the interaction between pfoa and aerobic granular sludge has never been documented this work therefore aims to provide such support through investigating the fate of pfoa at environmentally relevant levels in aerobic granular sludge systems and its impact on aerobic granular sludge experimental results showed that 32 0 36 4 of wastewater pfoa was removed by aerobic granular sludge in stable operation when pfoa concentration was ranged from 0 1 to 1 0 mg l mass balance analyses and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy survey scan revealed that the removal of pfoa was dominated by adsorption rather than biodegradation and sorption kinetic analysis indicated that inhomogeneous multilayer adsorption was responsible for this removal the adsorbed pfoa deteriorated the settleability of granular sludge and biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal significantly experimental results showed that 1 0 mg l pfoa inhibited anaerobic phosphate release aerobic phosphate uptake nitrate reduction and nitrite reduction processes by 60 50 13 1 and 5 8 respectively it was observed that pfoa induced large amounts of filamentous villus growing on the surface and increased the extracellular polymeric substances of granular sludge fourier transform infrared spectra and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectrum showed that several function groups in extracellular polymeric substances such as hydroxyl groups amides and polysaccharides were affected by pfoa it was also found that pfoa inhibited the cyclic transformations of polyhydroxyalkanoates and glycogen microbial community analyses showed that pfoa decreased the abundances of nitrosomonas nitrospira accumulibacter and other function microbes such as rhodospirillaceae thauera and azoarcus graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge perfluorooctanoic acid adsorption microbial community 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge is widely considered one of the most promising biotechnologies for wastewater treatment owning to its high biomass retention good settling ability dense and strong microbial structure and high tolerance to organic loading and toxicity adav et al 2008a compared to the conventional activated sludge process the bioreactor volume can be largely reduced and bulky settling devices are not needed therefore aerobic granular sludge technology has been recently attracted growing attention in the past most efforts were dedicated to cultivating aerobic granule optimizing operational parameters or scaling up aerobic granular sludge technology to practical levels for example verawaty et al 2012 found that when activated sludge and crushed aerobic granule sludge were used as inocula to cultivate aerobic granular sludge crushed granules acted as nuclei for attachment of floccular sludge during the initial stage of granule development wang et al 2006 reported that a rapid formation of aerobic granulation could be achieved at high volume exchange ratios varying from 20 to 80 because high volume exchange ratios facilitated excessive production of extracellular polymers and subsequent calcium accumulation to date more than 40 full scale aerobic granule sludge based municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been in operation or under construction worldwide e g netherlands australia brazil poland portugal ireland scotland south africa and switzerland since 2005 pronk et al 2017 these plants demonstrated significant improvements in process stability effluent quality and energy saving as compared to traditional activated sludge processes with total nitrogen 5 mg l and total phosphorus 0 3 mg l being usually achieved in effluent niermans et al 2014 previous investigations demonstrated that aerobic granular sludge was effective in removing the major pollutants in wastewaters such as biological oxygen demand nitrogen and phosphorus even in real situations nancharaiah and reddy 2018 yang et al 2019 apart from these major pollutants wastewaters also contain several emerging pollutants which are detected even at ppm level but overlooked previously to date little information is available to interactions between aerobic granular sludge and these emerging pollutants perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa a class of emerging pollutants which is largely produced and used in various commercial products and industrial processes such as coatings shampoos electroplating fire fighting foams lubricants and pesticides lindstrom et al 2011 gupta and saleh 2013 in addition pfoa is the final degradation product of a variety of precursor perfluorinated chemicals including fluorotelomer alcohols and fluorinated polymers ochoa herrera and sierra alvarez 2008 large quantities of pfoa have been produced and utilized world wide during the last decades li et al 2015 for instance it was documented that approximately 150 t pfoa was used in china in 2013 liu et al 2017 the extensive application of pfoa inevitably leads to its environmental release resulting in substantial accumulations in wwtps the last barriers before its final entrance to natural environment it is reported that pfoa is often detected at substantial levels in both wwtps and natural waterbodies in many areas for example sludge pfoa level was 23 2 298 0 ng g dried weight in different wwtps in shanghai china wang et al 2015 wang et al reported that the average and maximal concentrations of pfoa were 0 11 mg l and 0 97 mg l in xiaoqing river in china respectively wang et al 2016a according to our survey on seven wwtps in central and east china e g changsha and ningbo pfoa concentration in municipal wastewaters was in the range of 0 09 0 92 mg l pfoa is extremely persistent bioaccumulative and very resistant to typical environmental degradation processes due to its carbon fluorine bonds with high bond energy approximately 110 kcal mol vecitis et al 2009 moreover pfoa is a carcinogen a developmental toxicant a liver toxicant and an immune system toxicant and also exerts hormonal impacts including alteration of thyroid hormone levels persson et al 2013 xia et al 2017 thus the fate of pfoa in various environments and its toxicity to environmental microbes have recently attracted increasing concerns qu et al 2010 higgins and schultz schultz et al 2006 found that the mass flows of pfoa were 400 80 mg day in raw influent and 300 40 mg day in final effluent suggesting that conventional activated sludge process could not effectively remove this compound yu et al reported that 20 mg l pfoa had negative impacts on microbial growth and organic carbon removal they found that 16 s rrna gene copy numbers decreased from 8 18 108 to 1 24 108 copies m l while dissolved organic carbon in effluent increased from 5 0 to 17 8 mg c l in steady state operation yu et al 2018 despite these significant advances the interaction between pfoa and aerobic granular sludge has never been documented up to now it is unknown whether pfoa is removed by aerobic granular sludge if it is how is it removed by aerobic granular sludge does pfoa at environmentally relevant levels significantly affect the performances of aerobic granular sludge based on the questions above this work therefore aims to fill this gap through deeply understanding the fate of pfoa at environmentally relevant levels i e 0 1 1 mg l in aerobic granular sludge systems and its impacts on aerobic granular sludge firstly the removal efficiency of pfoa in aerobic granular sludge systems was evaluated then details of how aerobic granular sludge removes pfoa were elucidated through the analyses of mass balance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and sorption kinetics and isotherm models thirdly the effect of pfoa on the performances of aerobic granular sludge such as settleability and biological nutrient removal was assessed finally the mechanisms of pfoa affecting these performances were explored from the aspects of the morphology of aerobic granular sludge surface assayed by scanning electron microscopy sem variations of chemical functional groups by fourier transform infrared spectra ftir and xps the transformations of metabolic intermediates and the abundances of major microorganisms by amplicon sequencing analysis to the best of our knowledge this is the first work clarifying the interaction between pfoa and aerobic granular sludge the findings achieved fill the gap between aerobic granular sludge and the emerging contaminant pfoa 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater synthetic wastewater was used in this work and prepared daily by nh4cl kh2po4 and ch3coona to get average initial nh4 n soluble phosphorus sop and soluble chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations of approximately 56 15 and 418 mg l respectively the synthetic wastewater also contained the following compounds mgso4 74 mg l cacl2 18 mg l znso4 7h2o 0 18 mg l mncl2 2h2o 0 2 mg l nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o 0 13 mg l ki 0 05 mg l h3bo3 0 18 mg

sludge reactors four reproductive sequencing batch reactors were configured with an effective working volume of 13 l each the seed aerobic granule sludge was withdrawn from an aerobic granule sludge reactor operated in our laboratory and was inoculated into the four reactors simultaneously the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and sludge volume index svi of the seed granules were approximately 6300 mg l and 30 ml g respectively all the reactors were placed in a temperature controlled room 21 1 c and operated with three cycles daily each cycle consisted of 5 min feeding 120 min anaerobic and 240 min aerobic periods followed by 5 min settling 5 min decanting and 45 min idle periods during the feeding period each reactor received 7 l synthetic wastewater containing 0 serving as the control 0 1 0 5 or 1 0 mg l pfoa which were prepared by adding relevant volumes of pfoa stock 0 5 g l to wastewater in the decanting period 7 l of the supernatant was decanted from each reactor continuous aeration was carried out by pumping ambient air to each reactor at a rate of 2 5 l min in the aerobic period each reactor was constantly mixed with a magnetic stirrer 150 rpm except for the settling decanting and idle periods the hydraulic retention time and sludge retention time in these reactors were controlled at approximately 6 h and 21 d respectively all the reactors were operated more than 150 days during which the effluent concentrations of pfoa ammonium nitrite nitrate sop and soluble cod were measured twice a week besides svi and mlss in both the reactors and effluent were determined once per week it took about 65 days before these data achieved relatively stable in stable operation cyclic investigations microbial analyses and batch tests were carried out the degradation of pfoa in different periods of aerobic granular sludge systems was indicated by the loss rate of pfoa which was calculated by equation 1 1 the loss rate of pfoa m l i 1 m l i m s m s i 1 m l i 1 m s i 1 where ml i and ml i 1 is the total mass of pfoa in the liquor phase of reactor in the current i and previous time i 1 and ms i and ms i 1 is the total mass of pfoa in the sludge phase of reactor in the current i and previous time i 1 2 3 batch tests for the analyses of sorption kinetics and sorption isotherm in the adsorption kinetics test two reproductive polypropylene flasks with working volume of 1 l each were performed to differentiate the pfoa adsorption kinetics between aerobic granule sludge and conventional flocculent sludge each flask first received 250 ml either granule sludge withdrawn from the control reactor or conventional activated sludge cultivated in our lab then each flask was fed with synthetic wastewater to a final volume of 1 l the mlss and pfoa concentrations in the two flasks were the same and controlled at approximately 3000 mg l and 0 5 mg l respectively afterwards the flasks were placed in a temperature controlled room 21 1 c and mixed at 150 rpm by magnetic stirrers samples were taken from each flask at 5 15 30 45 60 90 120 180 240 and 360 min respectively the collected samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 8000 r min and 4 c and the supernatants were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane before pfoa measurement in the sorption isotherm test six replicate polypropylene flasks with a working volume of 1 l each were performed each received 250 ml aerobic granule sludge taken from the control reactor before being diluted with synthetic wastewater to a final volume of 1 l the pfoa concentration in these flasks was 0 1 0 2 0 5 0 8 1 or 2 mg l whereas mlss concentration in each flask was almost the same 3000 mg l all other operations were the same as described in the sorption kinetics test the adsorption isotherms of freundlich langmuir and temkin please see details below were respectively used to fit the data 2 freundlich isotherm lnq e lnk f 1 n lnc e where ce is the equilibrium concentration of pfoa mg l qe is the

effect of pfoa on nitrifying and denitrifying processes in this set of batch tests 16 reproductive reactors with a working volume of 500 ml each were performed these reactors were divided into four groups namely ammonium oxidation test nitrite oxidation test nitrate reduction test and nitrite reduction test with four in each which were used to assess the effect of pfoa on nitrifying and denitrifying processes respectively it should be noted that the effect of pfoa on the specific rates of phosphorus release and phosphorus uptake could be assessed directly in the parent reactors thus batch tests in terms of phosphorus release and uptake were not performed here ammonium oxidation test a total volume of 0 2 l mixed liquor was respectively withdrawn from the four parent aerobic granule sludge reactors operated above at the end of the aerobic period in stable operation each mixture was first centrifuged 5000 revolutions per min for 5 min at 20 c and washed with tap water to remove the residual nh4 n no3 n and no2 n and then re suspended in tap water with a final volume of 0 2 l then different amounts of pfoa were respectively added into the four reactors to achieve pfoa concentrations of 0 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 mg l which were the same as their parent reactors respectively afterwards 2 0 ml nh4 n stock solution 5 g n l was added into each reactor resulting in an initial nh4 n concentration of 50 mg nh4 n l during the entire experiment period air was adequately supplied to guarantee that dissolved oxygen was not limiting 5 mg l each reactor was operated for 60 min samples were taken at 15 min intervals for nh4 n measurement and the vss concentration was determined at the end of the test the volumetric nh4 n oxidation rate was measured through linear regression of the corresponding profile and the biomass specific nh4 n oxidation rate was then calculated by dividing the volumetric rate by the vss concentration nitrite oxidation test this test was performed the same as described in ammonium oxidation test except that 50 mg nh4 n l was replaced by 50 mg no2 n l in each reactor nitrate reduction test the operation was conducted the same as described in ammonium oxidation test except the following parts in each reactor 50 mg l no3 n was employed to replace 50 mg l nh4 n after no3 n addition 400 mg l cod prepared by 5 g l sodium acetate was added to each reactor to serve as electron donors for denitrification each reactor was constantly mixed with a magnetic stirrer 150 rpm without aeration during the entire test nitrite reduction test this test was carried out as those described in nitrate reduction test except that 50 mg l no2 n was used to replace 50 mg l no3 n 2 5 analytical methods ph was measured using a digital ph meter phs 3c leici co ltd shanghai china the analyses of cod nh4 n no2 n no3 n tn sop mlss and svi were conducted in accordance with standard methods apha 1998 wang et al 2019 morphology of aerobic granular sludge was recorded by a digital camera and the microstructure was probed by a sem hitachi s 570 japan the xps measurement was performed using an escalab 250xi spectrometer with an al kα x ray source a heat extraction method was applied to extract different eps fractions li and yang 2007 and the extraction process was detailed in supporting information text s1 an uplc ms ms was used to determine pfoa concentration and its degradation products using an uplc system waters corp usa equipped with a c18 column 2 1 mm 50 mm 1 7 μm waters usa after lyophilization 0 1 g sludge sample was transferred to a 15 ml polypropylene tube and spiked with methanol 7 5 ml the mixture was sonicated in a water bath for 15 min at 60 c and centrifuged for 15 min at 5000 rpm sonication was repeated for three times yielding a total of 22 5 ml supernatant the supernatant was collected and then concentrated to 1 ml through nitrogen blowing the sample was vortex mixed well and filtered through a 0 22 μm nylon

to original conditions at 8 51 min and was held 3 b until 12 min the column temperature was controlled constantly at 40 c ftir was performed to determine variations in functional groups the sludge sample was analyzed with a nicolet 560 ftir spectrometer under ambient conditions before analysis the wet sample was dried at 105 c and grounded with an agate mortar the sample was blended with kbr and then pressed into a disk for ftir analysis pure kbr disk was used as ftir reference scans wavenumber was in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 variations in microbial community among these reactors were

significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfoa removal in aerobic granular sludge systems table 1 outlines pfoa removal in different granule sludge reactors in stable operation it can be seen that influent pfoa level did not bring obvious impacts on pfoa removal efficiency in this work with an increase of influent pfoa concentration from 0 1 to 1 mg l pfoa removal efficiency varied merely from 32 0 1 1 to 36 4 1 2 which was higher than that removed by the conventional activated sludge process schultz et al 2006 by determining the pfoa concentration in influent and effluent higgins and schultz schultz et al 2006 found that 0 1 of pfoa in influent was only removed by the conventional activated sludge process it was reported previously that when aerobic granular sludge was used to remove five types of pharmaceuticals and personal care products the removal efficiencies of prednisolone norfloxacin naproxen sulphamethoxazole and ibuprofen reached 98 5 87 8 84 0 79 8 and 63 3 respectively wang et al 2016b saleh and gupta 2014 each cycle of granule sludge reactor includes an anaerobic period and an aerobic period to further figure out pfoa removal in the two periods pfoa concentration at the end of the two periods was also measured it can be found that 0 066 0 003 0 302 0 015 and 0 578 0 028 mg l pfoa were respectively measured in the liquid phase at the end of anaerobic period in the 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 mg l pfoa reactors while the corresponding concentrations at the end of aerobic period were 0 070 0 003 0 322 0 016 and 0 638 0 031 mg l respectively table 1 this indicates that anaerobic period is mainly responsible for pfoa removal in such granule sludge systems it should be noted that liquid pfoa concentration at the end of aerobic period in all the reactors increased rather than decreased slightly as compared with that measured in the anaerobic end probably due to that the intercepted or adsorbed pfoa in the anaerobic period was partly released from granule sludge during aeration it was also documented that pfoa could be eliminated effectively in lab scale closed loop reactors under anaerobic conditions under aerobic conditions however pfoa could not be eliminated by adsorption degradation or mineralization meesters and schroder 2004 gupta et al 2010 which well supported the data obtained in this work all the facts demonstrated that a portion of pfoa can be removed anaerobically by aerobic granular sludge in the following text details of how aerobic granular sludge removes pfoa were explored 3 2 how was pfoa removed in such aerobic granular sludge systems two behaviors i e adsorption and biodegradation are generally responsible for the removal of organics to identify the major behavior of pfoa removal in aerobic granular sludge systems mass balance analysis of pfoa in liquor and sludge phases in these reactors was performed table 2 it was found that with the decrease of pfoa content in liquor phase pfoa content in sludge phase increased and the sum of pfoa content in liquor and sludge phases did not vary significantly with time for example in the reactor receiving 1 0 mg l pfoa the sum of pfoa content in liquor and sludge phases was 5 14 0 25 mg at the beginning of anaerobic phase 4 78 0 24 mg at the end of anaerobic phase and 4 82 0 25 mg at the end of aerobic phase and these variations were statistically insignificant p 0 05 further calculations showed that less than 7 of total pfoa was lost in the entire treatment process similar observations were also observed in the other two reactors this suggested that influent pfoa was mainly removed through adsorption rather than biodegradation it was documented that perfluoroheptanoic acid perfluorohexanoic acid perfluorovaleric acid perfluorabutyric acid and pentafluoropropionic acid were the major degradation products of pfoa arias espana et al 2015 yan et al 2010 to further confirm the degradation possibility of pfoa in the granular sludge systems uplc ms was employed to identify the presence of these products it can be seen that all the compounds were not found in the uplc ms chromatogram of liquor sample or sludge sample taken from the 1 0 mg l pfoa reactor at the end of anaerobic period fig s1 supporting information suggesting that pfoa was non biodegradable in such aerobic granular sludge systems xps measurement showed that apart from the major elements i e n c and o a small and clear peak of f1s also appeared on the xps spectra of the sludge sample taken from the 0 5 mg l pfoa reactor in stable operation fig 1 a and b compared with the control reactor the fitting peaks at 689 1ev was corresponded to the c f bond in the 0 5 mg l pfoa reactor fig 1c and d which indicated the presence of pfoa in sludge the results confirmed that pfoa was adsorbed by aerobic granular sludge at a molecular level which supported the data presented in table 2 and confirmed again that aerobic granular sludge adsorption instead of biodegradation was responsible for pfoa removal in this work which was consistent with the results reported in the literature as well vecitis et al 2009 yu et al 2009 3 3 details of how aerobic granular sludge adsorbs pfoa to explore the adsorption behavior of pfoa the adsorption kinetics test was first employed using both aerobic granule sludge and conventional flocculent sludge it was found that the pseudo second order model described the experimental data well fig s2 supporting information the equilibrium adsorption capacity and initial adsorption rate of granular sludge were 0 14 mg g and 0 06 mg min respectively which were respectively 2 and 6 times of those of conventional flocculent sludge further analyses showed that the content of eps proteins in aerobic granular sludge was much higher than that in flocculent sludge 147 8 vs 54 92 mg g vss table s1 which may be the reason for the greater equilibrium adsorption capacity and rate adav et al 2008b it was reported that there was a significant correlation between eps proteins and sludge pfoa adsorption and sludge protein composition was favorable for the adsorption of pfoa zhang et al 2013 adsorption isotherm model is often used to describe the adsorption of organic matters from liquid phase to solid phase ochoa herrera and sierra alvarez 2008 to find out a suitable adsorption model for pfoa langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm models were tested with their fitting results being shown in fig s3 supporting information among them freundlich model was found to describe the pfoa adsorption much better than the other two indicating that the process of pfoa adsorption by aerobic granular sludge was mainly inhomogeneous multilayer adsorption 3 4 impact of pfoa on settleability and nutrient removal of aerobic granular sludge after about 65 d all the reactors achieved steady state operation it was found that the presence of pfoa increased svi and effluent suspended solids concentration but decreased mlss in aerobic granular sludge reactors with an increase of pfoa concentration from 0 to 1 0 mg l effluent suspended solids concentration and svi increased respectively from 3 mg l and 40 ml g to 35 mg l and 90 ml g whereas reactor mlss decreased from 4600 mg l to 3300 mg l fig s4 supporting information the results demonstrated that the presence of pfoa deteriorated the settleability of aerobic granular sludge fig 2 shows the cyclic transformations of cod sop tn ammonium nitrite and nitrate it can be seen that cod transformation in both the anaerobic and aerobic periods was affected by the presence of pfoa with an increase of pfoa concentration from 0 to 1 0 mg l cod concentration in the anaerobic and aerobic end increased from 28 06 5 70 and 24 02 5 38 to 156 96 4 86 and 42 07 4 28 mg l mg l respectively fig 2a accompanied with the decrease of anaerobic cod uptake anaerobic sop release also decreased the sop concentration at the end of anaerobic period decreased from 62 44 1 53 to 31 45 1 37 mg l with pfoa concentration increasing from 0 to 1 0 mg l subsequently sop concentration at the end of aerobic period increased from 0 54 0 02 to 4 56 0 54 mg l fig 2b it is known that the energy generated from polyphosphate cleavage anaerobically is mainly used for polyphosphate accumulating organisms to take up cod while the stored carbon is majorly used to provide energy or electron donors for aerobic sop uptake or denitrifying sop uptake the results suggested that pfoa addition deteriorated obviously anaerobic sop release and aerobic sop uptake further investigations showed that the specific anaerobic sop release rate and aerobic sop uptake rate decreased respectively from 9 5 0 5 and 4 6 0 2 to 3 8 0 1 and 2 3 0 1 mg p g vss min with pfoa increasing from 0 to 1 0 mg l table 3 this suggested that 1 0 mg l pfoa inhibited anaerobic sop release and aerobic sop uptake processes by 60 and 50 respectively the addition of pfoa also deteriorated tn removal efficiency and tn removal efficiency decreased from 99 4 0 5 to 80 1 2 5 with pfoa dosage increasing from 0 to 1 0 mg l fig 2c compared with the control the presence of 0 1 and 0 5 mg l pfoa did not cause obvious variations in ammonium oxidation with 0 mg l ammonium being measured at the end of the aerobic period in the three reactors fig 2d however 2 2 0 65 mg l ammonium was determined at the end of the aerobic period in the reactor with 1 0 mg l pfoa addition suggesting that this level of pfoa inhibit ammonium oxidation process it was also found that the presence of pfoa resulted in the accumulations of nitrite and nitrate fig 2e and f indicating that nitrifying and or denitrifying processes were inhibited to figure out the specific effect of pfoa on both the nitrifying and denitrifying processes a series of batch tests was operated and the results were summarized in table 3 nh4 n oxidation rate was measured at 5 2 mg n g vss min in the reactors with 0 0 1 and 0 5 mg l pfoa addition confirming again that pfoa at such levels did not affect ammonium oxidation process further increase of pfoa concentration to 1 0 mg l reduced it to 4 6 mg n g vss min suggesting that this dosage of pfoa inhibited ammonium oxidation process by 11 5 compared with ammonium oxidation process nitrite oxidation process however was inhibited much severer by pfoa with an increase of pfoa from 0 to 1 0 mg l no2 n oxidation rate decreased from 3 5 to 2 1 mg n g vss min indicating that 1 0 mg l pfoa inhibited nitrite oxidation process by 40 similar to ammonium oxidation process low levels of pfoa e g 0 1 and 0 5 mg l did not inhibit nitrate and nitrite reduction processes while 1 0 mg l pfoa inhibited these processes by 13 1 and 5 8 respectively in the following text mechanisms of how pfoa affects nitrogen and phosphorus removal were further explored 3 5 mechanisms of how pfoa affects the settleability and nitrogen and phosphorus removal of aerobic granular sludge the sludge in the control reactor showed a typical aerobic granular phenotype with its yellow surface being smooth and soft fig s5 after 20 d exposure to pfoa the granules became while with large amounts of filamentous villus growing on their surfaces fig s5a similar observations were also observed on 60 d operation this could be further supported by sem analysis shown in fig 3 a it can be seen that large numbers of cocci shaped and bacilli shaped cells were observed in the control reactor with the increase of pfoa concentration the cocci shaped and bacilli shaped cells decreased or even disappeared whereas filamentous sharped cells increased on the surface of aerobic granular sludge suggesting the presence of filamentous villus outside aerobic granular sludge filamentous microorganisms including fungi have a competitive advantage over non filamentous because they are able to take up more nutrients from media at low substrate levels owing to their high surface area to volume ratio and preferential growth in a single direction once filamentous growth dominated the surface of aerobic granular sludge deterioration of aerobic granular sludge structure and settleability occurred leading to subsequent biomass washout yu and liu 2006 eps are the major components of granule sludge playing crucial roles in the structure and functions of microbial aggregates and providing a protective barrier for microorganisms inside granule sludge to environmental toxins henriques and love 2007 as shown in fig 3b the content of proteins in all the s eps lb eps and tb eps increased respectively from 76 4 17 5 and 15 2 to 117 2 58 7 and 28 7 mg g vss with pfoa concentration increasing from 0 to 1 0 mg l it was indicated that eps was essential for maintaining the structural stability of aerobic granular sludge and deterioration of aerobic granular sludge settleability was mainly attributed to a sharp increase in lb eps content chen et al 2010 liu et al 2019 all the facts demonstrated that pfoa affected the surface structure and eps content of aerobic granular sludge which thereby deteriorated its settleability the functional groups in eps are closely relevant to the function of aerobic granule sludge thus we used ftir to investigate the effect of pfoa on the possible functional groups dominated in eps with the results being shown in fig 4 a compared with the control there were some changes decrease and shift in the bands of 1642 and 1546 cm 1 after pfoa addition they are assigned to amido i and ii bands of proteins table s2 supporting information indicating the changes closely related to the increase of eps proteins the band at 1072 cm 1 representing c o c of polysaccharides showed a shift to 1053 cm 1 in addition the signals in the range of 3440 3449 cm 1 belonging to the stretching of o h showed a significant increase in transmission intensities clearly when aerobic granular sludge was exposed to pfoa the main changes occurred in hydroxyl groups amides and polysaccharides it is known that these three groups are important compositions of enzymes in aerobic granule sludge which are mainly responsible for nutrient removal previous investigations demonstrated that pfoa could produce oxidative stress and cause protein dysfunction in organisms he et al 2016 liu et al 2016 it was documented that pfoa could affect the permeability of cell membranes and bind to proteins and other cell components in cells thereby inactivating the enzymes or leading to malfunction of the enzymes he et al 2016 to obtain more information regarding the function groups xps spectra were also used in this work four fitting peaks at 284 8 286 3 287 9 and 288 6 ev were detected in c1s high resolution spectrum fig 4b i and 4b ii which were reported to represent c c c o co and cooh bonds respectively liu et al 2010 in n1s high resolution spectrum two different characteristic peaks were also determined at 399 9 and 401 6 ev respectively fig 4b iii and 4 b iv the former peak is thought as nh2 while the latter peak is indicated as nh4 jansen and van bekkum 1995 compared with the control the presence of pfoa respectively decreased c element content of c c and cooh by 4 13 and 47 64 but increased c element content of c o and co by 0 43 and 23 34 respectively table s3 supporting information it was also found that pfoa increased the content of n element in nh2 group by 1 75 but decreased the content of n element in nh4 group by 22 04 table s3 supporting information all the facts confirmed again that pfoa affected the function groups in granular eps which thereby affected the performance of granules it was reported that polar functionalities dipoles such as nh and oh could develop relatively weak ion dipole interaction to anionic pfoa molecules punyapalakul et al 2013 it is well documented that biological nutrient especially phosphorus removal is related to the transformations of intermediate metabolites such as intracellular polyhydroxyalkanoates pha and glycogen chen et al 2012 oehmen et al 2007 generally the influent organics were consumed with pha synthesis and glycogen degradation in the anaerobic period while the stored pha was oxidized for phosphorus uptake denitrification and glycogen replenishment in the subsequent aerobic period compared with the control the presence of pfoa decreased the cyclic transformations of both pha and glycogen fig s6 for example the amounts of anaerobic pha accumulation and glycogen degradation were 4 4 and 2 9 mmol c g vss in the control whereas the corresponding values were 1 3 and 1 4 mmol c g vss in the 1 0 mg l pfoa reactor respectively fig s6 supporting information it is documented that in biological phosphorus removal systems the cyclic transformations of pha and glycogen are closely associated with the activities of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos the higher the transformations of pha and glycogen the greater metabolism activities of paos mino et al 1998 it seems that the presence of pfoa inhibited the intracellular metabolite transformations of paos and or denitrifying paos this inhibition decreased the activities of paos or denitrifying paos which might be one reason for pfoa deteriorating nitrogen and phosphorus removal the structure of microbial community and the abundance of functional bacteria are relevant to the performance of aerobic granule sludge thus the microbial communities among the four reactors were finally compared using the amplicon sequencing proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi were the three main phyla in all the four reactors but the presence of pfoa caused substantial changes in the abundances of microorganisms in these phyla fig s7 supporting information for example compared with the control the abundances of microbes affiliated to proteobacteria in the 1 0 mg l pfoa reactor increased by 41 76 whereas the populations of microbes affiliated to bacteroidetes and chloroflexi decreased by 1 35 and 35 24 respectively many types of microbes belonged to these phyla were reported to contribute to the removals of antimicrobial substances and nutrient zhao et al 2015 yang et al 2018a fig 5 further shows the difference in microbial community among the four reactors at genus level it was reported that rhodospirillaceae uncultured could secrete eps which played important roles in stabilizing granule structure wang et al 2018 yang et al 2018b with an increase of pfoa concentration from 0 to 1 0 mg l the relative abundances of rhodospirillaceae uncultured decreased from 2 91 to 1 13 which was in accord with the results shown in figs s4 and s5 in the control reactor two types of ammonia oxidizing bacteria namely nitrosomonas and nitrosomonadaceae uncultured were detected which accounted for 1 29 and 0 26 of the total bacterial sequences respectively in the 1 0 mg l pfoa reactor however nitrosomonadaceae uncultured was non detectable meanwhile the abundance of nitrosomonas decreased to 1 07 of the total bacterial sequences this suggested that the presence of pfoa inhibited ammonium oxidizing bacteria significantly and nitrosomonadaceae uncultured seemed to be more sensitive to pfoa than nitrosomonas it was also measured that nitrospira one typical nitrite oxidizing bacteria accounted for 0 95 of the total bacterial sequences in the control reactor whereas the corresponding value was merely 0 22 in the 1 0 mg l pfoa reactor confirming again that nitrite oxidizing process was severely inhibited by pfoa the relative abundance of candidatus accumulibacter one representative paos decreased from 20 82 to 10 09 with pfoa concentration increasing from 0 to 1 0 mg l which was mainly responsible for the deterioration of phosphorus removal in the pfoa added reactors apart from these bacteria several denitrifying bacteria such as azoarcus thauera and zoogloea chen et al 2012 were also detected in these reactors expectably the relative abundances of these denitrifying bacteria decreased with an increase of pfoa concentration from 0 to 1 0 mg l the relative abundances of azoarcus thauera and zoogloea decreased from 1 18 1 39 and 1 23 0 93 1 07 and 1 02 respectively all these variations in microbial communities supported well the chemical analyses regarding the settleability and nutrient removal of aerobic granular sludge performed above 4 conclusions in this study the fate of pfoa in aerobic granular sludge and its effect on aerobic granular sludge were investigated for the first time the main conclusions are 1 about 32 0 36 4 of pfoa in wastewater was removed by aerobic granular sludge after stable operation when pfoa concentration was ranged from 0 1 to 1 0 mg l sorption kinetic analysis indicated that inhomogeneous multilayer adsorption was responsible for this removal 2 the adsorbed pfoa deteriorated the settleability and biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal of granular sludge significantly with an increase of pfoa from 0 to 1 mg l sop and tn removal efficiencies decreased from 94 2 0 2 and 99 4 0 5 to 55 1 1 7 and 80 1 2 5 respectively 3 pfoa affected several function groups in extracellular polymeric substances such as hydroxyl groups amides and polysaccharides and pfoa inhibited the transformations of polyhydroxyalkanoates and glycogen 4 microbial community analysis showed that pfoa decreased the abundances of nitrosomonas nitrospira accumulibacter and other function microbes such as rhodospirillaceae thauera and azoarcus declaration of competing interest the authors
