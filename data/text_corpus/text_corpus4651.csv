23255,to investigate the effect of anode location and quantities on underwater electric fields numerical simulations were performed using the boundary element method simulations were performed for the cases of 3 4 and 5 pairs and the installation locations of the anodes were set at 10 different hull regions although the potential difference was nearly unchanged with changes in the anode locations the electric field was effectively diminished when the anodes were uniformly distributed through prevention of the current concentration at the specific region additionally increasing the number of anodes decreased the underwater electric field although the decrease rate of the electric field reduced thus the locations of anodes should be uniformly distributed and an adequate number of anodes should be applied to effectively reduce the underwater electric fields graphical abstract image 1 keywords underwater electric field cathodic protection potential simulation 1 introduction electric fields form around ship due to current flow from cathodic protection cp systems such as impressed current cathodic protection iccp and sacrificial anode cathodic protection sacp xing et al 2009 also underwater electrical potentials uep which can generate underwater electric signatures may form even in the absence of cp systems due to galvanic corrosion between the hull steel and propeller nickel aluminum bronze nab a steady current flow around the hull of a ship can create an underwater electric field modern underwater mines are attuned to these electric field signatures and use them to detect and classify passing vessels thus diminishing underwater electric fields is required to increase survivability mathiazhagan 2010 degiorgi et al 2005 one of the main sources for current flow is the cathodic protection current from iccp according to the evan s diagram in fig 1 the applied current for cp can be theoretically determined by the polarization curve abootalebi et al 2010 kim et al 2016 as seen in fig 1 the anodic current density is under activation control activation polarization and the cathodic current density is limited at a higher current density concentration polarization as the applied current for cp is increased the potential of the ship material is reduced and the corrosion current density is reduced accordingly roberge 1999 additionally the amount of applied current is generally proportional to the intensity of the underwater electric field indicating that the applied current should be minimized for electric field silencing prior to the 1980s the quantity and location of the iccp anodes were determined primarily based on empirical equations and the experience of engineers however iccp designed with these methods can often lead to under or overprotection easily inducing insufficient cathodic protection or hydrogen induced cracking and the cathodic stripping of coatings to solve this problem it is important to consider the relationship between the cathodic protection efficiency and the location or number of anodes recently the prediction or design of cp and underwater electric fields has been performed via numerical simulation especially the boundary element method bem kim et al 2017a b zamani et al 1987 xing et al 2016 z lan et al 2012 although cathodic protection optimization studies investigating the location or quantity of anodes have been performed previously diaz and adey 2005 these methods possess some challenges due to their complex structure presence of a sacrificial anode and polarization curves under various conditions therefore detailed studies are therefore needed under a variety of conditions and structures also prediction methods for underwater electric fields are needed to decrease the time consuming processes used during the design of vessels the latest researches included simulation of underwater electric field caused by cathodic protection influence of deep sea condition on the electric field of an underwater vehicle kim et al 2018a b investigation of underwater electric field of ship protected by cathodic current using computer simulation under the different conductivity environments kim et al 2018b and effect of temperature and flow velocity on underwater electromagnetic field under cathodic protection kim et al 2017c however they seem to be insufficient for considering the design of iccp although the effect of mixed type cathodic protection on underwater electric field kim et al 2017a b c is positive it has some limitations to apply it it means that the basic iccp design like arrangement of anodes is a very important consideration however the related research is lack even though the location and quantity of anodes have a significant influence on the cathodic protection efficiency and underwater signature thus in this study the influence of the iccp anode locations and the quantities of anodes on the underwater electric fields was investigated 2 experimental 2 1 numerical simulation model ship studied in this paper possessed a hull with a length of 103 m width of 13 m height of 6 m and two propellers because the wetted surface of the ship was of interest in this paper the immersed area model of the ship was established by the 3d boundary element method beasy cp10 0r15 also 10 pairs of iccp anodes area of each one is 1 1 m2 which is the noble part and not obeyed by a specific material property and dielectric shields area of each one is 2 4 m2 were installed in the 3d ship model with the same distance in the x direction in order to investigate the effects of the iccp anode locations and quantities of anodes this was done because the x positions of the anodes primarily influence the cathodic protection and underwater electric field eight sacrificial anodes brick shaped were also installed on each rudder and shaft support fig 2 shows a meshed model of the ship with 16 156 quadrilateral or triangular elements in this model the x axis and y axis are parallel and vertical to the keel of the ship respectively while the z axis is vertical to sea level 2 2 boundary conditions a mathematical formulation for a uniform isotropic electrolyte seawater domain denoted by ω in fig 3 was applied to the bem simulation adey and niku 1998 some simplifying assumptions were made to assist in the simulation i the solution must be uniform and electro neutral ii a concentration gradient should not be present in the electrolyte solution and iii the boundary of the container should be electrically insulating to eliminate any potential flow current leakages from the container according to these assumptions the potential obeyed the laplace equation as follows 1 1 k 2 φ 0 the laplace equation was solved using the following boundary conditions jia et al 2006 2 φ φ 0 on γ 1 3 i i 0 on γ 2 4 i a f a φ a on γ 3 a 5 i c f c φ c on γ 3 c where k s m is the conductivity of seawater 4 s m in this paper ϕ v is the potential of the ship surface γ is the entire surface of the electrolyte domain including γ 1 γ 2 γ 3a and γ 3c and i is the current across the boundary additionally ϕ 0 and i 0 are given constant values for the potential and current respectively f a φ a and f c φ c are functions that indicate the relationship between the potential and current of the anode and cathode respectively equations 4 and 5 are the boundary conditions of the anode hull and propeller according to the surface condition the initial output current of the iccp anode can be calculated with dnv rp 401 det norske veritas 2010 polarization curves of the hull hy 80 propeller nab and sacrificial anode zn in seawater obtained via piecewise linear interpolation were derived as the boundary conditions the polarization curves were measured via potentiodynamic polarization experiments and the potential was scanned from 150 mv relative to the open circuit potential to 1200 mv vs the saturated calomel electrode sce at a scan rate of 0 166 mv s the dimensions of the specimen for the polarization test were 10 10 5 mm3 a 15 coating damaged condition was applied to simulate 10 years of service under sea water conditions according to equation 6 as given by dnv rp 401 6 f c a b t where t year is the duration of immersion and a initial damage 0 02 and b damage velocity 0 012 are damage constants that depend on the coating specs and condition fig 4 shows the polarization curves of each material used in this study potentiodynamic polarization tests for achieving polarization curves are conducted in three times and there is almost no difference among them a semi infinite one zone case was considered in order to exclude interfacial influences caused by current reflection to assume a semi infinite zone the dimensions of the zone were set to 1000 1000 500 m3 because the current flow from the cp system can be ignored at locations that are more than 10 times the length of the ship away from the ship the conductivity of the zone was set to 4 s m 2 3 internal points and analysis of the underwater electric field electric fields caused by cp and corrosion were interpreted with internal points along the keel line where the highest signature of the ship occurred at a depth of 14 m from 150 m 0 m 14 m per 1 m main concerning depth of underwater mine is 14 m for the naval surface vessel because it is generally installed and operated at its depth therefore the analysis depth of underwater electric field is set to the 14 m also because the y component of the electric field ey was symmetrical at the keel line and the component values were almost zero ex and ez were evaluated in this study the amounts of arrangement cases for 3 4 and 5 pairs of anodes were 120 210 and 252 respectively interpretation of all of the cases was a time consuming process and inefficient with regard to analyzing the influence of anode locations and the quantities thus 10 arrangement cases were selected according to the following methods and assumptions i the iccp anodes are numbered from 1 bow to 10 stern according to their location on the ship ii the number of selected iccp anodes is summated in the cases of 3 4 and 5 pairs and the sum of the numbers is used as the x axis value in the maximum electric field vs anode location graph iii the process of selecting the anode location primarily considers the fully distributed state based on dnv rp 401 but the selected anode location cases consider one sided and adequately distributed locations to interpret the effect of the anode location it was helpful to evaluate the relationship between the anode locations and the underwater electric fields because the locations were defined by specific values 3 results and discussion the applied current for the iccp was optimized using the sequence linear programing method which was sufficient for the ship below 800 mvsce and for performing a detailed analysis with regard to the influence of anode locations and quantities on the electric field in short sufficient cathodic protection 800 mvsce was needed for all cases the anode positions and maximum average electric field which was the sum of the electric field in all directional components for the cases of 3 4 and 5 pairs are listed in tables 1 3 respectively these results can also be seen in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 the electric field was maximized when the installed anodes were one sided in the stern or bow region in all cases alternatively the electric field decreased when the installed anodes were properly distributed along the hull under the same applied total current although the electric field decreased when the anodes biased on the stern and bow regions were increased with regard to the anode quantity the electric field dramatically decreased after the anodes were properly distributed this indicates that the anode locations influenced the electric field value and can be used to decrease the maximum electric field without reducing the impressed current generally the electric field was proportional to the current density i caused by corrosion additionally cathodic protection in the medium demonstrated conductivity σ according to the following equation 7 varney et al 1999 2000 chung et al 2011 7 σ e i however the value of the electric field differed according to the anode position and quantities despite exhibiting the same total current this means that the value of the electric field at a specific region is related to the distribution of the applied current rather than the total applied current thus the diminishment of an underwater electric field should be considered with regard to the total applied current the anode locations and the number of anodes additionally the electric field was caused by the potential difference as evidenced by equation 8 8 e v d where v is the electric potential and d is the distance because the potential distribution is directly related to the underwater electric field it was investigated to evaluate the relationship between the hull potential measured between the cp system and the underwater electric field the potential distribution across the hull was investigated for cases where anodes were installed with one sided or uniformly distributed locations as can be seen in fig 6 in the case of 3 anode pairs the potential difference between the highest and lowest values decreased significantly after the anodes were uniformly distributed alternatively the potential gap between the highest and lowest values was almost similar in the cases of 4 and 5 pairs this suggests that the potential gap does not change for a specific quantity of anodes regardless of the anode location however according to equation 8 the underwater electric field could be changed because the distance between the different potential points had an effect on the underwater electric field thus investigations with regard to the underwater electric field in each case were necessary for a detailed analysis of the underwater electric field the electric field of the signature plane total electric field and x and z components e x and e z at the keel line were measured for anodes installed with one sided bow or stern regions or uniformly distributed locations fig 7 shows the signature planes of the underwater electric field total field for the cases of 3 4 and 5 pairs according to the installed anode locations for the cases of anodes installed on just one side a c d f g and i the electric field was the highest at a specific bow and stern region and distributed over a wide region along the shape of the vessel however as the number of anodes increased the highest electric field region moved from an area where an anode was installed to a region without an anode this means that the current flow from the iccp anode becomes more concentrated at a region without anode as the quantity of anodes increases additionally the electric field at the anode installed region decreased because the current from the anode was more widely distributed thus the electric field at that region was relatively reduced for the cases of uniformly distributed anodes b e and h high electric field regions were observed in the stern bow and middle part of the vessel and the distribution range of the electric field was narrower also the electric field value decreased for all cases with uniformly distributed anodes indicating that the current flow far from the source was diminished and that the protection current was effectively distributed throughout the hull of the ship without deviation e x and e z at the keel line for the case of anodes installed with one sided bow or stern regions or uniformly distributed locations can be seen in fig 8 the shape and value of the e x and e z profiles at the keel line were different due to the vector direction of the current flow from the iccp anodes and sacrificial anodes for the cases of anodes installed on just one side the electric field was concentrated steep graph line on the stern or bow region without any signature fluctuation additionally the degree of the steep line was moderated by increasing the quantity of the anodes this means that the one sided installation of anodes dramatically increases the electric field however this dramatic increase can be diminished by increasing the number of anodes for the cases of uniformly distributed anodes fluctuations in the electric field were clearly observed along the vessel theses fluctuations were mainly observed at the locations of installed anodes the degree of fluctuation did not significantly change according to an increase in the quantity of anodes however the maximum value of the electric field decreased with an increase in the quantity of anodes as can be seen in fig 9 the degree of electric field reduction decreased from 14 to 6 as the number of anodes increased this indicates that increasing the quantity of anodes affected the reduction of the electric field however the effect was diminished due to the length of the ship thus the number of anodes used should be changed according to the length of the ship when attempting to reduce the electric field in addition the applied current for the iccp according to the anode position and quantities are listed in table 4 in the case of anodes installed with one sided location the applied current was concentrated on the anode located forward or backward on the other hand the applied current was well divided when the anodes were installed with uniformly distributed locations this means that the applied current is more likely to be divided in the uniformly distributed cases thereby influence the reducing the underwater electric field also the total applied current value was not proportional to the underwater electric field indicating that the distribution of the applied current was more important than the total applied current value namely the location and quantity design in the iccp should be more significantly considered than the decreased of the total applied current 4 conclusion the effects of the anode locations and quantities on underwater electric fields in multi iccp anode systems were investigated using a simulation based on the boundary element method the electric field increased when anodes were installed and concentrated on the bow or stern regions due to the localization of cathodic current flow at a specific region the potential difference between the highest and lowest values decreased as the anode quantity increased in the all cases although the electric field decreased with an increasing the number of anodes the degree of reduction decreased in summary when attempting to diminish the underwater electric fields of iccp systems design engineer should consider using a uniform distribution of anodes additionally increasing the quantity of anodes decreased the electric field and this degree of reduction depended on the length of the ship

23256,in this paper a numerical wave flume with full functions of wave generation and absorption is proposed under the framework of weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics wcsph in contrast to the conventional sph numerical wave flumes using wave paddles and sponge layers the wave generation and absorption in this paper are implemented using non reflective open boundary conditions which are capable of generating multiple types of waves including solitary waves linear and second order regular waves passive and active wave absorption are available for transmitting incident waves and preventing secondary reflections steady or unsteady flows can also be defined during wave generation and absorption to set up numerical wave flow flumes the results on a series of validation cases indicate that this sph numerical wave flume not only performs satisfactorily in conventional wave generation and absorption and nonlinear wave structure interaction simulations but also has the following three advantages 1 it avoids using the sponge layers to shorten the flumes which improves the efficiency 2 it keeps the mean water level steady and prevents water level shifting

to the movement pattern of the wave generation equipment all types of waves in laboratory wave flumes including solitary waves monaghan and kos 1999 pringgana et al 2015 regular waves gao et al 2012 irregular waves altomare et al 2017 and even extreme waves dao et al 2011 can also be generated in nwfs by adjusting the frequency and the amplitude of the equipment s movement a good example was shown by a recent work of altomare et al 2017 which presented a fully comprehensive implementation of conventional wave generation and active wave absorption for second order long crested monochromatic and random waves in a wcsph based weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics model specific treatments were developed for the generation of nonperiodic waves for example li et al 2012 and lo and shao 2002 generated solitary waves by initializing the water particles with analytical velocities and free surface elevations fu and jin 2015 and capone et al 2010 simulated landslide waves as a sliding object interacting with steady water those wave generation techniques are only suitable for specific circumstances and cannot be generalized to periodic waves source generation is a rather common wave generation technique for grid based nwfs brorsen and larsen 1987 wei et al 1999 but has not attracted much attention in particle based nwfs ni and feng 2013 first introduced the source generation technique into sph nwf and successfully generated regular waves by modifying the velocities of the water particles inside the source zone later liu et al 2015 provided a more complete theoretical derivation implemented a momentum source in the framework of isph incomprehensible smoothed particle hydrodynamics and validated their nwf with a wave breakwater interaction case an additional sponge layer is usually needed behind the wave source to absorb the undesired waves leading to an increase in the number of computational nodes in the system and a reduction of efficiency meanwhile a qualified solitary wave cannot be generated in a particle based nwf by modifying the momentum source without introducing mass momentum i e adding or deleting particles similarly this type of nwf cannot implement generalized free surface flow except for the three abovementioned wave generation techniques some research has also been carried out on the application of open boundary conditions obcs in sph nwfs however it is relatively difficult to implement an euler viewed obc in a lagrangian characterized sph model first a dynamic upload unload algorithm for fluid particles should be carefully chosen to ensure the efficiency and robustness of the program second the integral completion of the particles near open boundaries should be fully considered to guarantee the computational accuracy finally it is also important to handle the exchange of both information e g fluctuations of free surface elevations and mass e g fluid particles between the inside and outside of the system to prevent the side effects brought by the reflection and unphysical noise at open boundaries the most frequently used obc for the sph method was proposed by lastiwka et al 2009 the integral completion of particles is guaranteed by deploying a buffer zone beside the open boundary and the information and mass can be exchanged through the movement of buffer particles this technique has already been applied in simulating multiple types of hydrodynamic phenomena based on the navier stokes equations including pipe flows khorasanizade and sousa 2016 lastiwka et al 2009 jets aristodemo et al 2015 open channel flows meister et al 2014 and hydraulic jumps federico et al 2012 as well as free surface flow problems based on the shallow water equations swes such as the okushiri tsunami in japan and flood inundations from a hypothetical dyke breach at thamesmead in the united kingdom vacondio et al 2012 it is worth mentioning that ni et al 2016 implemented non reflective obcs in an swe based sph free surface flow model for the first time based on the obc treatment from conventional ocean circulation models this non reflective obc treatment ensures the unhindered transmission of internal fluctuations out of the system without reflections at open boundaries when inputting external signal simultaneously it provides a theoretical basis for the wave generation and absorption technique in this paper leroy et al 2016 and ferrand et al 2017 investigated and introduced another kind of obcs named unified semi analytical open boundary conditions usaobcs in their isph and wcsph based numerical models respectively it is an extension of the unified semi analytical wall boundary conditions ferrand et al 2013 leroy et al 2014 the most intriguing feature of this new method was that the obcs analytically reconstructed the integral domain of particles near the open boundaries using open boundary nodes and particles nearby instead of using buffer particles solitary waves and regular waves were generated by a true mass source i e creating and destroying fluid particles through the obcs a passive obc was also implemented based on the riemann invariants near the open boundary and no reflection was observed when solitary waves propagated outwards leroy et al 2016 used the usaobc to simulate a creager weir flow and a 3 d circular pipe flow their work associated with ferrand et al 2017 s trial on wcsph both proved the high accuracy and stability of the usaobc however it remains to be studied whether this obc can be used to construct an active obc i e transmitting fluctuation outwards while receiving external signals simultaneously which is the key technique for active wave absorption awa in nwfs wave absorption is also an essential function for nwfs to eliminate undesired free surface fluctuations or implement a semi infinite nwf the simplest and most direct approach is to mimic the wave absorption strategy in the laboratory wave flume by deploying a mild slope at one end of the flume where waves will be dissipated after running up and breaking however this strategy is rarely utilized in sph nwfs because of the poor absorption effectiveness and the low computational efficiency the most widely used wave absorption technique in sph nwfs is sponge layers altomare et al 2017 molteni et al 2013 ni and feng 2013 which originate from grid based nwfs by enhancing the resistance force against particles movements a sponge layer is able to dissipate wave energy within a relatively short distance 1 3 times the wavelength it should be mentioned that one of the intrinsic disadvantages of sponge layers is that they generally cannot exist with flow at the same time and will fail to absorb waves when there are wave flow interactions shibata et al 2011 calculated the amplitudes and phases of the incident waves using fourier transform and implemented regular wave absorption by creating deleting open boundary particles obps and modifying particle velocities analytically this technique will certainly reduce the cpu time due to the absence of sponge layers however further study is required on whether it is capable of dealing with irregular waves and general unsteady flows after the incident waves interact with the structures in the flume the reflected waves will propagate backwards to the wave generation side a secondary reflected wave will then be triggered by the conventional wave generation equipment e g wave paddles or virtual wave generation zones gradually accumulated wave energy will lead to much larger waves and have a destructive influence on the experimental or simulation results researchers altomare et al 2017 didier and neves 2012 have solved this secondary reflection problem by mimicking the awa technique from the laboratory flumes 1 monitor the water elevation in front of the wave paddle in every step and obtain a modification signal by comparing the measured elevation with the targeted elevation and 2 add the modification signal to the original wave generation signal and a compensated wave with the same amplitude and staggered phase will be generated to counteract the reflected waves in this paper a numerical wave flume with full wave generation and absorption functionalities is proposed based on non reflective open boundary conditions under the wcsph framework this nwf is capable of generating solitary waves and regular waves both passive and active wave absorption with high efficiency are available to transmit different types of waves and prevent secondary reflection steady and unsteady flows can also be added to the wave generation and absorption process to implement a numerical wave flow flume the paper is structured as follows a summary and discussion of nwf especially the development of sph nwf is provided in section one section two briefly reviews the sph mathematical theory and numerical model as well as the algorithms for piston wave generation and sponge layer wave absorption the sph non reflective open boundary condition and its extension to wave generation and absorption are introduced in section three multiple numerical tests are adopted to validate the performance of this new nwf in section four including a wave absorption benchmark test for non reflective obc regular wave generation and passive absorption tests with various wave periods standing wave tests for regular wave active absorption regular wave runup on a beach and regular wave interaction with submerged breakwater sections five and six present the conclusions and acknowledgements respectively 2 sph model and a conventional numerical wave flume 2 1 a brief introduction of the sph method the sph method was first proposed by gingold and monaghan 1977 and lucy 1977 separately to solve astrophysics problems in three dimensional open space in this numerical method a large number of particles are used to discretize the system each particle represents a medium group and there are no direct connections among them in the conventional mesh form effectively preventing the grid distortion problem thus the sph method is an ideal tool for handling highly nonlinear coastal hydrodynamic problems with violent and complex free surface deformations gotoh and khayyer 2016 shadloo et al 2016 e g wave plunging and breaking the core concept of the sph method is the system discretization using a limited number of particles which not only represent direct material properties e g density velocity and pressure but also act as computational nodes the field function f r see eq 1 and its derivative f r see eq 2 at any position in the system can be calculated by accumulating all the neighboring particles according to a weighting function which is called a smoothing function or kernel function readers are suggested to refer to the works of liu and liu 2003 and danis et al 2013 for more detailed theoretical discussion and formulation 1 f r i j 1 n m j ρ j f r j w i j 2 f r i j 1 n m j ρ j f r j i w i j where f represents any field function in the system the subscripts i and j indicate the central particle and a neighboring particle respectively m and ρ denote the mass and density of the particle the smoothing function w ij w r i r j h describes the weighting influence of particle j on particle i and h and κh are the smoothing length and smoothing radius respectively generally speaking larger smoothing radius leads to higher accuracy but for polynomial kernels like wendland kernel or cubic kernel there re upper limits for the smoothing radius due to the tensile instability effect by contrast gaussian kernel doesn t suffer from that problem and doesn t have an upper limit for the smoothing radius thus a gaussian smoothing function eq 3 is adopted is this paper for the nwf the smoothing length h equals 1 2 times the particle initial interval and the smoothing radius equals 3 h 3 w r h α d e r 2 where r r ij h and α d equals 1 π1 2 h 1 πh 2 and 1 π3 2 h 3 in 1d 2d and 3d space respectively 2 2 sph model in this paper a large eddy simulation model for the sph method namely the sub particle scale sps model is adopted to simulate the turbulence following the work of gotoh et al 2004 and gomez gesteira et al 2012 the momentum equation of the navier stokes equations can be written in a lagrangian form 4 d u d t 1 ρ p g υ 0 2 u 1 ρ τ where u ρ and p denote the velocity density and pressure respectively g is the gravitational acceleration and the third and fourth terms on the right hand side of the equation are the laminar viscosity and turbulent viscosity respectively ν 0 is the kinetic viscosity and τ is the sps stress tensor with 5 τ α β υ t ρ 2 s α β 2 3 k δ α β 2 3 ρ c i δ 2 δ α β s α β 2 where k is the sps turbulence kinetic energy the turbulent eddy viscosity υ t c s δ 2 s the smagorinsky constant c s 0 12 c i 0 0066 δ αβ 1 α β 0 α β s 2 s α β s α β is the particle initial interval and s αβ is the element of the sps strain tensor 6 s α β 1 2 u α x β u β x α thus eq 4 is written in sph form 7 d u i d t j 1 n m j p j ρ j 2 p i ρ i 2 i w i j g j 1 n 4 υ 0 m j r i j u i j i w i j ρ i ρ j r i j 2 j 1 n m j τ j ρ j 2 τ i ρ i 2 i w i j the total derivative of the velocity with respect to time can be calculated directly thanks to the lagrangian feature of the sph method thereby avoiding the need to distinguish between the local acceleration and convective acceleration in euler based methods it not only greatly simplifies the equation solving process but also benefits the computational accuracy of convection problems the wcsph method monaghan and kos 1999 which treats water as a weakly compressible fluid is used in this paper as the main framework model the δ sph formulas antuono et al 2010 marrone et al 2011 are applied to calculate the rate of density change of fluid particles 8 d ρ i d t j 1 n m j u i j i w i j δ h c 0 j 1 n m j ρ j ψ i j i w i j 9 ψ i j 2 ρ j ρ i r i j r i j 2 ρ i l ρ j l 10 ρ i l j 1 n ρ j ρ i l i i w i j d v j 11 l i j 1 n r j r i i w i j d v j 1 where the second term on the right hand side of eq 8 is the dissipative term for the rate of density change it will reduce the unphysical oscillations of density and pressure in wcsph which is the core idea of δ sph where δ controls the dissipative intensity of the rate of density change δ 0 1 is used in this paper meanwhile the fluid pressure is related to the density explicitly according to the concept of artificial compressibility then the pressure is obtained through the equation of state as 12 p b ρ ρ 0 γ 1 where γ 7 b c 0 2 ρ 0 γ ρ 0 denotes the reference density and ρ 0 1000 kg m3 for water simulation c 0 is called the artificial speed of sound which is usually chosen to be larger than 10 times the fluid velocity to control the variation range of fluid density to within 1 a predictor corrector scheme with second order accuracy is adopted following gomez gesteira et al 2012 2 3 a conventional sph numerical wave flume wave generation and wave absorption are two important functions for numerical wave flumes the most common techniques used in sph nwfs are piston type generation and sponge layer absorption a brief description of these two techniques is given in this section of the paper fig 1 presents three arrangements for nwfs the flume in fig 1 a is usually used to simulate wave interactions with coastal structures where the wave paddle is deployed on the left side of the flume and the structure is on the right to absorb the waves reflected from the structure and simulate a semi infinite flume the piston type movement can also be modified according to the wave state in real time which is known as active wave absorption awa the flume in fig 1 b is usually found in simulations of wave interactions with submerged breakwaters floating objects or other permeable structures the paddle on the left will generate targeted waves and absorb reflected waves when awa is activated the sponge layer will absorb the transmitted waves and provide an open sea condition fig 1 c shows a conventional nwf setup for source generation liu et al 2015 ni and feng 2013 waves are generated by modifying the particle velocities in the source zone with a momentum source term and there re no particle creations or destructions during the wave generation since the waves from the source will propagate towards both sides simultaneously a sponge layer always needs to be deployed near one side of the source to absorb the undesired waves as this technique is not as common as those mentioned above no further details of source generation will be discussed in this paper 2 3 1 wave generation using a piston type paddle 2 3 1 1 solitary wave generation boussinesq 1872 proposed the analytical profile of solitary waves for inviscid and incompressible fluid and the first order solution for the wave elevation η t is 13 η t h s e c h 2 x where h is the solitary wave height x 3 h 4 d 3 x c t and d is the water depth c is the wave speed which is calculated by 14 c g h d then the control signal for solitary wave generation in the laboratory can be obtained the displacement x and the stroke s of the wave paddle are described as 15 x 4 h 3 d d tanh 3 h 4 d 3 c t x 16 s 16 h 3 d d the length and period of the solitary wave are infinite in theory and the wave paddle speed converges to zero when t however the wave paddle in the real case only works for limited time let 17 tanh 3 h 4 d 3 c t 2 s 2 0 999 then we obtain an approximate working time for the wave paddle i e the solitary wave period 18 t 2 d c 4 d 3 h 3 8 h d the wave paddle is set to move from a steady state at t 0 let the computational time step be δt and the paddle position at time t be x t then the paddle position at time t δt is 19 x t δ t 4 h 3 d d tanh 3 h 4 d 3 c x t 2 3 1 2 regular wave generation according to the linear wave generation theory robert and robert 1984 ursell et al 1960 to generate a wave η p with wave number k and frequency ω in a flume of depth d the paddle velocity u 0 should be 20 u 0 t ω w η p where w is called the hydraulic transfer function and describes the relationship between the wave paddle s harmonic motion and the water surface fluctuation 21 w 4 sinh 2 k d 2 k d sinh 2 k d for regular waves with small wave height h and frequency ω the wave elevation is usually expressed as follows 22 η p h 2 cos ω t the horizontal displacement of the wave paddle in one time step is 23 δ x u 0 δ t to absorb the reflected waves wen et al 2016 implemented the awa function in sph nwf following the awa technique originally developed for a grid based nwf wang 1995 the paddle velocity u 0 is expressed as 24 u 0 t ω w 2 η p η m where η p and η m indicate the targeted surface elevation and the measured surface elevation respectively directly in front of the paddle 2 3 2 wave absorption using a sponge layer a sph sponge layer is a numerical virtual domain where the fluid particles are set to move with larger resistance in order to accelerate the kinetic energy dissipation and reduce the fluctuation amplitude conventional approaches for sponge layers include using a larger numerical viscosity coefficient and adding a dissipative term to the momentum equation molteni et al 2013 in this paper the dissipation of wave energy is achieved by modifying the particle acceleration in the sponge layer if the fluid particle acceleration calculated by the original momentum equation is a ci then the modified acceleration a i can be obtained by eq 25 25 a i c a a c i a x u i 0 a c i a x u i 0 the weighting function c a fig 2 for the sponge layer is a 1 4 cosine type function which modifies the acceleration in a smooth way and prevents reflections at the interface the horizontal axis indicates the ratio of the particle distance x from the interface and the sponge layer length d ni and feng 2013 suggested using a sponge layer of length 2 3 1 times the wavelength to achieve effective results 3 a numerical wave flume with non reflective open boundary conditions most conventional sph nwfs using obc are based on the unilateral flow applications vacondio et al 2012 kazemi et al 2017 while few attentions were paid on waves in this section the detailed techniques of wave generation and absorption are demonstrated presenting the capacity of non reflective obc for different types of water waves first in section 3 1 the general implementing of buffer zone obc is briefly introduced then the theoretical algorithm of non reflective obc and its implementing in the framework of ns equations based models are discussed in section 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 respectively section 3 2 gives the detailed generation signals for solitary waves and regular waves section 3 3 shows the wave absorption technique using non reflective obcs 3 1 open boundary conditions for sph models with a free surface this paper follows the most widely used sph obc treatment which deploys buffer zones outside the inflow boundary and the outflow boundary see fig 3 the particle transformation between buffer zones and normal fluid zones obeys the following rules 1 when an obp from the inflow buffer zone enters the normal fluid zone it will turn into a normal fluid particle and a new obp solid circles with dashed lines in fig 3 will be added upstream with the same z coordinate to replenish the inflow buffer zone 2 when a normal fluid particle enters the outflow buffer zone it will turn into an obp 3 when an obp leaves the buffer zone and exits the system it will be deleted from the memory the obps are involved in the computation of the momentum equation and the continuity equation together with normal fluid particles preventing the integral domain of the fluid particles from being truncated at the boundaries and helping transmit information into the system it should be noted that the properties of the inflow and outflow buffer zones are determined by the flow direction at the open boundary the zones can be switched from inflow to outflow and vice versa during the simulation however to implement an accurate and robust obc for sph free surface flow there are still two key tasks to carry out imposing non reflective open boundary conditions and implementing the variable open boundary water depth in unsteady flows 3 1 1 imposing non reflective open boundary conditions in some sph free surface flow models based on the shallow water equations the characteristic open boundary condition chang and chang 2013 vacondio et al 2012 cobc was applied to treat the information exchange of unsteady flows at the open boundaries multiple complex flow cases were successfully simulated including subcritical flows supercritical flows and transcritical flows ni et al 2016 noted that the reflections occurring at the cobc in subcritical flows would ruin the numerical results and provide unsteady data in long time simulations by imitating the treatment of radiation open boundaries in ocean circulation models they proposed a novel obc for sph free surface flow models called flather s open boundary condition fobc the conventional radiation boundary is a passive obc and its basic idea is to assume that the fluctuations inside the system propagate outwards in the form of waves calculate the phase speed and amplitude of the fluctuations near the open boundary and predict the fluctuations arrival time and final form at the open boundary by extrapolation then a real time reaction can be implemented to prevent reflection when the fluctuations transmit outwards through the open boundary by contrast fobc is derived from the passive radiation equation together with the one dimensional gravitational wave equation thus external signals such as depth averaged velocity u ext and water depth d ext are considered making fobc capable of importing external signals and transmitting fluctuations at the same time fobc is also proven to be algorithmically concise and of low computational complexity for subcritical flows u ext gd ext 1 2 the depth averaged velocity u b and water depth d b at the fobc are obtained as 26 u b u e x t c d i d i d e x t d b d e x t where u ext and d ext denote the external signals of the depth averaged velocity and water depth respectively while d i and c denote the water depth of the normal fluid zone near the open boundary and the phase speed of the fluctuation respectively for those fluctuations with unknown phase speed the phase speed of shallow water waves can be a simple replacement i e c gd i 1 2 numerical tests have shown that fobc is not sensitive to the value of the phase speed ni et al 2016 the sign in eq 26 is determined by the fluctuation direction relative to the open boundary when the fluctuation propagates outwards through the open boundary in the positive direction then a positive sign is used otherwise a negative sign is used for supercritical flows u ext gd ext 1 2 the depth averaged velocity u b and water depth d b at the fobc are both given by the external signals 27 u b u e x t d b d e x t 3 1 2 implementing the variable open boundary water depth in unsteady flows in the open boundaries of sph models based on the shallow water equations ni et al 2016 vacondio et al 2012 the depth averaged velocity u and water depth d are two key variables and are the essential properties of the computational nodes particles however the value of the water depth cannot be determined based on any single particle in the ns equations based sph models instead the value is based on an accumulated set that includes all of the fluid particles from the bed to the free surface at a certain section moreover additional information such as vertical velocities should be provided if the ns equations are adopted as the governing equations here in this paper the depth averaged velocity u is obtained by 28 u 1 d z b e d z s u r f a c e u d z since direct assignment is not practicable for adjusting the water depth and velocity at the open boundary special algorithms are designed in this paper for open boundaries with relatively small variations in depth we proportionally magnify the vertical coordinates of obps from t to t 1 which is shown as fig 4 a 29 x i t 1 x i t z i t 1 d t 1 d t z i t b i t b i t the obp i maintains its horizontal coordinate and magnifies its vertical coordinate according to the current water depth d t and targeted water depth d t 1 at the open boundary d t 1 is calculated according to the flow state at and near the open boundary as well as the chosen obc algorithm b i t denotes the bed elevation at the section of particle i in time t open boundaries with larger depth variations than a threshold will have intolerable negative influence on the particle number densities of the buffer zones if the abovementioned magnification strategy is continued this is when the obp additions and deletions algorithm should be activated the equivalent number of open boundary layers n and the relative vertical compressibility of the obps p are defined as 30 n n b f l b f δ x 31 p d n δ x where n bf is the total number of obps in the buffer zone l bf is the horizontal width of the buffer zone and δx is the particle initial interval when eq 32 holds a layer of new obps will be added on top of the current obps as shown in fig 4 b when eq 33 holds the top layer of the current obps will be deleted as shown in fig 4 c the vertical coordinates should be fine tuned after the additions or deletions the main idea of this algorithm is to keep the particle number densities of the buffer zones fluctuating in a tolerable range by controlling the number of obps number and their interval multiple cases show that satisfactory results can be obtained when the threshold coefficient of vertical compressibility γ 0 1 and the obp additions and deletions algorithm is conducted every 100 steps 32 d t 1 d t d t 1 n δ x 1 γ 1 d t 1 n 1 δ x γ 33 d t 1 d t 1 d t 1 n δ x γ d t 1 n 1 δ x 1 γ in conclusion when the water depth at the open boundary fluctuates out of range i e when eq 32 or eq 33 holds apply the obp additions and deletions algorithm when the water depth fluctuates within range i e when neither eq 32 nor eq 33 holds use eq 29 to modify the obps vertical coordinates cobc and fobc were first applied in models based on the shallow water equations where the velocities were depth averaged thus it is suggested that the obp velocities be updated directly with the section depth averaged velocity calculated by eq 26 or eq 28 to keep the buffer zone stable however if the velocity distribution in the vertical direction is known in advance the particle velocities at different positions can be still calculated by the depth averaged velocity and the velocity distribution function note that the obp pressure in this paper is obtained by the steady water assumption which may introduce some error into the system however the influence seems to be negligible after sufficiently many tests in contrast this simplifying assumption contributes to the stability of the buffer zones 3 2 wave generation using obc fig 5 presents a general sph numerical wave flume with open boundaries each of which is defined as either a source or sink due to the lagrangian feature of the sph method these sources sinks have the properties of both mass and velocity and are implemented by adding deleting obps and modifying obp velocities respectively thus we are able to generate the desired water waves at the open boundaries according to the external signals as well as the desired flow conditions to the best of the authors knowledge no such combined wave flow flume has been implemented by conventional piston type wave generation and sponge layer wave absorption the next part of this paper provides the detailed wave generation signals for solitary waves and regular waves 3 2 1 solitary wave generation for solitary wave generation the free surface elevation η and velocity u w of obc particle x z are given in first order form 34 η h sech 2 x u g d h d sech 2 x w 3 g h 1 z d h d 3 2 sech 2 x t a n h x where h and d denote the wave height and water depth respectively to generate a solitary wave from the left end of a steady flume x is shifted as x 3 h 4 d 3 x c t t while the wave speed c and vicarious period t are calculated by eq 14 and eq 18 3 2 2 regular wave generation there is a simple method to generate regular waves use the analytical solution of regular waves directly as the signal for the free surface elevation η and velocity u w of particle x z here we choose the first order stokes wave solution 35 η h 2 cos k x ω t u h ω 2 cosh k z d sinh k d cos k x ω t w h ω 2 sinh k z d sinh k d sin k x ω t where d h k and ω denote the mean water depth wave height wave number and wave frequency respectively an alternative signal used in this paper is obtained by imitating the piston wave generation signal 36 η h 2 cos k x ω t u ω w η w 0 w 4 sinh 2 k d 2 k d sinh 2 k d it has been proved through multiple tests and comparisons that almost the same regular waves can be generated by eq 35 and eq 36 as mentioned before the open boundary technique used in this paper was originally applied in two dimensional free surface flow models ni et al 2016 which ignore the vertical velocities of the water particles thus giving the obps vertical velocities by using the analytical solution directly may have a negative influence on the particle regularity and stability near the buffer zone while the wave paddle moves horizontally in the laboratory wave generation no vertical velocity component is considered which satisfies the assumption of our sph open boundary technique therefore we recommend eq 36 as the signal for linear regular wave generation 37 η h 2 cos θ k h 2 8 sinh 2 k d k h 2 16 cosh k d cosh 2 k d 2 sinh 3 k d cos 2 θ u ω w h 2 cos θ ω h 3 16 d 3 cosh k d sinh 3 k d 2 w cos 2 θ w 0 w 4 sinh 2 k d 2 k d sinh 2 k d θ k x ω t eq 37 is suggested for the generation of second order waves following the work of madsen 1971 on the second order wave maker theory which was also adopted by altomare et al 2017 to generate long crested waves note that the surface elevation η in eq 37 is given by the second order stokes wave theory and the horizontal velocity of the obc particles u is the time derivative of the piston displacement in the second order wave maker theory the reflected waves from the structures have less influence on the open boundary than on conventional wave paddles because the obc is purely a visual object however the secondary reflection cannot be neglected because the accumulated energy will complicate the obp addition and deletion process introduce unphysical noise into the system and sometimes lead to program crashing in this paper the non reflective obc namely fobc which was introduced in section 3 1 1 is adopted to implement the awa function for regular wave generation where the water depth d b and particle velocities u w are expressed as 38 d b d e x t η e x t u u e x t c d b η η e x t w 0 where η denotes the wave elevation near the open boundary d ext and η ext denote the signals of water flow depth and wave elevation respectively which are given by the mean water depth d and the analytical solution for pure regular wave cases and u ext represents the external velocity signal which can be separated linearly into the water flow velocity u f l o w e x t and wave particle velocity u w a v e e x t 39 u e x t u f l o w e x t u w a v e e x t for pure regular wave cases u f l o w e x t equals zero and u w a v e e x t is obtained by eq 36 or eq 37 the fluctuation phase speed c is determined by the specific case for pure regular waves the phase speed is given by analytical theory but for unknown free surface fluctuations the shallow water wave speed gd b 1 2 is a reasonable choice because fobc is not sensitive to the phase speed it should be noted that the doppler effect should be considered when the fluctuation phase speed is affected by the wave flow interaction because awa is difficult to implement if the analytical solution of regular wave velocities is directly adopted as the external signal a uniform velocity distribution in the vertical direction is recommended for fobc this is another reason why we suggest using eq 36 or eq 37 rather than eq 35 as the signal of regular wave generation 3 3 wave absorption using obc 3 3 1 general passive wave absorption the non reflective obc in section 3 1 1 can be used to implement passive boundaries apart from generating waves for general passive open boundaries without external input each water particle s vertical velocity w is equal to zero and its horizontal velocity u is expressed as 40 u u e x t c d i d i d e x t where the external velocity signal u ext 0 the external water depth d ext equals the mean water depth for pure wave absorption cases and d i denotes the water depth near the open boundary the phase speed of free surface fluctuation is obtained according to the specific case for example the phase speed of solitary waves is given by eq 14 while the regular wave speed can be calculated analytically using the prescribed parameters the shallow water wave speed is recommended for those cases with unknown fluctuation phase speed note that the speed of water flow should be considered together with the wave speed for wave flow interaction cases the water depth at the open boundary is usually given directly by the external water depth signal in the original fobc to improve the free surface continuity between the buffer zone and normal fluid zone a modified water depth is used for passive boundaries following the radiation equation 41 d b n 1 d b n c δ t δ x b i d b n d i n where d b n and d b n 1 denote the open boundary water depths at the nth and n 1 th steps respectively d i n denotes the water depth inside the normal fluid zone near the open boundary at the nth step δt is the time step and δx bi is the distance between the gauge point b for the open boundary water depth and the gauge point i for the internal water depth 3 3 2 wave absorption for regular waves for general passive wave absorption obc the horizontal velocities of obps are uniformly distributed since it is hard to obtain a general particle velocity distribution however for regular wave cases the horizontal velocity u i and the depth averaged mean velocity u can be analytically calculated as 42 u i h ω 2 cosh k z i d sinh k d cos k x i ω t 43 u 1 η d d η u ⅆ z h ω cos k x ω t 2 k η d sinh k η d sinh k d where η and d denote the free surface fluctuation and mean water depth of the corresponding section we define the horizontal velocity distribution function f z i as the ratio of u i and u 44 f z i k η d sinh k η d cosh k z i d then the horizontal velocity of particle i in the passive open boundary can be modified by f z i as 45 u i f z i u u f l o w u f l o w note that u in eq 45 is calculated by eq 40 tests show that the obp velocities better obey the practical velocity distribution after the modification by eq 45 and the reflection rate is reduced by 50 comparing with the general passive wave absorption open boundary f z i 1 4 model validation and application in this section a series of full functional validations are conducted for sph nwf based on non reflective obc including the passive absorption boundary and the wave generation and absorption of solitary waves and regular waves then the sph nwf is applied to simulate the regular wave runup on a beach and the regular wave interaction with submerged breakwater 4 1 non reflective open boundary conditions ni et al 2016 adopted a wave absorption benchmark test suggested by the international society of offshore and polar engineers isope clément 1999 to assess the passive wave absorption performance of their shallow water equation based sph model the same benchmark test is also used in this paper to assess the performance of this obc in the navier stokes framework fig 6 presents the initial state of the benchmark test where the length of the main flume l 10 h 4 m and the water depth h 0 4 m a sponge layer with a length of 2 h is deployed on the right side of the main flume in the original setup fig 6 a using the sponge layer algorithm in section 2 3 there is a bump in the left side of the water body whose surface elevation is defined in eq 46 this initial setup will provide broadband fluctuations at the wave source and a qualified wave absorption technique should be able to deal with this case clément 1999 in fig 6 b the sponge layer is replaced by a buffer zone which is much shorter than that in conventional absorption and serves as an fobc in this case solid boundaries act as the bed and the left border of the flume 46 η h 0 4 exp x h 4 after the model is initialized part of the bump s potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy in the form of waves which propagate to the right side of the flume the waves will be finally absorbed by the sponge layer fig 6 a or transmitted outwards through the non reflective obc fig 6 b the kinetic energy potential energy total energy of the water and time are normalized to e k e p e t and t fig 7 compares the time evolutions of the energy in the flumes using different wave absorption techniques at approximately t 7 0 the first wave of the fluctuations arrives at the right border of the main flume the flume using a sponge layer absorbs 65 of the total energy during t 10 20 and the remaining energy is reflected in the form of long waves more time is needed for thorough energy dissipation as shown in fig 7 a in contrast the fobc exhibits better wave absorption performance as shown in fig 7 b the total energy is reduced significantly at t 10 and all the waves have been transmitted outside of the flume by approximately t 20 no reflection is observed at the fobc which shows satisfactory adaptivity for fluctuations with various frequencies 4 2 solitary wave generation and absorption fig 8 presents two solitary wave generation techniques where the upper and lower parts of each subgraph correspond to flumes using conventional wave paddles and the open boundaries proposed by this paper respectively the two dimensional flume is 5 0 m in length and 0 4 m in water depth the solitary wave height is 0 1 m and the computational resolution is 0 01 m 0 01 m fig 8 a fig 8 f show the particle velocity field at t 0 0 s 1 4 s 1 8 s 2 2 s 2 6 s and 3 0 s while fig 9 shows the surface elevation at three sections x 1 0 m 2 5 m and 4 0 m as well as the corresponding analytical solutions these comparisons show that the obc wave generation technique in this paper is capable of generating exactly the same solitary waves as the conventional wave paddle method with the same velocity field and surface elevation the water particles in front of the wave peak move in upwardly inclined directions while those behind the peak move in downwardly inclined directions the particles have larger velocities when they are closer to the wave peak thus the mass transport of the water body is complete after the solitary wave passes by the wave paddle can provide the water body with only a velocity source sink rather than a mass source sink an artificial mass source sink arises due to the extrusion suction of the water body as the wave paddle moves forwards backwards whereas a true mass source sink is implemented by adding deleting particles and modifying particle velocities through open boundaries it is also an interesting finding that the water in the box with dashed lines in fig 8 is equivalent to the fictitious water that is pushed forward by the wave paddle at the same time note that after the main peak of the solitary wave leaves the obc at t 3 0 s the velocities of the wave paddle and the buffer particles are zero while a small anticlockwise vortex is observed near the wave generation source it is caused by the unbalanced movement between the wave wake and the steady buffer zone in which the particles obtain vertical velocities before the solitary wave leaves however this local vortex can be neglected and has no influence on wave propagations or the water body beyond this area numerical convergence tests are also conducted for solitary wave propagation using various resolutions with d 0 δx 20 25 40 and 50 fig 10 a shows the free surface evolutions at x 2 5 m since the solitary wave generation signals are given by the accurate analytical velocities and water depths satisfactory results are obtained even with the lowest resolution d 0 δx 20 fig 10 b shows the wave height evolutions when the solitary waves propagate along the flume numerical results converge to the analytical wave height with the refinement of the particle sizes a slower decreasing speed in wave height is also found in the cases using higher resolution which indicates a lower numerical dissipation intensity fig 11 shows the whole process of the solitary wave propagating outwards through the fobc which is located at x 5 0 m no reflection is observed when the wave profile moves to the right freely and the water body returns to the calm state a uniform velocity distribution is adopted for solitary wave absorption and this approximation is proved to be reasonable by the satisfactory result 4 3 regular wave generation and absorption regular wave generation and absorption are two of the most important functions for nwfs here they are assessed by three sets of regular waves with wave periods of t 0 8 s 1 5 s and 2 2 s which correspond to the period range that is commonly used in laboratory flumes the length of the flat bottom flume is 5 times the wavelength wave generation using obc section 3 2 2 occurs at one end of the flat bottom flume and wave absorption using obc section 3 3 2 occurs at the other in all test cases the water depth and the wave height are 0 4 m and 0 04 m respectively note that the first two cases t 0 8 s and 1 5 s are driven by the linear signal as eq 36 while the third case t 2 2 s is driven by the second order signal as eq 37 four wave elevation gauges are deployed along the flume at x 0 5l l 2l and 3l comparisons are made between numerical results and corresponding analytical solutions shown in fig 12 the waves with various periods propagate steadily with satisfactory accuracy fig 13 presents time evolutions of velocity distributions of regular waves propagating with various periods both the horizontal velocities and the vertical velocities match the analytical solutions thus it can be concluded that the regular wave generation technique proposed by this paper is capable of generating regular waves in a wide period range that are suitable for engineering and scientific research moreover regular wave absorption using a non reflective obc shows good stability during the tests when simulating a half infinite flume by transmitting the incident waves without reflection fig 14 shows the pressure field near the open boundary in the cases of t 1 5 s the unphysical pressure oscillation of wcsph is remitted due to the use of δ sph formula eq 8 and the pressure distribution is also satisfactory the pressure noise introduced by the open boundary can hardly be observed indicating the validity and reliability of the obc wave generation technique proposed in this paper in addition to basic wave generation and passive absorption the function of awa is tested a standing wave case is implemented in a flume with a length of 2l and a water depth of 0 4 m the left end of the flume inputs regular waves with h 0 02 m and t 1 0 s and the right end is set as a vertical solid wall to form standing waves two wave generation techniques are used including conventional pistons and open boundaries which were introduced in sections 2 and 3 respectively fig 15 present the time space distributions of surface elevations of standing waves using different wave generation strategies the incident regular waves propagate from the left to the right and form standing waves in front of the vertical wall in theory the amplitudes of the standing waves at the wave antinodes and the wave nodes are 2h and zero respectively however the wave fluctuations in fig 15 a and fig 15 c are obviously much larger than expected since the reflected waves are trapped inside the flume due to the use of conventional piston generation and the original obc generation in the cases where awa fig 15 b or non reflective generation i e fobc in fig 15 d is applied satisfactory wave height fields are obtained as the secondary reflections have been properly handled fig 16 presents the standing wave elevations near the wall for different wave generation strategies it shows that the fobc generation performs as well as the awa technique for piston generation note that a relatively short flume is chosen in this test to amplify the secondary reflection effect and increase the difficulty for awa fig 17 presents the wave generation states for different wave generation strategies after activating the awa function the wave paddle stroke is reduced automatically when the reflected waves arrive at the generation area fig 17 a hence secondary reflection is prevented similarly the reaction to fobc wave generation is the automatic adjustment of the particle velocities and the water depth at the buffer zone fig 17 b these two algorithms are proven to be able to transmit the reflected waves out of the system successfully in the view of lagrange and euler respectively fig 18 shows the envelopes of the standing waves generated by the fobc which match the analytical solution satisfactorily with clear wave nodes and antinodes however it should be noted that the awa algorithm for conventional piston generation is relatively sensitive to the water depth variation in front of the paddle whose periodic oscillation center will probably be shifted gradually altomare et al 2017 unfortunately this kind of shift is influenced by multiple factors and its length and direction are difficult to predict the same situation usually occurs in the laboratory flumes which are much longer than the shift length thus the variation of mean water depth in the flume can be neglected the wave generation is stopped occasionally when the shift length exceeds the maximum stroke of the wave generator however the experimental results before the interruption are still acceptable the numerical flume length is usually set to several times the wavelength to reduce the number of computational nodes and improve the simulation efficiency the ratio between the maximum shift length and the flume length easily reaches 5 or even 10 this indicates that there is a 5 or 10 variation in the mean water depth which could have an extremely negative influence on the wave generation as well as the wave overtopping measurement and the force on the coastal structures by contrast the location of the obc wave generation source is constant during the simulation and the mean water depth is controlled by the external signal only hence the phenomenon of water level shifting is completely prevented even for long time simulations which can be regarded as another advantage over the conventional numerical wave generation technique 4 4 regular wave runup on a beach wave runup on a beach is a common coastal hydrodynamic phenomenon the wave shoaling leads to the increasing nonlinearity which should be accurately simulated by a qualified hydrodynamic model in this section a regular wave runup case is modeled by the proposed nwf with a 1 6 beach the water depth at the toe of the beach is 0 7 m and the obc wave generation is 1 0 m away from the toe as shown in fig 19 the regular wave height and period are 0 16 m and 2 0 s respectively two wave gauges are deployed at x 1 02 m and x 2 81 m following the experiment arrangement of li et al 2004 the awa is activated to absorb the reflective waves from the beach fig 20 shows the free surface of runup waves in one wave period the nonlinearity and skewness of the shoaling waves are reproduced as well as the setup of the mean water level satisfactory agreements are found in comparison between the numerical results and experimental data li et al 2004 at two wave gauges in fig 19 the numerical results also converge to the experimental data with the refinement of the particle sizes from d 0 δx 35 to d 0 δx 100 see fig 21 4 5 regular wave interaction with submerged breakwater the submerged breakwaters are permeable coastal structures which have important influence on the near shore hydrodynamic process and sediment transportation when a wave propagates over a submerged breakwater the wave profile height and period will change nonlinearly due to the varying water depth this is a traditional research field of coastal engineering and is usually used to assess the nwf s capability in dealing with nonlinear wave problems liu et al 2015 ren et al 2016 a regular wave interaction with the submerged breakwater test proposed by beji and battjes 1993 is simulated in this section as a practical application of this nwf fig 22 shows a sketch of the numerical flume which is 11 0 m long and has a water depth of 0 4 m the top of the submerged breakwater is 2 0 m in width and 0 3 m in height the fore slope and the back slope are 1 20 and 1 10 respectively regular waves with h 0 02 m and t 2 02 s are generated at the left end of the flume using fobc while the right end of the flume passive absorption occurs six water level gauges denoted g1 g6 are deployed at x 4 5 m 6 5 m 7 5 m 8 5 m 9 7 m and 11 3 m according to the arrangement of the laboratory experiment the time evolutions of surface elevations at six gauges are given in fig 23 and comparisons are also made between sph results and experimental data the waves at g1 fig 23 a are still in a harmonic pattern which starts to transform nonlinearly as the waves propagate onto the breakwater at g2 fig 23 b when the waves move over the breakwater fig 23 c fig 23 e high order waves gradually develop as the energy shifts among different frequencies energy redistributions among the waves are complete after the waves propagate back into the deep water over the whole submerged breakwater the sph results of this paper match the experimental data satisfactorily indicating that the proposed wave generation and absorption technique is qualified to set up a robust nwf to simulate nonlinear hydrodynamic problems on complex terrains it should also be noted that the validation result at g6 is not as good as those from g1 to g5 this is probably due to the numerical dissipation of sph methods as well as the weak compressibility assumption of wcsph in this submerged breakwater case water body on the left side of the structure will be carried to the right side because of the mass transportation effect of the nonlinear waves if the conventional piston wave generation and the sponge layer wave absorption are used here the water on the right cannot return to the left freely due to blockage by the breakwater and at the same time there is no water supplement for the left part of the flume the mean water levels on different sides of the breakwater will gradually become unbalanced with the mean water level on the right becoming higher than that on the left leading to non negligible error in the simulation results the shorter the nwf is the larger the water level difference will be by contrast this phenomenon will be completely prevented if the obc wave generation and absorption techniques are applied to maintain steady mean water levels in the flumes using obc wave generation and absorption techniques the width of the buffer zone is generally set to 4 times the initial particle interval which can be almost neglected comparing with the sponge layers in conventional nwfs thus the computational efficiency is improved although the length of the nwf varies due to the case features and the reduction in cpu time or increase in efficiency is different from case to case a primary computational efficiency test is conducted using two flat bottom flumes one generates and absorbs regular waves with open boundaries while the other is set as a conventional nwf which uses a piston wave maker and a sponge layer various lengths of flumes are tested ranging from l to 7l and all the cpu times are normalized by the cpu time costed in the case using obc wave generation and absorption with flume length l the comparison shown in fig 24 indicates that the relatively shorter nwfs using obc method are more efficient than those using conventional methods because of the absence of the sponge layer which is l in length with the increase of the flume length conventional nwfs use less cpu time than those using obc method since the obc algorithm is generally more time consuming the critical nwf length in the test is about 4 5l which is expected to increase for more optimized obc algorithm in the future work the cpu time cost of awa is also evaluated for both conventional flumes and obc flumes it is found that the averaged error between awa on and awa off cases is about 1 0 so that the computational cost in awa can be neglected thus only the results with awa off are shown in fig 24 5 conclusion a sph numerical wave flume with full functions of wave generation and absorption based on the non reflective open boundary conditions is proposed in this paper a series of test cases prove that this nwf is capable of generating multiple types of waves including solitary waves linear and nonlinear regular waves both passive and active wave absorption with satisfactory performance are available for the option of transmitting incident waves and preventing secondary reflections steady or unsteady flows can also be defined during wave generation and absorption to set up numerical wave flow flumes finally the sph nwf is applied to simulate the regular wave runup on a beach and the interaction of a regular wave with submerged breakwater thus further validating its reliability and practicability by contrast with the piston wave generation and sponge layer wave absorption strategies in conventional sph nwfs the obc wave generation and absorption techniques in this paper not only have all the equivalent functions but also exhibit three advantages 1 they avoid using the sponge layers to shorten the flumes which improves the efficiency 2 they keep the mean water level steady and prevent water level shifting 3 they implement steady unsteady flow and wave flow interactions to model a wider range of hydrodynamic problems these three advantages still hold when comparing with nwfs that use source generation liu et al 2015 ni and feng 2013 note again that the multiple wave generation signals for various wave types suggested by this paper are developed from the laboratory wave generation theory rather than adopting the analytical solution of the particle velocities and free surface elevation there are three main reasons for this 1 the piston moves horizontally in the laboratory wave generation theory which is in accordance with the assumption of sph obc used in this paper it helps reduce the unphysical noise near the buffer zone and improve the stability and accuracy in wave generation 2 a uniform velocity distribution in the buffer zone is generally required for fobc the active wave absorption is difficult to implement if the analytical velocity solution is applied to buffer zone particles directly the obc wave generation and absorption systems are implemented under the vertical two dimensional wcsph framework in theory they can also be implemented easily in isph or other particle based numerical models however as the buffer zone particle velocities in this paper are perpendicular to the open boundaries there remains more work to be done in the future on how to apply this technique to oblique wave generation and absorption in three dimensional sph nwfs it should be noted that computational difficulty or numerical noise sometimes occur when there is breaking surface at the open boundary due to the use of buffer zone and the basic assumption of fobc the implement of second order bound long wave generation and the awa of irregular waves should also be considered in the future work to better simulate real sea conditions acknowledgements this work was supported by the scientific research program of zhejiang institute of hydrsaulics estuary no a17001 and national natural science

23256,in this paper a numerical wave flume with full functions of wave generation and absorption is proposed under the framework of weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics wcsph in contrast to the conventional sph numerical wave flumes using wave paddles and sponge layers the wave generation and absorption in this paper are implemented using non reflective open boundary conditions which are capable of generating multiple types of waves including solitary waves linear and second order regular waves passive and active wave absorption are available for transmitting incident waves and preventing secondary reflections steady or unsteady flows can also be defined during wave generation and absorption to set up numerical wave flow flumes the results on a series of validation cases indicate that this sph numerical wave flume not only performs satisfactorily in conventional wave generation and absorption and nonlinear wave structure interaction simulations but also has the following three advantages 1 it avoids using the sponge layers to shorten the flumes which improves the efficiency 2 it keeps the mean water level steady and prevents water level shifting and 3 it implements steady unsteady flow and wave flow interactions to model a wider range of hydrodynamic problems keywords smoothed particle hydrodynamics numerical wave flume open boundary condition wave generation wave absorption non reflection 1 introduction the numerical wave flume nwf is the expansion and application of the laboratory wave flume in the field of computational fluid dynamics this powerful research tool has been used widely in hydrodynamics and coastal engineering in recent decades as a promising mesh free numerical method smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph monaghan 2005 violeau 2012 zhang et al 2017 is attracting increasing attention and has been adopted to implement numerical wave flumes and simulate highly nonlinear free surface flows violeau and rogers 2016 including unsteady flow interactions with complex structures and wave plunging and breaking wave generation and wave absorption are two main functions for a nwf the earliest and most direct way to generate waves monaghan 1994 is to mimic the wave generation mechanism of a laboratory wave flume by forcing the water body to act in a targeted pattern through the mechanical movement of the wave generation equipment due to the sph method s natural advantages in dealing with fluid solid interactions and moving boundaries this type of wave generation techniques is the most widely used in sph nwfs these techniques can be divided into piston type altomare et al 2017 monaghan 1994 and flap type techniques altomare et al 2014 gomez gesteira et al 2012 shibata et al 2011 according to the movement pattern of the wave generation equipment all types of waves in laboratory wave flumes including solitary waves monaghan and kos 1999 pringgana et al 2015 regular waves gao et al 2012 irregular waves altomare et al 2017 and even extreme waves dao et al 2011 can also be generated in nwfs by adjusting the frequency and the amplitude of the equipment s movement a good example was shown by a recent work of altomare et al 2017 which presented a fully comprehensive implementation of conventional wave generation and active wave absorption for second order long crested monochromatic and random waves in a wcsph based weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics model specific treatments were developed for the generation of nonperiodic waves for example li et al 2012 and lo and shao 2002 generated solitary waves by initializing the water particles with analytical velocities and free surface elevations fu and jin 2015 and capone et al 2010 simulated landslide waves as a sliding object interacting with steady water those wave generation techniques are only suitable for specific circumstances and cannot be generalized to periodic waves source generation is a rather common wave generation technique for grid based nwfs brorsen and larsen 1987 wei et al 1999 but has not attracted much attention in particle based nwfs ni and feng 2013 first introduced the source generation technique into sph nwf and successfully generated regular waves by modifying the velocities of the water particles inside the source zone later liu et al 2015 provided a more complete theoretical derivation implemented a momentum source in the framework of isph incomprehensible smoothed particle hydrodynamics and validated their nwf with a wave breakwater interaction case an additional sponge layer is usually needed behind the wave source to absorb the undesired waves leading to an increase in the number of computational nodes in the system and a reduction of efficiency meanwhile a qualified solitary wave cannot be generated in a particle based nwf by modifying the momentum source without introducing mass momentum i e adding or deleting particles similarly this type of nwf cannot implement generalized free surface flow except for the three abovementioned wave generation techniques some research has also been carried out on the application of open boundary conditions obcs in sph nwfs however it is relatively difficult to implement an euler viewed obc in a lagrangian characterized sph model first a dynamic upload unload algorithm for fluid particles should be carefully chosen to ensure the efficiency and robustness of the program second the integral completion of the particles near open boundaries should be fully considered to guarantee the computational accuracy finally it is also important to handle the exchange of both information e g fluctuations of free surface elevations and mass e g fluid particles between the inside and outside of the system to prevent the side effects brought by the reflection and unphysical noise at open boundaries the most frequently used obc for the sph method was proposed by lastiwka et al 2009 the integral completion of particles is guaranteed by deploying a buffer zone beside the open boundary and the information and mass can be exchanged through the movement of buffer particles this technique has already been applied in simulating multiple types of hydrodynamic phenomena based on the navier stokes equations including pipe flows khorasanizade and sousa 2016 lastiwka et al 2009 jets aristodemo et al 2015 open channel flows meister et al 2014 and hydraulic jumps federico et al 2012 as well as free surface flow problems based on the shallow water equations swes such as the okushiri tsunami in japan and flood inundations from a hypothetical dyke breach at thamesmead in the united kingdom vacondio et al 2012 it is worth mentioning that ni et al 2016 implemented non reflective obcs in an swe based sph free surface flow model for the first time based on the obc treatment from conventional ocean circulation models this non reflective obc treatment ensures the unhindered transmission of internal fluctuations out of the system without reflections at open boundaries when inputting external signal simultaneously it provides a theoretical basis for the wave generation and absorption technique in this paper leroy et al 2016 and ferrand et al 2017 investigated and introduced another kind of obcs named unified semi analytical open boundary conditions usaobcs in their isph and wcsph based numerical models respectively it is an extension of the unified semi analytical wall boundary conditions ferrand et al 2013 leroy et al 2014 the most intriguing feature of this new method was that the obcs analytically reconstructed the integral domain of particles near the open boundaries using open boundary nodes and particles nearby instead of using buffer particles solitary waves and regular waves were generated by a true mass source i e creating and destroying fluid particles through the obcs a passive obc was also implemented based on the riemann invariants near the open boundary and no reflection was observed when solitary waves propagated outwards leroy et al 2016 used the usaobc to simulate a creager weir flow and a 3 d circular pipe flow their work associated with ferrand et al 2017 s trial on wcsph both proved the high accuracy and stability of the usaobc however it remains to be studied whether this obc can be used to construct an active obc i e transmitting fluctuation outwards while receiving external signals simultaneously which is the key technique for active wave absorption awa in nwfs wave absorption is also an essential function for nwfs to eliminate undesired free surface fluctuations or implement a semi infinite nwf the simplest and most direct approach is to mimic the wave absorption strategy in the laboratory wave flume by deploying a mild slope at one end of the flume where waves will be dissipated after running up and breaking however this strategy is rarely utilized in sph nwfs because of the poor absorption effectiveness and the low computational efficiency the most widely used wave absorption technique in sph nwfs is sponge layers altomare et al 2017 molteni et al 2013 ni and feng 2013 which originate from grid based nwfs by enhancing the resistance force against particles movements a sponge layer is able to dissipate wave energy within a relatively short distance 1 3 times the wavelength it should be mentioned that one of the intrinsic disadvantages of sponge layers is that they generally cannot exist with flow at the same time and will fail to absorb waves when there are wave flow interactions shibata et al 2011 calculated the amplitudes and phases of the incident waves using fourier transform and implemented regular wave absorption by creating deleting open boundary particles obps and modifying particle velocities analytically this technique will certainly reduce the cpu time due to the absence of sponge layers however further study is required on whether it is capable of dealing with irregular waves and general unsteady flows after the incident waves interact with the structures in the flume the reflected waves will propagate backwards to the wave generation side a secondary reflected wave will then be triggered by the conventional wave generation equipment e g wave paddles or virtual wave generation zones gradually accumulated wave energy will lead to much larger waves and have a destructive influence on the experimental or simulation results researchers altomare et al 2017 didier and neves 2012 have solved this secondary reflection problem by mimicking the awa technique from the laboratory flumes 1 monitor the water elevation in front of the wave paddle in every step and obtain a modification signal by comparing the measured elevation with the targeted elevation and 2 add the modification signal to the original wave generation signal and a compensated wave with the same amplitude and staggered phase will be generated to counteract the reflected waves in this paper a numerical wave flume with full wave generation and absorption functionalities is proposed based on non reflective open boundary conditions under the wcsph framework this nwf is capable of generating solitary waves and regular waves both passive and active wave absorption with high efficiency are available to transmit different types of waves and prevent secondary reflection steady and unsteady flows can also be added to the wave generation and absorption process to implement a numerical wave flow flume the paper is structured as follows a summary and discussion of nwf especially the development of sph nwf is provided in section one section two briefly reviews the sph mathematical theory and numerical model as well as the algorithms for piston wave generation and sponge layer wave absorption the sph non reflective open boundary condition and its extension to wave generation and absorption are introduced in section three multiple numerical tests are adopted to validate the performance of this new nwf in section four including a wave absorption benchmark test for non reflective obc regular wave generation and passive absorption tests with various wave periods standing wave tests for regular wave active absorption regular wave runup on a beach and regular wave interaction with submerged breakwater sections five and six present the conclusions and acknowledgements respectively 2 sph model and a conventional numerical wave flume 2 1 a brief introduction of the sph method the sph method was first proposed by gingold and monaghan 1977 and lucy 1977 separately to solve astrophysics problems in three dimensional open space in this numerical method a large number of particles are used to discretize the system each particle represents a medium group and there are no direct connections among them in the conventional mesh form effectively preventing the grid distortion problem thus the sph method is an ideal tool for handling highly nonlinear coastal hydrodynamic problems with violent and complex free surface deformations gotoh and khayyer 2016 shadloo et al 2016 e g wave plunging and breaking the core concept of the sph method is the system discretization using a limited number of particles which not only represent direct material properties e g density velocity and pressure but also act as computational nodes the field function f r see eq 1 and its derivative f r see eq 2 at any position in the system can be calculated by accumulating all the neighboring particles according to a weighting function which is called a smoothing function or kernel function readers are suggested to refer to the works of liu and liu 2003 and danis et al 2013 for more detailed theoretical discussion and formulation 1 f r i j 1 n m j ρ j f r j w i j 2 f r i j 1 n m j ρ j f r j i w i j where f represents any field function in the system the subscripts i and j indicate the central particle and a neighboring particle respectively m and ρ denote the mass and density of the particle the smoothing function w ij w r i r j h describes the weighting influence of particle j on particle i and h and κh are the smoothing length and smoothing radius respectively generally speaking larger smoothing radius leads to higher accuracy but for polynomial kernels like wendland kernel or cubic kernel there re upper limits for the smoothing radius due to the tensile instability effect by contrast gaussian kernel doesn t suffer from that problem and doesn t have an upper limit for the smoothing radius thus a gaussian smoothing function eq 3 is adopted is this paper for the nwf the smoothing length h equals 1 2 times the particle initial interval and the smoothing radius equals 3 h 3 w r h α d e r 2 where r r ij h and α d equals 1 π1 2 h 1 πh 2 and 1 π3 2 h 3 in 1d 2d and 3d space respectively 2 2 sph model in this paper a large eddy simulation model for the sph method namely the sub particle scale sps model is adopted to simulate the turbulence following the work of gotoh et al 2004 and gomez gesteira et al 2012 the momentum equation of the navier stokes equations can be written in a lagrangian form 4 d u d t 1 ρ p g υ 0 2 u 1 ρ τ where u ρ and p denote the velocity density and pressure respectively g is the gravitational acceleration and the third and fourth terms on the right hand side of the equation

the element of the sps strain tensor 6 s α β 1 2 u α x β u β x α thus eq 4 is written in sph form 7 d u i d t j 1 n m j p j ρ j 2 p i ρ i 2 i w i j g j 1 n 4 υ 0 m j r i j u i j i w i j ρ i ρ j r i j 2 j 1 n m j τ j ρ j 2 τ i ρ i 2 i w i j the total derivative of the velocity with respect to time can be calculated directly thanks to the lagrangian feature of the sph method thereby avoiding the need to distinguish between the local acceleration and convective acceleration in euler based methods it not only greatly simplifies the equation solving process but also benefits the computational accuracy of convection problems the wcsph method monaghan and kos 1999 which treats water as a weakly compressible fluid is used in this paper as the main framework model the δ sph formulas antuono et al 2010 marrone et al 2011 are applied to calculate the rate of density change of fluid particles 8 d ρ i d t j 1 n m j u i j i w i j δ h c 0 j 1 n m j ρ j ψ i j i w i j 9 ψ i j 2 ρ j ρ i r i j r i j 2 ρ i l ρ j l 10 ρ i l j 1 n ρ j ρ i l i i w i j d v j 11 l i j 1 n r j r i i w i j d v j 1 where the second term on the right hand side of eq 8 is the dissipative term for the rate of density change it will reduce the unphysical oscillations of density and pressure in wcsph which is the core idea of δ sph where δ controls the dissipative intensity of the rate of density change δ 0 1 is used in this paper meanwhile the fluid pressure is related to the density explicitly according to the concept of artificial compressibility then the pressure is obtained through the equation of state as 12 p b ρ ρ 0 γ 1 where γ 7 b c 0 2 ρ 0 γ ρ 0 denotes the reference density and ρ 0 1000 kg m3 for water simulation c 0 is called the artificial speed of sound which is usually chosen to be larger than 10 times the fluid velocity to control the variation range of fluid density to within 1 a predictor corrector scheme with second order accuracy is adopted following gomez gesteira et al 2012 2 3 a conventional sph numerical wave flume wave generation and wave absorption are two important functions for numerical wave flumes the most common techniques used in sph nwfs are piston type generation and sponge layer absorption a brief description of these two techniques is given in this section of the paper fig 1 presents three arrangements for nwfs the flume in fig 1 a is usually used to simulate wave interactions with coastal structures where the wave paddle is deployed on the left side of the flume and the structure is on the right to absorb the waves reflected from the structure and simulate a semi infinite flume the piston type movement can also be modified according to the wave state in real time which is known as active wave absorption awa the flume in fig 1 b is usually found in simulations of wave interactions with submerged breakwaters floating objects or other permeable structures the paddle on the left will generate targeted waves and absorb reflected waves when awa is activated the sponge layer will absorb the transmitted waves and provide an open sea condition fig 1 c shows a conventional nwf setup for source generation liu et al 2015 ni and feng 2013 waves are generated by modifying the particle velocities in the source zone with a momentum source term and there re no particle creations or destructions during the wave generation since the waves from the source will propagate towards both sides simultaneously a sponge layer always needs to be deployed near one side of the source to absorb the undesired waves as this technique is not as common as those mentioned above no further details of source generation will be discussed in this paper 2 3 1 wave generation using a piston type paddle 2 3 1 1 solitary wave generation boussinesq 1872 proposed the analytical profile of solitary waves for inviscid and incompressible fluid and the first order solution for the wave elevation η t is 13 η t h s e c h 2 x where h is the solitary wave height x 3 h 4 d 3 x c t and d is the water depth c is the wave speed which is calculated by 14 c g h d then the control signal for solitary wave generation in the laboratory can be obtained the displacement x and the stroke s of the wave paddle are described as 15 x 4 h 3 d d tanh 3 h 4 d 3 c t x 16 s 16 h 3 d d the length and period of the solitary wave are infinite in theory and the wave paddle speed converges to zero when t however the wave paddle in the real case only works for limited time let 17 tanh 3 h 4 d 3 c t 2 s 2 0 999 then we obtain an approximate working time for the wave paddle i e the solitary wave period 18 t 2 d c 4 d 3 h 3 8 h d the wave paddle is set to move from a steady state at t 0 let the computational time step be δt and the paddle position at time t be x t then the paddle position at time t δt is 19 x t δ t 4 h 3 d d tanh 3 h 4 d 3 c x t 2 3 1 2 regular wave generation according to the linear wave generation theory robert and robert 1984 ursell et al 1960 to generate a wave η p with wave number k and frequency ω in a flume of depth d the paddle velocity u 0 should be 20 u 0 t ω w η p where w is called the hydraulic transfer function and describes the relationship between the wave paddle s harmonic motion and the water surface fluctuation 21 w 4 sinh 2 k d 2 k d sinh 2 k d for regular waves with small wave height h and frequency ω the wave elevation is usually expressed as follows 22 η p h 2 cos ω t the horizontal displacement of the wave paddle in one time step is 23 δ x u 0 δ t to absorb the reflected waves wen et al 2016 implemented the awa function in sph nwf following the awa technique originally developed for a grid based nwf wang 1995 the paddle velocity u 0 is expressed as 24 u 0 t ω w 2 η p η m where η p and η m indicate the targeted surface elevation and the measured surface elevation respectively directly in front of the paddle 2 3 2 wave absorption using a sponge layer a sph sponge layer is a numerical virtual domain where the fluid particles are set to move with larger resistance in order to accelerate the kinetic energy dissipation and reduce the fluctuation amplitude conventional approaches for sponge layers include using a larger numerical viscosity coefficient and adding a dissipative term to the momentum equation molteni et al 2013 in this paper the dissipation of wave energy is achieved by modifying the particle acceleration in the sponge layer if the fluid particle acceleration calculated by the original momentum equation is a ci then the modified acceleration a i can be obtained by eq 25 25 a i c a a c i a x u i 0 a c i a x u i 0 the weighting function c a fig 2 for the sponge layer is a 1 4 cosine type function which modifies the acceleration in a smooth way and prevents reflections at the interface the horizontal axis indicates the ratio of the particle distance x from the interface and the sponge layer length d ni and feng 2013 suggested using a sponge layer of length 2 3 1 times the wavelength to achieve effective results 3 a numerical wave flume with non reflective open boundary conditions most conventional sph nwfs using obc are based on the unilateral flow applications vacondio et al 2012 kazemi et al 2017 while few attentions were paid on waves in this section the detailed techniques of wave generation and absorption are demonstrated presenting the capacity of non reflective obc for different types of water waves first in section 3 1 the general implementing of buffer zone obc is briefly introduced then the theoretical algorithm of non reflective obc and its implementing in the framework of ns equations based models are discussed in section 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 respectively section 3 2 gives the detailed generation signals for solitary waves and regular waves section 3 3 shows the wave absorption technique using non reflective obcs 3 1 open boundary conditions for sph models with a free surface this paper follows the most widely used sph obc treatment which deploys buffer zones outside the inflow boundary and the outflow boundary see fig 3 the particle transformation between buffer zones and normal fluid zones obeys the following rules 1 when an obp from the inflow buffer zone enters the normal fluid zone it will turn into a normal fluid particle and a new obp solid circles with dashed lines in fig 3 will be added upstream with the same z coordinate to replenish the inflow buffer zone 2 when a normal fluid particle enters the outflow buffer zone it will turn into an obp 3 when an obp leaves the buffer zone and exits the system it will be deleted from the memory the obps are involved in the computation of the momentum equation and the continuity equation together with normal fluid particles preventing the integral domain of the fluid particles from being truncated at the boundaries and helping transmit information into the system it should be noted that the properties of the inflow and outflow buffer zones are determined by the flow direction at the open boundary the zones can be switched from inflow to outflow and vice versa during the simulation however to implement an accurate and robust obc for sph free surface flow there are still two key tasks to carry out imposing non reflective open boundary conditions and implementing the variable open boundary water depth in unsteady flows 3 1 1 imposing non reflective open boundary conditions in some sph free surface flow models based on the shallow water equations the characteristic open boundary condition chang and chang 2013 vacondio et al 2012 cobc was applied to treat the information exchange of unsteady flows at the open boundaries multiple complex flow cases were successfully simulated including subcritical flows supercritical flows and transcritical flows ni et al 2016 noted that the reflections occurring at the cobc in subcritical flows would ruin the numerical results and provide unsteady data in long time simulations by imitating the treatment of radiation open boundaries in ocean circulation models they proposed a novel obc for sph free surface flow models called flather s open boundary condition fobc the conventional radiation boundary is a passive obc and its basic idea is to assume that the fluctuations inside the system propagate outwards in the form of waves calculate the phase speed and amplitude of the fluctuations near the open boundary and predict the fluctuations arrival time and final form at the open boundary by extrapolation then a real time reaction can be implemented to prevent reflection when the fluctuations transmit outwards through the open boundary by contrast fobc is derived from the passive radiation equation together with the one dimensional gravitational wave equation thus external signals such as depth averaged velocity u ext and water depth d ext are considered making fobc capable of importing external signals and transmitting fluctuations at the same time fobc is also proven to be algorithmically concise and of low computational complexity for subcritical flows u ext gd ext 1 2 the depth averaged velocity u b and water depth d b at the fobc are obtained as 26 u b u e x t c d i d i d e x t d b d e x t where u ext and d ext denote the external signals of the depth averaged velocity and water depth respectively while d i and c denote the water depth of the normal fluid zone near the open boundary and the phase speed of the fluctuation respectively for those fluctuations with unknown phase speed the phase speed of shallow water waves can be a simple replacement i e c gd i 1 2 numerical tests have shown that fobc is not sensitive to the value of the phase speed ni et al 2016 the sign in eq 26 is determined by the fluctuation direction relative to the open boundary when the fluctuation propagates outwards through the open boundary in the positive direction then a positive sign is used otherwise a negative sign is used for supercritical flows u ext gd ext 1 2 the depth averaged velocity u b and water depth d b at the fobc are both given by the external signals 27 u b u e x t d b d e x t 3 1 2 implementing the variable open boundary water depth in unsteady flows in the open boundaries of sph models based on the shallow water equations ni et al 2016 vacondio et al 2012 the depth averaged velocity u and water depth d are two key variables and are the essential properties of the computational nodes particles however the value of the water depth cannot be determined based on any single particle in the ns equations based sph models instead the value is based on an accumulated set that includes all of the fluid particles from the bed to the free surface at a certain section moreover additional information such as vertical velocities should be provided if the ns equations are adopted as the governing equations here in this paper the depth averaged velocity u is obtained by 28 u 1 d z b e d z s u r f a c e u d z since direct assignment is not practicable for adjusting the water depth and velocity at the open boundary special algorithms are designed in this paper for open boundaries with relatively small variations in depth we proportionally magnify the vertical coordinates of obps from t to t 1 which is shown as fig 4 a 29 x i t 1 x i t z i t 1 d t 1 d t z i t b i t b i t the obp i maintains its horizontal coordinate and magnifies its vertical coordinate according to the current water depth d t and targeted water depth d t 1 at the open boundary d t 1 is calculated according to the flow state at and near the open boundary as well as the chosen obc algorithm b i t denotes the bed elevation at the section of particle i in time t open boundaries with larger depth variations than a threshold will have intolerable negative influence on the particle number densities of the buffer zones if the abovementioned magnification strategy is continued this is when the obp additions and deletions algorithm should be activated the equivalent number of open boundary layers n and the relative vertical compressibility of the obps p are defined as 30 n n b f l b f δ x 31 p d n δ x where n bf is the total number of obps in the buffer zone l bf is the horizontal width of the buffer zone and δx is the particle initial interval when eq 32 holds a layer of new obps will be added on top of the current obps as shown in fig 4 b when eq 33 holds the top layer of the current obps will be deleted as shown in fig 4 c the vertical coordinates should be fine tuned after the additions or deletions the main idea of this algorithm is to keep the particle number densities of the buffer zones fluctuating in a tolerable range by controlling the number of obps number and their interval multiple cases show that satisfactory results can be obtained when the threshold coefficient of vertical compressibility γ 0 1 and the obp additions and deletions algorithm is conducted every 100 steps 32 d t 1 d t d t 1 n δ x 1 γ 1 d t 1 n 1 δ x γ 33 d t 1 d t 1 d t 1 n δ x γ d t 1 n 1 δ x 1 γ in conclusion when the water depth at the open boundary fluctuates out of range i e when eq 32 or eq 33 holds apply the obp additions and deletions algorithm when the water depth fluctuates within range i e when neither eq 32 nor eq 33 holds use eq 29 to modify the obps vertical coordinates cobc and fobc were first applied in models based on the shallow water equations where the velocities were depth averaged thus it is suggested that the obp velocities be updated directly with the section depth averaged velocity calculated by eq 26 or eq 28 to keep the buffer zone stable however if the velocity distribution in the vertical direction is known in advance the particle velocities at different positions can be still calculated by the depth averaged velocity and the velocity distribution function note that the obp pressure in this paper is obtained by the steady water assumption which may introduce some error into the system however the influence seems to be negligible after sufficiently many tests in contrast this simplifying assumption contributes to the stability of the buffer zones 3 2 wave generation using obc fig 5 presents a general sph numerical wave flume with open boundaries each of which is defined as either a source or sink due to the lagrangian feature of the sph method these sources sinks have the properties of both mass and velocity and are implemented by adding deleting obps and modifying obp velocities respectively thus we are able to generate the desired water waves at the open boundaries according to the external signals as well as the desired flow conditions to the best of the authors knowledge no such combined wave flow flume has been implemented by conventional piston type wave generation and sponge layer wave absorption the next part of this paper provides the detailed wave generation signals for solitary waves and regular waves 3 2 1 solitary wave generation for solitary wave generation the free surface elevation η and velocity u w of obc particle x z are given in first order form 34 η h sech 2 x u g d h d sech 2 x w 3 g h 1 z d h d 3 2 sech 2 x t a n h x where h and d denote the wave height and water depth respectively to generate a solitary wave from the left end of a steady flume x is shifted as x 3 h 4 d 3 x c t t while the wave speed c and vicarious period t are calculated by eq 14 and eq 18 3 2 2 regular wave generation there is a simple method to generate regular waves use the analytical solution of regular waves directly as the signal for the free surface elevation η and velocity u w of particle x z here we choose the first order stokes wave solution 35 η h 2 cos k x ω t u h ω 2 cosh k z d sinh k d cos k x ω t w h ω 2 sinh k z d sinh k d sin k x ω t where d h k and ω denote the mean water depth wave height wave number and wave frequency respectively an alternative signal used in this paper is obtained by imitating the piston wave generation signal 36 η h 2 cos k x ω t u ω w η w 0 w 4 sinh 2 k d 2 k d sinh 2 k d it has been proved through multiple tests and comparisons that almost the same regular waves can be generated by eq 35 and eq 36 as mentioned before the open boundary technique used in this paper was originally applied in two dimensional free surface flow models ni et al 2016 which ignore the vertical velocities of the water particles thus giving the obps vertical velocities by using the analytical solution directly may have a negative influence on the particle regularity and stability near the buffer zone while the wave paddle moves horizontally in the laboratory wave generation no vertical velocity component is considered which satisfies the assumption of our sph open boundary technique therefore we recommend eq 36 as the signal for linear regular wave generation 37 η h 2 cos θ k h 2 8 sinh 2 k d k h 2 16 cosh k d cosh 2 k d 2 sinh 3 k d cos 2 θ u ω w h 2 cos θ ω h 3 16 d 3 cosh k d sinh 3 k d 2 w cos 2 θ w 0 w 4 sinh 2 k d 2 k d sinh 2 k d θ k x ω t eq 37 is suggested for the generation of second order waves following the work of madsen 1971 on the second order wave maker theory which was also adopted by altomare et al 2017 to generate long crested waves note that the surface elevation η in eq 37 is given by the second order stokes wave theory and the horizontal velocity of the obc particles u is the time derivative of the piston displacement in the second order wave maker theory the reflected waves from the structures have less influence on the open boundary than on conventional wave paddles because the obc is purely a visual object however the secondary reflection cannot be neglected because the accumulated energy will complicate the obp addition and deletion process introduce unphysical noise into the system and sometimes lead to program crashing in this paper the non reflective obc namely fobc which was introduced in section 3 1 1 is adopted to implement the awa function for regular wave generation where the water depth d b and particle velocities u w are expressed as 38 d b d e x t η e x t u u e x t c d b η η e x t w 0 where η denotes the wave elevation near the open boundary d ext and η ext denote the signals of water flow depth and wave elevation respectively which are given by the mean water depth d and the analytical solution for pure regular wave cases and u ext represents the external velocity signal which can be separated linearly into the water flow velocity u f l o w e x t and wave particle velocity u w a v e e x t 39 u e x t u f l o w e x t u w a v e e x t for pure regular wave cases u f l o w e x t equals zero and u w a v e e x t is obtained by eq 36 or eq 37 the fluctuation phase speed c is determined by the specific case for pure regular waves the phase speed is given by analytical theory but for unknown free surface fluctuations the shallow water wave speed gd b 1 2 is a reasonable choice because fobc is not sensitive to the phase speed it should be noted that the doppler effect should be considered when the fluctuation phase speed is affected by the wave flow interaction because awa is difficult to implement if the analytical solution of regular wave velocities is directly adopted as the external signal a uniform velocity distribution in the vertical direction is recommended for fobc this is another reason why we suggest using eq 36 or eq 37 rather than eq 35 as the signal of regular wave generation 3 3 wave absorption using obc 3 3 1 general passive wave absorption the non reflective obc in section 3 1 1 can be used to implement passive boundaries apart from generating waves for general passive open boundaries without external input each water particle s vertical velocity w is equal to zero and its horizontal velocity u is expressed as 40 u u e x t c d i d i d e x t where the external velocity signal u ext 0 the external water depth d ext equals the mean water depth for pure wave absorption cases and d i denotes the water depth near the open boundary the phase speed of free surface fluctuation is obtained according to the specific case for example the phase speed of solitary waves is given by eq 14 while the regular wave speed can be calculated analytically using the prescribed parameters the shallow water wave speed is recommended for those cases with unknown fluctuation phase speed note that the speed of water flow should be considered together with the wave speed for wave flow interaction cases the water depth at the open boundary is usually given directly by the external water depth signal in the original fobc to improve the free surface continuity between the buffer zone and normal fluid zone a modified water depth is used for passive boundaries following the radiation equation 41 d b n 1 d b n c δ t δ x b i d b n d i n where d b n and d b n 1 denote the open boundary water depths at the nth and n 1 th steps respectively d i n denotes the water depth inside the normal fluid zone near the open boundary at the nth step δt is the time step and δx bi is the distance between the gauge point b for the open boundary water depth and the gauge point i for the internal water depth 3 3 2 wave absorption for regular waves for general passive wave absorption obc the horizontal velocities of obps are uniformly distributed since it is hard to obtain a general particle velocity distribution however for regular wave cases the horizontal velocity u i and the depth averaged mean velocity u can be analytically calculated as 42 u i h ω 2 cosh k z i d sinh k d cos k x i ω t 43 u 1 η d d η u ⅆ z h ω cos k x ω t 2 k η d sinh k η d sinh k d where η and d denote the free surface fluctuation and mean water depth of the corresponding section we define the horizontal velocity distribution function f z i as the ratio of u i and u 44 f z i k η d sinh k η d cosh k z i d then the horizontal velocity of particle i in the passive open boundary can be modified by f z i as 45 u i f z i u u f l o w u f l o w note that u in eq 45 is calculated by eq 40 tests show that the obp velocities better obey the practical velocity distribution after the modification by eq 45 and the reflection rate is reduced by 50 comparing with the general passive wave absorption open boundary f z i 1 4 model validation and application in this section a series of full functional validations are conducted for sph nwf based on non reflective obc including the passive absorption boundary and the wave generation and absorption of solitary waves and regular waves then the sph nwf is applied to simulate the regular wave runup on a beach and the regular wave interaction with submerged breakwater 4 1 non reflective open boundary conditions ni et al 2016 adopted a wave absorption benchmark test suggested by the international society of offshore and polar engineers isope clément 1999 to assess the passive wave absorption performance of their shallow water equation based sph model the same benchmark test is also used in this paper to assess the performance of this obc in the navier stokes framework fig 6 presents the initial state of the benchmark test where the length of the main flume l 10 h 4 m and the water depth h 0 4 m a sponge layer with a length of 2 h is deployed on the right side of the main flume in the original setup fig 6 a using the sponge layer algorithm in section 2 3 there is a bump in the left side of the water body whose surface elevation is defined in eq 46 this initial setup will provide broadband fluctuations at the wave source and a qualified wave absorption technique should be able to deal with this case clément 1999 in fig 6 b the sponge layer is replaced by a buffer zone which is much shorter than that in conventional absorption and serves as an fobc in this case solid boundaries act as the bed and the left border of the flume 46 η h 0 4 exp x h 4 after the model is initialized part of the bump s potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy in the form of waves which propagate to the right side of the flume the waves will be finally absorbed by the sponge layer fig 6 a or transmitted outwards through the non reflective obc fig 6 b the kinetic energy potential energy total energy of the water and time are normalized to e k e p e t and t fig 7 compares the time evolutions of the energy in the flumes using different wave absorption techniques at approximately t 7 0 the first wave of the fluctuations arrives at the right border of the main flume the flume using a sponge layer absorbs 65 of the total energy during t 10 20 and the remaining energy is reflected in the form of long waves more time is needed for thorough energy dissipation as shown in fig 7 a in contrast the fobc exhibits better wave absorption performance as shown in fig 7 b the total energy is reduced significantly at t 10 and all the waves have been transmitted outside of the flume by approximately t 20 no reflection is observed at the fobc which shows satisfactory adaptivity for fluctuations with various frequencies 4 2 solitary wave generation and absorption fig 8 presents two solitary wave generation techniques where the upper and lower parts of each subgraph correspond to flumes using conventional wave paddles and the open boundaries proposed by this paper respectively the two dimensional flume is 5 0 m in length and 0 4 m in water depth the solitary wave height is 0 1 m and the computational resolution is 0 01 m 0 01 m fig 8 a fig 8 f show the particle velocity field at t 0 0 s 1 4 s 1 8 s 2 2 s 2 6 s and 3 0 s while fig 9 shows the surface elevation at three sections x 1 0 m 2 5 m and 4 0 m as well as the corresponding analytical solutions these comparisons show that the obc wave generation technique in this paper is capable of generating exactly the same solitary waves as the conventional wave paddle method with the same velocity field and surface elevation the water particles in front of the wave peak move in upwardly inclined directions while those behind the peak move in downwardly inclined directions the particles have larger velocities when they are closer to the wave peak thus the mass transport of the water body is complete after the solitary wave passes by the wave paddle can provide the water body with only a velocity source sink rather than a mass source sink an artificial mass source sink arises due to the extrusion suction of the water body as the wave paddle moves forwards backwards whereas a true mass source sink is implemented by adding deleting particles and modifying particle velocities through open boundaries it is also an interesting finding that the water in the box with dashed lines in fig 8 is equivalent to the fictitious water that is pushed forward by the wave paddle at the same time note that after the main peak of the solitary wave leaves the obc at t 3 0 s the velocities of the wave paddle and the buffer particles are zero while a small anticlockwise vortex is observed near the wave generation source it is caused by the unbalanced movement between the wave wake and the steady buffer zone in which the particles obtain vertical velocities before the solitary wave leaves however this local vortex can be neglected and has no influence on wave propagations or the water body beyond this area numerical convergence tests are also conducted for solitary wave propagation using various resolutions with d 0 δx 20 25 40 and 50 fig 10 a shows the free surface evolutions at x 2 5 m since the solitary wave generation signals are given by the accurate analytical velocities and water depths satisfactory results are obtained even with the lowest resolution d 0 δx 20 fig 10 b shows the wave height evolutions when the solitary waves propagate along the flume numerical results converge to the analytical wave height with the refinement of the particle sizes a slower decreasing speed in wave height is also found in the cases using higher resolution which indicates a lower numerical dissipation intensity fig 11 shows the whole process of the solitary wave propagating outwards through the fobc which is located at x 5 0 m no reflection is observed when the wave profile moves to the right freely and the water body returns to the calm state a uniform velocity distribution is adopted for solitary wave absorption and this approximation is proved to be reasonable by the satisfactory result 4 3 regular wave generation and absorption regular wave generation and absorption are two of the most important functions for nwfs here they are assessed by three sets of regular waves with wave periods of t 0 8 s 1 5 s and 2 2 s which correspond to the period range that is commonly used in laboratory flumes the length of the flat bottom flume is 5 times the wavelength wave generation using obc section 3 2 2 occurs at one end of the flat bottom flume and wave absorption using obc section 3 3 2 occurs at the other in all test cases the water depth and the wave height are 0 4 m and 0 04 m respectively note that the first two cases t 0 8 s and 1 5 s are driven by the linear signal as eq 36 while the third case t 2 2 s is driven by the second order signal as eq 37 four wave elevation gauges are deployed along the flume at x 0 5l l 2l and 3l comparisons are made between numerical results and corresponding analytical solutions shown in fig 12 the waves with various periods propagate steadily with satisfactory accuracy fig 13 presents time evolutions of velocity distributions of regular waves propagating with various periods both the horizontal velocities and the vertical velocities match the analytical solutions thus it can be concluded that the regular wave generation technique proposed by this paper is capable of generating regular waves in a wide period range that are suitable for engineering and scientific research moreover regular wave absorption using a non reflective obc shows good stability during the tests when simulating a half infinite flume by transmitting the incident waves without reflection fig 14 shows the pressure field near the open boundary in the cases of t 1 5 s the unphysical pressure oscillation of wcsph is remitted due to the use of δ sph formula eq 8 and the pressure distribution is also satisfactory the pressure noise introduced by the open boundary can hardly be observed indicating the validity and reliability of the obc wave generation technique proposed in this paper in addition to basic wave generation and passive absorption the function of awa is tested a standing wave case is implemented in a flume with a length of 2l and a water depth of 0 4 m the left end of the flume inputs regular waves with h 0 02 m and t 1 0 s and the right end is set as a vertical solid wall to form standing waves two wave generation techniques are used including conventional pistons and open boundaries which were introduced in sections 2 and 3 respectively fig 15 present the time space distributions of surface elevations of standing waves using different wave generation strategies the incident regular waves propagate from the left to the right and form standing waves in front of the vertical wall in theory the amplitudes of the standing waves at the wave antinodes and the wave nodes are 2h and zero respectively however the wave fluctuations in fig 15 a and fig 15 c are obviously much larger than expected since the reflected waves are trapped inside the flume due to the use of conventional piston generation and the original obc generation in the cases where awa fig 15 b or non reflective generation i e fobc in fig 15 d is applied satisfactory wave height fields are obtained as the secondary reflections have been properly handled fig 16 presents the standing wave elevations near the wall for different wave generation strategies it shows that the fobc generation performs as well as the awa technique for piston generation note that a relatively short flume is chosen in this test to amplify the secondary reflection effect and increase the difficulty for awa fig 17 presents the wave generation states for different wave generation strategies after activating the awa function the wave paddle stroke is reduced automatically when the reflected waves arrive at the generation area fig 17 a hence secondary reflection is prevented similarly the reaction to fobc wave generation is the automatic adjustment of the particle velocities and the water depth at the buffer zone fig 17 b these two algorithms are proven to be able to transmit the reflected waves out of the system successfully in the view of lagrange and euler respectively fig 18 shows the envelopes of the standing waves generated by the fobc which match the analytical solution satisfactorily with clear wave nodes and antinodes however it should be noted that the awa algorithm for conventional piston generation is relatively sensitive to the water depth variation in front of the paddle whose periodic oscillation center will probably be shifted gradually altomare et al 2017 unfortunately this kind of shift is influenced by multiple factors and its length and direction are difficult to predict the same situation usually occurs in the laboratory flumes which are much longer than the shift length thus the variation of mean water depth in the flume can be neglected the wave generation is stopped occasionally when the shift length exceeds the maximum stroke of the wave generator however the experimental results before the interruption are still acceptable the numerical flume length is usually set to several times the wavelength to reduce the number of computational nodes and improve the simulation efficiency the ratio between the maximum shift length and the flume length easily reaches 5 or even 10 this indicates that there is a 5 or 10 variation in the mean water depth which could have an extremely negative influence on the wave generation as well as the wave overtopping measurement and the force on the coastal structures by contrast the location of the obc wave generation source is constant during the simulation and the mean water depth is controlled by the external signal only hence the phenomenon of water level shifting is completely prevented even for long time simulations which can be regarded as another advantage over the conventional numerical wave generation technique 4 4 regular wave runup on a beach wave runup on a beach is a common coastal hydrodynamic phenomenon the wave shoaling leads to the increasing nonlinearity which should be accurately simulated by a qualified hydrodynamic model in this section a regular wave runup case is modeled by the proposed nwf with a 1 6 beach the water depth at the toe of the beach is 0 7 m and the obc wave generation is 1 0 m away from the toe as shown in fig 19 the regular wave height and period are 0 16 m and 2 0 s respectively two wave gauges are deployed at x 1 02 m and x 2 81 m following the experiment arrangement of li et al 2004 the awa is activated to absorb the reflective waves from the beach fig 20 shows the free surface of runup waves in one wave period the nonlinearity and skewness of the shoaling waves are reproduced as well as the setup of the mean water level satisfactory agreements are found in comparison between the numerical results and experimental data li et al 2004 at two wave gauges in fig 19 the numerical results also converge to the experimental data with the refinement of the particle sizes from d 0 δx 35 to d 0 δx 100 see fig 21 4 5 regular wave interaction with submerged breakwater the submerged breakwaters are permeable coastal structures which have important influence on the near shore hydrodynamic process and sediment transportation when a wave propagates over a submerged breakwater the wave profile height and period will change nonlinearly due to the varying water depth this is a traditional research field of coastal engineering and is usually used to assess the nwf s capability in dealing with nonlinear wave problems liu et al 2015 ren et al 2016 a regular wave interaction with the submerged breakwater test proposed by beji and battjes 1993 is simulated in this section as a practical application of this nwf fig 22 shows a sketch of the numerical flume which is 11 0 m long and has a water depth of 0 4 m the top of the submerged breakwater is 2 0 m in width and 0 3 m in height the fore slope and the back slope are 1 20 and 1 10 respectively regular waves with h 0 02 m and t 2 02 s are generated at the left end of the flume using fobc while the right end of the flume passive absorption occurs six water level gauges denoted g1 g6 are deployed at x 4 5 m 6 5 m 7 5 m 8 5 m 9 7 m and 11 3 m according to the arrangement of the laboratory experiment the time evolutions of surface elevations at six gauges are given in fig 23 and comparisons are also made between sph results and experimental data the waves at g1 fig 23 a are still in a harmonic pattern which starts to transform nonlinearly as the waves propagate onto the breakwater at g2 fig 23 b when the waves move over the breakwater fig 23 c fig 23 e high order waves gradually develop as the energy shifts among different frequencies energy redistributions among the waves are complete after the waves propagate back into the deep water over the whole submerged breakwater the sph results of this paper match the experimental data satisfactorily indicating that the proposed wave generation and absorption technique is qualified to set up a robust nwf to simulate nonlinear hydrodynamic problems on complex terrains it should also be noted that the validation result at g6 is not as good as those from g1 to g5 this is probably due to the numerical dissipation of sph methods as well as the weak compressibility assumption of wcsph in this submerged breakwater case water body on the left side of the structure will be carried to the right side because of the mass transportation effect of the nonlinear waves if the conventional piston wave generation and the sponge layer wave absorption are used here the water on the right cannot return to the left freely due to blockage by the breakwater and at the same time there is no water supplement for the left part of the flume the mean water levels on different sides of the breakwater will gradually become unbalanced with the mean water level on the right becoming higher than that on the left leading to non negligible error in the simulation results the shorter the nwf is the larger the water level difference will be by contrast this phenomenon will be completely prevented if the obc wave generation and absorption techniques are applied to maintain steady mean water levels in the flumes using obc wave generation and absorption techniques the width of the buffer zone is generally set to 4 times the initial particle interval which can be almost neglected comparing with the sponge layers in conventional nwfs thus the computational efficiency is improved although the length of the nwf varies due to the case features and the reduction in cpu time or increase in efficiency is different from case to case a primary computational efficiency test is conducted using two flat bottom flumes one generates and absorbs regular waves with open boundaries while the other is set as a conventional nwf which uses a piston wave maker and a sponge layer various lengths of flumes are tested ranging from l to 7l and all the cpu times are normalized by the cpu time costed in the case using obc wave generation and absorption with flume length l the comparison shown in fig 24 indicates that the relatively shorter nwfs using obc method are more efficient than those using conventional methods because of the absence of the sponge layer which is l in length with the increase of the flume length conventional nwfs use less cpu time than those using obc method since the obc algorithm is generally more time consuming the critical nwf length in the test is about 4 5l which is expected to increase for more optimized obc algorithm in the future work the cpu time cost of awa is also evaluated for both conventional flumes and obc flumes it is found that the averaged error between awa on and awa off cases is about 1 0 so that the computational cost in awa can be neglected thus only the results with awa off are shown in fig 24 5 conclusion a sph numerical wave flume with full functions of wave generation and absorption based on the non reflective open boundary conditions is proposed in this paper a series of test cases prove that this nwf is capable of generating multiple types of waves including solitary waves linear and nonlinear regular waves both passive and active wave absorption with satisfactory performance are available for the option of transmitting incident waves and preventing secondary reflections steady or unsteady flows can also be defined during wave generation and absorption to set up numerical wave flow flumes finally the sph nwf is applied to simulate the regular wave runup on a beach and the interaction of a regular wave with submerged breakwater thus further validating its reliability and practicability by contrast with the piston wave generation and sponge layer wave absorption strategies in conventional sph nwfs the obc wave generation and absorption techniques in this paper not only have all the equivalent functions but also exhibit three advantages 1 they avoid using the sponge layers to shorten the flumes which improves the efficiency 2 they keep the mean water level steady and prevent water level shifting 3 they implement steady unsteady flow and wave flow interactions to model a wider range of hydrodynamic problems these three advantages still hold when comparing with nwfs that use source generation liu et al 2015 ni and feng 2013 note again that the multiple wave generation signals for various wave types suggested by this paper are developed from the laboratory wave generation theory rather than adopting the analytical solution of the particle velocities and free surface elevation there are three main reasons for this 1 the piston moves horizontally in the laboratory wave generation theory which is in accordance with the assumption of sph obc used in this paper it helps reduce the unphysical noise near the buffer zone and improve the stability and accuracy in wave generation 2 a uniform velocity distribution in the buffer zone is generally required for fobc the active wave absorption is difficult to implement if the analytical velocity solution is applied to buffer zone particles directly the obc wave generation and absorption systems are implemented under the vertical two dimensional wcsph framework in theory they can also be implemented easily in isph or other particle based numerical models however as the buffer zone particle velocities in this paper are perpendicular to the open boundaries there remains more work to be done in the future on how to apply this technique to oblique wave generation and absorption in three dimensional sph nwfs it should be noted that computational difficulty or numerical noise sometimes occur when there is breaking surface at the open boundary due to the use of buffer zone and the basic assumption of fobc the implement of second order bound long wave generation and the awa of irregular waves should also be considered in the future work to better simulate real sea conditions acknowledgements this work was supported by the scientific research program of zhejiang institute of hydrsaulics estuary no a17001 and national natural science

23257,the latest imo regulatory requirements concerning the control of toxic gas emissions from ships have sparked interest in whether ships are adequately equipped to operate safely in adverse weather conditions when compliance is achieved simply by the reduction of power this paper deals with the analysis of navigational accidents collision grounding and contact accidents that occurred in adverse weather conditions and may have been related to the lack of sufficient powering and manoeuvrability the analysis aims to potentially assist the imo regulatory work in setting rational margins of minimum powering of ships for safely operating in adverse weather conditions keywords adverse weather conditions navigational accidents ship safety imo emissions control 1 introduction the international maritime organization imo leading the efforts to reduce toxic gas emissions from maritime operations has introduced the energy efficiency design index eedi requirement for new ships in the imo resolution mepc 203 62 imo 2011 the eedi is expressed in grams of emitted co2 by the distance the cargo has been transported g co2 t nm and is intended to be a driver for limiting the emissions of toxic gases from new ships concerns have been raised that relate to the speculation that compliance with the eedi requirement might be accomplished simply by installing smaller main engines on new ships however this decision could have a negative impact on the safe operation of ships in adverse weather conditions by a subsequent reduction of the capability of ships to maintain their manoeuvrability as highlighted by the international association of classification societies iacs 2010 the negative impacts of having inadequate propulsion power in adverse weather conditions include the inability to maintain or change course especially in restricted navigational areas shigunov and papanikolaou 2014 and the inability to maintain ship speed the work carried out by iacs led to the introduction of the 2013 interim guidelines for determining minimum propulsion power by the imo resolution mepc 232 65 imo 2013a followed by amendments by the imo resolutions mepc 255 67 imo 2014 and mepc 262 68 imo 2015 the scope of the guidelines covers new ships that need to comply with the eedi requirements in unrestricted navigation and which are equipped with a conventional propulsion system the purpose of the 2013 interim guidelines is to ensure that ships dispose a minimum power that is adequate for maintaining manoeuvrability and navigational safely in adverse weather conditions the criteria for determining the minimum propulsion power in adverse conditions depend on ship size type and were derived on the basis of the eedi reference lines in addition the guidelines define what is considered adverse weather condition as a function of ship size expressed by its length between perpendiculars lpp the corresponding range of environmental parameters associated with adverse conditions is 4 0 5 5 m significant wave height hs which corresponds to sea states 5 7 rough to high on the douglas scale and 15 7 19 0 m s mean wind speed vw which corresponds to level 8 gale on the beaufort scale because ships often operate in weather conditions that are worse than those embedded in the interim guidelines and should be taken into account in their design bitner gregerse et al 2016 concerns were expressed by the maritime industry about the margins for wave height and wind speed values that determine what is considered adverse weather and what is considered adequate propulsion power to maintain manoeuvrability according to the imo 2013 interim guidelines these concerns were the basis for the project shopera energy efficient safe ship operation which was funded by the european commission under the fp7 framework papanikolaou et al 2015 the objectives of this research project were among others to specify the environmental conditions for assessing sufficient propulsion power as well as to assess the safety margins of ships that navigate in adverse weather conditions papanikolaou et al 2016 this paper presents part of the work of project shopera and builds on the research of ventikos et al 2015 by introducing specific met ocean data wave height and wind speed into the analysis for accidents that occurred from 1990 up to 2013 this work involves the analysis of navigational accidents recorded in the ihs sea webtm database ihs 2013 which happened in severe weather conditions and may be related to the failure of powering and manoeuvrability the analysis of the severity of the weather during these accidents should enable a not strictly qualitative comparison with the definition of adverse conditions in the 2013 interim guidelines of the imo the ultimate goal is to potentially assist the imo regulatory work in setting rational margins of minimum powering of ships for safely operating in severe adverse weather conditions the next section describes the methodology of the conducted analysis thereafter the results of the statistical analysis of the accident sample are elaborated namely it includes a general description of the accident sample the distributions that are indicative of ship size the analysis of the annual number of accidents and the relative frequencies of the accidents of interest per ship year the section after presents the analysis of the prevailing weather conditions at the time and location of the accident the paper concludes with a commentary of the most significant results and insights that relate to the limits for adverse weather conditions set by the imo 2013 interim guidelines 2 methodology and data verification the scope of the analysis includes navigational accidents i e collision contact and grounding accidents that have occurred in severe adverse weather conditions in navigational limited waters which might be related to manoeuvrability issues due to the lack of adequate powering and or steering compared to other accident types such as founderings this type was considered more likely to occur due to lack of sufficient power and or steering the reasoning for the selection of navigational limited waters in the analysis is that ships operate there with lower speeds compared to open water navigation while their manoeuvring efficiency of their steering devices capability is greatly affected in severe adverse weather conditions i e strong winds and large waves thus the safety problem at hand is not simply a minimum powering problem but a manoeuvrability problem in limited waters and severe weather conditions shigunov papanikolaou 2014 the main research questions of this work are which ship types and size classes are most vulnerable how often the accidents of interest have occurred in the past and whether the prevailing weather conditions during the accidents are comparable with those defined as adverse conditions in the interim guidelines the methodology of the analysis comprised the following steps 1 gather information on the accidents of interest 2 screen the information to identify the cases that are more likely to have been caused by a lack of sufficient propulsive power 3 identify the size classes for each ship type that seem most vulnerable to this hazard 4 determine the frequency and possible temporal trends of the accidents of interest and 5 determine the prevailing weather conditions a structured accident database was compiled from multiple data sources with specific inclusion criteria see table 1 the records for each accident in the database were organized into the following information groups ship details ship dimensions machinery data accident details and weather information accident information was mainly obtained from the ihs sea web marine casualty database ihs 2013 and the public area of the marine casualties and incidents database of the imo the global integrated shipping information system gisis imo 2013b these sources are among the most reliable and frequently used accident databases in the maritime industry τhe ihs sea web marine casualty database classifies the prevailing weather conditions on a qualitative scale which means that there may be no quantitative weather related information such as significant wave height and wind speed at the time of the accident therefore weather related information was provided by partners participating in the project shopera namely danaos shipping company ltd and the instituto superior tecnico ist centre for marine technology and engineering centec as well as relevant published accident reports the wave height information that was provided by partners in the project shopera are significant wave height values for the approximate time and location of the accidents of interest and were originally derived from model hindcasts as well as from statistical analysis of buoy measurements it should be noted that the obtained significant wave height values were used in this analysis as provided without any further elaboration from the available weather information for the accidents of interest the maximum recorded significant wave height equals 7 m and the maximum recorded mean wind speed equals 21 m s these conditions correspond to a sea state 7 high on the douglas scale and level 9 severe gale on the beaufort scale the swedish club 2014 after the initial data collection the database contained n 1666 navigational accidents that occurred in weather conditions which included both heavy weather conditions and extreme weather events 12 of the accidents subsequently a structured verification process with specific filtering criteria was conducted to ensure the validity of the original data and to ensure the relevance of the included cases to the scope of the analysis as most maritime accident databases do not provide adequate information on the causes of the recorded incidents psarros et al 2010 the possibility of a lack of propulsive power to actually be a root cause for the accidents of interest was indirectly determined with a set of specified criteria falsely including an irrelevant case would distort the conclusions of the analysis and provide misleading results considering that effective risk mitigation depends on determining the true root causes of an accident antão and guedes soares 2002 as shown in table 2 only 17 were considered relevant to the analysis i e 1389 accidents were excluded the highest retention rates are observed for ro ro ferries and cruise ships 29 and 27 of the initial sample per ship type respectively which indicates that these types of ships might be more frequently involved in accidents related to a potential lack of manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions stage i this stage involved an initial screening based on the accident category and resulted in the exclusion of 753 cases indicative examples of cases that are considered out of the scope of the analysis are cases where propulsive machinery was not damaged in any way or the hull of the ship was intact and the ship was not laid up for repairs as a result the following accident categories were excluded from the analysis hull and machinery damages including failures on the main engine or the generators blackouts hull cracks and failure of bow thruster propeller rudder and stabilizer accidents that are caused by fire explosion in machinery cargo spaces or in the accommodation any accident where the ship sank due to either ingress of water or cargo shift accidents that occurred while the ship was in shipyard or dry dock stage ii this stage resulted in the exclusion of 153 cases by applying the following filters the froude number fn and the severity of the accident ships with a froude number greater than 0 5 were considered high speed crafts and were excluded due to the fact that high speed crafts are usually equipped with high powered main engines in order to achieve high service speeds antão and guedes soares 2008 therefore high speed crafts are unlikely to face manoeuvrability issues due to lack of main engine power this filter was mainly applicable to cruise ships and ro ro ferries as they operate at greater service speeds compared to the other ship types under consideration a serious accident is one that results in one of the following lrfp 1995 structural damage rendering the ship unseaworthy such as penetration of hull underwater immobilization of main engines extensive damage etc breakdown actual total loss any other undefined situation resulting in damage or financial loss which is considered to be serious incl fatalities missing persons and environmental damage every accident that does not fall in the previously mentioned categories is characterized as not serious serious accidents have a relatively higher probability of being reported in maritime accident databases hassel et al 2011 and are usually reported in more detail compared to not serious accidents for example recorded information for not serious cases may only involve the date place of occurrence and the mention of minor damages therefore accidents which had been classified as not serious were excluded because their relevance to the scope of the present analysis could not be safely determined stage iii during this stage the remaining data was verified against published accident reports either by various accident investigation branches or other national maritime authorities such as the marine accident investigation branch maib uk the transport safety bureau tsb australia and the hellenic bureau for marine casualties investigation greece in addition the data was cross checked with any available information that could be retrieved from other sources such as the lloyd s casualty week publication the verification of the collected data by using multiple data sources ensured the validity to the highest degree possible and the completeness of the data records for the accidents of interest about 29 of the initial sample i e 483 cases were excluded during stage iii of the verification process the following are indicative cases that were excluded from the analysis 1 the ship was either anchored or moored and either started to drag its anchor and drift or broke its moorings 2 the ship came into contact with objects such as floating logs or containers that could not be seen and therefore could not have been avoided by the crew 3 the ship suffered heavy weather damage to the superstructures 4 the main cause of the accident was the effect of the human factor e g collision accidents that were caused by non compliance of the crew to the international regulations for preventing collision at sea colregs and 5 the ship was under tug assistance at the time of the accident after the verification process the accident database contained n 277 cases of which 239 about 86 occurred in heavy weather conditions and 38 about 14 occurred in extreme weather events 3 statistical analysis this section presents the results from the analysis of the accident sample n 277 that was conducted to answer the basic research questions of this work 3 1 description of accident sample the following is a general statistical description of the accident sample by examining the percentage distributions for ship type accident location and accident category fig 1 shows that 82 of the accidents in the database involved the following ship types general cargo ships 31 bulk carriers 21 ro ro ferries 19 and tankers 9 the remaining ship types i e container ships cruise ships ro ro cargo pure car carriers and gas carriers each comprise about 3 5 of the accident database fig 2 shows that most of the recorded cases 54 are grounding accidents while the remaining percentage is equally distributed between contact 23 and collision 23 accidents fig 3 shows that the majority 53 of the accidents occurred while the ship was within port limits followed by 19 when the ship was navigating in restricted waters and 27 while the ship was en route therefore 72 of the accidents occurred within port limits in restricted water navigation where the speed of a ship can be as low as about 3 5 knots murdoch et al 2012 in these conditions manoeuvrability is highly dependent on the severity of the weather conditions as expressed by the values of wind speed and wave height papanikolaou et al 2015 fig 4 shows that most of the contact 86 and collision 62 accidents occurred while the ship was within port limits whereas grounding accidents are almost equally distributed to accidents that occurred while the ship was en route 44 and while the ship was within port limits 36 fig 5 shows that about 40 of the accidents in the sample involve grounding accidents of general cargo ships bulk carriers and tankers contact accidents involving ro ro ferries comprised 10 of the total accidents from the accident descriptions it was evident that most of these accidents involve a ship striking the dock while manoeuvring to berth or while leaving the port this is also indicated in fig 6 where almost 19 of the accidents involve ro ro ferries that were within port limits this is reasonable considering that ro ro ferries usually serve routes that include very frequent port calls which consequently increases their exposure to the hazards that result from the need of low speed manoeuvring a similar explanation may be offered for the accidents within port limits involving general cargo ships that comprise about 14 of the accident sample fig 6 therefore ro ro ferries seem to be frequently involved in accidents within port limits in adverse weather conditions a fact which may be attributed to their large wind profile area that limits their manoeuvring capabilities in these conditions an additional contributing factor to the frequent contact accidents involving ro ro ferries within port limits is presumed to be the potential insufficiency in the design of the port itself which may be related to its orientation to prevailing heavy weather conditions and therefore to what extent it is exposed to the weather it is also interesting to note that about 15 of contact accidents involving ro ro ferries happened in greek waters which may be attributed to the high volumes of coastal shipping traffic in this region in contrast to ro ro ferries container ships that also have large wind profile areas mostly due to the containers loaded on deck comprise only a small percentage 5 of the accidents in the sample this could be attributed to the fact that container ships usually require the use of tug assistance for effective manoeuvring within port limits e g while mooring as well as for navigating in restricted waters and therefore do not rely on their own power 3 2 distributions indicative of ship size to determine whether the average size of the ships involved in the accidents of interest are significantly different from the corresponding average size in the fleet in service the distribution of values for characteristic metrics of size and installed power which is indicated by the recorded mcr of the different ship types in the accident sample are compared to the corresponding distributions in the november 2013 fleet in service the data for the fleet in service was obtained from the ihs sea web database and include the ships that were in service in november 2013 and totalled 35 279 ships with a distribution per ship type as shown in fig 7 while the clarkson s fleet at risk data are classified by size classes for each ship type they do not contain information on installed power and therefore could not be used for the comparisons that are presented in this section the aim of the comparison is to determine whether the ships involved in the accidents of interest are smaller or larger compared to the fleet in service by placing the size and installed power within the context of the fleet for container ships the number of twenty foot equivalent unit teu containers have been used as a characteristic metric of size for cruise ships and ro ro ferries the size is determined by gross tonnage grt measurements for the remaining ship types the deadweight dwt was used for determining ship size the distribution of values shown in fig 8 fig 16 are percentile graphs that indicate the full range minimum to maximum for each characteristic metric and show the dispersion of values the graphs depict 50 of all values within the rectangle which is bounded by the 25th and 75th percentiles and indicate the median of the sample as a line the dashed horizontal lines indicate the limits of the various size classes per ship type as defined by the clarkson s intelligence network to identify potential changes in the distributions the following figures also compare the accident sample including extreme weather events n 277 with the accident sample containing only heavy weather conditions n 239 the comparison shows that the distributions indicating ship size and installed power are not observably different if we exclude extreme weather events from the analysis this will be further elaborated upon in the section presenting the analysis of the prevailing weather conditions from the mean values of size in table 3 it is observed that the accident sample mostly contains smaller ships container ships gas carriers tankers and bulk carriers are about 25 smaller on average compared to the ships that were in service during november 2013 however ro ro cargo ships and ro ro ferries are about 86 larger on average compared to the fleet in service in addition it is observed that the dispersion of values around the mean is smaller compared to the corresponding november 2013 fleet in service for all ship types that were examined except pure car carriers fig 12 which exhibit a relatively larger dispersion of values to test whether the observed differences in the mean values for the selected metric of size per ship type are statistically significant a two sample two tail t test assuming unequal variances was applied kanji 2006 the results in table 3 show that for a level of significance at p 0 05 ro ro ferries fig 11 involved in the accidents of interest are significantly larger while bulk carriers fig 15 significantly smaller compared to the ships that were in service during november 2013 additionally while the observed difference for ro ro cargo ships fig 10 is not statistically significant at the specified level the relative proximity of the t statistic to the critical value indicates that ro ro cargo ships might be significantly larger compared to the ships that were in service during november 2013 for the remaining ship types i e not ro ro cargo ships ro ro ferries and bulk carriers size is distributed in a similar manner as in the november 2013 fleet in service and mean values are not significantly different however when comparing the maximum ship sizes the accident sample contains smaller ships compared to those found in the fleet in service for example the maximum capacity for containerships fig 8 in the accident sample is 5000 teu while the november 2013 fleet in service contains ships up to about 18000 teu this is also observed for cruise ships fig 9 tankers fig 14 gas carriers fig 13 and general cargo ships fig 16 these observations indicate that specific size classes are more likely than others to be involved in the accident of interest specifically smaller ships seem more likely to be involved in an accident i e contact collision grounding during adverse weather in navigational settings that require low speed manoeuvring i e when approaching a port or when navigating in restricted waters because small ships usually depend on their own propulsion for these navigational conditions it is more likely that they might be affected by a lack of adequate powering compared to very large ships which usually require the use of tug assistance in restricted waters and port approaches in addition large tankers and gas carriers usually operate with relatively less frequent port calls while ship masters usually prefer to sail to a sheltered location or leave a coastal area and head to open waters during an escalating storm papanikolaou et al 2015 therefore it is more likely for large ships of this type to be in open waters in adverse weather conditions where contact grounding and collision accidents are less likely to occur the fact that ro ro ferries and ro ro cargo ships involved in the accident of interest are larger compared to the november 2013 fleet in service might indicate that their large wind profile area is an important factor despite their large installed power 3 3 trend analysis the purpose of this analysis is to identify possible temporal trends for navigational accidents in adverse weather conditions by plotting the number of recorded accidents as a time series a graphical representation for the period 1990 2013 is shown in fig 17 the clarksea index clarkson s 2016 which is a general indicator of earnings in the maritime industry is also plotted against the accidents time series for the same period for comparison evidently there is an increase in the total number of navigational accidents in adverse weather conditions after 2005 which peaks around 2007 while from 2010 there seems to be a decreasing trend a kendall s tau statistical test showed that the fluctuations in the number of accidents per year may not be random t a u 0 642 p 0 0001 the clarksea index roughly follows the same downward and upward trends over this period which shows that the number of navigational accidents in adverse weather conditions may be correlated to the growth of international sea borne trade the increasing trend of the clarksea index is indicative of the big boom in the shipping industry and the international sea borne trade that started in 2003 the consequent deep recession after 2009 had a direct impact on the shipping industry unctad 2015 and consequently on the number of ships in service the subsequent reduction in the fleet at risk of various ship types may account for the apparent sharp decrease in the number of recorded accidents of interest the same statistical test was also applied to the time series of accident numbers for each individual ship type to determine which ship type is most relevant to the significance of the overall trend that was observed the results in table 4 indicate that there is a statistically significant increasing trend p 0 05 in the number of the accidents of interest for the following ship types container ships cruise ships ro ro ferries bulk carriers and general cargo ships the increase in average earnings for the maritime industry during the big boom is mostly attributed to the rapid economic growth of china which translated to an increase in the demand for iron ore this fact may justify the increasing trend of navigational accidents in adverse weather conditions involving bulk carriers and general cargo ships as during that period a greater number was in service which means that more ships were exposed to navigational risks relevant statistics show that the fleet at risk of bulk carriers increased by 230 compared to the previous decade during the period 2001 2010 while the corresponding increase for general cargo ships is estimated at 40 clarkson s 2016 3 4 accident rates this section presents the relative frequency for the accidents of interest per ship type with the aim to investigate the extent of the problem in relation to the number of ships in operation for the same period the accident rates were calculated per ship year table 5 by considering the accidents that occurred during the same period for which there was available fleet at risk data according to eq 1 this basis is common in maritime risk assessment see eliopoulou et al 2016 as it represents the population of ships fleet that were at risk of being involved in an accident the data for the fleet at risk was provided by the clarkson s shipping intelligence network clarkson s 2013 the data contains 330 857 ships that were built from 1980 onward while it should be noted that the fleet numbers for tankers and bulk carriers were available for the period 1990 2013 while for all other ship types only for the period 1996 2013 1 a c c i d e n t f r e q u e n c y n u m b e r o f a c c i d e n t s t i m e p e r i o d f l e e t n u m b e r t i m e p e r i o d τhe initial accident sample n 277 cases refers to the period 1990 2013 therefore the calculation of the accident rates has been based on a subset of the initial accident sample additionally due to limitations in the fleet at risk data ro ro ferries and ro ro cargo ships have been aggregated in one category ro ro ships some useful remarks may be made by comparing the frequency of each ship type in the accident sample to the corresponding frequency in the fleet at risk for the same period from 1996 to 2013 fig 18 the reasoning is that if a random accident sample was extracted from the fleet at risk population then it would be expected that the distribution of ship types would be very close to that in the population therefore differences in these distributions might indicate ship types that are more likely to be involved in the accident of interest gas carriers pure car carriers and cruise ships appear almost as frequently in the accident sample as in the fleet at risk this indicates that these ship types are not especially vulnerable to navigational accidents in adverse weather conditions even though they have large wind profile areas and therefore are exposed to greater lateral wind forces general cargo ships appear almost 4 times more frequently in the accident sample 32 than in the fleet at risk 7 and ro ro ships comprise 23 of the accident sample compared to 6 of the fleet at risk ro ro ships include both ro ro ferries and ro ro cargo ships additionally the following ship types appear less frequently in the accident sample compared to the fleet at risk bulk carriers 21 of accidents vs 34 of fleet tankers 9 of accidents vs 22 of fleet and container ships 5 of accidents vs 19 of fleet the calculated accident rates per ship type are between the orders of 10 410 4 container ships pure car carriers gas carriers tankers and bulk carriers and 10 3 10 3 cruise ships ro ro general cargo ships accidents per ship year general cargo ships are the ship type that is involved most frequently in this type of accident 3 58e 03 accidents per ship year while accidents involving tankers are the ones occurring least frequently 1 72e 04 accidents per ship year the increased frequency of accidents involving cruise ships ro ro ships and general cargo ships could be attributed to the fact that these ship types are expected to make port calls more frequently e g compared to tankers which increases their exposure to the hazards that result to the accidents of interest the calculated accident rates per ship type and accident category were compared with the corresponding rates from published fsa studies imo 2010 2008a 2008b 2008c 2007a 2007b 2002 it should be noted that the accident rates in fsa studies table 6 take into account accidents regardless of the prevailing weather conditions while the rates for the accidents of interest table 7 consider accidents that have occurred only in weather conditions that include heavy weather conditions and extreme weather events overall the rates that were calculated for the accident sample order in the range of 10 5 to 10 3 accidents per ship year are at least one order of magnitude lower than the corresponding values from the various fsa studies order in the range of 10 4 to 10 2 accidents per ship year therefore accidents in adverse weather conditions that may have been caused by manoeuvrability issues due to a lack of adequate installed power are a comparatively small proportion of all the accidents investigated in the fsa studies an interesting observation is that for some ship types and accident categories the calculated rates are in the same order of magnitude which implies that the accidents of interest are a significant proportion compared to all the accidents investigated in the fsa studies this is the case for collision accidents involving bulk carriers grounding accidents involving general cargo ships and contact accidents involving ropax vessels the results in tables 8 14 break down the previously calculated accident rates to the corresponding size classes for each ship type accident rates for small bulk carriers and for general cargo ships smaller than 5000 t dwt could not be calculated due to the unavailability of the corresponding fleet at risk data the ship type and size class most frequently 1 56e 02 accidents per ship year involved in the accidents of interest are ro ro ships smaller than 2000 t dwt the smallest relative frequency was calculated for handysize tankers 7 65e 05 accidents per ship year 4 weather conditions the purpose of this analysis is to determine the prevailing wave height and wind speed values during the accidents of interest and compare them to the corresponding limits for adverse weather conditions as defined by the imo 2013 interim guidelines 2013a an initial exploratory analysis of the obtained weather information is shown in fig 19 and fig 20 for wind speed in m s and wave height in m respectively a limitation of this analysis relates to the very small availability and in some cases the validity of the obtained weather related information wave height was available for 133 out of the 277 accidents 48 whereas wind speed for only 130 47 of the cases per ship type the available weather related information ranged from 1 3 to 2 3 of the accidents for example wave height and wind speed information for accidents involving tankers were available for less than 30 of the total cases the maximum values for the availability of the weather information are observed for accidents involving cruise ships ro ro ferries and ro ro cargo ships where wave height was available for an average of 65 and wind speed was available for an average of 56 of the cases incomplete records i e cases with only one of wave height or wind speed information were excluded from the analysis based on the assumption that no significant information would be lost as the frequency distributions of the complete and incomplete weather information records was similar to ensure validity the obtained information was cross referenced where possible with weather information found in published accident reports in some cases the available weather information had much lower wave height and wind speed values compared to those in the corresponding published accident reports since accident reports may be considered a reliable source of weather information it was assumed that the obtained values for wave height and wind speed may in some cases be underestimated compared to the actual weather conditions at this stage it was decided to exclude the accidents that had occurred in extreme weather events in addition it was decided to conduct an outlier analysis of the accidents that had occurred in heavy weather as some extreme wave height and wind speed values were observed and these could potentially be attributed to either erroneous reporting or unusually high values that have an extremely low probability of occurrence the cut off values were derived from the standardized z scores of the 25th 50th and 75th percentiles and equal 7 m for wave height values and 25 m s for wind speed these exclusions are justified as such extreme weather conditions may not be reasonably expected to inform a regulatory process such as defining the minimum required propulsion power in adverse weather conditions after the exclusions an accident subset containing n 110 cases was derived for which the average values for wind speed and wave height are 10 46 m s and 1 61 m respectively the corresponding distribution of wind speed values follows a wide spread bell type function whereas the distribution for wave height is strongly skewed towards smaller values and resemble the character of exponential decay see histograms in fig 21 and fig 22 the correlation between the wind speed x axis and wave height values y axis is shown in fig 23 where the most appropriate fit for the relationship between wind speed and wave height was determined to be the power function a regression analysis of the values resulted in a coefficient of r2 0 75 the distributions of the available weather information for the accident subset n 110 per accident and ship type are shown in fig 24 through fig 27 which are percentile graphs that indicate the full range minimum to maximum of the weather related information and show the dispersion of values the graphs depict 50 of all values within the rectangle which is bounded by the 25th and 75th percentiles and indicate the median of the sample as a line the graphs also include the outlier cut off limits 7 m for wave height and 25 m s for wind speed the average conditions for the accident sample as well as the adverse condition limits as set by the imo in the 2013 interim guidelines about 75 of collision accidents in the accident sample occurred in met ocean conditions close to the average accident conditions 1 61 m for wave height and 10 46 m s for wind speed whereas 75 of contact and grounding accidents occurred in wave heights equal to about 2 5 m and wind speed about 13 5 m s that are greater compared to the average conditions see figs 24 and 25 respectively the observed weather conditions during collision accidents may be attributed to the fact that about 62 of all collision accidents occurred while the ship was within port limits where milder weather conditions may be expected about 44 of all grounding accidents occurred while the ship was en route where weather conditions may be expected to be worse compared to a more sheltered location such as within port limits or restricted waters if we examine contact accidents the fact that they have occurred in worse conditions compared to collision accidents might at first glance seem counter intuitive since 86 of these accidents occurred while the ship was within port limits however considering that contact accidents within port limits mostly involve ro ro ferries 10 of all accidents which despite their increased manoeuvring capabilities they are more vulnerable to higher wind speeds in low speed manoeuvring situations due to their increased wind profile area this result is more reasonable while wave height and wind speed distributions are mostly similar for each accident category grounding accidents appear to have more dispersed values additionally minimum and maximum wave height and wind speed values are approximately equal for all accident categories except for contact accidents that involve some cases that have occurred in larger wave heights as shown in fig 26 about 75 of navigational accidents involving pure car carriers tankers bulk carriers and general cargo ships occurred in wave heights below the average accident conditions 1 61 m even though the medians for these ship types are similar the dispersion for tankers is smaller compared to bulk carriers and general cargo ships all accidents involving gas carriers occurred in wave heights below the average accident conditions and while 50 of the accidents involving cruise ships occurred in similar wave height conditions as gas carriers the corresponding distribution is more dispersed and highly skewed to lower values most of the accidents involving ro ro ferries and ro ro cargo ships over 50 of the accidents occurred in larger wave heights compared to the average accident conditions a comparison between the two distributions shows that while the medians are similar wave height data for ro ro ferries is much more dispersed compared to ro ro cargo ships considering the distribution of wind speed information per ship type as shown in fig 27 they follow generally similar trends with the ones observed for wave height both in terms of data dispersion and median placement in relation to the average accident conditions however about 50 of the accidents involving pure car carriers have occurred in wind speeds greater than the average accident conditions 10 46 m s with values ranging from 10 28 m s up to 20 5 m s which are very close to the definition of adverse conditions by the imo furthermore 75 of accidents involving ro ro ferries and ro ro cargo ships occurred in wind speeds well above the average accident conditions this may be attributed to the relatively small size to installed power ratios that characterize ro ro ferries and ro ro cargo ships which increases the possibility that the installed power will be adequate for safe manoeuvring in adverse weather conditions in addition ro ro ships are usually equipped with auxiliary steering devices such as bow thrusters that provides them with increased manoeuvring capabilities in such environmental conditions it is interesting to examine the prevailing weather conditions at the time of the most frequent as well as the least frequent accidents and the corresponding ship types and size classes that were involved in these accidents see the section on the calculation of the accident rates the prevailing weather conditions were determined by averaging the available weather related information for each ship type and size class it is noted that following the previously described outlier analysis for the weather related information wave heights over 7 m and wind speeds over 25 m s have been excluded from the analysis the ship types that are involved most frequently in the order of 10 3 accidents per ship year in the accidents of interest are cruise ships ro ro ships and general cargo ships as shown in fig 28 the highest values for the average weather conditions wave height about 2 50 m and wind speed about 13 m s were related to accidents involving ro ro ships the lowest accident frequencies order of 10 4 accidents per ship year were calculated for accidents involving container ships pure car carriers gas carriers tankers and bulk carriers the highest values for the average weather conditions wave height about 2 30 m and wind speed about 11 7 m s were related to accidents involving bulk carriers although pure car carrier accidents occurred in relatively small average wave heights about 1 00 m the average wind speed is equal to about 17 m s which is of the highest values recorded fig 29 correlates the prevailing weather conditions with the size classes of the ship types that are most frequently involved in the accidents of interest with the aim to provide additional resolution to the information in fig 28 it is noted that less frequent size classes are omitted from the representation for reasons of graphical clarity ro ro ships have the highest accident frequency fig 28 which is mostly attributed to accidents involving relatively small under 2000 t dwt ships the corresponding weather conditions were average wave height equal to about 3 m and average wind speed equal to about 13 m s which are very close to the average weather conditions for all size classes of this ship type tankers and container ships are the ship types least frequently involved in the accidents of interest fig 28 and the corresponding frequencies are mostly attributed to relatively large ships aframax and panamax class respectively the corresponding weather conditions for aframax tankers were average wave height equal to about 2 6 m and average wind speed equal to about 14 6 m s in addition the corresponding weather conditions for panamax container ships were average wave height equal to about 1 9 m and average wind speed equal to about 11 6 m s 5 conclusions this paper presents a comprehensive statistical analysis of navigational ship accidents i e collision contact and grounding accidents in the presence of severe adverse weather conditions that might be related to manoeuvrability issues due to the lack of adequate powering and or steering for the purposes of this analysis a structured accident database was compiled by using readily available accident related information from multiple sources 71 of the accidents of interest consisted of general cargo ships 31 bulk carriers 21 and ro ro ferries and ro ro cargo ships 19 about 54 of the accident sample consists of grounding and collision contact accidents that occurred while the vessel was within port limits or limited areas in a large portion of these accidents ro ro ferries were involved in collision contact accidents most grounding accidents about 20 of the accident sample involved tankers bulk carriers and general cargo ships that were en route at the time of the accident the analysis generally indicated that smaller cargo ships seem to be more vulnerable to this type of accident bulk carriers involved in the accident of interest are significantly smaller compared to the average size of the corresponding november 2013 fleet in service while container ships gas carriers and tankers are on average 25 smaller however it seems that this is not the case for ro ro ferries and ro ro cargo ships since the accident sample contains relatively larger ships compared to the average size of the november 2013 fleet in service which indicates that there might be a considerable effect on their manoeuvring capabilities in adverse weather conditions due to large wind profile areas overall the accident sample did not involve very large ships for most ship types which could be attributed to the facts that these ships are usually equipped with larger main engines and they usually require tug assistance when approaching a port or when navigating in restricted waters the time series analysis of the accident sample revealed a statistically significant increasing trend approximately during the period from 2005 to 2007 while the years after and up to 2013 seem to mark a decline in the number of adverse weather accidents this trend may correlate very closely to the rapid growth of the maritime industry up to 2008 and the subsequent recession as shown by the temporal trends of the clarksea index which is an indicator of the average earnings for the maritime industry the overall increasing trend in the number of the accidents of interest may be attributed to significant increasing trends for accidents involving container ships bulk carriers general cargo ships ro ro ferries and cruise ships the calculation of the accident rates per ship type show that the ship types most frequently involved in this type of accident are the following 1 cruise and ro ro ships 2 28e 03 and 3 13e 03 accidents per ship year respectively due to their large wind profile areas and frequent port calls and 2 general cargo ships 3 58e 03 accidents per ship year as they usually operate in coastal waters with frequent port calls the least frequent accidents involved tankers 1 72e 04 accidents per ship year in addition from the comparison of the calculated rates with those found in earlier submitted fsa studies we may conclude that even though the accidents of herein interest are only a small proportion of all accidents recorded for most ship types and accident categories it is shown that for collision accidents involving bulk carriers grounding accidents involving general cargo ships and contact accidents involving ropax vessels the accident rates related to bad weather are significant the analysis of the obtained weather related information is limited by issues of data availability and in some cases validity complete records of weather information i e records where information was available for both wave height and wind speed were available for only 110 out of the total 277 cases which amounts about 40 of the accidents of interest the validity of the data was addressed by cross referencing the available wave height and wind speed information where possible with corresponding information from other published accident reports of the same accidents to limit the uncertainties of the conducted study it was decided to exclude cases with incomplete weather records and very extreme abnormal weather conditions as they may distort the outcome of the study for the resulting accident subset n 110 the average wave height was equal to 1 61 m and the average wind speed 10 46 m s collision accidents occurred in relatively milder weather conditions compared to both contact and grounding accidents this may be related to the fact that most collision accidents occurred when the ship was either within port limits or in restricted waters while most grounding accidents occurred when the ship was en route most contact accidents also occurred within port limits and mainly involved ro ro ferries ro ro ships have a relatively large wind profile area that exposes them to greater risks from high winds which limits their ability to manoeuvre in low speed navigation which is a functional need within port limits for this ship type considering the available weather related information for the most frequent accidents the worst recorded average weather conditions were observed in accidents involving ro ro ships 2 50 m wave height and 13 m s wind speed while for the least frequent accidents the worst average weather conditions were present in accidents involving bulk carriers 2 30 m wave height and 12 m s wind speed the imo 2013 interim guidelines determine the limits for adverse weather conditions as a function of ship size regardless of ship type while the limits for significant wave height range from 4 0 m to 5 5 m and the limits for mean wind speed range from 15 7 m s to 19 0 m s imo 2013a this analysis has demonstrated that most navigational accidents in the presence of adverse weather conditions happened at much lower significant wave heights and wind speeds namely in conditions that cannot be defined as adverse while the accidents happened in limited coastal waters obviously the ships experienced manoeuvrability issues that may be related to increased vessel traffic collisions next to insufficient propulsion power and or steering ability at low speed note that as demonstrated by ventikos et al 2018 most of the ships that were involved in the accidents of interest would be compliant with the requirements for the interim guidelines minimum propulsion power in adverse conditions that are stipulated in the energy efficiency related regulations of the imo it should also be noted that the focus of the present analysis is accidents in navigational limited waters whereas the scope of the imo 2013 interim guidelines includes and mainly refers to open sea navigation the weather conditions in the open sea are more likely to be more severe compared to those encountered in coastal and restricted waters the manoeuvrability and safety of the ships in open sea navigation is however an entirely different safety problem which is presently addressed by solas intact stability criteria a clear conclusion is that safe navigation in adverse weather conditions is correlated to a variety of additional factors other than installed propulsion power and therefore further work and research would be required to ensure that the relevant regulatory requirements properly reflect realistic operational conditions and are not problematic in the practice of implementation this may suggest that a redefinition of what is considered adverse weather condition in relation to the particularities of each ship type is necessary in fact several delegations at imo have recently concluded that a simple increase of the severity of the weather conditions specified in the 2013 interim guidelines is presently not warranted nor rational while the currently under revision guidelines imo 2016 should reflect actual ship operation and be based on realistic scenarios and corresponding environmental conditions acknowledgements the

23257,the latest imo regulatory requirements concerning the control of toxic gas emissions from ships have sparked interest in whether ships are adequately equipped to operate safely in adverse weather conditions when compliance is achieved simply by the reduction of power this paper deals with the analysis of navigational accidents collision grounding and contact accidents that occurred in adverse weather conditions and may have been related to the lack of sufficient powering and manoeuvrability the analysis aims to potentially assist the imo regulatory work in setting rational margins of minimum powering of ships for safely operating in adverse weather conditions keywords adverse weather conditions navigational accidents ship safety imo emissions control 1 introduction the international maritime organization imo leading the efforts to reduce toxic gas emissions from maritime operations has introduced the energy efficiency design index eedi requirement for new ships in the imo resolution mepc 203 62 imo 2011 the eedi is expressed in grams of emitted co2 by the distance the cargo has been transported g co2 t nm and is intended to be a driver for limiting the emissions of toxic gases from new ships concerns have been raised that relate to the speculation that compliance with the eedi requirement might be accomplished simply by installing smaller main engines on new ships however this decision could have a negative impact on the safe operation of ships in adverse weather conditions by a subsequent reduction of the capability of ships to maintain their manoeuvrability as highlighted by the international association of classification societies iacs 2010 the negative impacts of having inadequate propulsion power in adverse weather conditions include the inability to maintain or change course especially in restricted navigational areas shigunov and papanikolaou 2014 and the inability to maintain ship speed the work carried out by iacs led to the introduction of the 2013 interim guidelines for determining minimum propulsion power by the imo resolution mepc 232 65 imo 2013a followed by amendments by the imo resolutions mepc 255 67 imo 2014 and mepc 262 68 imo 2015 the scope of the guidelines covers new ships that need to comply with the eedi requirements in unrestricted navigation and which are equipped with a conventional propulsion system the purpose of the 2013 interim guidelines is to ensure that ships dispose a minimum power that is adequate for maintaining manoeuvrability and navigational safely in adverse weather conditions the criteria for determining the minimum propulsion power in adverse conditions depend on ship size type and were derived on the basis of the eedi reference lines in addition the guidelines define what is considered adverse weather condition as a function of ship size expressed by its length between perpendiculars lpp the corresponding range of environmental parameters associated with adverse conditions is 4 0 5 5 m significant wave height hs which corresponds to sea states 5 7 rough to high on the douglas scale and 15 7 19 0 m s mean wind speed vw which corresponds to level 8 gale on the beaufort scale because ships often operate in weather conditions that are worse than those embedded in the interim guidelines and should be taken into account in their design bitner gregerse et al 2016 concerns were expressed by the maritime industry about the margins for wave height and wind speed values that determine what is considered adverse weather and what is considered adequate propulsion power to maintain manoeuvrability according to the imo 2013 interim guidelines these concerns were the basis for the project shopera energy efficient safe ship operation which was funded by the european commission under the fp7 framework papanikolaou et al 2015 the objectives of this research project were among others to specify the environmental conditions for assessing sufficient propulsion power as well as to assess the safety margins of ships that navigate in adverse weather conditions papanikolaou et al 2016 this paper presents part of the work of project shopera and builds on the research of ventikos et al 2015 by introducing specific met ocean data wave height and wind speed into the analysis for accidents that occurred from 1990 up to 2013 this work involves the analysis of navigational accidents recorded in the ihs sea webtm database ihs 2013 which happened in severe weather conditions and may be related to the failure of powering and manoeuvrability the analysis of the severity of the weather during these accidents should enable a not strictly qualitative comparison with the definition of adverse conditions in the 2013 interim guidelines of the imo the ultimate goal is to potentially assist the imo regulatory work in setting rational margins of minimum powering of ships for safely operating in severe adverse weather conditions the next section describes the methodology of the conducted analysis thereafter the results of the statistical analysis of the accident sample are elaborated namely it includes a general description of the accident sample the distributions that are indicative of ship size the analysis of the annual number of accidents and the relative frequencies of the accidents of interest per ship year the section after presents the analysis of the prevailing weather conditions at the time and location of the accident the paper concludes with a commentary of the most significant results and insights that relate to the limits for adverse weather conditions set by the imo 2013 interim guidelines 2 methodology and data verification the scope of the analysis includes navigational accidents i e collision contact and grounding accidents that have occurred in severe adverse weather conditions in navigational limited waters which might be related to manoeuvrability issues due to the lack of adequate powering and or steering compared to other accident types such as founderings this type was considered more likely to occur due to lack of sufficient power and or steering the reasoning for the selection of navigational limited waters in the analysis is that ships operate there with lower speeds compared to open water navigation while their manoeuvring efficiency of their steering devices capability is greatly affected in severe adverse weather conditions i e strong winds and large waves thus the safety problem at hand is not simply a minimum powering problem but a manoeuvrability problem in limited waters and severe weather conditions shigunov papanikolaou 2014 the main research questions of this work are which ship types and size classes are most vulnerable how often the accidents of interest have occurred in the past and whether the prevailing weather conditions during the accidents are comparable with those defined as adverse conditions in the interim guidelines the methodology of the analysis comprised the following steps 1 gather information on the accidents of interest 2 screen the information to identify the cases that are more likely to have been caused by a lack of sufficient propulsive power 3 identify the size classes for each ship type that seem most vulnerable to this hazard 4 determine the frequency and possible temporal trends of the accidents of interest and 5 determine the prevailing weather conditions a structured accident database was compiled from multiple data sources with specific inclusion criteria see table 1 the records for each accident in the database were organized into the following information groups ship details ship dimensions machinery data accident details and weather information accident information was mainly obtained from the ihs sea web marine casualty database ihs 2013 and the public area of the marine casualties and incidents database of the imo the global integrated shipping information system gisis imo 2013b these sources are among the most reliable and frequently used accident databases in the maritime industry τhe ihs sea web marine casualty database classifies the prevailing weather conditions on a qualitative scale which means that there may be no quantitative weather related information such as significant wave height and wind speed at the time of the accident therefore weather related information was provided by partners participating in the project shopera namely danaos shipping company ltd and the instituto superior tecnico ist centre for marine technology and engineering centec as well as relevant published accident reports the wave height information that was provided by partners in the project shopera are significant wave height values for the approximate time and location of the accidents of interest and were originally derived from model hindcasts as well as from statistical analysis of buoy measurements it should be noted that the obtained significant wave height values were used in this analysis as provided without any further elaboration from the available weather information for the accidents of interest the maximum recorded significant wave height equals 7 m and the maximum recorded mean wind speed equals 21 m s these conditions correspond to a sea state 7 high on the douglas scale and level 9 severe gale on the beaufort scale the swedish club 2014 after the initial data collection the database contained n 1666 navigational accidents that occurred in weather conditions which included both heavy weather conditions and extreme weather events 12 of the accidents subsequently a structured verification process with specific filtering criteria was conducted to ensure the validity of the original data and to ensure the relevance of the included cases to the scope of the analysis as most maritime accident databases do not provide adequate information on the causes of the recorded incidents psarros et al 2010 the possibility of a lack of propulsive power to actually be a root cause for the accidents of interest was indirectly determined with a set of specified criteria falsely including an irrelevant case would distort the conclusions of the analysis and provide misleading results considering that effective risk mitigation depends on determining the true root causes of an accident antão and guedes soares 2002 as shown in table 2 only 17 were considered relevant to the analysis i e 1389 accidents were excluded the highest retention rates are observed for ro ro ferries and cruise ships 29 and 27 of the initial sample per ship type respectively which indicates that these types of ships might be more frequently involved in accidents related to a potential lack of manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions stage i this stage involved an initial screening based on the accident category and resulted in the exclusion of 753 cases indicative examples of cases that are considered out of the scope of the analysis are cases where propulsive machinery was not damaged in any way or the hull of the ship was intact and the ship was not laid up for repairs as a result the following accident categories were excluded from the analysis hull and machinery damages including failures on the main engine or the generators blackouts hull cracks and failure of bow thruster propeller rudder and stabilizer accidents that are caused by fire explosion in machinery cargo spaces or in the accommodation any accident where the ship sank due to either ingress of water or cargo shift accidents that occurred while the ship was in shipyard or dry dock stage ii this stage resulted in the exclusion of 153 cases by applying the following filters the froude number fn and the severity of the accident ships with a froude number greater than 0 5 were considered high speed crafts and were excluded due to the fact that high speed crafts are usually equipped with high powered main engines in order to achieve high service speeds antão and guedes soares 2008 therefore high speed crafts are unlikely to face manoeuvrability issues due to lack of main engine power this filter was mainly applicable to cruise ships and ro ro ferries as they operate at greater service speeds compared to the other ship types under consideration a serious accident is one that results in one of the following lrfp 1995 structural damage rendering the ship unseaworthy such as penetration of hull underwater immobilization of main engines extensive damage etc breakdown actual total loss any other undefined situation resulting in damage or financial loss which is considered to be serious incl fatalities missing persons and environmental damage every accident that does not fall in the previously mentioned categories is characterized as not serious serious accidents have a relatively higher probability of being reported in maritime accident databases hassel et al 2011 and are usually reported in more detail compared to not serious accidents for example recorded information for not serious cases may only involve the date place of occurrence and the mention of minor damages therefore accidents which had been classified as not serious were excluded because their relevance to the scope of the present analysis could not be safely determined stage iii during this stage the remaining data was verified against published accident reports either by various accident investigation branches or other national maritime authorities such as the marine accident investigation branch maib uk the transport safety bureau tsb australia and the hellenic bureau for marine casualties investigation greece in addition the data was cross checked with any available information that could be retrieved from other sources such as the lloyd s casualty week publication the verification of the collected data by using multiple data sources ensured the validity to the highest degree possible and the completeness of the data records for the accidents of interest about 29 of the initial sample i e 483 cases were excluded during stage iii of the verification process the following are indicative cases that were excluded from the analysis 1 the ship was either anchored or moored and either started to drag its anchor and drift or broke its moorings 2 the ship came into contact with objects such as floating logs or containers that could not be seen and therefore could not have been avoided by the crew 3 the ship suffered heavy weather damage to the superstructures 4 the main cause of the accident was the effect of the human factor e g collision accidents that were caused by non compliance of the crew to the international regulations for preventing collision at sea colregs and 5 the ship was under tug assistance at the time of the accident after the verification process the accident database contained n 277 cases of which 239 about 86 occurred in heavy weather conditions and 38 about 14 occurred in extreme weather events 3 statistical analysis this section presents the results from the analysis of the accident sample n 277 that was conducted to answer the basic research questions of this work 3 1 description of accident sample the following is a general statistical description of the accident sample by examining the percentage distributions for ship type accident location and accident category fig 1 shows that 82 of the accidents in the database involved the following ship types general cargo ships 31 bulk carriers 21 ro ro ferries 19 and tankers 9 the remaining ship types i e container ships cruise ships ro ro cargo pure car carriers and gas carriers each comprise about 3 5 of the accident database fig 2 shows that most of the recorded cases 54 are grounding accidents while the remaining percentage is equally distributed between contact 23 and collision 23 accidents fig 3 shows that the majority 53 of the accidents occurred while the ship was within port limits followed by 19 when the ship was navigating in restricted waters and 27 while the ship was en route therefore 72 of the accidents occurred within port limits in restricted water navigation where the speed of a ship can be as low as about 3 5 knots murdoch et al 2012 in these conditions manoeuvrability is highly dependent on the severity of the weather conditions as expressed by the values of wind speed and wave height papanikolaou et al 2015 fig 4 shows that most of the contact 86 and collision 62 accidents occurred while the ship was within port limits whereas grounding accidents are almost equally distributed to accidents that occurred while the ship was en route 44 and while the ship was within port limits 36 fig 5 shows that about 40 of the accidents in the sample involve grounding accidents of general cargo ships bulk carriers and tankers contact accidents involving ro ro ferries comprised 10 of the total accidents from the accident descriptions it was evident that most of these accidents involve a ship striking the dock while manoeuvring to berth or while leaving the port this is also indicated in fig 6 where almost 19 of the accidents involve ro ro ferries that were within port limits this is reasonable considering that ro ro ferries usually serve routes that include very frequent port calls which consequently increases their exposure to the hazards that result from the need of low speed manoeuvring a similar explanation may be offered for the accidents within port limits involving general cargo ships that comprise about 14 of the accident sample fig 6 therefore ro ro ferries seem to be frequently involved in accidents within port limits in adverse weather conditions a fact which may be attributed to their large wind profile area that limits their manoeuvring capabilities in these conditions an additional contributing factor to the frequent contact accidents involving ro ro ferries within port limits is presumed to be the potential insufficiency in the design of the port itself which may be related to its orientation to prevailing heavy weather conditions and therefore to what extent it is exposed to the weather it is also interesting to note that about 15 of contact accidents involving ro ro ferries happened in greek waters which may be attributed to the high volumes of coastal shipping traffic in this region in contrast to ro ro ferries container ships that also have large wind profile areas mostly due to the containers loaded on deck comprise only a small percentage 5 of the accidents in the sample this could be attributed to the fact that container ships usually require the use of tug assistance for effective manoeuvring within port limits e g while mooring as well as for navigating in restricted waters and therefore do not rely on their own power 3 2 distributions indicative of ship size to determine whether the average size of the ships involved in the accidents of interest are significantly different from the corresponding average size in the fleet in service the distribution of values for characteristic metrics of size and installed power which is indicated by the recorded mcr of the different ship types in the accident sample are compared to the corresponding distributions in the november 2013 fleet in service the data for the fleet in service was obtained from the ihs sea web database and include the ships that were in service in november 2013 and totalled 35 279 ships with a distribution per ship type as shown in fig 7 while the clarkson s fleet at risk data are classified by size classes for each ship type they do not contain information on installed power and therefore could not be used for the comparisons that are presented in this section the aim of the comparison is to determine whether the ships involved in the accidents of interest are smaller or larger compared to the fleet in service by placing the size and installed power within the context of the fleet for container ships the number of twenty foot equivalent unit teu containers have been used as a characteristic metric of size for cruise ships and ro ro ferries the size is determined by gross tonnage grt measurements for the remaining ship types the deadweight dwt was used for determining ship size the distribution of values shown in fig 8 fig 16 are percentile graphs that indicate the full range minimum to maximum for each characteristic metric and show the dispersion of values the graphs depict 50 of all values within the rectangle which is bounded by the 25th and 75th percentiles and indicate the median of the sample as a line the dashed horizontal lines indicate the limits of the various size classes per ship type as defined by the clarkson s intelligence network to identify potential changes in the distributions the following figures also compare the accident sample including extreme weather events n 277 with the accident sample containing only heavy weather conditions n 239 the comparison shows that the distributions indicating ship size and installed power are not observably different if we exclude extreme weather events from the analysis this will be further elaborated upon in the section presenting the analysis of the prevailing weather conditions from the mean values of size in table 3 it is observed that the accident sample mostly contains smaller ships container ships gas carriers tankers and bulk carriers are about 25 smaller on average compared to the ships that were in service during november 2013 however ro ro cargo ships and ro ro ferries are about 86 larger on average compared to the fleet in service in addition it is observed that the dispersion of values around the mean is smaller compared to the corresponding november 2013 fleet in service for all ship types that were examined except pure car carriers fig 12 which exhibit a relatively larger dispersion of values to test whether the observed differences in the mean values for the selected metric of size per ship type are statistically significant a two sample two tail t test assuming unequal variances was applied kanji 2006 the results in table 3 show that for a level of significance at p 0 05 ro ro ferries fig 11 involved in the accidents of interest are significantly larger while bulk carriers fig 15 significantly smaller compared to the ships that were in service during november 2013 additionally while the observed difference for ro ro cargo ships fig 10 is not statistically significant at the specified level the relative proximity of the t statistic to the critical value indicates that ro ro cargo ships might be significantly larger compared to the ships that were in service during november 2013 for the remaining ship types i e not ro ro cargo ships ro ro ferries and bulk carriers size is distributed in a similar manner as in the november 2013 fleet in service and mean values are not significantly different however when comparing the maximum ship sizes the accident sample contains smaller ships compared to those found in the fleet in service for example the maximum capacity for containerships fig 8 in the accident sample is 5000 teu while the november 2013 fleet in service contains ships up to about 18000 teu this is also observed for cruise ships fig 9 tankers fig 14 gas carriers fig 13 and general cargo ships fig 16 these observations indicate that specific size classes are more likely than others to be involved in the accident of interest specifically smaller ships seem more likely to be involved in an accident i e contact collision grounding during adverse weather in navigational settings that require low speed manoeuvring i e when approaching a port or when navigating in restricted waters because small ships usually depend on their own propulsion for these navigational conditions it is more likely that they might be affected by a lack of adequate powering compared to very large ships which usually require the use of tug assistance in restricted waters and port approaches in addition large tankers and gas carriers usually operate with relatively less frequent port calls while ship masters usually prefer to sail to a sheltered location or leave a coastal area and head to open waters during an escalating storm papanikolaou et al 2015 therefore it is more likely for large ships of this type to be in open waters in adverse weather conditions where contact grounding and collision accidents are less likely to occur the fact that ro ro ferries and ro ro cargo ships involved in the accident of interest are larger compared to the november 2013 fleet in service might indicate that their large wind profile area is an important factor despite their large installed power 3 3 trend analysis the purpose of this analysis is to identify possible temporal trends for navigational accidents in adverse weather conditions by plotting the number of recorded accidents as a time series a graphical representation for the period 1990 2013 is shown in fig 17 the clarksea index clarkson s 2016 which is a general indicator of earnings in the maritime industry is also plotted against the accidents time series for the same period for comparison evidently there is an increase in the total number of navigational accidents in adverse weather conditions after 2005 which peaks around 2007 while from 2010 there seems to be a decreasing trend a kendall s tau statistical test showed that the fluctuations in the number of accidents per year may not be random t a u 0 642 p 0 0001 the clarksea index roughly follows the same downward and upward trends over this period which shows that the number of navigational accidents in adverse weather conditions may be correlated to the growth of international sea borne trade the increasing trend of the clarksea index is indicative of the big boom in the shipping industry and the international sea borne trade that started in 2003 the consequent deep recession after 2009 had a direct impact on the shipping industry unctad 2015 and consequently on the number of ships in service the subsequent reduction in the fleet at risk of various ship types may account for the apparent sharp decrease in the number of recorded accidents of interest the same statistical test was also applied to the time series of accident numbers for each individual ship type to determine which ship type is most relevant to the significance of the overall trend that was observed the results in table 4 indicate that there is a statistically significant increasing trend p 0 05 in the number of the accidents of interest for the following ship types container ships cruise ships ro ro ferries bulk carriers and general cargo ships the increase in average earnings for the maritime industry during the big boom is mostly attributed to the rapid economic growth of china which translated to an increase in the demand for iron ore this fact may justify the increasing trend of navigational accidents in adverse weather conditions involving bulk carriers and general cargo ships as during that period a greater number was in service which means that more ships were exposed to navigational risks relevant statistics show that the fleet at risk of bulk carriers increased by 230 compared to the previous decade during the period 2001 2010 while the corresponding increase for general cargo ships is estimated at 40 clarkson s 2016 3 4 accident rates this section presents the relative frequency for the accidents of interest per ship type with the aim to investigate the extent of the problem in relation to the number of ships in operation for the same period the accident rates were calculated per ship year table 5 by considering the accidents that occurred during the same period for which there was available fleet at risk data according to eq 1 this basis is common in maritime risk assessment see eliopoulou et al 2016 as it represents the population of ships fleet that were at risk of being involved in an accident the data for the fleet at risk was provided by the clarkson s shipping intelligence network clarkson s 2013 the data contains 330 857 ships that were built from 1980 onward while it should be noted that the fleet numbers for tankers and bulk carriers were available for the period 1990 2013 while for all other ship types only for the period 1996 2013 1 a c c i d e n t f r e q u e n c y n u m b e r o f a c c i d e n t s t i m e p e r i o d f l e e t n u m b e r t i m e p e r i o d τhe initial accident sample n 277 cases refers to the period 1990 2013 therefore the calculation of the accident rates has been based on a subset of the initial accident sample additionally due to limitations in the fleet at risk data ro ro ferries and ro ro cargo ships have been aggregated in one category ro ro ships some useful remarks may be made by comparing the frequency of each ship type in the accident sample to the corresponding frequency in the fleet at risk for the same period from 1996 to 2013 fig 18 the reasoning is that if a random accident sample was extracted from the fleet at risk population then it would be expected that the distribution of ship types would be very close to that in the population therefore differences in these distributions might indicate ship types that are more likely to be involved in the accident of interest gas carriers pure car carriers and cruise ships appear almost as frequently in the accident sample as in the fleet at risk this indicates that these ship types are not especially vulnerable to navigational accidents in adverse weather conditions even though they have large wind profile areas and therefore are exposed to greater lateral wind forces general cargo ships appear almost 4 times more frequently in the accident sample 32 than in the fleet at risk 7 and ro ro ships comprise 23 of the accident sample compared to 6 of the fleet at risk ro ro ships include both ro ro ferries and ro ro cargo ships additionally the following ship types appear less frequently in the accident sample compared to the fleet at risk bulk carriers 21 of accidents vs 34 of fleet tankers 9 of accidents vs 22 of fleet and container ships 5 of accidents vs 19 of fleet the calculated accident rates per ship type are between the orders of 10 410 4 container ships pure car carriers gas carriers tankers and bulk carriers and 10 3 10 3 cruise ships ro ro general cargo ships accidents per ship year general cargo ships are the ship type that is involved most frequently in this type of accident 3 58e 03 accidents per ship year while accidents involving tankers are the ones occurring least frequently 1 72e 04 accidents per ship year the increased frequency of accidents involving cruise ships ro ro ships and general cargo ships could be attributed to the fact that these ship types are expected to make port calls more frequently e g compared to tankers which increases their exposure to the hazards that result to the accidents of interest the calculated accident rates per ship type and accident category were compared with the corresponding rates from published fsa studies imo 2010 2008a 2008b 2008c 2007a 2007b 2002 it should be noted that the accident rates in fsa studies table 6 take into account accidents regardless of the prevailing weather conditions while the rates for the accidents of interest table 7 consider accidents that have occurred only in weather conditions that include heavy weather conditions and extreme weather events overall the rates that were calculated for the accident sample order in the range of 10 5 to 10 3 accidents per ship year are at least one order of magnitude lower than the corresponding values from the various fsa studies order in the range of 10 4 to 10 2 accidents per ship year therefore accidents in adverse weather conditions that may have been caused by manoeuvrability issues due to a lack of adequate installed power are a comparatively small proportion of all the accidents investigated in the fsa studies an interesting observation is that for some ship types and accident categories the calculated rates are in the same order of magnitude which implies that the accidents of interest are a significant proportion compared to all the accidents investigated in the fsa studies this is the case for collision accidents involving bulk carriers grounding accidents involving general cargo ships and contact accidents involving ropax vessels the results in tables 8 14 break down the previously calculated accident rates to the corresponding size classes for each ship type accident rates for small bulk carriers and for general cargo ships smaller than 5000 t dwt could not be calculated due to the unavailability of the corresponding fleet at risk data the ship type and size class most frequently 1 56e 02 accidents per ship year involved in the accidents of interest are ro ro ships smaller than 2000 t dwt the smallest relative frequency was calculated for handysize tankers 7 65e 05 accidents per ship year 4 weather conditions the purpose of this analysis is to determine the prevailing wave height and wind speed values during the accidents of interest and compare them to the corresponding limits for adverse weather conditions as defined by the imo 2013 interim guidelines 2013a an initial exploratory analysis of the obtained weather information is shown in fig 19 and fig 20 for wind speed in m s and wave height in m respectively a limitation of this analysis relates to the very small availability and in some cases the validity of the obtained weather related information wave height was available for 133 out of the 277 accidents 48 whereas wind speed for only 130 47 of the cases per ship type the available weather related information ranged from 1 3 to 2 3 of the accidents for example wave height and wind speed information for accidents involving tankers were available for less than 30 of the total cases the maximum values for the availability of the weather information are observed for accidents involving cruise ships ro ro ferries and ro ro cargo ships where wave height was available for an average of 65 and wind speed was available for an average of 56 of the cases incomplete records i e cases with only one of wave height or wind speed information were excluded from the analysis based on the assumption that no significant information would be lost as the frequency distributions of the complete and incomplete weather information records was similar to ensure validity the obtained information was cross referenced where possible with weather information found in published accident reports in some cases the available weather information had much lower wave height and wind speed values compared to those in the corresponding published accident reports since accident reports may be considered a reliable source of weather information it was assumed that the obtained values for wave height and wind speed may in some cases be underestimated compared to the actual weather conditions at this stage it was decided to exclude the accidents that had occurred in extreme weather events in addition it was decided to conduct an outlier analysis of the accidents that had occurred in heavy weather as some extreme wave height and wind speed values were observed and these could potentially be attributed to either erroneous reporting or unusually high values that have an extremely low probability of occurrence the cut off values were derived from the standardized z scores of the 25th 50th and 75th percentiles and equal 7 m for wave height values and 25 m s for wind speed these exclusions are justified as such extreme weather conditions may not be reasonably expected to inform a regulatory process such as defining the minimum required propulsion power in adverse weather conditions after the exclusions an accident subset containing n 110 cases was derived for which the average values for wind speed and wave height are 10 46 m s and 1 61 m respectively the corresponding distribution of wind speed values follows a wide spread bell type function whereas the distribution for wave height is strongly skewed towards smaller values and resemble the character of exponential decay see histograms in fig 21 and fig 22 the correlation between the wind speed x axis and wave height values y axis is shown in fig 23 where the most appropriate fit for the relationship between wind speed and wave height was determined to be the power function a regression analysis of the values resulted in a coefficient of r2 0 75 the distributions of the available weather information for the accident subset n 110 per accident and ship type are shown in fig 24 through fig 27 which are percentile graphs that indicate the full range minimum to maximum of the weather related information and show the dispersion of values the graphs depict 50 of all values within the rectangle which is bounded by the 25th and 75th percentiles and indicate the median of the sample as a line the graphs also include the outlier cut off limits 7 m for wave height and 25 m s for wind speed the average conditions for the accident sample as well as the adverse condition limits as set by the imo in the 2013 interim guidelines about 75 of collision accidents in the accident sample occurred in met ocean conditions close to the average accident conditions 1 61 m for wave height and 10 46 m s for wind speed whereas 75 of contact and grounding accidents occurred in wave heights equal to about 2 5 m and wind speed about 13 5 m s that are greater compared to the average conditions see figs 24 and 25 respectively the observed weather conditions during collision accidents may be attributed to the fact that about 62 of all collision accidents occurred while the ship was within port limits where milder weather conditions may be expected about 44 of all grounding accidents occurred while the ship was en route where weather conditions may be expected to be worse compared to a more sheltered location such as within port limits or restricted waters if we examine contact accidents the fact that they have occurred in worse conditions compared to collision accidents might at first glance seem counter intuitive since 86 of these accidents occurred while the ship was within port limits however considering that contact accidents within port limits mostly involve ro ro ferries 10 of all accidents which despite their increased manoeuvring capabilities they are more vulnerable to higher wind speeds in low speed manoeuvring situations due to their increased wind profile area this result is more reasonable while wave height and wind speed distributions are mostly similar for each accident category grounding accidents appear to have more dispersed values additionally minimum and maximum wave height and wind speed values are approximately equal for all accident categories except for contact accidents that involve some cases that have occurred in larger wave heights as shown in fig 26 about 75 of navigational accidents involving pure car carriers tankers bulk carriers and general cargo ships occurred in wave heights below the average accident conditions 1 61 m even though the medians for these ship types are similar the dispersion for tankers is smaller compared to bulk carriers and general cargo ships all accidents involving gas carriers occurred in wave heights below the average accident conditions and while 50 of the accidents involving cruise ships occurred in similar wave height conditions as gas carriers the corresponding distribution is more dispersed and highly skewed to lower values most of the accidents involving ro ro ferries and ro ro cargo ships over 50 of the accidents occurred in larger wave heights compared to the average accident conditions a comparison between the two distributions shows that while the medians are similar wave height data for ro ro ferries is much more dispersed compared to ro ro cargo ships considering the distribution of wind speed information per ship type as shown in fig 27 they follow generally similar trends with the ones observed for wave height both in terms of data dispersion and median placement in relation to the average accident conditions however about 50 of the accidents involving pure car carriers have occurred in wind speeds greater than the average accident conditions 10 46 m s with values ranging from 10 28 m s up to 20 5 m s which are very close to the definition of adverse conditions by the imo furthermore 75 of accidents involving ro ro ferries and ro ro cargo ships occurred in wind speeds well above the average accident conditions this may be attributed to the relatively small size to installed power ratios that characterize ro ro ferries and ro ro cargo ships which increases the possibility that the installed power will be adequate for safe manoeuvring in adverse weather conditions in addition ro ro ships are usually equipped with auxiliary steering devices such as bow thrusters that provides them with increased manoeuvring capabilities in such environmental conditions it is interesting to examine the prevailing weather conditions at the time of the most frequent as well as the least frequent accidents and the corresponding ship types and size classes that were involved in these accidents see the section on the calculation of the accident rates the prevailing weather conditions were determined by averaging the available weather related information for each ship type and size class it is noted that following the previously described outlier analysis for the weather related information wave heights over 7 m and wind speeds over 25 m s have been excluded from the analysis the ship types that are involved most frequently in the order of 10 3 accidents per ship year in the accidents of interest are cruise ships ro ro ships and general cargo ships as shown in fig 28 the highest values for the average weather conditions wave height about 2 50 m and wind speed about 13 m s were related to accidents involving ro ro ships the lowest accident frequencies order of 10 4 accidents per ship year were calculated for accidents involving container ships pure car carriers gas carriers tankers and bulk carriers the highest values for the average weather conditions wave height about 2 30 m and wind speed about 11 7 m s were related to accidents involving bulk carriers although pure car carrier accidents occurred in relatively small average wave heights about 1 00 m the average wind speed is equal to about 17 m s which is of the highest values recorded fig 29 correlates the prevailing weather conditions with the size classes of the ship types that are most frequently involved in the accidents of interest with the aim to provide additional resolution to the information in fig 28 it is noted that less frequent size classes are omitted from the representation for reasons of graphical clarity ro ro ships have the highest accident frequency fig 28 which is mostly attributed to accidents involving relatively small under 2000 t dwt ships the corresponding weather conditions were average wave height equal to about 3 m and average wind speed equal to about 13 m s which are very close to the average weather conditions for all size classes of this ship type tankers and container ships are the ship types least frequently involved in the accidents of interest fig 28 and the corresponding frequencies are mostly attributed to relatively large ships aframax and panamax class respectively the corresponding weather conditions for aframax tankers were average wave height equal to about 2 6 m and average wind speed equal to about 14 6 m s in addition the corresponding weather conditions for panamax container ships were average wave height equal to about 1 9 m and average wind speed equal to about 11 6 m s 5 conclusions this paper presents a comprehensive statistical analysis of navigational ship accidents i e collision contact and grounding accidents in the presence of severe adverse weather conditions that might be related to manoeuvrability issues due to the lack of adequate powering and or steering for the purposes of this analysis a structured accident database was compiled by using readily available accident related information from multiple sources 71 of the accidents of interest consisted of general cargo ships 31 bulk carriers 21 and ro ro ferries and ro ro cargo ships 19 about 54 of the accident sample consists of grounding and collision contact accidents that occurred while the vessel was within port limits or limited areas in a large portion of these accidents ro ro ferries were involved in collision contact accidents most grounding accidents about 20 of the accident sample involved tankers bulk carriers and general cargo ships that were en route at the time of the accident the analysis generally indicated that smaller cargo ships seem to be more vulnerable to this type of accident bulk carriers involved in the accident of interest are significantly smaller compared to the average size of the corresponding november 2013 fleet in service while container ships gas carriers and tankers are on average 25 smaller however it seems that this is not the case for ro ro ferries and ro ro cargo ships since the accident sample contains relatively larger ships compared to the average size of the november 2013 fleet in service which indicates that there might be a considerable effect on their manoeuvring capabilities in adverse weather conditions due to large wind profile areas overall the accident sample did not involve very large ships for most ship types which could be attributed to the facts that these ships are usually equipped with larger main engines and they usually require tug assistance when approaching a port or when navigating in restricted waters the time series analysis of the accident sample revealed a statistically significant increasing trend approximately during the period from 2005 to 2007 while the years after and up to 2013 seem to mark a decline in the number of adverse weather accidents this trend may correlate very closely to the rapid growth of the maritime industry up to 2008 and the subsequent recession as shown by the temporal trends of the clarksea index which is an indicator of the average earnings for the maritime industry the overall increasing trend in the number of the accidents of interest may be attributed to significant increasing trends for accidents involving container ships bulk carriers general cargo ships ro ro ferries and cruise ships the calculation of the accident rates per ship type show that the ship types most frequently involved in this type of accident are the following 1 cruise and ro ro ships 2 28e 03 and 3 13e 03 accidents per ship year respectively due to their large wind profile areas and frequent port calls and 2 general cargo ships 3 58e 03 accidents per ship year as they usually operate in coastal waters with frequent port calls the least frequent accidents involved tankers 1 72e 04 accidents per ship year in addition from the comparison of the calculated rates with those found in earlier submitted fsa studies we may conclude that even though the accidents of herein interest are only a small proportion of all accidents recorded for most ship types and accident categories it is shown that for collision accidents involving bulk carriers grounding accidents involving general cargo ships and contact accidents involving ropax vessels the accident rates related to bad weather are significant the analysis of the obtained weather related information is limited by issues of data availability and in some cases validity complete records of weather information i e records where information was available for both wave height and wind speed were available for only 110 out of the total 277 cases which amounts about 40 of the accidents of interest the validity of the data was addressed by cross referencing the available wave height and wind speed information where possible with corresponding information from other published accident reports of the same accidents to limit the uncertainties of the conducted study it was decided to exclude cases with incomplete weather records and very extreme abnormal weather conditions as they may distort the outcome of the study for the resulting accident subset n 110 the average wave height was equal to 1 61 m and the average wind speed 10 46 m s collision accidents occurred in relatively milder weather conditions compared to both contact and grounding accidents this may be related to the fact that most collision accidents occurred when the ship was either within port limits or in restricted waters while most grounding accidents occurred when the ship was en route most contact accidents also occurred within port limits and mainly involved ro ro ferries ro ro ships have a relatively large wind profile area that exposes them to greater risks from high winds which limits their ability to manoeuvre in low speed navigation which is a functional need within port limits for this ship type considering the available weather related information for the most frequent accidents the worst recorded average weather conditions were observed in accidents involving ro ro ships 2 50 m wave height and 13 m s wind speed while for the least frequent accidents the worst average weather conditions were present in accidents involving bulk carriers 2 30 m wave height and 12 m s wind speed the imo 2013 interim guidelines determine the limits for adverse weather conditions as a function of ship size regardless of ship type while the limits for significant wave height range from 4 0 m to 5 5 m and the limits for mean wind speed range from 15 7 m s to 19 0 m s imo 2013a this analysis has demonstrated that most navigational accidents in the presence of adverse weather conditions happened at much lower significant wave heights and wind speeds namely in conditions that cannot be defined as adverse while the accidents happened in limited coastal waters obviously the ships experienced manoeuvrability issues that may be related to increased vessel traffic collisions next to insufficient propulsion power and or steering ability at low speed note that as demonstrated by ventikos et al 2018 most of the ships that were involved in the accidents of interest would be compliant with the requirements for the interim guidelines minimum propulsion power in adverse conditions that are stipulated in the energy efficiency related regulations of the imo it should also be noted that the focus of the present analysis is accidents in navigational limited waters whereas the scope of the imo 2013 interim guidelines includes and mainly refers to open sea navigation the weather conditions in the open sea are more likely to be more severe compared to those encountered in coastal and restricted waters the manoeuvrability and safety of the ships in open sea navigation is however an entirely different safety problem which is presently addressed by solas intact stability criteria a clear conclusion is that safe navigation in adverse weather conditions is correlated to a variety of additional factors other than installed propulsion power and therefore further work and research would be required to ensure that the relevant regulatory requirements properly reflect realistic operational conditions and are not problematic in the practice of implementation this may suggest that a redefinition of what is considered adverse weather condition in relation to the particularities of each ship type is necessary in fact several delegations at imo have recently concluded that a simple increase of the severity of the weather conditions specified in the 2013 interim guidelines is presently not warranted nor rational while the currently under revision guidelines imo 2016 should reflect actual ship operation and be based on realistic scenarios and corresponding environmental conditions acknowledgements the

23258,a systematic experimental investigation on the effect of different spacing between an array of oscillating water column owc devices integrated with offshore detached breakwater odbw in terms of their hydrodynamic performance has been studied a froude scale of 1 20 was chosen for integrating five similar devices of owc to the odbw owcbw and a series of experiments was carried out in a shallow wave basin three different centre to centre spacings s i e one two and three times the width of the owc model were considered the hydrodynamic performance was studied in terms of non dimensional lip wall pressure wave amplification factor non dimensional air pressure capture width and relative capture width the owcbw system with thrice the width of the model spacing exhibits a better performance the convergence of water waves in front of the owc devices due to obstruction from rubble mound breakwaters to progressive waves enhances the concentration of energy in front of the array of owc devices it facilitates the system to absorb a larger amount of wave power of about 2 2 times the given input power at natural frequency of the system this confirms that the array of owc devices exhibits better performance than in isolation keywords oscillating water column hydrodynamic performance optimal spacing offshore detached breakwater wave energy 1 introduction overwhelming worldwide awareness to reduce the use of conventional energy sources such as coal nuclear fossil fuels which lead to rise in sea level and climate change necessitates methods to be formulated for attenuation of green gas emission it insists the scientific community to focus on intensive research in developing enhanced renewable energy harnessing methods energy from sea waves is one of the most promising sources of renewable energy which is also environment friendly in the wave energy conversion process an interface device i e a floating body or an oscillating water within a structure is needed to convert the energy in the waves in the form of kinetic and or potential energy brooke 2003 this process is known as the primary conversion process and the device is called as the wave energy converter wec under the secondary conversion process stored energy is converted into a useful form of energy a critical review of the research and development on this topic has been reported by shaw 1982 ross 1995 brooke 2003 falcão 2010 and heath 2012 meticulously examining the sources available harris et al 2004 classifies the wecs based on its working principle as follows point absorber terminator and attenuator based on the fundamental concept during oil crisis date back to late seventies several attempts through experimental numerical analytical and pilot plant stage studies have been made to optimize the different wecs salter 1974 malmo and reitan 1985 henderson 2006 crom et al 2009 vicinanza et al 2013 stratigaki et al 2014 kamath et al 2015 among them terminator type of oscillating water column owc device is considered here the principle of owc device is similar to an air pump due to the up and down oscillation of the water column inside the chamber suction and expulsion of air would occur in the chamber through an air hole power take off pto device that is connected to a turbine in general the concentration of the population in a coastal belt is many times higher than the inner region and the human activities in the coastal zone have amounted to substantial economic proportions in view of industrialization there has been severe beach erosion observed all over the world whenever man made structures are built along the coast the coastal protection structures i e seawall groin offshore detached breakwaters and artificial beach nourishment are considered by coastal engineers for maintaining the stability and sustainability of the coastal zone among the different coastal protection structures offshore detached breakwaters odbw have been proved to be an efficient coastal protection structure which also maintains the aesthetic view of the beach the foremost burden in the advancement of owc wec technology is the financial aspect in comparison with the alternative renewable technologies the construction of a single owc device in the ocean would cost an enormous amount for this reason a multi utilitarian system is potential and more feasible this encompasses the integration of owc devices with odbw for coastal defence systems and with harbour formation sundar et al 2010 the combined owc devices with odbw will minimize the cost of its construction with dual purposes an energy extracting devices and protecting the coast from erosion the mutual benefits of avoiding erosion and harnessing energy could be achieved by analysing the performance of owc devices when it is integrated with breakwaters there have been numerous studies on the hydrodynamic optimization of owc device in isolation subjected to two dimensional waves morris thomas et al 2007 rezanejad et al 2013 wilbert et al 2013 kelly et al 2013 elhanafi et al 2016 ning et al 2016 moving on to three dimensional tests malmo and reitan 1985 initially investigated the wave power absorption by an oscillating water column in a channel using linear wave theory for different boundary conditions in the regions between absorber and channel wall their study laid theoretical foundations for the analysis of wave power stations consisting of an array of such owc units later malmo and reitan 1986a 1986b have compared the performance characteristics of owc device in isolation with that of owc devices placed in a row and reported that owc devices in an array were more effective than in isolation it was inferred by mciver and evans 1988 using the method of matched asymptotic expansions that the constant load damping of the pto mechanism for an array of units was able to achieve high performance over a range of wavelengths further it was noticed that the efficiency for obliquely incident waves reduces due to the reduction in the capture width whittaker and stewart 1993 reported that the maximum power output could increase for owc devices in a row by a scale of two compared to the one in isolation mciver 1994 found that the benefits of constructive interference for wave energy converters in harnessing energy from heaving motion might considerably be reduced by small changes in the incident wave direction through a laboratory model study based on principle of images method on an array of owc devices thiruvenkatasamy and neelamani 1997 found that efficiency of owc device increases up to s w 3 s centre to centre spacing between owc models and w width of the owc model and further increment in s w results in the decrease of efficiency martins rivas and mei 2009a 2009b have studied theoretically the wave power extraction from an owc device at the tip of a breakwater and along a straight coast using method of eigen function expansions and integral equations respectively for a single owc model installed at the tip of a long and thin breakwater it was found that the angle of wave incident affects the wave field present outside the structure but not the extracted power in contrast to this in the owc device installed on a cliff coast it was reported that its performance depends strongly on the angle of wave incidence and the capture length relative capture width was doubled due to coastal reflection torre enciso et al 2009 presented the three dimensional experimental study on the performance evaluation of an array of owc devices integrated with caisson breakwater for the benefit of both harbour formation and energy extraction it was reported that the integration of owc devices into breakwater was feasible in view of economical and energy conversion and that certainly led to construction of the mutriku wave power plant world s first wave energy commercial project in extending the analytical theory of martins rivas and mei 2009a 2009b lovas et al 2010 studied the hydrodynamic performance of a large circular owc device installed at the tip of a coastal corner with two special geometries a convex and a concave corner of right angle they have introduced a simpler strategy of optimization by assuming that the parameter representing the pto device could take two different values in high frequency and low frequency ranges it was reported that the optimal efficiency for the considered case can be comparable to the more ideal strategy where the parameter could be controlled for all frequencies magagna et al 2010 have carried out a physical model study on owc wave pumps and suggested that a limited spacing between the devices show positive effects in its performance and tend to decrease with spacing beyond two times the model dimension sundar et al 2010 presented a comprehensive review on the possible approaches of integrating owc devices with breakwaters for the harbour formation and coastal defence systems the interaction between owc devices and waves is of complex in nature and is more profoundly seen when these devices are arranged in arrays nader et al 2012 investigated the scattered waves around single and multiple owc devices using a finite element model based on linear wave theory it was stated that the power capture efficiency of individual devices was highly influenced by presence of neighbouring owc devices and that the optimal pto damping for an isolated owc might differ from that of an array of devices nader et al 2014 studied the hydrodynamic and energetic performance of a finite array of fixed owc devices it was shown that the position of the owc devices in the array highly influences the inner properties and the interaction between devices so when determining the optimum device parameters the position of the device in an array should be given more importance to increase the power extraction capacity of the system by using linearized potential flow theory konispoliatis and mavrakos 2016 have analysed the hydrodynamic performance of an array of floating owc devices in finite water depth it was observed that the power capture efficiency has been greatly influenced by the coupling between the number of owc devices in the array and their position against the wave front fleming et al 2012 and elhanafi et al 2016 studied experimentally and numerically the effect of underwater geometry on the performance of an offshore oscillating water column device and reported that the hydrodynamic efficiency of the system can be considerably improved by selecting suitable values for both the submergence ratio of asymmetric lips and the lip thickness fleming and macfarlane 2014 considered in situ calibration of an orifice separately for both inflow and outflow leads to more accurate flow rate prediction and consequently better prediction of the power absorbed by the owc device through an experimental study vyzikas et al 2017 examined the performance of owc devices with a pto for energy generation and without a pto as absorbing walls it was found that with the addition of the slope in front of the u owc device the efficiency of the system improved and the run up in front the structure was lesser in comparison with vertical breakwaters the available literature widely pertains to the evaluation of hydrodynamic performance of an array of owc devices setting into a reflecting wall or as a neighbouring devices with lesser clear spacing there arises a need to examine its hydrodynamic performance while being built along with porous structures such as rubble mound breakwaters with dual purposes an energy extracting devices and protecting the coast from erosion ashlin et al 2016 reported the influence of the chamber bottom profile configuration i e flat circular curve slope 1 in 1 and slope 1 in 5 bottom profiles through a comprehensive experimental program it was resolved that the circular curve bottom profile of owc device is more effective in terms of its hydrodynamic performance which has been adopted herein having realized the multiple benefits of serving as coastal protection measure in addition to harnessing the energy from waves an experimental study to optimize the centre to centre spacing between five similar devices of owc while being integrated with odbw was taken up while the experiments were conducted with both normal and oblique wave incidence results from the normal wave incidence tests are reported here similarly the experiments were conducted with both regular and random wave incidence results from the regular wave incidence tests alone are reported in this paper the details of the dimensions of owc models wave characteristics experimental set up experimental procedure results and discussion are reported in this paper 2 experimental campaign 2 1 test facility the present comprehensive experimental study was carried out in the shallow wave basin of 17 m long 15 m wide and 1 m deep in the indian institute of technology madras india the shallow wave basin is equipped with a wave maker operating in piston mode at one end through a servo actuator with a remote control system used to generate waves this is executed through a personal computer connected to the servo activator and another computer is dedicated for data acquisition of the signals from pressure transducers run up meters and wave gauges through an amplifier an artificial beach wave absorber on the other end is provided with a combination of parabolic perforated fibre reinforced polymer frp sheet and rubble mound to absorb the waves the schematic plan view of the shallow wave basin which depicts the position of wave gauges and the test model is shown in fig 1 the locations of the wave gauges wg 1 to wg 5 as discussed in the next section are indicated in the above figure 2 2 test model the test model owcbw consists of two parts the owc models and its integration with odbw views of the model setup from the wave maker end and from the absorber end are projected in fig 2 a and b respectively a closer view of the owc models is shown in fig 2c since the performance of an owc device primarily depends on its geometry the following details in fixing dimensions of owc device were taken from the comprehensive literature survey and results of which have been reported earlier by ashlin et al 2016 each of the owc chamber with dimensions of 283 mm wide w parallel to the wave crest and 180 mm length b along the wave direction was made of 12 mm thick acrylic sheet the total height h of the owc chamber was 540 mm and the water depth d in front of the owc chamber was 300 mm the bottom opening o in the front lip wall was 180 mm it is found that the natural frequency of the system was around d l 0 131 l is wave length the pto damping on the owc chamber was represented by an air hole of optimised a a i e 0 68 a is an air vent area and a is water plane area of owc chamber the dimensional details of the owc model from front and plan views as well as cross sectional elevation are shown in fig 3 the owc models were positioned at 10 5 m from the wave maker in order to ensure rigidity of an owc device it was fixed to a flat mild steel plate which in turn was fixed rigidly to the basin floor the flat mild steel plate on the leeside of the owc device was surrounded by the rubble mound which was an integrated part of the rubble mound breakwater this also ensured the linkage between an owc device and the breakwater the rubble mound breakwaters were designed as per the formula of hudson 1959 the distance between the shoreline and odbw a was fixed as 3 5 m to have minimum distance of about one maximum wave length employed in the tests the length of the central breakwater c and the spacing between odbw b with reference to still water level swl based upon the following literature dally and pope 1986 pope and dean 1986 seiji et al 1987 and suh and dalrymple 1987 were taken as 5 m and 2 5 m respectively in order to provide the direct penetration of the waves into the owc system and to avoid sliding of rubble materials from the integrated breakwater entrance guiding walls on its adjacent sides were provided with the length l equal to the length of the owc device b to achieve maximum performance malmo and reitan 1986a 1986b the cross sectional view of the owcbw system and its dimensional details are shown in fig 4 2 3 instrumentation two number of resistance type wave gauges wg 1 and wg 2 one at 3 7 m one wave length from the wave maker η 1 t and the another at 6 5 m from the owc model η 2 t measured the composite wave elevation which were used to decompose them into incident and reflected components as per the method of goda and suzuki 1976 there were five similar type of owc models integrated with the breakwater owc1 owc5 among which the first three models alone were housed with pressure transducers and run up meters based on the conclusion of evans 1979 throughout this study it was assumed that the hydrodynamic behaviour of owcbw system was symmetric about the mid point of the array there were two pressure transducers with a measuring range of 0 2 bar one in the front wall at mouth of the owc chamber facing the waves p fout t and the other towards the inner side p fin t used to register the respective pressure time histories in the central owc device owc3 in the owcbw system the air pressure variation due to rise and fall of free surface water inside the chamber for first three owc models was measured with a pressure sensor fixed on its top p air i t each of the three instrumented models was fixed with a run up gauge inside its chamber at the back wall to register the run up r u i t herein i denotes the respective owc devices number in which the measurement was taken up the measured differential air pressure and chamber free surface elevation were adopted to calculate the efficiency of the system the central unit alone was fixed with an additional run up gauges on the leeside r ub t and seaside r uf t of the lip wall this was felt necessary to understand the sloshing inside the chamber as well as the phase difference between the wave elevation at the inside and the outside of the chamber to understand the diffraction pattern around the owcbw system three wave gauges wg 3 wg 5 were placed in between the beach and the structure to evaluate the phase difference between incident waves to the water oscillation inside the chamber videos were taken close to the owc system from the front and side view in total 15 signatures from five pressure transducers five run up meters two wave gauges in front of the model and three wave gauges around the breakwater were acquired with a sampling interval of 0 01 s simultaneously the analysis for the measurements was carefully executed in the initial smaller window of steady state region i e the time series window without start up time and reflection a brief uncertainty analysis of different hydrodynamic parameters considered in the present experimental study was given in appendix a the regular tests covered a wave frequency range of 0 47 hz 1 11 hz wave steepness h l of 0 0065 0 0638 and relative water depth d l in the range of 0 08 0 26 in this paper the effect of wave steepness h l relative water depth d l and non dimensional spacing ks k 2π l on the non dimensional front wall outside pressure wave amplification factor air pressure capture width and relative capture width measured in the owc model subjected to normal wave incidence has been investigated 3 hydrodynamic parameters the different hydrodynamic parameters that were considered to evaluate hydrodynamic performance of the structure are as discussed below for a three dimensional model study on an array of owc devices the fundamental quantity employed to evaluate its performance is the capture width cw it considers the overall power absorbed by an owc device for regular waves this is defined to be the ratio between the total mean pneumatic output power produced by an owc device to the mean power offered by a unit crest wave width of the incident wave cruz 2008 wherein mean refers to the average power per wave period as follows 1 c a p t u r e width i cw i p o u t i p w herein i denotes the respective owc devices number in which the capture width measurement was taken up the time average incident wave power p w as a function of wave height h wave period t and water depth d is given as 2 p w ρ g h 2 8 c 2 1 2 k d sinh 2 k d where ρ is the mass density of fluid g is the gravitational acceleration c l t due to rise and fall of water inside the owc chamber the pneumatic output power p out i is developed it is calculated by integration of instantaneous free surface oscillation inside the chamber moving with a velocity v w i under the air pressure p air i as follows lópez et al 2015 3 p out i 1 t t t t p air i av w i dt herein v w i is the first derivative of the third order approximation to the free surface elevation inside the respective owc chambers calculated by the expression of lópez et al 2015 4 v w i 2 z j 1 3 z j 6 z j 1 z

uf and p air 3 reduces for low period waves away from natural frequency of the system as a major portion of the energy incident on the lip wall gets reflected leading to lesser energy into the chamber 4 1 effect of wave characteristics based on the theoretical investigation of malmo and reitan 1986b on a finite row of owc devices the average chamber free surface amplification and pressure ratio increases with the number of owc units in an array an array of owc devices with five devices exhibited better performance than the infinite number of devices in the present experimental study owc devices were integrated with the layout of detached breakwaters and the functional requirement of length of the breakwater limited the maximum number of owc devices up to five for the purpose of its integration with odbw for systems of more than a single device an appropriate spacing must be chosen on the basis of average performance of an array of devices cruz 2008 in order to understand the effect of spacing between owc units on the average hydrodynamic performance of an array of owc devices three different spacing s i e one two and three times the width of the owc model were considered when the spacing equals the width of the owc device the array of owc units positioned together in an owcbw system would act as a partially absorbing vertical wall type structure for incoming waves for other cases the owcbw system will act as a porous structure in dissipating diffracted waves around the owc devices this phenomenon has been confirmed based on the reflection coefficient as discussed later under section 4 6 the influence of wave characteristics on the average performance of the owcbw system for different spacing has been evaluated by exposing to tests of wave heights from 0 03 m to 0 09 m with different wave steepness 4 1 1 wave length in order to assess the effect of wave length on the average hydrodynamic performance of an array of owc devices for different spacing the regular wave experiments are carried out the wave height h was 0 03 m the variation in non dimensional front wall outside pressure pr fout average wave amplification factor β average non dimensional air pressure pr air average capture width cw and average relative capture width rcw with d l for different spacing is shown in fig 6 the hydrodynamic parameters β pr air cw and rcw are discussed here in terms of average of the first three owc devices owc1 to owc3 pr fout is presented for the mid owc chamber pr fout increases up to d l 0 104 beyond which it decreases with wave length increase in d l the tests are carried out in a constant water depth for all the three spacings s since the orbital motion under the wave decreases with wave length and exerts lesser pressure near the mouth of the chamber since the orbital motion under high frequency waves is less the lip wall prevents the wave energy to enter the owc device chamber and increases the reflected energy around d l 0 128 natural frequency of the system there observed to be a large pr fout due to lesser reflection coefficient which increases with decrease in wave length as this can be seen in the later section 4 6 due to higher reflection coefficient at high frequency waves that increases the reflected energy and exerts lesser pressure near the mouth of the chamber the higher value of pr fout around natural frequency of the system indicates the possibility of more energy being transmitted past the lip wall into the chamber among the three spacings tested the maximum pr fout was found to be 2 12 for s w 1 it is higher than the value observed from the similar two dimensional 2d model tests ashlin et al 2016 in which the maximum pr fout was observed to be 1 3 under regular and random wave incidences it is believed that due to higher reflection from the owcbw system as well as convergence of water waves the energy concentration in front of the device is high and absorbs more power from the total incident wave front greater than the width of the device which in fact tends to increase pr fout up to a maximum of about 2 12 i e more than the value for a fully reflected wave condition in front of a structure the influence of d l and s on the free surface amplification β inside the owc chamber is shown in fig 6b the energy conversion in the device occurs due to the wave oscillation inside the chamber and is determined by the hydrodynamics of the system however the effect of radiated flow around the device also influences the energy conversion the maximum β is about 2 8 times the incident wave height for s w 3 for d l up to about 0 16 beyond which the factor reduces to about 0 75 pr fout and β for s w 1 are 2 12 and 0 8 respectively thus the wave amplification factor is high around natural frequency of the system and increased spacing the dynamic air pressure inside the chamber at natural frequency of the system d l 0 128 is almost equal to that of the dynamic pressure available outside the chamber pr fout for s w 3 further pr air is found to be maximum at d l 0 128 natural frequency of the system and reduces on either side the variation of cw and rcw with d l for different spacing is presented in fig 6d the efficiency in the case of 2d tests is similar to rcw wherein the energy incident over the entire width of the owc device is taken into account however in the case of 3d tests to accommodate the diffraction phenomena the term capture width cw is introduced the capture width is not dimensionless and thereby it is scale dependent however the concept of cw is meaningful price et al 2009 in the sense that it represents the length of unit wave front that contains the absorbed power for spacing equals to thrice the width of the owc model the cw is observed to be a maximum to an extent of about 0 6 near the natural period of the system d l 0 128 and decreases on its either side the physical processes causing the reduction in capture width on either side of the natural period of the device are explained by quantitative analysis of the phase difference between the variations in the hydrodynamic parameters β 3 and pr air 3 the phase difference between these parameters for the different d l as a function of t t is given in table 1 the phase difference between β 3 and pr air 3 is found to be almost 2700 with the least at d l 0 128 corresponding to the natural frequency of the system on either side of the above stated d l since the phase difference is found to be higher the cw is found less in spite of β being higher similar observation has been discussed earlier by kamath et al 2015 the percentage of decrease in cw for s w 1 and s w 2 compared to that for s w 3 is found to be in the range of 11 59 and 8 43 respectively the non dimensional parameter rcw can possess values greater than unity when owc devices are placed in an array the devices capture maximum power to an extent of about 2 2 times the given input power at the natural frequency of the system this confirms that the owc device could absorb more power when placed in an array than in an isolation due to energy concentration rcw is found to decrease with spacing between owc units in general the key hydrodynamic parameters pr fout β pr air cw and rcw increase with wave length until natural frequency of the system and the spacing between the owc units 4 1 2 wave height the performance of the owc device is highly influenced by wave period followed by wave height lópez et al 2014 the effect of wave height on the average performance of the owcbw system has been examined fig 7 a d shows the variation of pr fout β pr air cw and rcw for h 0 09 m respectively it is observed that pr fout is higher than that measured for h 0 03 m for any d l an increase in h leads to an increase in the wave steepness it would induce higher pressures on the lip wall the trend in the variation of β pr air cw and rcw with d l for the three s tested is found to exhibit a similar trend as that seen for h 0 03 m however the values of these four parameters for h 0 09 m are found to be lesser than that obtained for h 0 03 m when the steeper waves pass into the chamber the energy dissipation at the tip of the lip wall due to turbulence vortex shedding radial flow of wave etc is higher than the low steepness waves and leads to higher energy loss kamath et al 2015 this phenomenon decreases the water surface oscillation and thus air pressure inside the chamber for a higher wave 4 1 3 wave steepness the effect of wave steepness h l on the average performance characteristics through the parameters pr fout β pr air cw and rcw for finer ranges of h l 0 0065 0 0155 0 0201 to 0 0278 0 0302 to 0 0434 and 0 0597 to 0 0638 is reported in fig 8 s w of 3 was considered the increase in wave steepness induces more pressure on the front side of the lip wall however β pr air and rcw are found to decrease with an increase in h l due to energy loss when the wave passes into the chamber past the lip wall further it is to be mentioned that the same model when it was subjected to two dimensional waves ashlin et al 2016 exhibited the similar kind of hydrodynamic variation for different wave steepness regime i e the hydrodynamic efficiency of the system decreases with an increase in wave steepness the results clearly indicate that hydrodynamic performance characteristics of owc device is better when exposed to the action of waves of lesser steepness than steeper waves overall the average performance of the first three respective owc devices in an array is found to be higher for thrice the width of the model spacing than the other spacings considered in this study it is due to that owc devices in an array where positioned together acting as a vertical wall type structure that contributes higher reflection and combination of both diffracted and radiated waves when the incident wave is acting on the structure the reflected radiated and diffracted waves cancel incident waves and reduces the input power to the system cruz 2008 but for twice and thrice the width of the model spacing integrated with odbw the reflection from owc devices decreases and the combination of both diffracted and radiated waves are dissipated through the rubble materials in between the individual owc units this certainly reduces the cancellation of waves and so increases the concentration of energy due to convergence of water waves in front of the owc model and further increases the performance of the owcbw system 4 2 effect of wave interaction between devices the average hydrodynamic performance of the owcbw system for different spacing between devices has been presented in the previous section it is further important to understand how the individual owc units in an array perform due to interaction effect when subjected to wave action in order to assess the variability in energy conversion within the system the hydrodynamic parameters β i pr air i and rcw i as a function of d l are presented in fig 9 for different spacing herein i denotes the respective owc devices in which the measurement was taken up similar to the earlier observation the hydrodynamic parameters β i pr air i and rcw i are found to increase with the spacing as well as wave length for all the three models it is also observed that the array with s w 3 exhibits the maximum efficiency for s w 1 the hydrodynamic parameters β i pr air i and rcw i of the first three respective owc models are found to decrease from the leading edge owc1 towards the central owc chamber owc3 the reduction in the wave amplification factor at the natural frequency of the system d l 0 128 for owc2 and owc3 devices with the base reference of owc1 device is 5 and 21 respectively it can be clearly seen in the video 1 taken from the front view of the owcbw system that the owc model placed on the leading edge subjected to higher wave amplification inside of its chamber than the other models as we could see from video 1 the leading edge model in spacing configuration of s w 1 surrounded on its one side by rubble materials and that decreases the reflection from the system this certainly increases the wave power input to the system and highly push and pull the water mass inside the owc model in leading edge of the owcbw system than the other models for owcbw system with s w 2 the efficiency of the individual owc device for d l 0 12 is found to be a maximum for owc1 device and the least for owc2 device for d l 0 12 owc1 device is found to exhibit the least efficiency the owcbw system with s w 3 for d l 0 12 the performance characteristics is found to be similar to that seen for s w 2 however for d l 0 12 a clear trend on the effect of position of the owc device is not observed supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2018 05 043 the following are the supplementary data related to this article video 1front view of the owcbw system for s w 1 1 4 3 effect of spacing further the effect of non dimensional spacing ks on the average hydrodynamic performance of the owcbw system subjected to regular waves for their direct field applications is examined in order to understand the variation of the rcw as a function of their respective non dimensional spacings is projected in fig 10 to avoid the influence of wave frequency on rcw the above said figure is depicted in terms of different discrete representation of d l as discussed earlier due to the limitation in length of odbw to serve as coastal protection purpose the rcw is given for ks in the range 0 5 ks 4 56 in the above figures the lower limit of ks corresponds to the case wherein the owc models are positioned together and the upper limit of ks corresponds to the case wherein the owc units are positioned with centre to centre spacing being thrice the width of the owc device the trend in variation of the hydrodynamic parameter rcw is found to increase with an increase in non dimensional spacing attaining a maximum value at ks 2 27 which corresponds to the natural frequency of the system d l 0 128 for d l 0 128 the minimum value of rcw occurs at ks 0 75 for the range of ks used amid the constraints in spacing the maximum and minimum values of hydrodynamic parameters correspond to the resonant frequency of the system that occurs at 1 52 times of ks apart which is similar to the results observed in theoretical investigation of thomas and evans 1981 from the above discussions we can conclude that the optimal spacing between the owc units for the present model setup is ks 2 27 herein the term wave length in k corresponds to the predominant wave length prevail in the coast considered for integrating owc models with odbw the optimal spacing may vary for the long breakwater than the one considered in this study and can be studied separately consequently the key geometric parameters of the owc device can be fixed based on the same predominant wave length as discussed in detail in authors previous work ashlin et al 2016 4 4 array performance the hydrodynamic performance of an array of owc devices in the owcbw system is investigated hereby normalizing the sum of cw of five devices with its array occupying space as given below 6 array rcw c w 3 2 c w 1 c w 2 5 w 4 s the variation in array rcw as a function of d l for three different spacing configurations is shown in fig 11 from the results it is observed that unlike as seen in the earlier results of rcw which is always found to be high for s w 3 throughout the d l regime the array rcw is measured to be high for s w 1 corresponds to d l greater than 0 16 the change in trend is mainly due to the uneven normalization because of different end to end array occupancy width by owc devices the array rcw for s w 3 despite being normalized by the value of 90 more than that of s w 1 the quantity difference between them is only about 50 70 but with increase in d l the trend in variation of array rcw is reversed and found to be high for the spacing configuration of s w 3 of about 15 30 more in comparison with other spacing configurations this explains overall the array configuration with s w 3 exhibits better performance throughout the d l regime considered in this study further in the next section the hypothetical situation of owc models occupying constant end to end width in owcbw system for all the three spacing configurations and its performance has been studied 4 5 total performance vs average performance till now the discussion focussed on keeping five number of owc devices while integrating with odbw for the different centre to centre spacing the average performance of the owcbw system the model setup with thrice the width of the model spacing was found to exhibit a better efficiency than the other spacings considered in this study the model occupying space between extreme ends is not the same for all the three model setups herein an attempt is made to analyse the relationship between the total efficiency of the system with an average efficiency of the system for a constant model occupying space by doing so the model setup with s w 1 s w 2 and s w 3 will occupy 13 7 and 5 number of power absorbing devices respectively to fill up the excess spaces beyond the ends of extreme owc device the schematic plan view of the non equal and equal end to end space occupancy by owc devices in the central owcbw system for different spacing configurations is shown in fig 12 a and b respectively it is assumed that the average rcw calculated from five devices integrated with odbw is multiplied with a total number of devices to obtain the total rcw for the respective spacings the relation between total rcw and rcw corresponds to a number of devices for a constant h of 0 03 m is shown in fig 13 herein the total rcw and rcw values are represented by symbols of circles and triangles respectively in general the parameters total rcw and rcw are directly and inversely proportional to the number of devices respectively the rcw is seen to decrease with an increase in the number of devices throughout the d l considered in this study similar to the above observations the total rcw is found to be increasing with an increase in the number of devices for d l 0 15 the difference between the total rcw while using five and 13 number of power absorbing devices is only about 20 and for d l 0 16 the difference between them is found to be the large of about 100 though the increase in the number of devices shows a better performance in harnessing total rcw compared to the lesser number of devices in a constantly occupied spacing it indirectly concludes the ineffectiveness of individual devices in harnessing energy from waves consequently the wave power absorption by the individual unit is fewer leads to higher wave force and scour on and around the structure respectively with increased maintenance by considering the total cost of building many devices and less difference only in harnessing total rcw for a lesser number of devices compared to the large number of devices lead us to prefer the model with thrice the width of the model spacing is better for the considered dual purpose system 4 6 reflection nature of owcbw system the performance of the coastal protection system is characterized by its reflective property howe and nader 2017 martins rivas and mei 2009a and is herein presented the percentage of wave reflection from owcbw system is determined by the wave reflection coefficient k r the k r is defined as the ratio between reflected wave height h r and incident wave height h i the composite wave elevations from η 1 t and η 2 t have been decomposed into reflected and incident components as per the method of goda and suzuki 1976 the variation of k r as a function of d l for different spacing is depicted in fig 14 from the results it is seen that k r is maximum for the owcbw system with a spacing s w 1 followed by s w 2 and s w 3 the k r is found to decrease up to d l 0 128 beyond which it increases with a decrease in the wave length for all the three spacings stated above the reason for the lowest k r at d l 0 128 resonant frequency of the system is high wave power absorption which maximizes the efficiency for long period waves the k r slightly increases compared to short period waves since in general the reflection due to low frequency waves is higher than that of the high frequency waves the higher order of k r under s w 1 is due to the reflective nature of the owcbw system since at the owcbw system with s w 1 the owc units are positioned together and acting as a partially absorbing vertical wall type structure that induces more reflection with an increase in s w the owcbw system act as a porous structure dissipating the incident wave energy by rubble materials consequently the reflection due to the owcbw system decreases and increases the performance of the individual owc device a lower k r indicates a large amount of wave power absorption 5 conclusions the performance evaluation of different spacing between an array of owc devices integrated with offshore detached breakwater subjected to regular wave field has been assessed through a well controlled comprehensive experimental program the effect of wave steepness h l relative water depth d l and non dimensional spacing ks on the non dimensional front wall outside pressure wave amplification factor air pressure capture width and relative capture width measured in the owc model subjected to normal wave incidence has been investigated the following are the conclusions drawn from the study the induced pressure on the seaside of the lip wall pr fout average wave amplification factor β average air pressure inside the chamber pr air average capture width cw and average relative capture width rcw are found to increase with an increase in wave length up to the natural frequency of the system d l 0 128 beyond which it decreases the hydrodynamic performance of the system decreases with an increase in wave height the owc device shows better performance for low steepness waves than the high steepness waves overall the average performance of the first three respective owc devices in an array is found to be higher for thrice the width of the model spacing than the other spacings considered in this study the trend in variation of the hydrodynamic parameter rcw is found to increase with an increase in non dimensional spacing attaining a maximum value at ks 2 27 which corresponds to the natural frequency of the system d l 0 128 the total rcw and rcw are directly and inversely proportional to the number of devices respectively the total rcw and rcw are increases and decreases with an increase in a number of devices respectively the phase difference between β 3 and pr air 3 is found to be almost 2700 with the least at d l 0 128 i e at the resonant period of the device the convergence of water waves due to three dimensional effects leads to concentration of wave energy in front of the array of owc chambers and increases the absorbed power to a maximum of 2 2 times the incident wave power this confirms that the owc system could absorb more power when placing in an array of devices than the isolated device due to energy concentration the natural frequency of the system is observed to be unaltered with the change in spacing between individual owc models the reflection nature of the owcbw system found to be high for s w 1 and decreases with an increase in spacing between owc models at the natural frequency of the system the reflection coefficient found to be the least for all the three spacing configurations because of high wave power absorption and less energy loss the performance analysis of owc devices integrated with porous structure i e offshore detached breakwater is investigated uniquely in the present study as the interaction between waves and owcbw system is of complex and large scale in nature the present experimental study which quantifies the performance of owcbw in terms of energy conversion and coastal protection is essential the present experimental study also can provide experimental data for validating numerical models the study has been conducted with only five numbers of owc devices that integrated with an offshore breakwater the optimal non dimensional spacing concluded in the present study is applicable only to the present model setup and has not been generalized it may vary for the long breakwater than the one considered in this study and can be studied separately the effect of incident wave direction on the performance of the owcbw system will be studied further the change in functional ability of breakwaters with and without owc devices can be considered for future works the study of owcbw systems with the moving bed model can be used to ascertain the scour around the integrated owc models and sediment movement around the owcbw system are also suggested for future works acknowledgement this research was funded by norwegian research council

23258,a systematic experimental investigation on the effect of different spacing between an array of oscillating water column owc devices integrated with offshore detached breakwater odbw in terms of their hydrodynamic performance has been studied a froude scale of 1 20 was chosen for integrating five similar devices of owc to the odbw owcbw and a series of experiments was carried out in a shallow wave basin three different centre to centre spacings s i e one two and three times the width of the owc model were considered the hydrodynamic performance was studied in terms of non dimensional lip wall pressure wave amplification factor non dimensional air pressure capture width and relative capture width the owcbw system with thrice the width of the model spacing exhibits a better performance the convergence of water waves in front of the owc devices due to obstruction from rubble mound breakwaters to progressive waves enhances the concentration of energy in front of the array of owc devices it facilitates the system to absorb a larger amount of wave power of about 2 2 times the given input power at natural frequency of the system this confirms that the array of owc devices exhibits better performance than in isolation keywords oscillating water column hydrodynamic performance optimal spacing offshore detached breakwater wave energy 1 introduction overwhelming worldwide awareness to reduce the use of conventional energy sources such as coal nuclear fossil fuels which lead to rise in sea level and climate change necessitates methods to be formulated for attenuation of green gas emission it insists the scientific community to focus on intensive research in developing enhanced renewable energy harnessing methods energy from sea waves is one of the most promising sources of renewable energy which is also environment friendly in the wave energy conversion process an interface device i e a floating body or an oscillating water within a structure is needed to convert the energy in the waves in the form of kinetic and or potential energy brooke 2003 this process is known as the primary conversion process and the device is called as the wave energy converter wec under the secondary conversion process stored energy is converted into a useful form of energy a critical review of the research and development on this topic has been reported by shaw 1982 ross 1995 brooke 2003 falcão 2010 and heath 2012 meticulously examining the sources available harris et al 2004 classifies the wecs based on its working principle as follows point absorber terminator and attenuator based on the fundamental concept during oil crisis date back to late seventies several attempts through experimental numerical analytical and pilot plant stage studies have been made to optimize the different wecs salter 1974 malmo and reitan 1985 henderson 2006 crom et al 2009 vicinanza et al 2013 stratigaki et al 2014 kamath et al 2015 among them terminator type of oscillating water column owc device is considered here the principle of owc device is similar to an air pump due to the up and down oscillation of the water column inside the chamber suction and expulsion of air would occur in the chamber through an air hole power take off pto device that is connected to a turbine in general the concentration of the population in a coastal belt is many times higher than the inner region and the human activities in the coastal zone have amounted to substantial economic proportions in view of industrialization there has been severe beach erosion observed all over the world whenever man made structures are built along the coast the coastal protection structures i e seawall groin offshore detached breakwaters and artificial beach nourishment are considered by coastal engineers for maintaining the stability and sustainability of the coastal zone among the different coastal protection structures offshore detached breakwaters odbw have been proved to be an efficient coastal protection structure which also maintains the aesthetic view of the beach the foremost burden in the advancement of owc wec technology is the financial aspect in comparison with the alternative renewable technologies the construction of a single owc device in the ocean would cost an enormous amount for this reason a multi utilitarian system is potential and more feasible this encompasses the integration of owc devices with odbw for coastal defence systems and with harbour formation sundar et al 2010 the combined owc devices with odbw will minimize the cost of its construction with dual purposes an energy extracting devices and protecting the coast from erosion the mutual benefits of avoiding erosion and harnessing energy could be achieved by analysing the performance of owc devices when it is integrated with breakwaters there have been numerous studies on the hydrodynamic optimization of owc device in isolation subjected to two dimensional waves morris thomas et al 2007 rezanejad et al 2013 wilbert et al 2013 kelly et al 2013 elhanafi et al 2016 ning et al 2016 moving on to three dimensional tests malmo and reitan 1985 initially investigated the wave power absorption by an oscillating water column in a channel using linear wave theory for different boundary conditions in the regions between absorber and channel wall their study laid theoretical foundations for the analysis of wave power stations consisting of an array of such owc units later malmo and reitan 1986a 1986b have compared the performance characteristics of owc device in isolation with that of owc devices placed in a row and reported that owc devices in an array were more effective than in isolation it was inferred by mciver and evans 1988 using the method of matched asymptotic expansions that the constant load damping of the pto mechanism for an array of units was able to achieve high performance over a range of wavelengths further it was noticed that the efficiency for obliquely incident waves reduces due to the reduction in the capture width whittaker and stewart 1993 reported that the maximum power output could increase for owc devices in a row by a scale of two compared to the one in isolation mciver 1994 found that the benefits of constructive interference for wave energy converters in harnessing energy from heaving motion might considerably be reduced by small changes in the incident wave direction through a laboratory model study based on principle of images method on an array of owc devices thiruvenkatasamy and neelamani 1997 found that efficiency of owc device increases up to s w 3 s centre to centre spacing between owc models and w width of the owc model and further increment in s w results in the decrease of efficiency martins rivas and mei 2009a 2009b have studied theoretically the wave power extraction from an owc device at the tip of a breakwater and along a straight coast using method of eigen function expansions and integral equations respectively for a single owc model installed at the tip of a long and thin breakwater it was found that the angle of wave incident affects the wave field present outside the structure but not the extracted power in contrast to this in the owc device installed on a cliff coast it was reported that its performance depends strongly on the angle of wave incidence and the capture length relative capture width was doubled due to coastal reflection torre enciso et al 2009 presented the three dimensional experimental study on the performance evaluation of an array of owc devices integrated with caisson breakwater for the benefit of both harbour formation and energy extraction it was reported that the integration of owc devices into breakwater was feasible in view of economical and energy conversion and that certainly led to construction of the mutriku wave power plant world s first wave energy commercial project in extending the analytical theory of martins rivas and mei 2009a 2009b lovas et al 2010 studied the hydrodynamic performance of a large circular owc device installed at the tip of a coastal corner with two special geometries a convex and a concave corner of right angle they have introduced a simpler strategy of optimization by assuming that the parameter representing the pto device could take two different values in high frequency and low frequency ranges it was reported that the optimal efficiency for the considered case can be comparable to the more ideal strategy where the parameter could be controlled for all frequencies magagna et al 2010 have carried out a physical model study on owc wave pumps and suggested that a limited spacing between the devices show positive effects in its performance and tend to decrease with spacing beyond two times the model dimension sundar et al 2010 presented a comprehensive review on the possible approaches of integrating owc devices with breakwaters for the harbour formation and coastal defence systems the interaction between owc devices and waves is of complex in nature and is more profoundly seen when these devices are arranged in arrays nader et al 2012 investigated the scattered waves around single and multiple owc devices using a finite element model based on linear wave theory it was stated that the power capture efficiency of individual devices was highly influenced by presence of neighbouring owc devices and that the optimal pto damping for an isolated owc might differ from that of an array of devices nader et al 2014 studied the hydrodynamic and energetic performance of a finite array of fixed owc devices it was shown that the position of the owc devices in the array highly influences the inner properties and the interaction between devices so when determining the optimum device parameters the position of the device in an array should be given more importance to increase the power extraction capacity of the system by using linearized potential flow theory konispoliatis and mavrakos 2016 have analysed the hydrodynamic performance of an array of floating owc devices in finite water depth it was observed that the power capture efficiency has been greatly influenced by the coupling between the number of owc devices in the array and their position against the wave front fleming et al 2012 and elhanafi et al 2016 studied experimentally and numerically the effect of underwater geometry on the performance of an offshore oscillating water column device and reported that the hydrodynamic efficiency of the system can be considerably improved by selecting suitable values for both the submergence ratio of asymmetric lips and the lip thickness fleming and macfarlane 2014 considered in situ calibration of an orifice separately for both inflow and outflow leads to more accurate flow rate prediction and consequently better prediction of the power absorbed by the owc device through an experimental study vyzikas et al 2017 examined the performance of owc devices with a pto for energy generation and without a pto as absorbing walls it was found that with the addition of the slope in front of the u owc device the efficiency of the system improved and the run up in front the structure was lesser in comparison with vertical breakwaters the available literature widely pertains to the evaluation of hydrodynamic performance of an array of owc devices setting into a reflecting wall or as a neighbouring devices with lesser clear spacing there arises a need to examine its hydrodynamic performance while being built along with porous structures such as rubble mound breakwaters with dual purposes an energy extracting devices and protecting the coast from erosion ashlin et al 2016 reported the influence of the chamber bottom profile configuration i e flat circular curve slope 1 in 1 and slope 1 in 5 bottom profiles through a comprehensive experimental program it was resolved that the circular curve bottom profile of owc device is more effective in terms of its hydrodynamic performance which has been adopted herein having realized the multiple benefits of serving as coastal protection measure in addition to harnessing the energy from waves an experimental study to optimize the centre to centre spacing between five similar devices of owc while being integrated with odbw was taken up while the experiments were conducted with both normal and oblique wave incidence results from the normal wave incidence tests are reported here similarly the experiments were conducted with both regular and random wave incidence results from the regular wave incidence tests alone are reported in this paper the details of the dimensions of owc models wave characteristics experimental set up experimental procedure results and discussion are reported in this paper 2 experimental campaign 2 1 test facility the present comprehensive experimental study was carried out in the shallow wave basin of 17 m long 15 m wide and 1 m deep in the indian institute of technology madras india the shallow wave basin is equipped with a wave maker operating in piston mode at one end through a servo actuator with a remote control system used to generate waves this is executed through a personal computer connected to the servo activator and another computer is dedicated for data acquisition of the signals from pressure transducers run up meters and wave gauges through an amplifier an artificial beach wave absorber on the other end is provided with a combination of parabolic perforated fibre reinforced polymer frp sheet and rubble mound to absorb the waves the schematic plan view of the shallow wave basin which depicts the position of wave gauges and the test model is shown in fig 1 the locations of the wave gauges wg 1 to wg 5 as discussed in the next section are indicated in the above figure 2 2 test model the test model owcbw consists of two parts the owc models and its integration with odbw views of the model setup from the wave maker end and from the absorber end are projected in fig 2 a and b respectively a closer view of the owc models is shown in fig 2c since the performance of an owc device primarily depends on its geometry the following details in fixing dimensions of owc device were taken from the comprehensive literature survey and results of which have been reported earlier by ashlin et al 2016 each of the owc chamber with dimensions of 283 mm wide w parallel to the wave crest and 180 mm length b along the wave direction was made of 12 mm thick acrylic sheet the total height h of the owc chamber was 540 mm and the water depth d in front of the owc chamber was 300 mm the bottom opening o in the front lip wall was 180 mm it is found that the natural frequency of the system was around d l 0 131 l is wave length the pto damping on the owc chamber was represented by an air hole of optimised a a i e 0 68 a is an air vent area and a is water plane area of owc chamber the dimensional details of the owc model from front and plan views as well as cross sectional elevation are shown in fig 3 the owc models were positioned at 10 5 m from the wave maker in order to ensure rigidity of an owc device it was fixed to a flat mild steel plate which in turn was fixed rigidly to the basin floor the flat mild steel plate on the leeside of the owc device was surrounded by the rubble mound which was an integrated part of the rubble mound breakwater this also ensured the linkage between an owc device and the breakwater the rubble mound breakwaters were designed as per the formula of hudson 1959 the distance between the shoreline and odbw a was fixed as 3 5 m to have minimum distance of about one maximum wave length employed in the tests the length of the central breakwater c and the spacing between odbw b with reference to still water level swl based upon the following literature dally and pope 1986 pope and dean 1986 seiji et al 1987 and suh and dalrymple 1987 were taken as 5 m and 2 5 m respectively in order to provide the direct penetration of the waves into the owc system and to avoid sliding of rubble materials from the integrated breakwater entrance guiding walls on its adjacent sides were provided with the length l equal to the length of the owc device b to achieve maximum performance malmo and reitan 1986a 1986b the cross sectional view of the owcbw system and its dimensional details are shown in fig 4 2 3 instrumentation two number of resistance type wave gauges wg 1 and wg 2 one at 3 7 m one wave length from the wave maker η 1 t and the another at 6 5 m from the owc model η 2 t measured the composite wave elevation which were used to decompose them into incident and reflected components as per the method of goda and suzuki 1976 there were five similar type of owc models integrated with the breakwater owc1 owc5 among which the first three models alone were housed with pressure transducers and run up meters based on the conclusion of evans 1979 throughout this study it was assumed that the hydrodynamic behaviour of owcbw system was symmetric about the mid point of the array there were two pressure transducers with a measuring range of 0 2 bar one in the front wall at mouth of the owc chamber facing the waves p fout t and the other towards the inner side p fin t used to register the respective pressure time histories in the central owc device owc3 in the owcbw system the air pressure variation due to rise and fall of free surface water inside the chamber for first three owc models was measured with a pressure sensor fixed on its top p air i t each of the three instrumented models was fixed with a run up gauge inside its chamber at the back wall to register the run up r u i t herein i denotes the respective owc devices number in which the measurement was taken up the measured differential air pressure and chamber free surface elevation were adopted to calculate the efficiency of the system the central unit alone was fixed with an additional run up gauges on the leeside r ub t and seaside r uf t of the lip wall this was felt necessary to understand the sloshing inside the chamber as well as the phase difference between the wave elevation at the inside and the outside of the chamber to understand the diffraction pattern around the owcbw system three wave gauges wg 3 wg 5 were placed in between the beach and the structure to evaluate the phase difference between incident waves to the water oscillation inside the chamber videos were taken close to the owc system from the front and side view in total 15 signatures from five pressure transducers five run up meters two wave gauges in front of the model and three wave gauges around the breakwater were acquired with a sampling interval of 0 01 s simultaneously the analysis for the measurements was carefully executed in the initial smaller window of steady state region i e the time series window without start up time and reflection a brief uncertainty analysis of different hydrodynamic parameters considered in the present experimental study was given in appendix a the regular tests covered a wave frequency range of 0 47 hz 1 11 hz wave steepness h l of 0 0065 0 0638 and relative water depth d l in the range of 0 08 0 26 in this paper the effect of wave steepness h l relative water depth d l and non dimensional spacing ks k 2π l on the non dimensional front wall outside pressure wave amplification factor air pressure capture width and relative capture width measured in the owc model subjected to normal wave incidence has been investigated 3 hydrodynamic parameters the different hydrodynamic parameters that were considered to evaluate hydrodynamic performance of the structure are as discussed below for a three dimensional model study on an array of owc devices the fundamental quantity employed to evaluate its performance is the capture width cw it considers the overall power absorbed by an owc device for regular waves this is defined to be the ratio between the total mean pneumatic output power produced by an owc device to the mean power offered by a unit crest wave width of the incident wave cruz 2008 wherein mean refers to the average power per wave period as follows 1 c a p t u r e width i cw i p o u t i p w herein i denotes the respective owc devices number in which the capture width measurement was taken up the time average incident wave power p w as a function of wave height h wave period t and water depth d is given as 2 p w ρ g h 2 8 c 2 1 2 k d sinh 2 k d where ρ is the mass density of fluid g is the gravitational acceleration c l t due to rise and fall of water inside the owc chamber the pneumatic output power p out i is developed it is calculated by integration of instantaneous free surface oscillation inside the chamber moving with a velocity v w i under the air pressure p air i as follows lópez et al 2015 3 p out i 1 t t t t p air i av w i dt herein v w i is the first derivative of the third order approximation to the free surface elevation inside the respective owc chambers calculated by the expression of lópez et al 2015 4 v w i 2 z j 1 3 z j 6 z j 1 z

uf and p air 3 reduces for low period waves away from natural frequency of the system as a major portion of the energy incident on the lip wall gets reflected leading to lesser energy into the chamber 4 1 effect of wave characteristics based on the theoretical investigation of malmo and reitan 1986b on a finite row of owc devices the average chamber free surface amplification and pressure ratio increases with the number of owc units in an array an array of owc devices with five devices exhibited better performance than the infinite number of devices in the present experimental study owc devices were integrated with the layout of detached breakwaters and the functional requirement of length of the breakwater limited the maximum number of owc devices up to five for the purpose of its integration with odbw for systems of more than a single device an appropriate spacing must be chosen on the basis of average performance of an array of devices cruz 2008 in order to understand the effect of spacing between owc units on the average hydrodynamic performance of an array of owc devices three different spacing s i e one two and three times the width of the owc model were considered when the spacing equals the width of the owc device the array of owc units positioned together in an owcbw system would act as a partially absorbing vertical wall type structure for incoming waves for other cases the owcbw system will act as a porous structure in dissipating diffracted waves around the owc devices this phenomenon has been confirmed based on the reflection coefficient as discussed later under section 4 6 the influence of wave characteristics on the average performance of the owcbw system for different spacing has been evaluated by exposing to tests of wave heights from 0 03 m to 0 09 m with different wave steepness 4 1 1 wave length in order to assess the effect of wave length on the average hydrodynamic performance of an array of owc devices for different spacing the regular wave experiments are carried out the wave height h was 0 03 m the variation in non dimensional front wall outside pressure pr fout average wave amplification factor β average non dimensional air pressure pr air average capture width cw and average relative capture width rcw with d l for different spacing is shown in fig 6 the hydrodynamic parameters β pr air cw and rcw are discussed here in terms of average of the first three owc devices owc1 to owc3 pr fout is presented for the mid owc chamber pr fout increases up to d l 0 104 beyond which it decreases with wave length increase in d l the tests are carried out in a constant water depth for all the three spacings s since the orbital motion under the wave decreases with wave length and exerts lesser pressure near the mouth of the chamber since the orbital motion under high frequency waves is less the lip wall prevents the wave energy to enter the owc device chamber and increases the reflected energy around d l 0 128 natural frequency of the system there observed to be a large pr fout due to lesser reflection coefficient which increases with decrease in wave length as this can be seen in the later section 4 6 due to higher reflection coefficient at high frequency waves that increases the reflected energy and exerts lesser pressure near the mouth of the chamber the higher value of pr fout around natural frequency of the system indicates the possibility of more energy being transmitted past the lip wall into the chamber among the three spacings tested the maximum pr fout was found to be 2 12 for s w 1 it is higher than the value observed from the similar two dimensional 2d model tests ashlin et al 2016 in which the maximum pr fout was observed to be 1 3 under regular and random wave incidences it is believed that due to higher reflection from the owcbw system as well as convergence of water waves the energy concentration in front of the device is high and absorbs more power from the total incident wave front greater than the width of the device which in fact tends to increase pr fout up to a maximum of about 2 12 i e more than the value for a fully reflected wave condition in front of a structure the influence of d l and s on the free surface amplification β inside the owc chamber is shown in fig 6b the energy conversion in the device occurs due to the wave oscillation inside the chamber and is determined by the hydrodynamics of the system however the effect of radiated flow around the device also influences the energy conversion the maximum β is about 2 8 times the incident wave height for s w 3 for d l up to about 0 16 beyond which the factor reduces to about 0 75 pr fout and β for s w 1 are 2 12 and 0 8 respectively thus the wave amplification factor is high around natural frequency of the system and increased spacing the dynamic air pressure inside the chamber at natural frequency of the system d l 0 128 is almost equal to that of the dynamic pressure available outside the chamber pr fout for s w 3 further pr air is found to be maximum at d l 0 128 natural frequency of the system and reduces on either side the variation of cw and rcw with d l for different spacing is presented in fig 6d the efficiency in the case of 2d tests is similar to rcw wherein the energy incident over the entire width of the owc device is taken into account however in the case of 3d tests to accommodate the diffraction phenomena the term capture width cw is introduced the capture width is not dimensionless and thereby it is scale dependent however the concept of cw is meaningful price et al 2009 in the sense that it represents the length of unit wave front that contains the absorbed power for spacing equals to thrice the width of the owc model the cw is observed to be a maximum to an extent of about 0 6 near the natural period of the system d l 0 128 and decreases on its either side the physical processes causing the reduction in capture width on either side of the natural period of the device are explained by quantitative analysis of the phase difference between the variations in the hydrodynamic parameters β 3 and pr air 3 the phase difference between these parameters for the different d l as a function of t t is given in table 1 the phase difference between β 3 and pr air 3 is found to be almost 2700 with the least at d l 0 128 corresponding to the natural frequency of the system on either side of the above stated d l since the phase difference is found to be higher the cw is found less in spite of β being higher similar observation has been discussed earlier by kamath et al 2015 the percentage of decrease in cw for s w 1 and s w 2 compared to that for s w 3 is found to be in the range of 11 59 and 8 43 respectively the non dimensional parameter rcw can possess values greater than unity when owc devices are placed in an array the devices capture maximum power to an extent of about 2 2 times the given input power at the natural frequency of the system this confirms that the owc device could absorb more power when placed in an array than in an isolation due to energy concentration rcw is found to decrease with spacing between owc units in general the key hydrodynamic parameters pr fout β pr air cw and rcw increase with wave length until natural frequency of the system and the spacing between the owc units 4 1 2 wave height the performance of the owc device is highly influenced by wave period followed by wave height lópez et al 2014 the effect of wave height on the average performance of the owcbw system has been examined fig 7 a d shows the variation of pr fout β pr air cw and rcw for h 0 09 m respectively it is observed that pr fout is higher than that measured for h 0 03 m for any d l an increase in h leads to an increase in the wave steepness it would induce higher pressures on the lip wall the trend in the variation of β pr air cw and rcw with d l for the three s tested is found to exhibit a similar trend as that seen for h 0 03 m however the values of these four parameters for h 0 09 m are found to be lesser than that obtained for h 0 03 m when the steeper waves pass into the chamber the energy dissipation at the tip of the lip wall due to turbulence vortex shedding radial flow of wave etc is higher than the low steepness waves and leads to higher energy loss kamath et al 2015 this phenomenon decreases the water surface oscillation and thus air pressure inside the chamber for a higher wave 4 1 3 wave steepness the effect of wave steepness h l on the average performance characteristics through the parameters pr fout β pr air cw and rcw for finer ranges of h l 0 0065 0 0155 0 0201 to 0 0278 0 0302 to 0 0434 and 0 0597 to 0 0638 is reported in fig 8 s w of 3 was considered the increase in wave steepness induces more pressure on the front side of the lip wall however β pr air and rcw are found to decrease with an increase in h l due to energy loss when the wave passes into the chamber past the lip wall further it is to be mentioned that the same model when it was subjected to two dimensional waves ashlin et al 2016 exhibited the similar kind of hydrodynamic variation for different wave steepness regime i e the hydrodynamic efficiency of the system decreases with an increase in wave steepness the results clearly indicate that hydrodynamic performance characteristics of owc device is better when exposed to the action of waves of lesser steepness than steeper waves overall the average performance of the first three respective owc devices in an array is found to be higher for thrice the width of the model spacing than the other spacings considered in this study it is due to that owc devices in an array where positioned together acting as a vertical wall type structure that contributes higher reflection and combination of both diffracted and radiated waves when the incident wave is acting on the structure the reflected radiated and diffracted waves cancel incident waves and reduces the input power to the system cruz 2008 but for twice and thrice the width of the model spacing integrated with odbw the reflection from owc devices decreases and the combination of both diffracted and radiated waves are dissipated through the rubble materials in between the individual owc units this certainly reduces the cancellation of waves and so increases the concentration of energy due to convergence of water waves in front of the owc model and further increases the performance of the owcbw system 4 2 effect of wave interaction between devices the average hydrodynamic performance of the owcbw system for different spacing between devices has been presented in the previous section it is further important to understand how the individual owc units in an array perform due to interaction effect when subjected to wave action in order to assess the variability in energy conversion within the system the hydrodynamic parameters β i pr air i and rcw i as a function of d l are presented in fig 9 for different spacing herein i denotes the respective owc devices in which the measurement was taken up similar to the earlier observation the hydrodynamic parameters β i pr air i and rcw i are found to increase with the spacing as well as wave length for all the three models it is also observed that the array with s w 3 exhibits the maximum efficiency for s w 1 the hydrodynamic parameters β i pr air i and rcw i of the first three respective owc models are found to decrease from the leading edge owc1 towards the central owc chamber owc3 the reduction in the wave amplification factor at the natural frequency of the system d l 0 128 for owc2 and owc3 devices with the base reference of owc1 device is 5 and 21 respectively it can be clearly seen in the video 1 taken from the front view of the owcbw system that the owc model placed on the leading edge subjected to higher wave amplification inside of its chamber than the other models as we could see from video 1 the leading edge model in spacing configuration of s w 1 surrounded on its one side by rubble materials and that decreases the reflection from the system this certainly increases the wave power input to the system and highly push and pull the water mass inside the owc model in leading edge of the owcbw system than the other models for owcbw system with s w 2 the efficiency of the individual owc device for d l 0 12 is found to be a maximum for owc1 device and the least for owc2 device for d l 0 12 owc1 device is found to exhibit the least efficiency the owcbw system with s w 3 for d l 0 12 the performance characteristics is found to be similar to that seen for s w 2 however for d l 0 12 a clear trend on the effect of position of the owc device is not observed supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2018 05 043 the following are the supplementary data related to this article video 1front view of the owcbw system for s w 1 1 4 3 effect of spacing further the effect of non dimensional spacing ks on the average hydrodynamic performance of the owcbw system subjected to regular waves for their direct field applications is examined in order to understand the variation of the rcw as a function of their respective non dimensional spacings is projected in fig 10 to avoid the influence of wave frequency on rcw the above said figure is depicted in terms of different discrete representation of d l as discussed earlier due to the limitation in length of odbw to serve as coastal protection purpose the rcw is given for ks in the range 0 5 ks 4 56 in the above figures the lower limit of ks corresponds to the case wherein the owc models are positioned together and the upper limit of ks corresponds to the case wherein the owc units are positioned with centre to centre spacing being thrice the width of the owc device the trend in variation of the hydrodynamic parameter rcw is found to increase with an increase in non dimensional spacing attaining a maximum value at ks 2 27 which corresponds to the natural frequency of the system d l 0 128 for d l 0 128 the minimum value of rcw occurs at ks 0 75 for the range of ks used amid the constraints in spacing the maximum and minimum values of hydrodynamic parameters correspond to the resonant frequency of the system that occurs at 1 52 times of ks apart which is similar to the results observed in theoretical investigation of thomas and evans 1981 from the above discussions we can conclude that the optimal spacing between the owc units for the present model setup is ks 2 27 herein the term wave length in k corresponds to the predominant wave length prevail in the coast considered for integrating owc models with odbw the optimal spacing may vary for the long breakwater than the one considered in this study and can be studied separately consequently the key geometric parameters of the owc device can be fixed based on the same predominant wave length as discussed in detail in authors previous work ashlin et al 2016 4 4 array performance the hydrodynamic performance of an array of owc devices in the owcbw system is investigated hereby normalizing the sum of cw of five devices with its array occupying space as given below 6 array rcw c w 3 2 c w 1 c w 2 5 w 4 s the variation in array rcw as a function of d l for three different spacing configurations is shown in fig 11 from the results it is observed that unlike as seen in the earlier results of rcw which is always found to be high for s w 3 throughout the d l regime the array rcw is measured to be high for s w 1 corresponds to d l greater than 0 16 the change in trend is mainly due to the uneven normalization because of different end to end array occupancy width by owc devices the array rcw for s w 3 despite being normalized by the value of 90 more than that of s w 1 the quantity difference between them is only about 50 70 but with increase in d l the trend in variation of array rcw is reversed and found to be high for the spacing configuration of s w 3 of about 15 30 more in comparison with other spacing configurations this explains overall the array configuration with s w 3 exhibits better performance throughout the d l regime considered in this study further in the next section the hypothetical situation of owc models occupying constant end to end width in owcbw system for all the three spacing configurations and its performance has been studied 4 5 total performance vs average performance till now the discussion focussed on keeping five number of owc devices while integrating with odbw for the different centre to centre spacing the average performance of the owcbw system the model setup with thrice the width of the model spacing was found to exhibit a better efficiency than the other spacings considered in this study the model occupying space between extreme ends is not the same for all the three model setups herein an attempt is made to analyse the relationship between the total efficiency of the system with an average efficiency of the system for a constant model occupying space by doing so the model setup with s w 1 s w 2 and s w 3 will occupy 13 7 and 5 number of power absorbing devices respectively to fill up the excess spaces beyond the ends of extreme owc device the schematic plan view of the non equal and equal end to end space occupancy by owc devices in the central owcbw system for different spacing configurations is shown in fig 12 a and b respectively it is assumed that the average rcw calculated from five devices integrated with odbw is multiplied with a total number of devices to obtain the total rcw for the respective spacings the relation between total rcw and rcw corresponds to a number of devices for a constant h of 0 03 m is shown in fig 13 herein the total rcw and rcw values are represented by symbols of circles and triangles respectively in general the parameters total rcw and rcw are directly and inversely proportional to the number of devices respectively the rcw is seen to decrease with an increase in the number of devices throughout the d l considered in this study similar to the above observations the total rcw is found to be increasing with an increase in the number of devices for d l 0 15 the difference between the total rcw while using five and 13 number of power absorbing devices is only about 20 and for d l 0 16 the difference between them is found to be the large of about 100 though the increase in the number of devices shows a better performance in harnessing total rcw compared to the lesser number of devices in a constantly occupied spacing it indirectly concludes the ineffectiveness of individual devices in harnessing energy from waves consequently the wave power absorption by the individual unit is fewer leads to higher wave force and scour on and around the structure respectively with increased maintenance by considering the total cost of building many devices and less difference only in harnessing total rcw for a lesser number of devices compared to the large number of devices lead us to prefer the model with thrice the width of the model spacing is better for the considered dual purpose system 4 6 reflection nature of owcbw system the performance of the coastal protection system is characterized by its reflective property howe and nader 2017 martins rivas and mei 2009a and is herein presented the percentage of wave reflection from owcbw system is determined by the wave reflection coefficient k r the k r is defined as the ratio between reflected wave height h r and incident wave height h i the composite wave elevations from η 1 t and η 2 t have been decomposed into reflected and incident components as per the method of goda and suzuki 1976 the variation of k r as a function of d l for different spacing is depicted in fig 14 from the results it is seen that k r is maximum for the owcbw system with a spacing s w 1 followed by s w 2 and s w 3 the k r is found to decrease up to d l 0 128 beyond which it increases with a decrease in the wave length for all the three spacings stated above the reason for the lowest k r at d l 0 128 resonant frequency of the system is high wave power absorption which maximizes the efficiency for long period waves the k r slightly increases compared to short period waves since in general the reflection due to low frequency waves is higher than that of the high frequency waves the higher order of k r under s w 1 is due to the reflective nature of the owcbw system since at the owcbw system with s w 1 the owc units are positioned together and acting as a partially absorbing vertical wall type structure that induces more reflection with an increase in s w the owcbw system act as a porous structure dissipating the incident wave energy by rubble materials consequently the reflection due to the owcbw system decreases and increases the performance of the individual owc device a lower k r indicates a large amount of wave power absorption 5 conclusions the performance evaluation of different spacing between an array of owc devices integrated with offshore detached breakwater subjected to regular wave field has been assessed through a well controlled comprehensive experimental program the effect of wave steepness h l relative water depth d l and non dimensional spacing ks on the non dimensional front wall outside pressure wave amplification factor air pressure capture width and relative capture width measured in the owc model subjected to normal wave incidence has been investigated the following are the conclusions drawn from the study the induced pressure on the seaside of the lip wall pr fout average wave amplification factor β average air pressure inside the chamber pr air average capture width cw and average relative capture width rcw are found to increase with an increase in wave length up to the natural frequency of the system d l 0 128 beyond which it decreases the hydrodynamic performance of the system decreases with an increase in wave height the owc device shows better performance for low steepness waves than the high steepness waves overall the average performance of the first three respective owc devices in an array is found to be higher for thrice the width of the model spacing than the other spacings considered in this study the trend in variation of the hydrodynamic parameter rcw is found to increase with an increase in non dimensional spacing attaining a maximum value at ks 2 27 which corresponds to the natural frequency of the system d l 0 128 the total rcw and rcw are directly and inversely proportional to the number of devices respectively the total rcw and rcw are increases and decreases with an increase in a number of devices respectively the phase difference between β 3 and pr air 3 is found to be almost 2700 with the least at d l 0 128 i e at the resonant period of the device the convergence of water waves due to three dimensional effects leads to concentration of wave energy in front of the array of owc chambers and increases the absorbed power to a maximum of 2 2 times the incident wave power this confirms that the owc system could absorb more power when placing in an array of devices than the isolated device due to energy concentration the natural frequency of the system is observed to be unaltered with the change in spacing between individual owc models the reflection nature of the owcbw system found to be high for s w 1 and decreases with an increase in spacing between owc models at the natural frequency of the system the reflection coefficient found to be the least for all the three spacing configurations because of high wave power absorption and less energy loss the performance analysis of owc devices integrated with porous structure i e offshore detached breakwater is investigated uniquely in the present study as the interaction between waves and owcbw system is of complex and large scale in nature the present experimental study which quantifies the performance of owcbw in terms of energy conversion and coastal protection is essential the present experimental study also can provide experimental data for validating numerical models the study has been conducted with only five numbers of owc devices that integrated with an offshore breakwater the optimal non dimensional spacing concluded in the present study is applicable only to the present model setup and has not been generalized it may vary for the long breakwater than the one considered in this study and can be studied separately the effect of incident wave direction on the performance of the owcbw system will be studied further the change in functional ability of breakwaters with and without owc devices can be considered for future works the study of owcbw systems with the moving bed model can be used to ascertain the scour around the integrated owc models and sediment movement around the owcbw system are also suggested for future works acknowledgement this research was funded by norwegian research council

23259,a thorough stability analysis of submerged pipeline dynamics has been performed the problem of current induced vibrations in a free spanning pipeline was analyzed using both linear and non linear methodologies while most investigations dedicated to the analysis of this type of problem use either approximate analytical methods or traditional numerical methods two alternative approaches are presented linear stability analysis lsa and the generalized integral transform technique gitt although strictly valid when the pipeline is subject to small amplitude disturbances lsa is simple to apply and yields accurate either explicit or transcendental analytical relations that predict dominant pipeline vibration frequencies and wavelengths as well as the onset of buckling on the other hand the gitt can predict pipeline behavior for arbitrary disturbance amplitudes more efficiently than traditional numerical methods these features are illustrated by considering the problem of a submerged pipeline subjected to soil conditions and ocean currents this problem was solved using lsa the gitt and the finite element method fem for comparison purposes moreover the dnv rp f105 standard was also used for verifying the proposed methods the alternative methods offered in this paper can overcome limitations associated with traditional analytical and numerical approaches and are employed to produce previously unreported results keywords local and modal linear stability analysis integral transforms natural frequencies buckling 1 introduction free spans are commonly encountered in underwater pipelines that lay on the ocean bottom due to a frequently uneven seabed this particular configuration in association with ocean currents and soil stiffness can greatly accentuate fatigue failure as a result frequency analyses become a crucial part of pipeline design for ensuring pipeline integrity and preventing expensive maintenance nowadays the dnv rp f105 standard dnv rp f105 2006 has been used as major industry guideline in configurations involving free spanning pipelines in spite of the relevance of this international standard it is limited to a number of free span scenarios and in many cases alternative methods are required one common approach to derive the dynamic response of free spanning offshore pipelines is to use approximate analytical methods these are often based on a simplified beam theory and consequently of easy application fyrileiv and mork 2002 approximate methods are still in use as presented in sollund et al 2015a where closed form analytical expressions for the fundamental frequency of short free spans were obtained using dimensional analysis the inherent simplicity of these type of methods has drawbacks since their approximate character can lead to inaccurate solutions limiting their application to simpler problems on the other end of the spectrum traditional numerical schemes such as finite element methods fem huges 1987 zienkiewicz et al 2013 are capable of solving extremely complex problems while still providing good accuracy consequently these methods have been widely used for analyzing subsea pipeline dynamics forbes and reda 2013 santos et al 2014 naturally these methods often require a significant amount of cpu time to meet strict accuracy requirements combining the advantages of numerical and analytical approaches semi analytical methods arise as a powerful alternative to the former ones they can provide improved accuracy for complex nonlinear problems as compared to analytical methods while still consuming a reasonably small amount of cpu time when compared to traditional numerical schemes when looking into free span problems there are some literature studies that employ methods of this kind vedeld et al 2013 presented a semi analytical solution for the harmonic response of pipelines based on the rayleigh ritz approach in combination with a displacement field taken as a fourier series in subsequent studies the dynamic response of both free spanning pipelines sollund et al 2015b as well as multi span pipelines sollund et al 2014 was analyzed using the same methodology two well established semi analytical methods that are particularly interesting for the analysis of underwater pipeline dynamics are the linear stability analysis lsa and the generalized integral transform technique gitt the lsa methodology provides the asymptotic response of dynamical systems when their steady states are subjected to small disturbances this is achieved by transforming the original non linear governing equations into a simpler linear and modal form that is then numerically solved in spite of this simplification the method can still provide highly accurate solutions and be applied to complex problems most lsa applications involve fluids mechanics problems such as convective and absolute asymptotic instabilities huerre and monkewitz 1990 transient disturbance growth due to non monotonic dynamic behavior schmid 2007 and the evaluation of the stability of dynamical systems with two and three dimensional steady states theofilis 2011 there are however studies related to fluid structure interaction problems as well as seen in dowell and hall 2001 while lsa involves the solution of a simpler model derived from the original problem formulation the gitt cotta 1993 addresses the original model in its complete form in which the sough solutions are expressed as series of orthogonal eigenfunctions this hybrid analytical numerical technique is akin to the fem as the solutions are written in terms of basis functions however the usage of orthogonal bases leads to solutions with higher accuracy furthermore it requires no domain discretization many times leading to smaller cpu times the gitt has found numerous applications in heat and fluid flow over the past decades more recently it has also been applied to a variety of dynamical systems such as wind induced vibrations in overhead conductors matt 2009 dynamics of axially moving beams an and su 2011 2014a dynamics of damaged structures matt 2013 vibration in orthotropic plates an and su 2014b pipe dynamics in the presence of two phase flow gu et al 2013 an and su 2015 and general one dimensional distributed systems matt 2015 it is important to highlight that the combined application of integral transforms with linear stability analysis has been previously employed this was first presented in studies focused on the onset of natural convection in porous cavities alves et al 2002 and in superposed fluid and porous layers hirata et al 2006 the former employed a linearization of the integral transformed system whereas the latter linearized the original model prior to the integral transformation processes this second alternative which involves solving the differential eigenvalue problem resulting from the application of lsa using the gitt has also become common in recent years sphaier and barletta 2014 sphaier et al 2015 alves and barletta 2015 although there are a few literature studies that employ generalized integral transforms to problems involving mechanical systems there are no studies related to the application of the gitt to free spans in submerged pipelines let alone combined gitt lsa applications to these types of problems in this context the main purpose of this work can be summarized as two fold i propose lsa as an alternative to approximate analytical methods capable of providing accurate solutions to complex problems while maintaining simplicity of use and small cpu time requirements and i i propose gitt as an alternative to traditional discretization methods that can simulate nonlinear dynamical systems with lower cpu time requirements while still providing highly accurate solutions to complex problems these are demonstrated as feasible alternatives through the analysis of the dynamic response of a free span pipeline on an uneven seabed that is subjected to axial force soil stiffness and seawater movement numerical results are then compared to the dnv rp f105 standard dnv rp f105 2006 and new data for configurations not covered by this standard are provided 2 mathematical model consider a pipeline laying on a seabed subjected to soil conditions and weak ocean currents as sketched in fig 1 a and the corresponding physical model illustrated in fig 1 b where t is the axial force l is the pipeline length k is the soil stiffness and x y are the spatial coordinates the governing equation for the considered model is given by 1 e i 4 y x 4 t 2 y x 2 ρ w c d d 2 u c y t u c y t π 4 ρ m d 2 c m a c f w π 4 ρ w d 2 c a m 2 y t 2 where e is young s modulus i is the moment of inertia ρ w is the seawater density ρ m is the pipeline density c d is the drag coefficient and the outer and inner diameters of the pipeline are d and d i respectively moreover u c and a c are the ocean water current velocity and acceleration whereas m π d 2 d i 2 ρ m 4 is and f w m g are the mass and weight per unit length finally c m is an inertia coefficient c a is an added mass coefficient g is the gravity acceleration and c e i l 2 π ρ w d 2 c a 4 m is the phase speed of a disturbance with wave length l in a pipeline with zero axial force these parameters and variables are then rewritten in dimensionless form using 2a j τ t c d ξ x l η y d β l 2 d 2 α 2 t l 2 e i κ k l 3 e i γ l 4 d e i π 4 ρ m d 2 c m a c f w u u c c and δ ρ w c 2 c d l 4 2 e i such that eq 1 can be re written in dimensionless form as 3 4 η ξ 4 α 2 2 η ξ 2 δ u η τ u η τ γ β 2 η τ 2 one important remark about this equation must be pointed out only cases with u 1 can be considered because the pipeline current interaction model used in eq 3 assumes that the ocean current exerts a force on the pipeline that is proportional to the pipeline transversal velocity hence no vortex induced vibrations viv are herein considered this imposes re ρ w u c d μ w 48 as an approximate upper limit for the maximum value of the reynolds number of the ocean flow around the pipeline where μ w is the dynamic viscosity of ocean water nevertheless one should point out that this constraint is only approximate because it is strictly valid for a two dimensional straight pipeline different pipeline soil interactions are analyzed using distinct combinations of boundary conditions a first scenario considers a generalized pinned condition where the soil stiffness allows vertical motion proportional to the shear force but there is still no bending moment at the boundaries 4a 3 η ξ 3 κ η and 2 η ξ 2 0 at ξ 0 4b 3 η ξ 3 κ η and 2 η ξ 2 0 at ξ 1 a second configuration considers a generalized clamped condition where the soil stiffness also allows vertical motion proportional to shear force but there is still no slope at the boundaries 5a 3 η ξ 3 κ η and η ξ 0 at ξ 0 5b 3 η ξ 3 κ η and η ξ 0 at ξ 1 naturally both models can lead to the classical pinned and clamped conditions if one considers the limit where κ tends to infinity thus eliminating any soil elasticity accordingly four boundary condition cases will be analyzed namely the two generalized pinned and clamped models denoted elastic soil cases and the corresponding classical cases with a rigid soil at the boundaries regardless of the boundary condition case equation 3 admits the general steady state solution 6 η b ξ c 1 e α ξ c 2 e α ξ c 3 c 4 ξ γ δ u 2 2 α 2 ξ 2 where the constants c 1 to c 4 depend on the imposed boundary conditions now that the mathematical model has been clearly defined the dynamic response of a pipeline governed by eq 3 and boundary conditions 4 5 will be analyzed under different parametric conditions whenever required the initial condition is defined as the steady state given by eq 6 superposed to a linear perturbation which is described in the next section within this mathematical framework the dynamic responses predicted by lsa gitt and fem are compared in terms of solution accuracy and the cpu time required to generate these solutions at this point it is important to highlight that only cases with a rigid soil are known in the literature the other situations are unreported as far as the authors are aware 3 linear stability analysis dynamical systems subject to supercritical bifurcations can be analyzed through linear stability analysis where it is assumed that any deviation from a known steady state of this system is caused by small disturbances such an assumption allows the derivation of a linearized disturbance governing equation these equations can be further simplified by assuming that the disturbances take the form of normal modes in homogeneous coordinates according to these steps the pipeline dimensionless displacement can be written as 7 η ξ τ η b ξ ε η n ξ e i ω τ where η b ξ is given by eq 6 ε is the disturbance amplitude parameter η n ξ is the disturbance eigenfunction ω is the disturbance eigenvalue and i 1 the real part of ω is the frequency whereas its imaginary part represents the growth rate and η n ξ is the shape of the disturbance substituting eq 7 into the term which includes the absolute value operator in eq 3 leads to 8 u η τ u i ε ω η n ξ e i ω τ u ε ω η n ξ sin ω τ i ε ω η n ξ cos ω τ u ε ω η n ξ sin ω τ 2 ε ω η n ξ cos ω τ 2 u 2 2 ε ω η n ξ sin ω τ ε ω η n ξ 2 in which the identities exp i a cos a i sin a a b i a 2 b 2 and sin a 2 cos a 2 1 have been employed with a and b being real numbers if one assumes small frequencies i e ω o ε it is possible to approximate this expression as 9 u η τ u o ε 2 using a taylor series expansion a similar procedure has been used before when modeling thermal instabilities in power law fluids alves and barletta 2013 hence the linearized normal mode approximate version of eq 3 is 10 d 4 η n d ξ 4 α 2 d 2 η n d ξ 2 i δ u ω β ω 2 η n 0 which is obtained by substituting eqs 7 and 9 into eq 3 and grouping the o ε terms solutions to this equation depend on the imposed boundary conditions which are discussed next 3 1 pinned pinned with rigid soil when both edges of the pipeline are pinned down the disturbance amplitude boundary conditions are derived from eq 4 with κ to yield 11a η n 0 and d 2 η n d ξ 2 0 at ξ 0 11b η n 0 and d 2 η n d ξ 2 0 at ξ 1 which lead to the solution 12 η n ξ m 1 η m sin λ m ξ with sin λ m 0 where the latter yields λ m m π with m being a positive integer since all boundary conditions in 11 are homogeneous solution 12 can be substituted into eq 10 to yield 13 m 1 η m i δ u ω β ω 2 λ m 4 α 2 λ m 2 sin λ m ξ 0 which can only be true when the dispersion relation 14

previous equations ω ω r i ω i where ω r and ω i are the pipeline disturbance frequency and growth rate respectively equation 15 have four solutions namely 16a ω r 4 β λ m 4 α 2 λ m 2 δ 2 u 2 2 β and ω i δ u 2 β 16b ω r 0 and ω i δ u 2 β δ 2 u 2 4 β λ m 4 α 2 λ m 2 2 β nonetheless the relevant solutions among these are the ones that yield real values for ω r and ω i with the further requirement that the former is non negative it must be noted that the small frequency hypothesis used to obtain eq 9 is justified by solutions 16 as l d in most applications of interest i e β 1 when α 2 δ 2 u 2 4 β λ m 2 λ m 2 solution 16a with re ω r 0 is the correct one since it guarantees that im ω r 0 nevertheless an increase in either u or δ from zero produces two significant effects 1 it reduces the pipeline vibration frequency and 2 it damps any pipeline vibrations finally although multiple frequencies can be generated in this problem the case with λ 1 π leads to the most likely observable frequency on the other hand if α 2 δ 2 u 2 4 β λ m 2 λ m 2 both solutions in eq 16b become the correct ones instead since this guarantees that im ω i 0 they are both stable when α 2 λ m 2 as well however one of the solutions becomes unstable when α 2 λ m 2 the most unstable condition is achieved when m 1 where λ 1 π which leads to the classical formula dnv rp f105 2006 for the compressive tension required for buckling i e t b π 2 e i l 2 finally it is interesting to notice that buckling occurs under stationary conditions since ω r 0 3 2 clamped clamped with rigid soil when both edges of the pipeline are clamped down the disturbance amplitude boundary conditions are derived from eq 5 with κ to yield 17a η n 0 and d η n d ξ 0 at ξ 0 17b η n 0 and d η n d ξ 0 at ξ 1 whose solution can be obtained with the usual method of the characteristic equation leading to 18 η n ξ c 1 e λ ξ c 2 e λ ξ c 3 e λ ξ c 4 e λ ξ where the two new parameters are defined as 19 λ α 2 2 α 2 2 2 i δ u ω β ω 2 since eq 10 subjected to boundary conditions 17 represents an eigenvalue problem it is undetermined up to a constant hence in the present case c 4 1 is arbitrarily imposed to fix this scale invariance the first three boundary conditions in 17 are then used to solve for the remaining constants yielding 20a c 1 e λ e 2 λ λ λ λ e λ λ λ 2 e λ λ λ 1 e 2 λ λ 1 2 e λ λ e 2 λ 20b c 2 e λ λ 1 e 2

generate the dispersion relation 21 λ 2 λ 2 sinh λ sinh λ 2 λ λ 1 cosh λ cosh λ 0 which yields the values of ω r and ω i after all control parameters have been prescribed that satisfy both real and imaginary parts of this relation in this work the mathematica wolfram 2003 function findroot was used to solve eq 21 this function uses a newton raphson scheme to obtain the desired roots 3 3 pinned pinned with elastic soil when both edges of the pipeline are pinned down on an elastic soil with finite stiffness the disturbance amplitude boundary conditions are derived from eq 4 considering finite values for κ to yield 22a d 3 η n d ξ 3 κ η n and d 2 η n d ξ 2 0 at ξ 0 22b d 3 η n d ξ 3 κ η n and d 2 η n d ξ 2 0 at ξ 1 whose solution can be obtained using the same procedure described in

once again using findroot taking the limit when κ one obtains the dispersion relation 24 λ 2 λ 2 2 sinh λ sinh λ 0 which is an alternative but equivalent version of eq 14 3 4 clamped clamped with elastic soil when both edges of the pipeline are clamped down on an elastic soil with finite stiffness the disturbance amplitude boundary conditions are derived from eq 5 considering finite values for

the new dispersion relation 26 κ 2 λ 2 λ 2 λ 2 λ 2 λ 2 λ 2 2 sinh λ sinh λ 2 κ λ λ 2 λ 2 λ 2 sinh λ cosh λ 2 κ 2 λ λ 1 cosh λ cosh λ 2 κ λ 2 λ λ 2 λ 2 sinh λ cosh λ 0 that is solved once more using findroot as similarly done for the previous case it is interesting to note the limit κ leads to eq 21 4 generalized integral transform technique the original nonlinear problem defined by eq 3 can be solved with the generalized integral transform technique cotta 1993 in the context of the linear stability analysis presented in the previous sections gitt can also be understood as a technique for a nonlinear stability analysis of the same model the method seeks a solution for this problem in terms of an orthogonal eigenfunction expansion and an associated transformation relation known as the inverse transform pair 27a inverse η ξ τ i 0 η i τ ψ i ξ 27b transform η i τ 0 1 η ξ τ ψ i ξ d ξ where ψ i are normalized orthogonal eigenfunctions that arise from the solution of the bi harmonic eigenproblem given by 28 d 4 ψ i d ξ 4 μ i 4 ψ i 0 and homogeneous boundary conditions based on the ones from the original problem for the generalized pinned pinned situation this corresponds to 29a d 3 ψ i d ξ 3 κ ψ i and d 2 ψ i d ξ 2 0 at ξ 0 29b d 3 ψ i d ξ 3 κ ψ i and d 2 ψ i d ξ 2 0 at ξ 1 whereas for the generalized clamped clamped situation they are given by 30a d 3 ψ i d ξ 3 κ ψ i and d ψ i d ξ 0 at ξ 0 30b d 3 ψ i d ξ 3 κ ψ i and d ψ i d ξ 0 at ξ 1 noting that the special case of a rigid soil can be recovered when κ finally these eigenfunctions must also satisfy the orthonormality condition 31 0 1 ψ i ξ ψ j ξ d ξ δ i j the integral transformation of the problem is then carried out by multiplying eq 3 by ψ i and integrating the result over the domain length leading to 32 0 1 4 η

d ξ 0 1 ψ i i v η d ξ μ i 4 0 1 ψ i η d ξ 34b 0 1 ψ i 2 η ξ 2 d ξ 0 1 ψ i η d ξ due to the homogeneous nature of the boundary conditions for η and ψ i when substituting eq 34 and transformation 27b into eq 32 one obtains 35 μ i 4 η i α 2 0 1 η ψ i d ξ δ 0 1 u η τ u η τ ψ i d ξ 0 1 γ ψ i d ξ β d 2 η i d τ 2 leaving only non transformable terms as functions of η this direct dependence is removed by applying the inversion formula 27a to all terms but the one containing the absolute value operator which yields the coupled system of odes 36 μ i 4 η i α 2 j 0 a i j η j δ j 0 0 1 u η τ u δ i j d η j d τ ψ j ψ i d ξ γ i β d 2 η i d τ 2 for i 1 2 in which the integral coefficients are defined as 37a a i j 0 1 ψ i ψ j d ξ 37b γ i 0 1 γ ψ i d ξ next in order to facilitate the transformation of the remaining non transformable term its integration region is first divided into sub regions according to 38 0 1 u η τ d ξ m 1 m ξ m 1 ξ m u η τ d ξ where ξ m is defined by 39 ξ m m m allowing the term involving the absolute value operator to be accurately approximated by its value at the middle of each sub region applying this second order approximation to eq 38 and using the inversion formula 27a to the result leads to 40 0 1 u η τ u δ i j d η j d τ ψ j ψ i d ξ m 1 m u k 0 d η k d τ ψ k ξ m 1 2 ξ m 1 ξ m u δ i j d η j d τ ψ j ψ i d ξ such that the transformed system 36 can be re written as 41 μ i 4 η i α 2 j 0 a i j η j γ i δ j 0 m 1 m u k 0 j m k d η k d τ u δ i j g i m j h i m j d η j d τ β d 2 η i d τ 2 where the additional integral coefficients are given by 42a j m k ψ k ξ m 1 2 42b g i m j ξ m 1 ξ m ψ i d ξ 42c h i m j ξ m 1 ξ m ψ j ψ i d ξ finally the transformed initial conditions can be obtained by multiplying the initial condition e g a steady pipeline subject to a given disturbance by ψ i and integrating over the domain length this process yields 43 η i τ 0 ϕ i 0 1 η b ε η n ψ i d ξ where ϕ i is another integral coefficient the ode system 41 subjected to initial conditions 43 are then solved using the mathematica wolfram 2003 function ndsolve this function uses a solution methodology that selects between different marching schemes depending on how stiff is the ode system and guarantees a user prescribed accuracy by automatically adjusting the time step and accuracy order throughout the simulation once a finite number of η i are calculated the inversion relation 27a truncated to the same finite number is used to generate η this finite number of η i is selected based on accuracy considerations involving convergence of the summation series solution it should be noted that eq 27a also requires the normalized eigenfunctions ψ i which are discussed next 4 1 eigenvalue problem normalized eigenfunctions ψ i can also be obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem defined by eqs 28 30 for the original eigenfunction ψ i i e without normalization and then employing relations 44 ψ i ψ i n i 45 n i 0 1 ψ i 2 d ξ where n i is the norm solutions for ψ i under the different boundary conditions herein considered are presented next 4 1 1 pinned pinned with rigid soil using eq 4 with κ the eigenfunctions are given by 46 ψ i sinh μ i sin μ i ξ sin μ i sinh μ i

sin μ μ 6 are also obtained using findroot 4 1 4 clamped clamped with elastic soil using eq 5 with finite κ values the eigenfunctions are given by 51 ψ i sinh μ i ξ 2 μ i 3 sinh μ i κ cos μ i cosh μ i

transcendental equation 52 μ 3 sinh μ 2 κ cos μ 2 μ 3 sin μ cosh μ 2 κ μ 3 sin μ κ 2 cos μ κ 2 0 which are again solved using findroot 5 results and discussion both methodologies proposed in this paper for the study of pipeline dynamics must be verified and validated verification is performed by direct comparison to numerical results generated with a finite element method fem implementation since the lsa and gitt implementations were coded within the mathematica environment wolfram 2003 a fem code was also built using mathematica as a result proper cpu time comparisons between all three methods become possible the domain used by the fem is divided in a finite number of sub domains of uniform size where this number is chosen based on accuracy considerations furthermore the base functions used in each sub domain are third order polynomials following traditional galerkin implementations huges 1987 zienkiewicz et al 2013 once the system of odes is formed with the fem it is also solved using ndsolve while the verification of the current methodology can be readily performed validation requires comparisons with experimental data unfortunately due to an apparent lack of experimental results related to the presented cases in the literature a direct validation was unfeasible nevertheless the classical pinned pinned boundary condition case is indeed included in the international standard dnv rp f105 dnv rp f105 2006 since international standards generally require proper validation comparisons of the current results with those obtained from this standard are used as validation of the proposed methodologies in order to verify and validate the ability of both methodologies to simulate pipeline dynamics parametric conditions must be imposed the load pipeline material and dimension were selected based on common values for this type of application which usually employs a rust free uncoated steel pipeline immersed in the ocean the additional term a c in eq 1 is considered null for the sake of simplicity as already discussed in section 2 the maximum current speed allowed by this equation must be small since the model constraints require re 48 thus u c is considered null for simplicity s sake as well nevertheless the effect of the damping term in eq 3 does not vanish with u c 0 values for the remaining parameters c a c d and c m are taken from the dnv rp f105 design code dnv rp f105 2006 the required properties for the present study are given in table 1 the soil stiffness coefficient κ is calculated based on three types of soils stiffness k taken from the dnv rp f105 standard dnv rp f105 2006 as provided in table 2 based on these properties the resulting dimensionless parameters are given in table 3 as functions of the pipeline length l these are the parameters used in the simulations unless stated otherwise 5 1 dynamic pipeline response 5 1 1 small amplitude disturbances having established adequate values for the control parameters in the previous section it is now possible to analyze the dynamic pipeline response using the previously described methods the first step in this direction is to investigate the steady state η b ξ response when the pipeline is subjected to small disturbances in this context the lsa should yield very accurate predictions since this technique is specifically designed for this scenario naturally the gitt and fem solutions should produce the same results as the non linear effects are negligible for small disturbances this section is devoted to the first natural frequency calculation which is performed using the dimensionless parameters in table 3 table 4 compares lsa results and the dnv rp f105 standard dnv rp f105 2006 for κ as can be seen there is an outstanding agreement between with the standard for both sets of boundary conditions where a maximum error around 0 1 is seen for the pined pined case and about 0 02 is seen for the clamped clamped case natural frequency calculations with the gitt and the fem are straightforward as well since both techniques solve a system of odes in the form of q τ a q τ b q τ c o q τ 2 where q represents an arbitrary variable vector a and b coefficient matrices and c a coefficient vector natural frequencies can be extracted from the eigenvalues of b the results for the first natural frequency are not shown here because they yield maximum absolute errors of o 10 10 for the gitt and o 10 8 for the fem comparing to the lsa results these numbers were obtained using 60 terms in the truncated summation series solution of the gitt and 76 elements in the fem discretization additional results are presented in fig 2 for the first natural frequency as function of the pipeline length under parametric conditions interpolated from table 3 using a sixth order polynomial lines represent lsa results and points represent fem results as one can observe the natural frequency f decreases with increasing length l as expected furthermore oscillation frequencies in clamped clamped conditions are notably higher than the ones in pinned pinned conditions this is also expected due to the translational and rotational coupling restraints at the boundaries associated with the clamped conditions table 5 shows lsa results for the first natural frequency as function of pipeline length based on parameters from table 3 but now considering an elastic soil again the frequency decays with increasing l however lower values are generally obtained when compared to the infinite κ cases although a standard is not available for validation in this case these results are inherently verified since both gitt and fem results are essentially equal to the lsa results as was the case in table 4 fig 3 is similar to fig 2 but now an elastic soil is considered once again the first natural frequency decreases with pipeline length as further observed these frequencies increase as soil stiffness increases this effect is also stronger under clamped clamped conditions where the respective frequencies are higher as well in both cases however this effect is only noticeable for small pipeline lengths finally it is worth emphasizing that the fem results perfectly overlap the lsa data as was verified in fig 2 for a rigid soil 5 1 2 effect of current velocity the influence of ocean current velocity on pipeline vibration is now examined although already mentioned in the model section it is worth recalling that eq 1 does not take viv effects into account in other words the ocean current model used in this equation is only valid when the counter rotating vortices induced by the ocean flow around the pipeline remain stationary for straight pipelines such a model is valid as long as re 48 even though neither steady η b ξ nor unsteady η ξ τ pipelines remain straight this model is still assumed valid because η 1 is true for all τ values simulated in this study according to the parametric conditions imposed by table 1 this model limits u c to very small values however much higher values are herein employed otherwise this effect would be too small to be observed in a figure hence it is important to emphasize that the goal here is only to point out qualitative but not quantitative trends induced by ocean currents that generate stationary vortices that remain attached to the pipeline since all boundary conditions considered in this study lead to the same trends induced by current velocities the discussion that follows is based on the analytical expressions presented in eq 16 hence the conclusions drawn here are restricted to the presence of small amplitude disturbances the first trend is associated with pipeline frequency increasing u decreases its natural frequency this is however a very small effect since 4 β λ 1 4 δ 2 u 2 in general in order to illustrate this trend the first natural frequency as a function of pipeline length is shown in fig 4 for pinned pinned conditions with κ using the parameters from table 3 using two different current speeds u c 0 m s no current and u c 13 m s as can be seen even though the nonzero current velocity is significantly higher than allowed by the re 48 constraint differences in natural frequencies with and without currents can only be observed for very high pipeline lengths hence the pipeline natural frequency weakly decreases with an increasing current speed this is likely related to the fact that the counter rotating vortices are stationary i e they do not induce any oscillatory excitation on the pipeline that could significantly modify its natural frequencies finally it is important to note that these results were obtained with the lsa and verified with the fem the second trend that can be inferred from eq 16 which is also valid for the other boundary conditions is related to the pipeline stability since β δ and u are greater than zero small disturbances are always damped when the current speed is nonzero however this damping effect is also very small since β δ and u 1 in order to illustrate this result the transient evolution of a small disturbance is shown in fig 5 for the l 15 m parametric conditions in table 3 with u c 0 and u c 3 01 the disturbance shape eigenfunction is related to the first natural frequency eigenvalue and its asymptotic behavior in time is tracked at ξ 0 5 as observed it is quite clear that a nonzero current speed creates a damping effect since the amplification rate of the disturbance amplitude is negative without an ocean current disturbance amplitude does not vary this result might seem counterintuitive from a viv perspective but the model used here only accounts for attached counter rotating vortices which naturally induce a damping effect on the pipeline such an effect is very important in fatigue analysis since higher oscillation amplitudes lead to shorter pipeline lifespans finally the lsa could not be used to generate this figure because it is a time asymptotic analysis and hence cannot simulate initial value problems nevertheless these results are generated with the gitt and verified with the fem 5 1 3 large amplitude disturbances when the steady state solution η b ξ is subjected to large amplitude disturbances gitt and fem results should deviate from lsa predictions due to their ability to capture nonlinear effects in this scenario new phenomena are expected for instance several modes predicted by the lsa could be simultaneously excited additionally a broad band spectrum should be found around each mode where this broadness should be proportional to the amount of damping associated with each natural frequency table 6 shows the first three natural frequencies calculated by lsa for all four boundary conditions examined in this study all cases were calculated with l 15 m and u 0 the finite κ configuration were calculated using k 250 kn m m as can be seen resulting frequencies for all modes are higher for the case with a rigid soil also the clamped clamped configuration yields frequencies higher than those of the pinned pinned setup following the same trends observed in the previous sections in order to quantify the nonlinear effects the gitt is used to simulate the unsteady dynamics of a pipeline subjected to an initial condition with ε 10 and η n ξ exp 150 ξ 0 25 2 in eq 43 under the same parametric conditions used to calculate the lsa results in table 6 fig 6 shows the power spectra of this unsteady data extracted at ξ 0 2 for all four boundary conditions as one can observe the peak amplitude locations in the spectra coincide with predicted lsa results however the spectra is not broad around these frequencies and higher harmonics are also not observed despite the large amplitude of the initial disturbance this is likely due to the fact that eq 3 is only weakly nonlinear finally it is important to note that the gitt results are again verified by the fem results another point worth noting is that mode amplitudes depend strongly on the chosen boundary condition even though the same initial disturbance was used for all cases this can be explained by the data sampling location and mode shapes which are shown in fig 7 for the pinned pinned conditions as seen the first and second modes have approximately the same amplitude at ξ 2 for a rigid soil κ which is also higher than the first mode amplitude on the other hand the second first and third mode amplitudes are increasingly smaller at the same location with an elastic soil finite κ both trends are observed in fig 6 in terms of power spectra amplitude although not shown here the same applies to the clamped clamped condition 5 2 buckling scenarios when the pipeline is subjected to large enough compressive axial forces its steady state can become unstable causing the pipeline to transition to another steady state characterized by significant structural bending this phenomenon known as buckling can be predicted by both the lsa and gitt in the former case one must solve real and imaginary parts of eq 10 while imposing ω i 0 to find the values of real variables ω r and α 2 at the onset of instability for the pinned pinned case shown in section 3 1 this onset can be predicted analytically otherwise this must be done numerically table 7 displays these critical α c 2 values obtained with the lsa for all four boundary conditions using the parameters defined in table 3 these are the critical values for the onset of buckling because all conditions also yield ω r c 0 this data was verified by the gitt and the fem these results show that soil stiffness does not affect the onset of buckling which requires stronger axial forces to occur for clamped clamped boundary conditions further comparisons between lsa gitt and fem are now performed under a buckling scenario using simulations for pinned pinned α c 2 10 and clamped clamped α c 2 40 conditions for a rigid soil with β 2145 33 γ 0 δ 232 85 and u 0 the initial condition was composed of a disturbance with ε 10 4 and the first mode shape superposed to the steady state transient data for η ξ τ extracted at ξ 0 5 was then used in a nonlinear regression using the mathematica built in function findfit wolfram 2003 this is based on a least squared error minimization of the data which is approximated with the user defined function f τ a b exp ω i τ to extract the growth rate ω i where a and b are arbitrary constants it is important to note that the data interval used was 30 τ 100 both bounds are introduced with different purposes a high enough lower bound prevents the unwanted but unavoidable excitation of additional modes from reducing the estimated first mode growth rate accuracy by increasing the standard deviation in the estimation process however a low enough upper bound maintains nonlinear effects negligible allowing an accurate calculation of the linear growth rate the dimensionless pipeline displacement at ξ 0 5 over time calculated using the gitt for both boundary conditions is shown in fig 8 which qualitatively reveals the first mode linear growth rate within the chosen time interval these linear growth rates obtained from lsa and estimated from the gitt data are presented in table 8 as seen in this table and this figure the results are verified by the fem they show that the imposition of compression axial forces beyond the critical threshold creates a stationary destabilization of the steady state the word stationary here in lsa terminology means a non oscillatory evolution in time fig 8 cannot show a new steady state because eq 1 is a simplified model that does not include the strong nonlinearities required for such a state to be reached 5 3 cpu time comparison since the fem is arguably the most used numerical method to solve complex differential equation models in structural analysis it is important to assess the comparative performance of the gitt solution in order to do so gitt summation series solutions with 8 12 16 20 24 and 28 terms were generated for pinned pinned conditions for a rigid soil using the dimensionless parameters for l 15 m from table 3 absolute errors for η were estimated using a gitt solution with 60 terms as an approximate exact solution where their mean values ε at τ 10 were obtained over the pipeline length for each number of terms the cpu time t c p u required to generate the respective solution in mathematica was also registered a similar procedure was employed with fem where solutions with 6 10 14 18 26 and 30 grid elements were generated and absolute errors were calculated based on a solution with 76 elements used as an approximation to the exact solution fig 9 shows mean absolute error versus cpu time obtained for each number of terms elements in gitt fem as seen it is quite clear that the gitt convergence rate is much higher than its fem counterpart this result is expected due to the use of orthogonal base functions in the gitt solution which leads to a spectral like convergence the fem implementation on the other hand was based on third order polynomials in this study hence it is important to note that increasing the order of these polynomials coupled with improved nonuniform meshing would likely lead to significantly better convergence rates babuska and guo 1992 such a study however is outside the scope of the present paper 6 conclusions the most commonly used methods found in the recent literature to solve differential equation models for pipeline dynamics have important limitations approximate analytical methods are one example they are easily employed but their results often have low accuracy and their utilization is often restricted to simple problems finite element methods fem are another example they can be very accurate and also be used in complex problems but generating solutions is often time consuming two alternative methods were proposed in this study in an attempt to overcome some of these limitations linear stability analysis lsa is one of them although it is strictly valid for small amplitude disturbances it can generate accurate results to complex problems in a simple way the generalized integral transform technique gitt is the other one it can generate accurate results to complex nonlinear problems in an efficient way due to its spectral like convergence in order to compare these three methods they were used to solve a model for a free span pipeline laying on a seabed under the influence of soil conditions and ocean currents natural frequencies were calculated using lsa gitt and fem where the latter was employed for verification purposes all three methods yielded results that are essentially machine precision identical when both boundary conditions were considered with a rigid soil the dnv rp f105 standard was employed for validation purposes leading to maximum relative errors of about 0 1 and 0 02 for pinned pinned and clamped clamped conditions respectively the calculated first natural frequency for the pinned pinned case was smaller than that of the clamped clamped case it was also seen to increase with an increasing soil stiffness and it decrease under the effect of ocean currents these currents also create a dampening effect on pipeline vibration such trends were observed for all of the analyzed pipelines lengths and boundary conditions finally it is important to note that the ocean current model employed assumes that the counter rotating vortices formed as ocean water flows around the pipeline remain attached which restricts current speeds to very small values hence all effects induced by ocean currents described in this study are in fact very small and will be relevant only after large periods of time have passed although the previous results were obtained by considering low amplitude disturbances nonlinear pipeline dynamics were also evaluated using gitt and fem to study the effect of high amplitude disturbances in this scenario the lsa is not directly applicable hence the fem was used to verify the gitt results validation was not possible since the authors were not able to find experimental data in the literature that could be used for comparisons nevertheless in all cases gitt and fem results were essentially machine precision identical due to the large amplitude gaussian excitation asymmetrically placed along the pipeline the first three natural frequencies were simultaneously excited the spectrum around each frequency was very narrow though indicating that nonlinear effects in this model are indeed weak furthermore the amplitude of the unstable mode shape at the peak excitation location determined which natural frequency was dominant for all boundary conditions studied buckling scenarios were also analyzed with lsa gitt and fem the lsa was able to predict the onset of buckling for all boundary conditions these results were verified by gitt and fem which yielded machine precision identical results they were also validated by the dnv rp f105 standard although only for the pinned pinned conditions with a rigid soil it was found that the onset of buckling is not affected by soil stiffness and requires stronger axial forces under clamped clamped conditions finally the efficiency of both gitt and fem was estimated by assessing the cpu time required by each method to generate a solution with a certain average absolute error convergence rates were much higher for gitt than fem this is due to the fact that gitt employed orthogonal base functions whereas the fem used in this study employed third order polynomial base functions hence convergence rates are spectral for the former but they are only algebraic for the latter the fem performance however can be improved upon by using higher order polynomial base functions and nonuniform meshing acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support by the brazilian funding agencies capes cnpq and faperj 
23259,a thorough stability analysis of submerged pipeline dynamics has been performed the problem of current induced vibrations in a free spanning pipeline was analyzed using both linear and non linear methodologies while most investigations dedicated to the analysis of this type of problem use either approximate analytical methods or traditional numerical methods two alternative approaches are presented linear stability analysis lsa and the generalized integral transform technique gitt although strictly valid when the pipeline is subject to small amplitude disturbances lsa is simple to apply and yields accurate either explicit or transcendental analytical relations that predict dominant pipeline vibration frequencies and wavelengths as well as the onset of buckling on the other hand the gitt can predict pipeline behavior for arbitrary disturbance amplitudes more efficiently than traditional numerical methods these features are illustrated by considering the problem of a submerged pipeline subjected to soil conditions and ocean currents this problem was solved using lsa the gitt and the finite element method fem for comparison purposes moreover the dnv rp f105 standard was also used for verifying the proposed methods the alternative methods offered in this paper can overcome limitations associated with traditional analytical and numerical approaches and are employed to produce previously unreported results keywords local and modal linear stability analysis integral transforms natural frequencies buckling 1 introduction free spans are commonly encountered in underwater pipelines that lay on the ocean bottom due to a frequently uneven seabed this particular configuration in association with ocean currents and soil stiffness can greatly accentuate fatigue failure as a result frequency analyses become a crucial part of pipeline design for ensuring pipeline integrity and preventing expensive maintenance nowadays the dnv rp f105 standard dnv rp f105 2006 has been used as major industry guideline in configurations involving free spanning pipelines in spite of the relevance of this international standard it is limited to a number of free span scenarios and in many cases alternative methods are required one common approach to derive the dynamic response of free spanning offshore pipelines is to use approximate analytical methods these are often based on a simplified beam theory and consequently of easy application fyrileiv and mork 2002 approximate methods are still in use as presented in sollund et al 2015a where closed form analytical expressions for the fundamental frequency of short free spans were obtained using dimensional analysis the inherent simplicity of these type of methods has drawbacks since their approximate character can lead to inaccurate solutions limiting their application to simpler problems on the other end of the spectrum traditional numerical schemes such as finite element methods fem huges 1987 zienkiewicz et al 2013 are capable of solving extremely complex problems while still providing good accuracy consequently these methods have been widely used for analyzing subsea pipeline dynamics forbes and reda 2013 santos et al 2014 naturally these methods often require a significant amount of cpu time to meet strict accuracy requirements combining the advantages of numerical and analytical approaches semi analytical methods arise as a powerful alternative to the former ones they can provide improved accuracy for complex nonlinear problems as compared to analytical methods while still consuming a reasonably small amount of cpu time when compared to traditional numerical schemes when looking into free span problems there are some literature studies that employ methods of this kind vedeld et al 2013 presented a semi analytical solution for the harmonic response of pipelines based on the rayleigh ritz approach in combination with a displacement field taken as a fourier series in subsequent studies the dynamic response of both free spanning pipelines sollund et al 2015b as well as multi span pipelines sollund et al 2014 was analyzed using the same methodology two well established semi analytical methods that are particularly interesting for the analysis of underwater pipeline dynamics are the linear stability analysis lsa and the generalized integral transform technique gitt the lsa methodology provides the asymptotic response of dynamical systems when their steady states are subjected to small disturbances this is achieved by transforming the original non linear governing equations into a simpler linear and modal form that is then numerically solved in spite of this simplification the method can still provide highly accurate solutions and be applied to complex problems most lsa applications involve fluids mechanics problems such as convective and absolute asymptotic instabilities huerre and monkewitz 1990 transient disturbance growth due to non monotonic dynamic behavior schmid 2007 and the evaluation of the stability of dynamical systems with two and three dimensional steady states theofilis 2011 there are however studies related to fluid structure interaction problems as well as seen in dowell and hall 2001 while lsa involves the solution of a simpler model derived from the original problem formulation the gitt cotta 1993 addresses the original model in its complete form in which the sough solutions are expressed as series of orthogonal eigenfunctions this hybrid analytical numerical technique is akin to the fem as the solutions are written in terms of basis functions however the usage of orthogonal bases leads to solutions with higher accuracy furthermore it requires no domain discretization many times leading to smaller cpu times the gitt has found numerous applications in heat and fluid flow over the past decades more recently it has also been applied to a variety of dynamical systems such as wind induced vibrations in overhead conductors matt 2009 dynamics of axially moving beams an and su 2011 2014a dynamics of damaged structures matt 2013 vibration in orthotropic plates an and su 2014b pipe dynamics in the presence of two phase flow gu et al 2013 an and su 2015 and general one dimensional distributed systems matt 2015 it is important to highlight that the combined application of integral transforms with linear stability analysis has been previously employed this was first presented in studies focused on the onset of natural convection in porous cavities alves et al 2002 and in superposed fluid and porous layers hirata et al 2006 the former employed a linearization of the integral transformed system whereas the latter linearized the original model prior to the integral transformation processes this second alternative which involves solving the differential eigenvalue problem resulting from the application of lsa using the gitt has also become common in recent years sphaier and barletta 2014 sphaier et al 2015 alves and barletta 2015 although there are a few literature studies that employ generalized integral transforms to problems involving mechanical systems there are no studies related to the application of the gitt to free spans in submerged pipelines let alone combined gitt lsa applications to these types of problems in this context the main purpose of this work can be summarized as two fold i propose lsa as an alternative to approximate analytical methods capable of providing accurate solutions to complex problems while maintaining simplicity of use and small cpu time requirements and i i propose gitt as an alternative to traditional discretization methods that can simulate nonlinear dynamical systems with lower cpu time requirements while still providing highly accurate solutions to complex problems these are demonstrated as feasible alternatives through the analysis of the dynamic response of a free span pipeline on an uneven seabed that is subjected to axial force soil stiffness and seawater movement numerical results are then compared to the dnv rp f105 standard dnv rp f105 2006 and new data for configurations not covered by this standard are provided 2 mathematical model consider a pipeline laying on a seabed subjected to soil conditions and weak ocean currents as sketched in fig 1 a and the corresponding physical model illustrated in fig 1 b where t is the axial force l is the pipeline length k is the soil stiffness and x y are the spatial coordinates the governing equation for the considered model is given by 1 e i 4 y x 4 t 2 y x 2 ρ w c d d 2 u c y t u c y t π 4 ρ m d 2 c m a c f w π 4 ρ w d 2 c a m 2 y t 2 where e is young s modulus i is the moment of inertia ρ w is the seawater density ρ m is the pipeline density c d is the drag coefficient and the outer and inner diameters of the pipeline are d and d i respectively moreover u c and a c are the ocean water current velocity and acceleration whereas m π d 2 d i 2 ρ m 4 is and f w m g are the mass and weight per unit length finally c m is an inertia coefficient c a is an added mass coefficient g is the gravity acceleration and c e i l 2 π ρ w d 2 c a 4 m is the phase speed of a disturbance with wave length l in a pipeline with zero axial force these parameters and variables are then rewritten in dimensionless form using 2a j τ t c d ξ x l η y d β l 2 d 2 α 2 t l 2 e i κ k l 3 e i γ l 4 d e i π 4 ρ m d 2 c m a c f w u u c c and δ ρ w c 2 c d l 4 2 e i such that eq 1 can be re written in dimensionless form as 3 4 η ξ 4 α 2 2 η ξ 2 δ u η τ u η τ γ β 2 η τ 2 one important remark about this equation must be pointed out only cases with u 1 can be considered because the pipeline current interaction model used in eq 3 assumes that the ocean current exerts a force on the pipeline that is proportional to the pipeline transversal velocity hence no vortex induced vibrations viv are herein considered this imposes re ρ w u c d μ w 48 as an approximate upper limit for the maximum value of the reynolds number of the ocean flow around the pipeline where μ w is the dynamic viscosity of ocean water nevertheless one should point out that this constraint is only approximate because it is strictly valid for a two dimensional straight pipeline different pipeline soil interactions are analyzed using distinct combinations of boundary conditions a first scenario considers a generalized pinned condition where the soil stiffness allows vertical motion proportional to the shear force but there is still no bending moment at the boundaries 4a 3 η ξ 3 κ η and 2 η ξ 2 0 at ξ 0 4b 3 η ξ 3 κ η and 2 η ξ 2 0 at ξ 1 a second configuration considers a generalized clamped condition where the soil stiffness also allows vertical motion proportional to shear force but there is still no slope at the boundaries 5a 3 η ξ 3 κ η and η ξ 0 at ξ 0 5b 3 η ξ 3 κ η and η ξ 0 at ξ 1 naturally both models can lead to the classical pinned and clamped conditions if one considers the limit where κ tends to infinity thus eliminating any soil elasticity accordingly four boundary condition cases will be analyzed namely the two generalized pinned and clamped models denoted elastic soil cases and the corresponding classical cases with a rigid soil at the boundaries regardless of the boundary condition case equation 3 admits the general steady state solution 6 η b ξ c 1 e α ξ c 2 e α ξ c 3 c 4 ξ γ δ u 2 2 α 2 ξ 2 where the constants c 1 to c 4 depend on the imposed boundary conditions now that the mathematical model has been clearly defined the dynamic response of a pipeline governed by eq 3 and boundary conditions 4 5 will be analyzed under different parametric conditions whenever required the initial condition is defined as the steady state given by eq 6 superposed to a linear perturbation which is described in the next section within this mathematical framework the dynamic responses predicted by lsa gitt and fem are compared in terms of solution accuracy and the cpu time required to generate these solutions at this point it is important to highlight that only cases with a rigid soil are known in the literature the other situations are unreported as far as the authors are aware 3 linear stability analysis dynamical systems subject to supercritical bifurcations can be analyzed through linear stability analysis where it is assumed that any deviation from a known steady state of this system is caused by small disturbances such an assumption allows the derivation of a linearized disturbance governing equation these equations can be further simplified by assuming that the disturbances take the form of normal modes in homogeneous coordinates according to these steps the pipeline dimensionless displacement can be written as 7 η ξ τ η b ξ ε η n ξ e i ω τ where η b ξ is given by eq 6 ε is the disturbance amplitude parameter η n ξ is the disturbance eigenfunction ω is the disturbance eigenvalue and i 1 the real part of ω is the frequency whereas its imaginary part represents the growth rate and η n ξ is the shape of the disturbance substituting eq 7 into the term which includes the absolute value operator in eq 3 leads to 8 u η τ u i ε ω η n ξ e i ω τ u ε ω η n ξ sin ω τ i ε ω η n ξ cos ω τ u ε ω η n ξ sin ω τ 2 ε ω η n ξ cos ω τ 2 u 2 2 ε ω η n ξ sin ω τ ε ω η n ξ 2 in which the identities exp i a cos a i sin a a b i a 2 b 2 and sin a 2 cos a 2 1 have been employed with a and b being real numbers if one assumes small frequencies i e ω o ε it is possible to approximate this expression as 9 u η τ u o ε 2 using a taylor series expansion a similar procedure has been used before when modeling thermal instabilities in power law fluids alves and barletta 2013 hence the linearized normal mode approximate version of eq 3 is 10 d 4 η n d ξ 4 α 2 d 2 η n d ξ 2 i δ u ω β ω 2 η n 0 which is obtained by substituting eqs 7 and 9 into eq 3 and grouping the o ε terms solutions to this equation depend on the imposed boundary conditions which are discussed next 3 1 pinned pinned with rigid soil when both edges of the pipeline are pinned down the disturbance amplitude boundary conditions are derived from eq 4 with κ to yield 11a η n 0 and d 2 η n d ξ 2 0 at ξ 0 11b η n 0 and d 2 η n d ξ 2 0 at ξ 1 which lead to the solution 12 η n ξ m 1 η m sin λ m ξ with sin λ m 0 where the latter yields λ m m π with m being a positive integer since all boundary conditions in 11 are homogeneous solution 12 can be substituted into eq 10 to yield 13 m 1 η m i δ u ω β ω 2 λ m 4 α 2 λ m 2 sin λ m ξ 0 which can only be true when the dispersion relation 14

previous equations ω ω r i ω i where ω r and ω i are the pipeline disturbance frequency and growth rate respectively equation 15 have four solutions namely 16a ω r 4 β λ m 4 α 2 λ m 2 δ 2 u 2 2 β and ω i δ u 2 β 16b ω r 0 and ω i δ u 2 β δ 2 u 2 4 β λ m 4 α 2 λ m 2 2 β nonetheless the relevant solutions among these are the ones that yield real values for ω r and ω i with the further requirement that the former is non negative it must be noted that the small frequency hypothesis used to obtain eq 9 is justified by solutions 16 as l d in most applications of interest i e β 1 when α 2 δ 2 u 2 4 β λ m 2 λ m 2 solution 16a with re ω r 0 is the correct one since it guarantees that im ω r 0 nevertheless an increase in either u or δ from zero produces two significant effects 1 it reduces the pipeline vibration frequency and 2 it damps any pipeline vibrations finally although multiple frequencies can be generated in this problem the case with λ 1 π leads to the most likely observable frequency on the other hand if α 2 δ 2 u 2 4 β λ m 2 λ m 2 both solutions in eq 16b become the correct ones instead since this guarantees that im ω i 0 they are both stable when α 2 λ m 2 as well however one of the solutions becomes unstable when α 2 λ m 2 the most unstable condition is achieved when m 1 where λ 1 π which leads to the classical formula dnv rp f105 2006 for the compressive tension required for buckling i e t b π 2 e i l 2 finally it is interesting to notice that buckling occurs under stationary conditions since ω r 0 3 2 clamped clamped with rigid soil when both edges of the pipeline are clamped down the disturbance amplitude boundary conditions are derived from eq 5 with κ to yield 17a η n 0 and d η n d ξ 0 at ξ 0 17b η n 0 and d η n d ξ 0 at ξ 1 whose solution can be obtained with the usual method of the characteristic equation leading to 18 η n ξ c 1 e λ ξ c 2 e λ ξ c 3 e λ ξ c 4 e λ ξ where the two new parameters are defined as 19 λ α 2 2 α 2 2 2 i δ u ω β ω 2 since eq 10 subjected to boundary conditions 17 represents an eigenvalue problem it is undetermined up to a constant hence in the present case c 4 1 is arbitrarily imposed to fix this scale invariance the first three boundary conditions in 17 are then used to solve for the remaining constants yielding 20a c 1 e λ e 2 λ λ λ λ e λ λ λ 2 e λ λ λ 1 e 2 λ λ 1 2 e λ λ e 2 λ 20b c 2 e λ λ 1 e 2

generate the dispersion relation 21 λ 2 λ 2 sinh λ sinh λ 2 λ λ 1 cosh λ cosh λ 0 which yields the values of ω r and ω i after all control parameters have been prescribed that satisfy both real and imaginary parts of this relation in this work the mathematica wolfram 2003 function findroot was used to solve eq 21 this function uses a newton raphson scheme to obtain the desired roots 3 3 pinned pinned with elastic soil when both edges of the pipeline are pinned down on an elastic soil with finite stiffness the disturbance amplitude boundary conditions are derived from eq 4 considering finite values for κ to yield 22a d 3 η n d ξ 3 κ η n and d 2 η n d ξ 2 0 at ξ 0 22b d 3 η n d ξ 3 κ η n and d 2 η n d ξ 2 0 at ξ 1 whose solution can be obtained using the same procedure described in subsection 3 2 it leads to the new dispersion relation 23 2 κ λ 2 λ 3 λ 2 λ 2 sinh λ cosh λ κ 2 λ 2 λ 2 2 λ sinh λ sinh λ 2 κ λ 3 λ 2 λ 2 λ 2 cosh λ sinh λ 2 λ 5 λ 5 1 cosh λ cosh λ 0 that is solved once again using findroot taking the limit when κ one obtains the dispersion relation 24 λ 2 λ 2 2 sinh λ sinh λ 0 which is an alternative but equivalent version of eq 14 3 4 clamped clamped with elastic soil when both edges of the pipeline are clamped down on an elastic soil with finite stiffness the disturbance amplitude boundary conditions are derived from eq 5 considering finite values for

the new dispersion relation 26 κ 2 λ 2 λ 2 λ 2 λ 2 λ 2 λ 2 2 sinh λ sinh λ 2 κ λ λ 2 λ 2 λ 2 sinh λ cosh λ 2 κ 2 λ λ 1 cosh λ cosh λ 2 κ λ 2 λ λ 2 λ 2 sinh λ cosh λ 0 that is solved once more using findroot as similarly done for the previous case it is interesting to note the limit κ leads to eq 21 4 generalized integral transform technique the original nonlinear problem defined by eq 3 can be solved with the generalized integral transform technique cotta 1993 in the context of the linear stability analysis presented in the previous sections gitt can also be understood as a technique for a nonlinear stability analysis of the same model the method seeks a solution for this problem in terms of an orthogonal eigenfunction expansion and an associated transformation relation known as the inverse transform pair 27a inverse η ξ τ i 0 η i τ ψ i ξ 27b transform η i τ 0 1 η ξ τ ψ i ξ d ξ where ψ i are normalized orthogonal eigenfunctions that arise from the solution of the bi harmonic eigenproblem given by 28 d 4 ψ i d ξ 4 μ i 4 ψ i 0 and homogeneous boundary conditions based on the ones from the original problem for the generalized pinned pinned situation this corresponds to 29a d 3 ψ i d ξ 3 κ ψ i and d 2 ψ i d ξ 2 0 at ξ 0 29b d 3 ψ i d ξ 3 κ ψ i and d 2 ψ i d ξ 2 0 at ξ 1 whereas for the generalized clamped clamped situation they are given by 30a d 3 ψ i d ξ 3 κ ψ i and d ψ i d ξ 0 at ξ 0 30b d 3 ψ i d ξ 3 κ ψ i and d ψ i d ξ 0 at ξ 1 noting that the special case of a rigid soil can be recovered when κ finally these eigenfunctions must also satisfy the orthonormality condition 31 0 1 ψ i ξ ψ j ξ d ξ δ i j the integral transformation of the problem is then carried out by multiplying eq 3 by ψ i and integrating the result over the domain length leading to 32 0 1 4 η ξ 4 ψ i d ξ α 2 0 1 2 η ξ 2 ψ i d ξ δ 0 1 u η τ u η τ ψ i d ξ 0 1 γ ψ i d ξ β 0 1 2 η τ 2 ψ i d ξ then integrating by parts to the first two terms yields 33 0 1 ψ i 4 η ξ 4 d ξ ψ i 3 η ξ 3 ψ i 2 η ξ 2 ξ 0 ξ 1 0 1 ψ i 2 η ξ 2 d ξ ψ i 3 η ξ 3 ψ i 2 η ξ 2 ψ i η ξ ψ i η ξ 0 ξ 1 0 1 ψ i i v η d ξ 33b 0 1 ψ i 2 η ξ 2 d ξ ψ i η ξ ψ i η ξ 0 ξ 1 0 1 ψ i η d ξ which can then be reduced to 34a 0 1 ψ i 4 η ξ 4 d ξ 0 1 ψ i i v η d ξ μ i 4 0 1 ψ i η d ξ 34b 0 1 ψ i 2 η ξ 2 d ξ 0 1 ψ i η d ξ due to the homogeneous nature of the boundary conditions for η and ψ i when substituting eq 34 and transformation 27b into eq 32 one obtains 35 μ i 4 η i α 2 0 1 η ψ i d ξ δ 0 1 u η τ u η τ ψ i d ξ 0 1 γ ψ i d ξ β d 2 η i d τ 2 leaving only non transformable terms as functions of η this direct dependence is removed by applying the inversion formula 27a to all terms but the one containing the absolute value operator which yields the coupled system of odes 36 μ i 4 η i α 2 j 0 a i j η j δ j 0 0 1 u η τ u δ i j d η j d τ ψ j ψ i d ξ γ i β d 2 η i d τ 2 for i 1 2 in which the integral coefficients are defined as 37a a i j 0 1 ψ i ψ j d ξ 37b γ i 0 1 γ ψ i d ξ next in order to facilitate the transformation of the remaining non transformable term its integration region is first divided into sub regions according to 38 0 1 u η τ d ξ m 1 m ξ m 1 ξ m u η τ d ξ where ξ m is defined by 39 ξ m m m allowing the term involving the absolute value operator to be accurately approximated by its value at the middle of each sub region applying this second order approximation to eq 38 and using the inversion formula 27a to the result leads to 40 0 1 u η τ u δ i j d η j d τ ψ j ψ i d ξ m 1 m u k 0 d η k d τ ψ k ξ m 1 2 ξ m 1 ξ m u δ i j d η j d τ ψ j ψ i d ξ such that the transformed system 36 can be re written as 41 μ i 4 η i α 2 j 0 a i j η j γ i δ j 0 m 1 m u k 0 j m k d η k d τ u δ i j g i m j h i m j d η j d τ β d 2 η i d τ 2 where the additional integral coefficients are given by 42a j m k ψ k ξ m 1 2 42b g i m j ξ m 1 ξ m ψ i d ξ 42c h i m j ξ m 1 ξ m ψ j ψ i d ξ finally the transformed initial conditions can be obtained by multiplying the initial condition e g a steady pipeline subject to a given disturbance by ψ i and integrating over the domain length this process yields 43 η i τ 0 ϕ i 0 1 η b ε η n ψ i d ξ where ϕ i is another integral coefficient the ode system 41 subjected to initial conditions 43 are then solved using the mathematica wolfram 2003 function ndsolve this function uses a solution methodology that selects between different marching schemes depending on how stiff is the ode system and guarantees a user prescribed accuracy by automatically adjusting the time step and accuracy order throughout the simulation once a finite number of η i are calculated the inversion relation 27a truncated to the same finite number is used to generate η this finite number of η i is selected based on accuracy considerations involving convergence of the summation series solution it should be noted that eq 27a also requires the normalized eigenfunctions ψ i which are discussed next 4 1 eigenvalue problem normalized eigenfunctions ψ i can also be obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem defined by eqs 28 30 for the original eigenfunction ψ i i e without normalization and then employing relations 44 ψ i ψ i n i 45 n i 0 1 ψ i 2 d ξ where n i is the norm solutions for ψ i under the different boundary conditions herein considered are presented next 4 1 1 pinned pinned with rigid soil using eq 4 with κ the eigenfunctions are given by 46 ψ i sinh μ i sin μ i ξ sin μ i sinh μ i

sin μ μ 6 are also obtained using findroot 4 1 4 clamped clamped with elastic soil using eq 5 with finite κ values the eigenfunctions are given by 51 ψ i sinh μ i ξ 2 μ i 3 sinh μ i κ cos μ i cosh μ i

transcendental equation 52 μ 3 sinh μ 2 κ cos μ 2 μ 3 sin μ cosh μ 2 κ μ 3 sin μ κ 2 cos μ κ 2 0 which are again solved using findroot 5 results and discussion both methodologies proposed in this paper for the study of pipeline dynamics must be verified and validated verification is performed by direct comparison to numerical results generated with a finite element method fem implementation since the lsa and gitt implementations were coded within the mathematica environment wolfram 2003 a fem code was also built using mathematica as a result proper cpu time comparisons between all three methods become possible the domain used by the fem is divided in a finite number of sub domains of uniform size where this number is chosen based on accuracy considerations furthermore the base functions used in each sub domain are third order polynomials following traditional galerkin implementations huges 1987 zienkiewicz et al 2013 once the system of odes is formed with the fem it is also solved using ndsolve while the verification of the current methodology can be readily performed validation requires comparisons with experimental data unfortunately due to an apparent lack of experimental results related to the presented cases in the literature a direct validation was unfeasible nevertheless the classical pinned pinned boundary condition case is indeed included in the international standard dnv rp f105 dnv rp f105 2006 since international standards generally require proper validation comparisons of the current results with those obtained from this standard are used as validation of the proposed methodologies in order to verify and validate the ability of both methodologies to simulate pipeline dynamics parametric conditions must be imposed the load pipeline material and dimension were selected based on common values for this type of application which usually employs a rust free uncoated steel pipeline immersed in the ocean the additional term a c in eq 1 is considered null for the sake of simplicity as already discussed in section 2 the maximum current speed allowed by this equation must be small since the model constraints require re 48 thus u c is considered null for simplicity s sake as well nevertheless the effect of the damping term in eq 3 does not vanish with u c 0 values for the remaining parameters c a c d and c m are taken from the dnv rp f105 design code dnv rp f105 2006 the required properties for the present study are given in table 1 the soil stiffness coefficient κ is calculated based on three types of soils stiffness k taken from the dnv rp f105 standard dnv rp f105 2006 as provided in table 2 based on these properties the resulting dimensionless parameters are given in table 3 as functions of the pipeline length l these are the parameters used in the simulations unless stated otherwise 5 1 dynamic pipeline response 5 1 1 small amplitude disturbances having established adequate values for the control parameters in the previous section it is now possible to analyze the dynamic pipeline response using the previously described methods the first step in this direction is to investigate the steady state η b ξ response when the pipeline is subjected to small disturbances in this context the lsa should yield very accurate predictions since this technique is specifically designed for this scenario naturally the gitt and fem solutions should produce the same results as the non linear effects are negligible for small disturbances this section is devoted to the first natural frequency calculation which is performed using the dimensionless parameters in table 3 table 4 compares lsa results and the dnv rp f105 standard dnv rp f105 2006 for κ as can be seen there is an outstanding agreement between with the standard for both sets of boundary conditions where a maximum error around 0 1 is seen for the pined pined case and about 0 02 is seen for the clamped clamped case natural frequency calculations with the gitt and the fem are straightforward as well since both techniques solve a system of odes in the form of q τ a q τ b q τ c o q τ 2 where q represents an arbitrary variable vector a and b coefficient matrices and c a coefficient vector natural frequencies can be extracted from the eigenvalues of b the results for the first natural frequency are not shown here because they yield maximum absolute errors of o 10 10 for the gitt and o 10 8 for the fem comparing to the lsa results these numbers were obtained using 60 terms in the truncated summation series solution of the gitt and 76 elements in the fem discretization additional results are presented in fig 2 for the first natural frequency as function of the pipeline length under parametric conditions interpolated from table 3 using a sixth order polynomial lines represent lsa results and points represent fem results as one can observe the natural frequency f decreases with increasing length l as expected furthermore oscillation frequencies in clamped clamped conditions are notably higher than the ones in pinned pinned conditions this is also expected due to the translational and rotational coupling restraints at the boundaries associated with the clamped conditions table 5 shows lsa results for the first natural frequency as function of pipeline length based on parameters from table 3 but now considering an elastic soil again the frequency decays with increasing l however lower values are generally obtained when compared to the infinite κ cases although a standard is not available for validation in this case these results are inherently verified since both gitt and fem results are essentially equal to the lsa results as was the case in table 4 fig 3 is similar to fig 2 but now an elastic soil is considered once again the first natural frequency decreases with pipeline length as further observed these frequencies increase as soil stiffness increases this effect is also stronger under clamped clamped conditions where the respective frequencies are higher as well in both cases however this effect is only noticeable for small pipeline lengths finally it is worth emphasizing that the fem results perfectly overlap the lsa data as was verified in fig 2 for a rigid soil 5 1 2 effect of current velocity the influence of ocean current velocity on pipeline vibration is now examined although already mentioned in the model section it is worth recalling that eq 1 does not take viv effects into account in other words the ocean current model used in this equation is only valid when the counter rotating vortices induced by the ocean flow around the pipeline remain stationary for straight pipelines such a model is valid as long as re 48 even though neither steady η b ξ nor unsteady η ξ τ pipelines remain straight this model is still assumed valid because η 1 is true for all τ values simulated in this study according to the parametric conditions imposed by table 1 this model limits u c to very small values however much higher values are herein employed otherwise this effect would be too small to be observed in a figure hence it is important to emphasize that the goal here is only to point out qualitative but not quantitative trends induced by ocean currents that generate stationary vortices that remain attached to the pipeline since all boundary conditions considered in this study lead to the same trends induced by current velocities the discussion that follows is based on the analytical expressions presented in eq 16 hence the conclusions drawn here are restricted to the presence of small amplitude disturbances the first trend is associated with pipeline frequency increasing u decreases its natural frequency this is however a very small effect since 4 β λ 1 4 δ 2 u 2 in general in order to illustrate this trend the first natural frequency as a function of pipeline length is shown in fig 4 for pinned pinned conditions with κ using the parameters from table 3 using two different current speeds u c 0 m s no current and u c 13 m s as can be seen even though the nonzero current velocity is significantly higher than allowed by the re 48 constraint differences in natural frequencies with and without currents can only be observed for very high pipeline lengths hence the pipeline natural frequency weakly decreases with an increasing current speed this is likely related to the fact that the counter rotating vortices are stationary i e they do not induce any oscillatory excitation on the pipeline that could significantly modify its natural frequencies finally it is important to note that these results were obtained with the lsa and verified with the fem the second trend that can be inferred from eq 16 which is also valid for the other boundary conditions is related to the pipeline stability since β δ and u are greater than zero small disturbances are always damped when the current speed is nonzero however this damping effect is also very small since β δ and u 1 in order to illustrate this result the transient evolution of a small disturbance is shown in fig 5 for the l 15 m parametric conditions in table 3 with u c 0 and u c 3 01 the disturbance shape eigenfunction is related to the first natural frequency eigenvalue and its asymptotic behavior in time is tracked at ξ 0 5 as observed it is quite clear that a nonzero current speed creates a damping effect since the amplification rate of the disturbance amplitude is negative without an ocean current disturbance amplitude does not vary this result might seem counterintuitive from a viv perspective but the model used here only accounts for attached counter rotating vortices which naturally induce a damping effect on the pipeline such an effect is very important in fatigue analysis since higher oscillation amplitudes lead to shorter pipeline lifespans finally the lsa could not be used to generate this figure because it is a time asymptotic analysis and hence cannot simulate initial value problems nevertheless these results are generated with the gitt and verified with the fem 5 1 3 large amplitude disturbances when the steady state solution η b ξ is subjected to large amplitude disturbances gitt and fem results should deviate from lsa predictions due to their ability to capture nonlinear effects in this scenario new phenomena are expected for instance several modes predicted by the lsa could be simultaneously excited additionally a broad band spectrum should be found around each mode where this broadness should be proportional to the amount of damping associated with each natural frequency table 6 shows the first three natural frequencies calculated by lsa for all four boundary conditions examined in this study all cases were calculated with l 15 m and u 0 the finite κ configuration were calculated using k 250 kn m m as can be seen resulting frequencies for all modes are higher for the case with a rigid soil also the clamped clamped configuration yields frequencies higher than those of the pinned pinned setup following the same trends observed in the previous sections in order to quantify the nonlinear effects the gitt is used to simulate the unsteady dynamics of a pipeline subjected to an initial condition with ε 10 and η n ξ exp 150 ξ 0 25 2 in eq 43 under the same parametric conditions used to calculate the lsa results in table 6 fig 6 shows the power spectra of this unsteady data extracted at ξ 0 2 for all four boundary conditions as one can observe the peak amplitude locations in the spectra coincide with predicted lsa results however the spectra is not broad around these frequencies and higher harmonics are also not observed despite the large amplitude of the initial disturbance this is likely due to the fact that eq 3 is only weakly nonlinear finally it is important to note that the gitt results are again verified by the fem results another point worth noting is that mode amplitudes depend strongly on the chosen boundary condition even though the same initial disturbance was used for all cases this can be explained by the data sampling location and mode shapes which are shown in fig 7 for the pinned pinned conditions as seen the first and second modes have approximately the same amplitude at ξ 2 for a rigid soil κ which is also higher than the first mode amplitude on the other hand the second first and third mode amplitudes are increasingly smaller at the same location with an elastic soil finite κ both trends are observed in fig 6 in terms of power spectra amplitude although not shown here the same applies to the clamped clamped condition 5 2 buckling scenarios when the pipeline is subjected to large enough compressive axial forces its steady state can become unstable causing the pipeline to transition to another steady state characterized by significant structural bending this phenomenon known as buckling can be predicted by both the lsa and gitt in the former case one must solve real and imaginary parts of eq 10 while imposing ω i 0 to find the values of real variables ω r and α 2 at the onset of instability for the pinned pinned case shown in section 3 1 this onset can be predicted analytically otherwise this must be done numerically table 7 displays these critical α c 2 values obtained with the lsa for all four boundary conditions using the parameters defined in table 3 these are the critical values for the onset of buckling because all conditions also yield ω r c 0 this data was verified by the gitt and the fem these results show that soil stiffness does not affect the onset of buckling which requires stronger axial forces to occur for clamped clamped boundary conditions further comparisons between lsa gitt and fem are now performed under a buckling scenario using simulations for pinned pinned α c 2 10 and clamped clamped α c 2 40 conditions for a rigid soil with β 2145 33 γ 0 δ 232 85 and u 0 the initial condition was composed of a disturbance with ε 10 4 and the first mode shape superposed to the steady state transient data for η ξ τ extracted at ξ 0 5 was then used in a nonlinear regression using the mathematica built in function findfit wolfram 2003 this is based on a least squared error minimization of the data which is approximated with the user defined function f τ a b exp ω i τ to extract the growth rate ω i where a and b are arbitrary constants it is important to note that the data interval used was 30 τ 100 both bounds are introduced with different purposes a high enough lower bound prevents the unwanted but unavoidable excitation of additional modes from reducing the estimated first mode growth rate accuracy by increasing the standard deviation in the estimation process however a low enough upper bound maintains nonlinear effects negligible allowing an accurate calculation of the linear growth rate the dimensionless pipeline displacement at ξ 0 5 over time calculated using the gitt for both boundary conditions is shown in fig 8 which qualitatively reveals the first mode linear growth rate within the chosen time interval these linear growth rates obtained from lsa and estimated from the gitt data are presented in table 8 as seen in this table and this figure the results are verified by the fem they show that the imposition of compression axial forces beyond the critical threshold creates a stationary destabilization of the steady state the word stationary here in lsa terminology means a non oscillatory evolution in time fig 8 cannot show a new steady state because eq 1 is a simplified model that does not include the strong nonlinearities required for such a state to be reached 5 3 cpu time comparison since the fem is arguably the most used numerical method to solve complex differential equation models in structural analysis it is important to assess the comparative performance of the gitt solution in order to do so gitt summation series solutions with 8 12 16 20 24 and 28 terms were generated for pinned pinned conditions for a rigid soil using the dimensionless parameters for l 15 m from table 3 absolute errors for η were estimated using a gitt solution with 60 terms as an approximate exact solution where their mean values ε at τ 10 were obtained over the pipeline length for each number of terms the cpu time t c p u required to generate the respective solution in mathematica was also registered a similar procedure was employed with fem where solutions with 6 10 14 18 26 and 30 grid elements were generated and absolute errors were calculated based on a solution with 76 elements used as an approximation to the exact solution fig 9 shows mean absolute error versus cpu time obtained for each number of terms elements in gitt fem as seen it is quite clear that the gitt convergence rate is much higher than its fem counterpart this result is expected due to the use of orthogonal base functions in the gitt solution which leads to a spectral like convergence the fem implementation on the other hand was based on third order polynomials in this study hence it is important to note that increasing the order of these polynomials coupled with improved nonuniform meshing would likely lead to significantly better convergence rates babuska and guo 1992 such a study however is outside the scope of the present paper 6 conclusions the most commonly used methods found in the recent literature to solve differential equation models for pipeline dynamics have important limitations approximate analytical methods are one example they are easily employed but their results often have low accuracy and their utilization is often restricted to simple problems finite element methods fem are another example they can be very accurate and also be used in complex problems but generating solutions is often time consuming two alternative methods were proposed in this study in an attempt to overcome some of these limitations linear stability analysis lsa is one of them although it is strictly valid for small amplitude disturbances it can generate accurate results to complex problems in a simple way the generalized integral transform technique gitt is the other one it can generate accurate results to complex nonlinear problems in an efficient way due to its spectral like convergence in order to compare these three methods they were used to solve a model for a free span pipeline laying on a seabed under the influence of soil conditions and ocean currents natural frequencies were calculated using lsa gitt and fem where the latter was employed for verification purposes all three methods yielded results that are essentially machine precision identical when both boundary conditions were considered with a rigid soil the dnv rp f105 standard was employed for validation purposes leading to maximum relative errors of about 0 1 and 0 02 for pinned pinned and clamped clamped conditions respectively the calculated first natural frequency for the pinned pinned case was smaller than that of the clamped clamped case it was also seen to increase with an increasing soil stiffness and it decrease under the effect of ocean currents these currents also create a dampening effect on pipeline vibration such trends were observed for all of the analyzed pipelines lengths and boundary conditions finally it is important to note that the ocean current model employed assumes that the counter rotating vortices formed as ocean water flows around the pipeline remain attached which restricts current speeds to very small values hence all effects induced by ocean currents described in this study are in fact very small and will be relevant only after large periods of time have passed although the previous results were obtained by considering low amplitude disturbances nonlinear pipeline dynamics were also evaluated using gitt and fem to study the effect of high amplitude disturbances in this scenario the lsa is not directly applicable hence the fem was used to verify the gitt results validation was not possible since the authors were not able to find experimental data in the literature that could be used for comparisons nevertheless in all cases gitt and fem results were essentially machine precision identical due to the large amplitude gaussian excitation asymmetrically placed along the pipeline the first three natural frequencies were simultaneously excited the spectrum around each frequency was very narrow though indicating that nonlinear effects in this model are indeed weak furthermore the amplitude of the unstable mode shape at the peak excitation location determined which natural frequency was dominant for all boundary conditions studied buckling scenarios were also analyzed with lsa gitt and fem the lsa was able to predict the onset of buckling for all boundary conditions these results were verified by gitt and fem which yielded machine precision identical results they were also validated by the dnv rp f105 standard although only for the pinned pinned conditions with a rigid soil it was found that the onset of buckling is not affected by soil stiffness and requires stronger axial forces under clamped clamped conditions finally the efficiency of both gitt and fem was estimated by assessing the cpu time required by each method to generate a solution with a certain average absolute error convergence rates were much higher for gitt than fem this is due to the fact that gitt employed orthogonal base functions whereas the fem used in this study employed third order polynomial base functions hence convergence rates are spectral for the former but they are only algebraic for the latter the fem performance however can be improved upon by using higher order polynomial base
