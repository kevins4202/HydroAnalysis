6715,tropical montane areas of southeast asia are exposed to high intensity rainfall during the monsoon period this is particularly problematic in areas where soils on steep slopes are cultivated as it can lead to heavy runoff high soil erosion and water pollution the objective of this paper is to analyse the effect of the impact of raindrops on the dynamics of runoff on such steep fields experiments under simulated rainfall were performed at the plot scale 1 m2 to quantify water export from the surface of upland agricultural soils during overland flow events four 1 m2 plots were divided in duplicated treatment groups a control with no amendments and b amended with pig manure each plot was divided into two 0 5 m2 rectangular subplots one subplot was designated as a rain splash treatment the other sub plot was covered with a 2 mm grid size wire screen that was located 12 cm above the soil surface the purpose of the screen was to break the raindrops into fine droplets and to reduce fall height in order to drastically reduce their kinetic energy runoff was measured for each sub plot the results show that raindrop impact drastically enhances runoff generation on both bare soils and on manure amended soils when the impact of raindrops was limited by screening runoff was higher on amended soils than on bare soils the temporal evolution of runoff was correctly modelled using a soil hydraulic conductivity that exponentially decreases over time of exposure to rainfall both experimental and modelling results showed that droplet energy induces a rapid evolution of the hydraulic properties of the soil surface due to crusting resulting in a reduction of hydraulic conductivity and a concomitant increase in runoff rate keywords runoff modelling raindrop impact hydraulic conductivity soil crusting tropical agro ecosystems lao pdr 1 introduction high intensity rainfall such as occurs during tropical monsoons induces reduced infiltration in bare soils valentin 1991 silburn and connoly 1995 assouline and mualem 1997 fohrer et al 1999 this is due to the fact that when a raindrop impacts a bare soil surface its kinetic energy is transferred to the soil surface where it can induce soil compaction aggregate destruction particle detachment and splashing the raindrop impact threshold related to a critical kinetic energy specific for each soil type needs to be overcome in order to initiate and support soil detachment armenise et al 2018 the formation of structural crusts at the surface of bare soils subject to the impact of raindrops depends on the soil properties rainfall characteristics flow conditions e g valentin and bresson 1992 assouline 2004 and also on the slope gradient ribolzi et al 2011 if fine particles resulting from detachment and or aggregate destruction are redistributed at the surface or transported by infiltrated water into the upper layer of the soil they can clog the porosity the formation of this surface seal drastically reduces infiltration during rainfall assouline and mualem 1997 surface sealing depends on soil properties presence and characteristics of aggregate and organic matter at the soil surface land use practices rawls et al 1990 and references therein but also on rainfall intensity and drop characteristics assouline and mualem 1997 lacombe et al 2018 all of which can have important implications for soil erosion and overland flow dynamics and water quality particularly in areas with steep slopes and where land use change has led to large areas of bare soil valentin et al 2008 vigiak et al 2008 ziegler et al 2009 ribolzi et al 2017 in order to quantify the raindrop impact on runoff ziegler et al 2000 performed rainfall simulation experiments on plots covered or not with a wire screen these authors showed that even on highly compacted road surfaces rain splash enhanced runoff they attributed this enhancement to the sealing of the surface by redistribution of already detached materials an et al 2012 using a similar method also observed that runoff rates were reduced during rainfall when the raindrop impact was reduced by a net only gentle slope gradients 18 were investigated both ziegler et al 2000 and an et al 2012 focused their study on erosion none of them modelled runoff enhancement by splash effect experimental studies have yielded contradictory results about the effect of presence of manure on the soil surface on infiltration on one hand reductions of infiltration have been observed on manured soils this was proposed to be a consequence of the plugging of pores by manure particles at the soil surface bottom et al 1986 on the other hand studies showed infiltration increases after application of manure mostaghimi et al 1989 gilley and risse 2000 with an increasing effect with the manure application rates this behaviour was explained by the protecting effect of the manure applied at the soil surface which reduced the sealing raindrop impact roberts and clanton 2000 however given that the texture and water content of manure varies as a function of the source and probably the diet of the species in question the differences observed may also be due to differences in manure source moreover variability in soil type and texture probably also play an important role physically based models that numerically solve mass and momentum conservation equations have been widely developed and used in hydrology an overview of these models and their applications have recently been discussed by paniconi and putti 2015 and by fatichi et al 2016 these models are particularly useful for simulating the partitioning between infiltration and runoff a first attempt to couple overland flow and soil infiltration models was made by smith and woolhiser 1971 this approach was successfully tested on laboratory and field experiments the resulting event oriented physically based runoff and erosion model kineros is still used today woolhiser et al 1990 ziegler et al 2000 gal et al 2017 because they allow to test more or less sophisticated hypothesis on the runoff generation physically based models are interesting tools to interpret experiments for example the incorporation of time dependent hydraulic conductivity functions allows simulation of the evolution of a physical seal layer on the soil surface silburn and connoly 1995 assouline 2004 in another study the cast3m numerical code was used to test various roughness models to simulate overland flow experiments at plot scale mügler et al 2011 the purpose of this paper is to answer by both experimental and modelling approaches to the following questions how much does the raindrop impact modify runoff on steep slope bare fields does manure protect or on the contrary enhance the degradation of the surface soils during rainfall events is this degradation amplified by successive rainfall events in this paper the materials and methods section presents the experiments and the modelling approach measured and modelled runoff rate are compared in the results section this comparison is followed by a general discussion of the relative influence of raindrop impact manure presence and successive rainfalls on runoff rates 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiments 2 1 1 study area the rain simulation experiments were carried out in the houay pano catchment 67 ha located at 102 09 50 e 19 51 00 n about ten kilometres from luang prabang north laos the elevation ranges from 400 m to 750 m above mean sea level the mean slope gradient of the catchment is 52 ribolzi et al 2011 the climate is tropical sub humid with an average annual temperature of 25 3 c ribolzi et al 2011 average annual precipitation is approximately 1260 mm and is characterized by high rain intensities of up to 280 mm h 1 valentin et al 2008 alfisols ultisols and entisols occur over about 50 30 and 20 of the catchment area respectively ribolzi et al 2011 the experimental plots described in the following section are located on alfisols agricultural practice and land use are typical of north laos with a slash and burn system of production rouw et al 2014 over the last 15 years land use has changed from crops job s tears maize upland rice and fallow toward teak plantations huon et al 2013 ribolzi et al 2017 2 1 2 experimental design experiments were performed on four 1 m2 plots installed on a steep slope 47 2 of the upper part of the catchment fig 1 the site was covered with fallow from 2005 to 2010 and upland rice during 2011 however this was harvested and the residues burned several months prior to the experiment soil texture was measured using the pipette method of olmstead et al 1930 three replicate measurements were conducted per treatment however given the proximity of the plots to each other and their location on the hillslope along the same topographic level the measurements can almost be considered as being 12 replicates of the same soil the soil characteristics slope texture and porosity are given in table 1 soils exhibited a clay loam texture each plot was divided into two sub plots 1 m downslope 0 5 m perpendicular to the slope in order to investigate the effect of the raindrop impact on runoff and erosion fig 1b this system inspired by the experiments performed by ziegler et al 2000 consists of covering one half of the 1 m2 plots with a mosquito net so that the raindrops break into fine droplets the rainfall kinetic energy is therefore drastically reduced before its impact with the ground the sub plot without the mosquito net allows the characterisation of the effect of raindrop impact the four plots were divided into duplicated treatment groups denoted a and b controls with no amendments ref a and ref b or amended with pig manure pig a and pig b plots pig a and pig b were only partially covered by disconnected small patches of pig manure fig 1c illustrates the distribution of the manure on the soil surface of these plots the soil surface features were characterized both before and after the series of rainfall simulations using the field method proposed by valentin and casenave 1992 and extensively used since then e g podwojewski et al 2008 patin et al 2012 lacombe et al 2018 this method recently described by patin et al 2018 is based on an accurate visual assessment of various components of surface features this requires to use charts or photo standards to enable each descriptor to calibrate his visual estimate students or farmers can assess the same percentages than a well trained expert after a training of only few minutes in this study field visual assessment was carried out by a well trained expert when compared with the data from image analysis this type of field visual assessment was found be very accurate and more rapid and informative than image digitizing method where some confusions can be made malam issa et al 2011 the main parameters included percentages of surface covered with vegetation plant litter crop residues leaves seeds charcoal free aggregates free gravel i e not embedded in a crust three types of physical crusts were readily distinguished in the field by their morphology i structural crusts where the original aggregate induced roughness could still be recognized ii erosion crusts where this roughness had disappeared iii gravel crusts that embedded coarse elements micromorphological examinations of the structural crusts developed in this site showed that they result from the packing of highly stable micro aggregates and are referred to as packing crusts ribolzi et al 2011 when compacted by raindrops and smoothed by overland flow this structural crust gradually transforms into an erosion crust characterized by a thin and very compacted smooth plasmic layer valentin and bresson 1992 when they include gravels structural or erosion crusts become a gravel crust valentin and casenave 1992 due to the low percentages of erosion and gravel crusts in this study we combined the three types of crusts in one general category total crusts to focus on the changes between free aggregates and free gravel into crusts the field criterion between these categories is that collecting free aggregates or gravel from the surface does not disturb the soil surface contrarily to what is observed when collecting an aggregate from a structural crust or a gravel from a gravel crust 2 1 3 rainfall simulation three successive rainfall simulations were conducted during the dry season using a portable rainfall simulator fig 1a janeau et al 2014 the rain simulator was calibrated 5 times before each simulation and 5 times after each simulation during 2 5 min each time to check the stability of the intensity the simulator was calibrated so as to produce a raindrop size distribution versus rainfall intensity similar to tropical rainfall asseline and valentin 1978 rainfall intensity was held constant at 90 mm h 1 during 60 min this intensity value was chosen because it corresponds to the median intensity that has been observed over a 10 year period and for which the kinetic energy permits the detachment of soil particles podwojewski et al 2008 the plots were covered with a plastic cover between simulations to prevent the possible modification of the soil surface characteristics and moisture content from natural precipitation the first simulated rainfall denoted r1 was designed to homogenize the hydrodynamic surface conditions and it was carried out without amendment the second simulated rainfall denoted r2 was conducted four days after r1 and was carried out following the application of pig manure to the pig plots two hours before the rainfall simulation table 2 the control plots refa and refb received no amendment a third simulated rainfall denoted r3 was carried out 24 h after r2 a total of twenty four experiments were performed on the sub plots two applications of rainfall with or without a mosquito net two applications of manure with or without pig manure three successive rainfalls two replicates overland flow from the pvc exit tube of each 0 5 m2 sub plot was collected in a large and clean bucket during each rainfall simulation overland flow from each sub plot was measured during 30 s of every minute using a graduated cylinder in order to calculate overland flow volume this water was then added to the collecting bucket the time step of 30 s was chosen so that sufficient water could be collected over a short enough time period that the rate of change of runoff flow could be determined the overland flow coefficient that is equal to the ratio between the total overland flow and the total rainfall was determined for each 0 5 m2 plot during rainfall simulation statistical significance of the effect of manure addition on surface runoff was determined with the mann whitney test and the non parametric wilcoxon test was used to determine the significance of the raindrop impact for both tests significance was set at p 0 05 2 2 models 2 2 1 general equations numerical simulations of overland flow experiments were performed with a physically based model that simultaneously solves surface and subsurface flows within a darcy multidomain approach weill et al 2009 in this approach the darcy equation the richards equation and the diffusive equation that model the flow in the saturated zone unsaturated zone and in the runoff layer respectively are written in the same way in the whole domain as follows 1 c h h t k h h q with h h z where h and z are the pressure head l and the soil elevation l respectively in this single richards diffusion type equation that describes both surface and subsurface flows the parameters c h l 1 and k h lt 1 are domain dependent and are defined both in the runoff layer and in the subsurface domain in the saturated zone c h and k h are equal to the specific volumetric storage ss and to the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the medium ks respectively in the unsaturated zone they are equal to the soil capillary capacity cc h and to the product ks kr h of the saturated hydraulic conductivity with the relative permeability respectively the relative permeability is described by the van genuchten function van genuchten 1980 in the surface domain the generalized eq 1 is equivalent to the diffusive wave approximation of the saint venant equation associated with the manning strickler flow formula in this case h is equal to the water depth in the runoff layer c h is equal to 0 for h 0 and equal to 1 for h 0 and k h is equal to h 5 3 n s where n is the manning coefficient that characterizes the soil rugosity and s is the surface slope we can notice here that in general the kinematic wave approximation is applied for modelling overland flow on steep slopes instead of the diffusive wave approximation singh 2002 and references therein however under certain conditions such as steady state cases of channel flow with upstream boundary conditions of zero discharge and finite length of the channel which are nearly the conditions of the plot experiments singh and aravamuthan 1995 showed that the diffusive wave approximation was in excellent agreement with the dynamic wave approximation whatever the values of the kinematic wave number and froude number in the generalized richards eq 1 q is a global source sink term in the followings q will be equal to zero in the whole domain except in the runoff layer where it will be equal to the rainfall 2 2 2 numerical methods the model was numerically solved in the framework of the cast3m simulation platform that has been developed since the eighties at the cea in france see the website www cast3m cea fr for more information the darcy multidomain approach and its numerical resolution have already been tested and validated on numerous academic and realistic test cases weill et al 2009 mügler et al 2011 kollet et al 2017 calculations were performed on a 2d vertical domain with an inclined length and a vertical depth equal to 1 m and 5 m respectively the 2d mesh was made of 2 2016 cells the resolution along the slope was equal to 0 5 m the vertical resolution was very fine at the top of the subsurface domain 5 10 5 m and coarsened towards the bottom 5 10 2 m temporal resolution was adaptive with a maximum value equal to 1 s no flow boundary conditions were applied at the vertical and bottom sides of the subsurface domain at the outlet of the runoff layer a zero water depth gradient boundary condition was applied weill et al 2009 the rainfall was imposed as a source term in the runoff layer the initial depth of the water table was equal to 2 5 m that is the observed water table depth at the end of the dry season ribolzi et al 2018 the spatial scheme was solved with a finite volume method bernard michel et al 2004 we used a direct solver the time discretization was implicit and the nonlinear terms were solved with an iterative picard algorithm in this formulation the nonlinear parameters were calculated from an underrelaxated water pressure 2 2 3 model parametrization parameters involved in the generalized richards eq 1 are the manning coefficient n the van genuchten parameters and the residual water content nvg αvg and θres the specific volumetric storage ss and the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the medium ks in a first step we performed a sensitive analysis and model calibration with the kineros code woolhiser et al 1990 and the hydropso r package zambrano bigiarini and rojas 2013 for the experiments without the mosquito net results showed that ks was the more sensitive parameter the van genuchten parameters and manning coefficient influenced results only during the first minutes of experiments at the beginning of runoff indeed at the 1 m2 plot scale some parameters such as the manning coefficient do not have much influence on overland flow however calibration of parameters with kineros and hydropso r failed for the simulations for the experiments with a mosquito net indeed experimental results clearly showed that permeability was not constant in time furthermore the problem with so many parameters was an ill posed problem and a calibration performed in a blind manner gave various sets of optimized parameters that were very different between similar experiments as a consequence we dropped kineros and chose to use the cast3m code to focus the modelling on the decrease of ks with time we also tried to minimize the number of parameters to be estimated by using as much as possible values taken from the literature the values for the manning s roughness coefficient for overland flow on a bare clay loam soil that are recommended by woolhiser 1975 range between 0 012 and 0 033 s m 1 3 we chose n 0 015 s m 1 3 table 3 as mentioned in table 1 the soil at the experimental site was mainly clayey hence the van genuchten parameters and the residual water content were chosen to equal the mean values recommended for clay meyer et al 1997 nvg 1 13 αvg 0 62 and θres 0 07 numerical results were not sensitive to the value of the specific storage it was chosen equal to 10 5 m 1 the hydraulic conductivity is defined as the ratio of the fluid velocity to the hydraulic gradient it characterizes the permeability of porous media in the present paper we investigated the role of the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks to drive the partitioning of water between runoff and infiltration the parameter ks was assumed constant in space at the 1 m2 plot scale however it was assumed to vary with time during the rainfall event the purpose of this time variation was to model the changes of the soil properties due to the evolution of the soil structure related to the apparition of crusts that reduce the infiltrability the modelling of the decrease of ks with time due to seal formation is often modelled with the following exponential function 2 k s t k k 0 k e t where k 0 and k are the initial and final hydraulic conductivities lt 1 respectively silburn and connoly 1995 assouline 2004 and references therein ribolzi et al 2011 the coefficient quantifies the decay rate of k s t the higher the value of the more strongly the decrease of k s with time as we had no information about the depth of the sealing layer during the rainfall experiments we assumed that k s did not vary with depth in the soil the parameter k s can be considered as an effective parameter for modelling several processes that modify the soil infiltrability during rainfall finally the parameters k 0 k and that characterize the decrease of k s with time according to the time evolution given by eq 2 were the only parameters to be estimated table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface runoff experiments the overland flow coefficient that is equal to the ratio between the total overland flow and the total rainfall was determined for each 0 5 m2 plot during the three successive rainfall simulations experimental results obtained for the four different plots refa refb piga and pigb and for the three successive simulated rainfalls r1 r2 and r3 are displayed in fig 2 on each figure empty and filled symbols correspond to the sub plots without and with a mosquito net respectively the thick solid lines correspond to the model outputs see section 3 2 the comparison of overland flow coefficients with or without a mosquito net clearly shows the large effect of raindrop impact on runoff fig 2 the values of the total runoff water measured at the outlet of the 0 5 m2 plots for the three successive simulated rainfalls are plotted in fig 3 here again the comparison of overland flow with or without a mosquito net using the non parametric wilcoxon analysis clearly shows significantly higher values without a mosquito p value 0 001 hence the data clearly show that raindrop impact enhances runoff generation regardless of the treatment applied to the sub plot and the rainfall event table 4 gives the main surface features of the various sub plots both before and after the series of rainfall experiments before the first simulated rainfall 56 72 of the surface of the sub plots was covered with free aggregates a large part of the remaining surface 19 39 was covered by crusts after the third rainfall almost of all the free aggregates disappeared at the surface of the sub plot submitted to raindrop impact and the soil surface was mainly covered by crusts 81 91 in contrast 37 47 of the surface of sub plots without raindrop impact was still covered by free aggregates after the three successive rainfalls and the crusts covered 41 54 3 2 surface runoff modelling 3 2 1 simulations fig 2 gives the evolution over time of both the measured and modelled overland flow coefficients for the eight sub plots and for the three rainfalls empty and filled symbols correspond to the sub plots without and with the mosquito net respectively the characteristics of the time evolutions ks t used for modelling the runoff are given in table 5 overland flow in each sub plot without a mosquito net was correctly modelled with a fast decreasing k s t with about the same value 4 2 h 1 except for the sub plot refa during rainfall r1 for which a lower value was obtained 1 8 h 1 in this particular case the value is explained by a slower increase of the runoff coefficient during the early stages of the experiment fig 2 due to an artifact related to the temporary obstruction of the sub plot outlets with coarse soil particles noticeably a decrease of k 0 and k values was observed from one rainfall to the next for sub plots without a mosquito net in contrast overland flow in each sub plot with a mosquito net was correctly modelled with a slowly decreasing k s t with a nearly ten times smaller value for 0 48 h 1 here again the values of k 0 and k decreased from one rainfall to the next evolutions of overland flow in the four sub plots with a mosquito net during the first rainfall r1 before spreading of manure are very similar they are all correctly modelled with the same k s t this result illustrates the reproducibility of the experiments 3 3 discussion the twenty four runoff experiments performed on sub plots with or without a mosquito net and with or without pig manure showed that raindrop impact drastically enhanced runoff generation on both bare soils and on manured amended soils the temporal evolution of runoff was correctly modelled using a soil hydraulic conductivity that exponentially decreases over time of exposure to rainfall both experimental and modelling results can help to distinguish the phenomena that increase runoff 3 3 1 effect of raindrop impact in the sub plots where the raindrop impact was reduced with mosquito net the reproducibility of the experiments was higher coefficient of variation 22 compared to sub plots exposed to raindrop impact coefficient of variation 50 as shown in fig 2 the evolution over time of the overland flow coefficient for the four sub plots under the first simulated rainfall are very similar they were all correctly modelled using the same very slowly decreasing hydraulic conductivity table 5 the differences in infiltration rate between unprotected and protected sub plots could be ascribed to the differences in crusting rates prior to the first simulated rainfall there was no significant difference among the two series of subplots with a mean crusts coverage of 29 4 for the unprotected subplots and 26 9 for the protected subplots after the three simulated rainfalls differences were significant with 86 5 and 49 6 respectively with a mean increase in crust coverage for the unprotected sub plots of 57 5 and a mean rate for protected sub plots of only 23 12 the role of the mosquito net in protecting soil from crust development was clearly shown after rainfalls very few erosion crusts were observed on the plots in contrast structural crusts covered 77 to 89 of the sub plot surfaces without a mosquito net and 41 54 of the sub plot surfaces with a mosquito net the high coverage of the soil with structural crusts is due to the high slope gradient of the plots indeed ribolzi et al 2011 showed that erosion crusts preferentially form under gentle slopes while structural crusts mainly develop under steep slopes furthermore the raindrop impact seems to boost the formation of structural crusts the formation of a surprisingly high proportion of crusts and the reduction of infiltration rate on all the sub plots suggest that the mosquito net did not remove kinetic energy completely data have been established under this type of rainfall simulator asseline and valentin 1978 for a rainfall intensity of 90 mm h 1 with a mean drop diameter of 1 34 mm and a falling height of 3 6 m it gave a mean falling velocity and a kinetic energy equal to 8 4 m s 1 and 22 5 j mm 1 m 2 respectively in a crude estimation based on the drop size distribution measured under 90 mm h 1 with the rainfall simulator asseline and valentin 1978 we can consider that half of the droplets with a diameter smaller than 2 mm could pass through the net unhindered they represent a kinetic energy of 3 8 j mm 1 m 2 the other half hit the mosquito net and fall from a 0 12 m height with a reduced velocity and kinetic energy equal to 3 5 m s 1 and 1 7 j mm 1 m 2 respectively similarly we can consider that all the drops with a diameter larger than 2 mm also hit the mosquito net and fall with a reduced velocity and a kinetic energy equal to 3 5 m s 1 and 2 7 j mm 1 m 2 respectively using these assumptions the total kinetic energy would be equal to 8 2 j mm 1 m 2 which means a reduction of 64 other studies have also used a mosquito net to dissipate kinetic energy e g carmi et al 2018 but to our knowledge only young and wiersma 1973 attempted to evaluate its impact on the reduction of kinetic energy using four layers of standard insect screen set up 5 cm above ground and high speed photographs to evaluate the velocity of drops they estimated that the falling velocity and kinetic energy were reduced by 51 66 and 76 89 respectively our approximation seems consistent with these data because we used only one layer of mosquito net that was placed further from the ground 12 cm instead of 5 cm the cumulative kinetic energy of the three high intensity rainfalls is equal to 2214 j m 2 which is therefore high enough to induce the development of crusts on protected sub plots this mean increase in crust coverage for the unprotected sub plots is about half the mean rate for protected sub plots which also seems consistent with a reduction of 64 of the kinetic energy it is well established that the development of crusts increases with cumulative kinetic energy e g baumhardt et al 1990 armenise et al 2018 these results show that runoff is much higher in the sub plots without a mosquito net figs 2 and 3 clearly illustrating the well known impact of raindrops on runoff generation and erosion silburn and connoly 1995 assouline and mualem 1997 fohrer et al 1999 lacombe et al 2018 when the impact of raindrops was reduced total runoff was on average reduced by 70 fig 3 this reduction is much higher than the one hour averaged reduction of 4 measured by an et al 2012 on a gentle 9 slope with a mollisol and with a 100 mm h 1 rainfall intensity however in these simulated rainfall experiments the elimination of raindrop impact induced a strong reduction of the runoff rate 1 13 up to 84 at the beginning of the rainfall until 20 min the authors mentioned that the main factor was rill initiation because they were using 8 m long soil pans under laboratory conditions conditions that were very different from 1 m long plots the important development of crusts on the houay pano soils can be linked to their texture but also to their content of a relatively high proportion of swelling clays valentin 1994 valentin and bresson 1997 the reduction of infiltration in swelling soils has been theoretically discussed for some time giraldez and sposito 1985 however a quantitative analysis of x ray computed tomography images of soil seal development under simulated rainfall has only recently been performed armenise et al 2018 this study showed that for a silty clay loam with an initial porosity equal to 0 24 the porosity of the first 5 mm was reduced by a factor of about two which is a large reduction but this may be due to crust formation rather than to porosity closure due to swelling clay aksu et al 2015 investigated the swelling of clay minerals and its impact on the permeability of unconsolidated porous media their experimental results confirmed that permeability decreases with increasing clay content however in high porosity samples more than 36 40 they showed that the reduction in porosity due to clay swelling was insufficient to cause a meaningful reduction of permeability in the present experiments the high soil porosity 58 cf table 1 may explain the weak reduction of infiltration due to swelling effects moreover no cracks were observed prior to the experiments where cracks have been observed prior to rainfall simulations they tended to close very rapidly casenave and valentin 1989 which cannot explain the gradual reduction of infiltration under the mosquito net furthermore if the closing of cracks were the main process of infiltration reduction it should be similar in the two series of sub plots instead a clear difference has been observed which can be more surely ascribed to the difference in kinetic energy and resulting crusting during the first rainfall experiments performed on the sub plots protected by a mosquito net differ from those performed without net only by the rainfall characteristics droplet size and kinetic energy as already discussed without raindrop impact results are reproducible runoff slowly increases during the rainfall event in the same manner fig 2 in contrast with raindrop impact the results are influenced by the plot characteristics runoff is higher in plots a than in plots b fig 2 according to rawls et al 1990 surface sealing depends on soil properties presence and characteristics of aggregates and organic matter at the soil surface and to land use practices assouline and mualem 1997 showed that it also depends on rainfall characteristics all the sub plots had the same soil properties table 1 same land use practices and were subject to the same rainfall intensity with identical drop characteristics however they did not have exactly the same surface features table 4 the variability of infiltrability on bare plots has already been observed in the houay pano catchment patin et al 2012 proposed that infiltrability during a natural rainfall event should be considered as a random function in space and time that is described for each land use by a log normal probability density function for bare soils they obtained a median infiltrability and a geometrical standard deviation equal to 10 mm h 1 and 2 9 mm h 1 respectively the infiltrabilities obtained in our experiments after three rainfall simulations between 15 and 23 mm h 1 table 5 are in this range of values 10 2 9 10 2 9 reflecting the local variations of initial surface properties 3 3 2 manure effect when the raindrop impact is reduced by the mosquito net the results are also reproducible during the second and third simulated rainfalls i e after the amendment with pig manure of two of the sub plots table 5 however the overland flow coefficient on amended soils increased more rapidly than on bare soils fig 2 comparison of total runoff on soils with or without manure fig 3 using the non parametric mann whitney analysis shows significantly higher runoff on manured soil p value 0 05 the decrease of infiltration on manured soils can be explained by the plugging of pores by manure particles at the soil surface bottom et al 1986 in contrast when the raindrop impact is reduced by the mosquito net the protecting role of various types of manures that has been observed and described in the literature mostaghimi et al 1989 gilley and risse 2000 roberts and clanton 2000 becomes much less important the experimental results also show that when bare soil is protected from raindrop impact the presence of pig manure at the surface reduces infiltration by a factor of about two in the field plants can play the same role as the mosquito net by protecting the soil from the raindrop effect hence higher runoff may be expected on vegetated fields where pigs are free to roam this overland flow enhancement can facilitate the transport of bacteria that are present in the manure and consequently can deteriorate water quality ackerman and taylor 1995 choudhary et al 1996 ramos et al 2006 results of the experiments with raindrop impact are very different the evolution over time of the overland flow coefficients depend more on initial soil surface features than on the presence or not of manure overland flow coefficients on plots a are always higher than those measured on plots b even during the first rainfall when there is no manure applied at the soil surface fig 2 non parametric mann whitney analysis of total runoff shows no significant difference between bare and manured soils p value 0 05 the manure application rates were perhaps too small to have a protecting effect and to reduce the sealing raindrop impact as suggested by roberts and clanton 2000 furthermore plots a and b were only very partially covered by disconnected small patches of pig manure although roberts and clanton added slurry to swine and dairy manure to completely cover the soil surface of their experimental columns 3 3 3 modelling of ks runoff experiments were modelled with the darcy continuum approach described in section 2 2 with a soil hydraulic conductivity that exponentially decreases over time of exposure to rainfall the formation of structural crusts observed after three successive rainfalls table 4 can explain this decrease almost all runoff experiments on sub plots without a mosquito net were correctly modelled with the same α value 4 2 h 1 which corresponds to a strong decrease of infiltrability during the rainfall events ribolzi et al 2011 expressed as the ratio of the rainfall intensity r and a dimensioning parameter τ from experiments performed on 30 and 75 slope at the plot scale they showed that less permeable erosion crusts formed on the 30 slope than the structural crusts that formed on the 75 slope they obtained τ 12 mm and 26 mm for the 30 and 75 slope respectively in the present study we obtain τ 22 mm for a 50 slope this value further highlights the strong dependence of infiltration rate on slope in contrast to this value of α all of runoff experiments with a mosquito net required a much smaller value of α α 0 48 h 1 such a value of α results in a very slow and quasi linear decrease of k s t the assumption that ks is constant over soil depth is subject to question as the modified hydraulic conductivity should only be imposed in the sealing layer several studies have shown that seal thickness depends on rainfall characteristics farres 1978 bedaiwy 2008 the increase of seal thickness with increasing rainfall duration was recently quantified from high resolution x ray computed tomography images of soil seal development under simulated rainfall armenise et al 2018 for a silty clay loam soil the seal thickness increased from 1 mm after 2 min of rainfall to 5 4 mm after 14 min of rainfall however as no information is available about the seal or crust thickness on the present plots we preferred not to add a new unknown parameter furthermore in layered media the median permeability is controlled by the least permeable layer 3 3 4 effect of successive rainfalls as can be clearly seen in fig 2 for each plot the overland flow coefficient increases during successive rainfalls for a given plot this increase is correctly modelled by a decrease of the initial hydraulic conductivity k 0 from one rainfall to the next table 5 the experiments were performed in may just before the beginning of the rainfall season the first simulation provides an indication of the behaviour of dry bare soils at the beginning of the monsoon with an infiltration capacity that progressively decreases over time of exposure to rainfall even if there was a four day gap between the first and second simulated rainfall the soil did not regain its initial properties indeed the leading cause of infiltration reduction was not the reversible clay swelling but rather the irreversible crusting of the soil surface as more rain fell more structural crusts were formed and the soil became less and less permeable 4 conclusion twenty four rainfall simulation experiments performed with or without raindrop impact on bare or amended soils led to the following conclusions raindrop impact drastically enhanced runoff generation on bare soils when raindrop impact was reduced runoff was on average reduced by 70 the energy of the raindrops induced a rapid evolution of the hydraulic properties of the soil resulting in a reduction of the hydraulic conductivity and a concomitant increase in runoff intensity a soil hydraulic conductivity that exponentially decreased over time of exposure to rainfall correctly modelled the temporal evolution of runoff under high intensity rainfall runoff on soils amended with pig manure was the same as on bare soils in contrast when the impact of raindrops was reduced with a 2 mm grid size wire screen runoff on amended soils was more than twice that of bare soils soil exposed to successive rainfalls became less and less permeable one of the main conclusions of this study is that on steep slopes and under high kinetic energy rainfall conditions surface runoff is very high and even a low cover such as a mosquito net can significantly reduce it this result is in agreement with recent studies that showed that when cultivation is abandoned which is the current tendency in vietnam natural regrowth reduces runoff lacombe et al 2016 the next step of this work will be to characterize the transport of faecal indicator bacteria from these steep slopes under high intensity rainfall indeed increased microbial pathogen dissemination and contamination of stream waters are crucial problems in rural southeast asia for the estimate of the flood and health risk it is essential that the future simulations better describe surface runoff and erosion at the catchment scale and take into account not only the spatial heterogeneity of the soil hydraulic conductivity but also its temporal

6715,tropical montane areas of southeast asia are exposed to high intensity rainfall during the monsoon period this is particularly problematic in areas where soils on steep slopes are cultivated as it can lead to heavy runoff high soil erosion and water pollution the objective of this paper is to analyse the effect of the impact of raindrops on the dynamics of runoff on such steep fields experiments under simulated rainfall were performed at the plot scale 1 m2 to quantify water export from the surface of upland agricultural soils during overland flow events four 1 m2 plots were divided in duplicated treatment groups a control with no amendments and b amended with pig manure each plot was divided into two 0 5 m2 rectangular subplots one subplot was designated as a rain splash treatment the other sub plot was covered with a 2 mm grid size wire screen that was located 12 cm above the soil surface the purpose of the screen was to break the raindrops into fine droplets and to reduce fall height in order to drastically reduce their kinetic energy runoff was measured for each sub plot the results show that raindrop impact drastically enhances runoff generation on both bare soils and on manure amended soils when the impact of raindrops was limited by screening runoff was higher on amended soils than on bare soils the temporal evolution of runoff was correctly modelled using a soil hydraulic conductivity that exponentially decreases over time of exposure to rainfall both experimental and modelling results showed that droplet energy induces a rapid evolution of the hydraulic properties of the soil surface due to crusting resulting in a reduction of hydraulic conductivity and a concomitant increase in runoff rate keywords runoff modelling raindrop impact hydraulic conductivity soil crusting tropical agro ecosystems lao pdr 1 introduction high intensity rainfall such as occurs during tropical monsoons induces reduced infiltration in bare soils valentin 1991 silburn and connoly 1995 assouline and mualem 1997 fohrer et al 1999 this is due to the fact that when a raindrop impacts a bare soil surface its kinetic energy is transferred to the soil surface where it can induce soil compaction aggregate destruction particle detachment and splashing the raindrop impact threshold related to a critical kinetic energy specific for each soil type needs to be overcome in order to initiate and support soil detachment armenise et al 2018 the formation of structural crusts at the surface of bare soils subject to the impact of raindrops depends on the soil properties rainfall characteristics flow conditions e g valentin and bresson 1992 assouline 2004 and also on the slope gradient ribolzi et al 2011 if fine particles resulting from detachment and or aggregate destruction are redistributed at the surface or transported by infiltrated water into the upper layer of the soil they can clog the porosity the formation of this surface seal drastically reduces infiltration during rainfall assouline and mualem 1997 surface sealing depends on soil properties presence and characteristics of aggregate and organic matter at the soil surface land use practices rawls et al 1990 and references therein but also on rainfall intensity and drop characteristics assouline and mualem 1997 lacombe et al 2018 all of which can have important implications for soil erosion and overland flow dynamics and water quality particularly in areas with steep slopes and where land use change has led to large areas of bare soil valentin et al 2008 vigiak et al 2008 ziegler et al 2009 ribolzi et al 2017 in order to quantify the raindrop impact on runoff ziegler et al 2000 performed rainfall simulation experiments on plots covered or not with a wire screen these authors showed that even on highly compacted road surfaces rain splash enhanced runoff they attributed this enhancement to the sealing of the surface by redistribution of already detached materials an et al 2012 using a similar method also observed that runoff rates were reduced during rainfall when the raindrop impact was reduced by a net only gentle slope gradients 18 were investigated both ziegler et al 2000 and an et al 2012 focused their study on erosion none of them modelled runoff enhancement by splash effect experimental studies have yielded contradictory results about the effect of presence of manure on the soil surface on infiltration on one hand reductions of infiltration have been observed on manured soils this was proposed to be a consequence of the plugging of pores by manure particles at the soil surface bottom et al 1986 on the other hand studies showed infiltration increases after application of manure mostaghimi et al 1989 gilley and risse 2000 with an increasing effect with the manure application rates this behaviour was explained by the protecting effect of the manure applied at the soil surface which reduced the sealing raindrop impact roberts and clanton 2000 however given that the texture and water content of manure varies as a function of the source and probably the diet of the species in question the differences observed may also be due to differences in manure source moreover variability in soil type and texture probably also play an important role physically based models that numerically solve mass and momentum conservation equations have been widely developed and used in hydrology an overview of these models and their applications have recently been discussed by paniconi and putti 2015 and by fatichi et al 2016 these models are particularly useful for simulating the partitioning between infiltration and runoff a first attempt to couple overland flow and soil infiltration models was made by smith and woolhiser 1971 this approach was successfully tested on laboratory and field experiments the resulting event oriented physically based runoff and erosion model kineros is still used today woolhiser et al 1990 ziegler et al 2000 gal et al 2017 because they allow to test more or less sophisticated hypothesis on the runoff generation physically based models are interesting tools to interpret experiments for example the incorporation of time dependent hydraulic conductivity functions allows simulation of the evolution of a physical seal layer on the soil surface silburn and connoly 1995 assouline 2004 in another study the cast3m numerical code was used to test various roughness models to simulate overland flow experiments at plot scale mügler et al 2011 the purpose of this paper is to answer by both experimental and modelling approaches to the following questions how much does the raindrop impact modify runoff on steep slope bare fields does manure protect or on the contrary enhance the degradation of the surface soils during rainfall events is this degradation amplified by successive rainfall events in this paper the materials and methods section presents the experiments and the modelling approach measured and modelled runoff rate are compared in the results section this comparison is followed by a general discussion of the relative influence of raindrop impact manure presence and successive rainfalls on runoff rates 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiments 2 1 1 study area the rain simulation experiments were carried out in the houay pano catchment 67 ha located at 102 09 50 e 19 51 00 n about ten kilometres from luang prabang north laos the elevation ranges from 400 m to 750 m above mean sea level the mean slope gradient of the catchment is 52 ribolzi et al 2011 the climate is tropical sub humid with an average annual temperature of 25 3 c ribolzi et al 2011 average annual precipitation is approximately 1260 mm and is characterized by high rain intensities of up to 280 mm h 1 valentin et al 2008 alfisols ultisols and entisols occur over about 50 30 and 20 of the catchment area respectively ribolzi et al 2011 the experimental plots described in the following section are located on alfisols agricultural practice and land use are typical of north laos with a slash and burn system of production rouw et al 2014 over the last 15 years land use has changed from crops job s tears maize upland rice and fallow toward teak plantations huon et al 2013 ribolzi et al 2017 2 1 2 experimental design experiments were performed on four 1 m2 plots installed on a steep slope 47 2 of the upper part of the catchment fig 1 the site was covered with fallow from 2005 to 2010 and upland rice during 2011 however this was harvested and the residues burned several months prior to the experiment soil texture was measured using the pipette method of olmstead et al 1930 three replicate measurements were conducted per treatment however given the proximity of the plots to each other and their location on the hillslope along the same topographic level the measurements can almost be considered as being 12 replicates of the same soil the soil characteristics slope texture and porosity are given in table 1 soils exhibited a clay loam texture each plot was divided into two sub plots 1 m downslope 0 5 m perpendicular to the slope in order to investigate the effect of the raindrop impact on runoff and erosion fig 1b this system inspired by the experiments performed by ziegler et al 2000 consists of covering one half of the 1 m2 plots with a mosquito net so that the raindrops break into fine droplets the rainfall kinetic energy is therefore drastically reduced before its impact with the ground the sub plot without the mosquito net allows the characterisation of the effect of raindrop impact the four plots were divided into duplicated treatment groups denoted a and b controls with no amendments ref a and ref b or amended with pig manure pig a and pig b plots pig a and pig b were only partially covered by disconnected small patches of pig manure fig 1c illustrates the distribution of the manure on the soil surface of these plots the soil surface features were characterized both before and after the series of rainfall simulations using the field method proposed by valentin and casenave 1992 and extensively used since then e g podwojewski et al 2008 patin et al 2012 lacombe et al 2018 this method recently described by patin et al 2018 is based on an accurate visual assessment of various components of surface features this requires to use charts or photo standards to enable each descriptor to calibrate his visual estimate students or farmers can assess the same percentages than a well trained expert after a training of only few minutes in this study field visual assessment was carried out by a well trained expert when compared with the data from image analysis this type of field visual assessment was found be very accurate and more rapid and informative than image digitizing method where some confusions can be made malam issa et al 2011 the main parameters included percentages of surface covered with vegetation plant litter crop residues leaves seeds charcoal free aggregates free gravel i e not embedded in a crust three types of physical crusts were readily distinguished in the field by their morphology i structural crusts where the original aggregate induced roughness could still be recognized ii erosion crusts where this roughness had disappeared iii gravel crusts that embedded coarse elements micromorphological examinations of the structural crusts developed in this site showed that they result from the packing of highly stable micro aggregates and are referred to as packing crusts ribolzi et al 2011 when compacted by raindrops and smoothed by overland flow this structural crust gradually transforms into an erosion crust characterized by a thin and very compacted smooth plasmic layer valentin and bresson 1992 when they include gravels structural or erosion crusts become a gravel crust valentin and casenave 1992 due to the low percentages of erosion and gravel crusts in this study we combined the three types of crusts in one general category total crusts to focus on the changes between free aggregates and free gravel into crusts the field criterion between these categories is that collecting free aggregates or gravel from the surface does not disturb the soil surface contrarily to what is observed when collecting an aggregate from a structural crust or a gravel from a gravel crust 2 1 3 rainfall simulation three successive rainfall simulations were conducted during the dry season using a portable rainfall simulator fig 1a janeau et al 2014 the rain simulator was calibrated 5 times before each simulation and 5 times after each simulation during 2 5 min each time to check the stability of the intensity the simulator was calibrated so as to produce a raindrop size distribution versus rainfall intensity similar to tropical rainfall asseline and valentin 1978 rainfall intensity was held constant at 90 mm h 1 during 60 min this intensity value was chosen because it corresponds to the median intensity that has been observed over a 10 year period and for which the kinetic energy permits the detachment of soil particles podwojewski et al 2008 the plots were covered with a plastic cover between simulations to prevent the possible modification of the soil surface characteristics and moisture content from natural precipitation the first simulated rainfall denoted r1 was designed to homogenize the hydrodynamic surface conditions and it was carried out without amendment the second simulated rainfall denoted r2 was conducted four days after r1 and was carried out following the application of pig manure to the pig plots two hours before the rainfall simulation table 2 the control plots refa and refb received no amendment a third simulated rainfall denoted r3 was carried out 24 h after r2 a total of twenty four experiments were performed on the sub plots two applications of rainfall with or without a mosquito net two applications of manure with or without pig manure three successive rainfalls two replicates overland flow from the pvc exit tube of each 0 5 m2 sub plot was collected in a large and clean bucket during each rainfall simulation overland flow from each sub plot was measured during 30 s of every minute using a graduated cylinder in order to calculate overland flow volume this water was then added to the collecting bucket the time step of 30 s was chosen so that sufficient water could be collected over a short enough time period that the rate of change of runoff flow could be determined the overland flow coefficient that is equal to the ratio between the total overland flow and the total rainfall was determined for each 0 5 m2 plot during rainfall simulation statistical significance of the effect of manure addition on surface runoff was determined with the mann whitney test and the non parametric wilcoxon test was used to determine the significance of the raindrop impact for both tests significance was set at p 0 05 2 2 models 2 2 1 general equations numerical simulations of overland flow experiments were performed with a physically based model that simultaneously solves surface and subsurface flows within a darcy multidomain approach weill et al 2009 in this approach the darcy equation the richards equation and the diffusive equation that model the flow in the saturated zone unsaturated zone and in the runoff layer respectively are written in the same way in the whole domain as follows 1 c h h t k h h q with h h z where h and z are the pressure head l and the soil elevation l respectively in this single richards diffusion type equation that describes both surface and subsurface flows the parameters c h l 1 and k h lt 1 are domain dependent and are defined both in the runoff layer and in the subsurface domain in the saturated zone c h and k h are equal to the specific volumetric storage ss and to the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the medium ks respectively in the unsaturated zone they are equal to the soil capillary capacity cc h and to the product ks kr h of the saturated hydraulic conductivity with the relative permeability respectively the relative permeability is described by the van genuchten function van genuchten 1980 in the surface domain the generalized eq 1 is equivalent to the diffusive wave approximation of the saint venant equation associated with the manning strickler flow formula in this case h is equal to the water depth in the runoff layer c h is equal to 0 for h 0 and equal to 1 for h 0 and k h is equal to h 5 3 n s where n is the manning coefficient that characterizes the soil rugosity and s is the surface slope we can notice here that in general the kinematic wave approximation is applied for modelling overland flow on steep slopes instead of the diffusive wave approximation singh 2002 and references therein however under certain conditions such as steady state cases of channel flow with upstream boundary conditions of zero discharge and finite length of the channel which are nearly the conditions of the plot experiments singh and aravamuthan 1995 showed that the diffusive wave approximation was in excellent agreement with the dynamic wave approximation whatever the values of the kinematic wave number and froude number in the generalized richards eq 1 q is a global source sink term in the followings q will be equal to zero in the whole domain except in the runoff layer where it will be equal to the rainfall 2 2 2 numerical methods the model was numerically solved in the framework of the cast3m simulation platform that has been developed since the eighties at the cea in france see the website www cast3m cea fr for more information the darcy multidomain approach and its numerical resolution have already been tested and validated on numerous academic and realistic test cases weill et al 2009 mügler et al 2011 kollet et al 2017 calculations were performed on a 2d vertical domain with an inclined length and a vertical depth equal to 1 m and 5 m respectively the 2d mesh was made of 2 2016 cells the resolution along the slope was equal to 0 5 m the vertical resolution was very fine at the top of the subsurface domain 5 10 5 m and coarsened towards the bottom 5 10 2 m temporal resolution was adaptive with a maximum value equal to 1 s no flow boundary conditions were applied at the vertical and bottom sides of the subsurface domain at the outlet of the runoff layer a zero water depth gradient boundary condition was applied weill et al 2009 the rainfall was imposed as a source term in the runoff layer the initial depth of the water table was equal to 2 5 m that is the observed water table depth at the end of the dry season ribolzi et al 2018 the spatial scheme was solved with a finite volume method bernard michel et al 2004 we used a direct solver the time discretization was implicit and the nonlinear terms were solved with an iterative picard algorithm in this formulation the nonlinear parameters were calculated from an underrelaxated water pressure 2 2 3 model parametrization parameters involved in the generalized richards eq 1 are the manning coefficient n the van genuchten parameters and the residual water content nvg αvg and θres the specific volumetric storage ss and the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the medium ks in a first step we performed a sensitive analysis and model calibration with the kineros code woolhiser et al 1990 and the hydropso r package zambrano bigiarini and rojas 2013 for the experiments without the mosquito net results showed that ks was the more sensitive parameter the van genuchten parameters and manning coefficient influenced results only during the first minutes of experiments at the beginning of runoff indeed at the 1 m2 plot scale some parameters such as the manning coefficient do not have much influence on overland flow however calibration of parameters with kineros and hydropso r failed for the simulations for the experiments with a mosquito net indeed experimental results clearly showed that permeability was not constant in time furthermore the problem with so many parameters was an ill posed problem and a calibration performed in a blind manner gave various sets of optimized parameters that were very different between similar experiments as a consequence we dropped kineros and chose to use the cast3m code to focus the modelling on the decrease of ks with time we also tried to minimize the number of parameters to be estimated by using as much as possible values taken from the literature the values for the manning s roughness coefficient for overland flow on a bare clay loam soil that are recommended by woolhiser 1975 range between 0 012 and 0 033 s m 1 3 we chose n 0 015 s m 1 3 table 3 as mentioned in table 1 the soil at the experimental site was mainly clayey hence the van genuchten parameters and the residual water content were chosen to equal the mean values recommended for clay meyer et al 1997 nvg 1 13 αvg 0 62 and θres 0 07 numerical results were not sensitive to the value of the specific storage it was chosen equal to 10 5 m 1 the hydraulic conductivity is defined as the ratio of the fluid velocity to the hydraulic gradient it characterizes the permeability of porous media in the present paper we investigated the role of the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks to drive the partitioning of water between runoff and infiltration the parameter ks was assumed constant in space at the 1 m2 plot scale however it was assumed to vary with time during the rainfall event the purpose of this time variation was to model the changes of the soil properties due to the evolution of the soil structure related to the apparition of crusts that reduce the infiltrability the modelling of the decrease of ks with time due to seal formation is often modelled with the following exponential function 2 k s t k k 0 k e t where k 0 and k are the initial and final hydraulic conductivities lt 1 respectively silburn and connoly 1995 assouline 2004 and references therein ribolzi et al 2011 the coefficient quantifies the decay rate of k s t the higher the value of the more strongly the decrease of k s with time as we had no information about the depth of the sealing layer during the rainfall experiments we assumed that k s did not vary with depth in the soil the parameter k s can be considered as an effective parameter for modelling several processes that modify the soil infiltrability during rainfall finally the parameters k 0 k and that characterize the decrease of k s with time according to the time evolution given by eq 2 were the only parameters to be estimated table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface runoff experiments the overland flow coefficient that is equal to the ratio between the total overland flow and the total rainfall was determined for each 0 5 m2 plot during the three successive rainfall simulations experimental results obtained for the four different plots refa refb piga and pigb and for the three successive simulated rainfalls r1 r2 and r3 are displayed in fig 2 on each figure empty and filled symbols correspond to the sub plots without and with a mosquito net respectively the thick solid lines correspond to the model outputs see section 3 2 the comparison of overland flow coefficients with or without a mosquito net clearly shows the large effect of raindrop impact on runoff fig 2 the values of the total runoff water measured at the outlet of the 0 5 m2 plots for the three successive simulated rainfalls are plotted in fig 3 here again the comparison of overland flow with or without a mosquito net using the non parametric wilcoxon analysis clearly shows significantly higher values without a mosquito p value 0 001 hence the data clearly show that raindrop impact enhances runoff generation regardless of the treatment applied to the sub plot and the rainfall event table 4 gives the main surface features of the various sub plots both before and after the series of rainfall experiments before the first simulated rainfall 56 72 of the surface of the sub plots was covered with free aggregates a large part of the remaining surface 19 39 was covered by crusts after the third rainfall almost of all the free aggregates disappeared at the surface of the sub plot submitted to raindrop impact and the soil surface was mainly covered by crusts 81 91 in contrast 37 47 of the surface of sub plots without raindrop impact was still covered by free aggregates after the three successive rainfalls and the crusts covered 41 54 3 2 surface runoff modelling 3 2 1 simulations fig 2 gives the evolution over time of both the measured and modelled overland flow coefficients for the eight sub plots and for the three rainfalls empty and filled symbols correspond to the sub plots without and with the mosquito net respectively the characteristics of the time evolutions ks t used for modelling the runoff are given in table 5 overland flow in each sub plot without a mosquito net was correctly modelled with a fast decreasing k s t with about the same value 4 2 h 1 except for the sub plot refa during rainfall r1 for which a lower value was obtained 1 8 h 1 in this particular case the value is explained by a slower increase of the runoff coefficient during the early stages of the experiment fig 2 due to an artifact related to the temporary obstruction of the sub plot outlets with coarse soil particles noticeably a decrease of k 0 and k values was observed from one rainfall to the next for sub plots without a mosquito net in contrast overland flow in each sub plot with a mosquito net was correctly modelled with a slowly decreasing k s t with a nearly ten times smaller value for 0 48 h 1 here again the values of k 0 and k decreased from one rainfall to the next evolutions of overland flow in the four sub plots with a mosquito net during the first rainfall r1 before spreading of manure are very similar they are all correctly modelled with the same k s t this result illustrates the reproducibility of the experiments 3 3 discussion the twenty four runoff experiments performed on sub plots with or without a mosquito net and with or without pig manure showed that raindrop impact drastically enhanced runoff generation on both bare soils and on manured amended soils the temporal evolution of runoff was correctly modelled using a soil hydraulic conductivity that exponentially decreases over time of exposure to rainfall both experimental and modelling results can help to distinguish the phenomena that increase runoff 3 3 1 effect of raindrop impact in the sub plots where the raindrop impact was reduced with mosquito net the reproducibility of the experiments was higher coefficient of variation 22 compared to sub plots exposed to raindrop impact coefficient of variation 50 as shown in fig 2 the evolution over time of the overland flow coefficient for the four sub plots under the first simulated rainfall are very similar they were all correctly modelled using the same very slowly decreasing hydraulic conductivity table 5 the differences in infiltration rate between unprotected and protected sub plots could be ascribed to the differences in crusting rates prior to the first simulated rainfall there was no significant difference among the two series of subplots with a mean crusts coverage of 29 4 for the unprotected subplots and 26 9 for the protected subplots after the three simulated rainfalls differences were significant with 86 5 and 49 6 respectively with a mean increase in crust coverage for the unprotected sub plots of 57 5 and a mean rate for protected sub plots of only 23 12 the role of the mosquito net in protecting soil from crust development was clearly shown after rainfalls very few erosion crusts were observed on the plots in contrast structural crusts covered 77 to 89 of the sub plot surfaces without a mosquito net and 41 54 of the sub plot surfaces with a mosquito net the high coverage of the soil with structural crusts is due to the high slope gradient of the plots indeed ribolzi et al 2011 showed that erosion crusts preferentially form under gentle slopes while structural crusts mainly develop under steep slopes furthermore the raindrop impact seems to boost the formation of structural crusts the formation of a surprisingly high proportion of crusts and the reduction of infiltration rate on all the sub plots suggest that the mosquito net did not remove kinetic energy completely data have been established under this type of rainfall simulator asseline and valentin 1978 for a rainfall intensity of 90 mm h 1 with a mean drop diameter of 1 34 mm and a falling height of 3 6 m it gave a mean falling velocity and a kinetic energy equal to 8 4 m s 1 and 22 5 j mm 1 m 2 respectively in a crude estimation based on the drop size distribution measured under 90 mm h 1 with the rainfall simulator asseline and valentin 1978 we can consider that half of the droplets with a diameter smaller than 2 mm could pass through the net unhindered they represent a kinetic energy of 3 8 j mm 1 m 2 the other half hit the mosquito net and fall from a 0 12 m height with a reduced velocity and kinetic energy equal to 3 5 m s 1 and 1 7 j mm 1 m 2 respectively similarly we can consider that all the drops with a diameter larger than 2 mm also hit the mosquito net and fall with a reduced velocity and a kinetic energy equal to 3 5 m s 1 and 2 7 j mm 1 m 2 respectively using these assumptions the total kinetic energy would be equal to 8 2 j mm 1 m 2 which means a reduction of 64 other studies have also used a mosquito net to dissipate kinetic energy e g carmi et al 2018 but to our knowledge only young and wiersma 1973 attempted to evaluate its impact on the reduction of kinetic energy using four layers of standard insect screen set up 5 cm above ground and high speed photographs to evaluate the velocity of drops they estimated that the falling velocity and kinetic energy were reduced by 51 66 and 76 89 respectively our approximation seems consistent with these data because we used only one layer of mosquito net that was placed further from the ground 12 cm instead of 5 cm the cumulative kinetic energy of the three high intensity rainfalls is equal to 2214 j m 2 which is therefore high enough to induce the development of crusts on protected sub plots this mean increase in crust coverage for the unprotected sub plots is about half the mean rate for protected sub plots which also seems consistent with a reduction of 64 of the kinetic energy it is well established that the development of crusts increases with cumulative kinetic energy e g baumhardt et al 1990 armenise et al 2018 these results show that runoff is much higher in the sub plots without a mosquito net figs 2 and 3 clearly illustrating the well known impact of raindrops on runoff generation and erosion silburn and connoly 1995 assouline and mualem 1997 fohrer et al 1999 lacombe et al 2018 when the impact of raindrops was reduced total runoff was on average reduced by 70 fig 3 this reduction is much higher than the one hour averaged reduction of 4 measured by an et al 2012 on a gentle 9 slope with a mollisol and with a 100 mm h 1 rainfall intensity however in these simulated rainfall experiments the elimination of raindrop impact induced a strong reduction of the runoff rate 1 13 up to 84 at the beginning of the rainfall until 20 min the authors mentioned that the main factor was rill initiation because they were using 8 m long soil pans under laboratory conditions conditions that were very different from 1 m long plots the important development of crusts on the houay pano soils can be linked to their texture but also to their content of a relatively high proportion of swelling clays valentin 1994 valentin and bresson 1997 the reduction of infiltration in swelling soils has been theoretically discussed for some time giraldez and sposito 1985 however a quantitative analysis of x ray computed tomography images of soil seal development under simulated rainfall has only recently been performed armenise et al 2018 this study showed that for a silty clay loam with an initial porosity equal to 0 24 the porosity of the first 5 mm was reduced by a factor of about two which is a large reduction but this may be due to crust formation rather than to porosity closure due to swelling clay aksu et al 2015 investigated the swelling of clay minerals and its impact on the permeability of unconsolidated porous media their experimental results confirmed that permeability decreases with increasing clay content however in high porosity samples more than 36 40 they showed that the reduction in porosity due to clay swelling was insufficient to cause a meaningful reduction of permeability in the present experiments the high soil porosity 58 cf table 1 may explain the weak reduction of infiltration due to swelling effects moreover no cracks were observed prior to the experiments where cracks have been observed prior to rainfall simulations they tended to close very rapidly casenave and valentin 1989 which cannot explain the gradual reduction of infiltration under the mosquito net furthermore if the closing of cracks were the main process of infiltration reduction it should be similar in the two series of sub plots instead a clear difference has been observed which can be more surely ascribed to the difference in kinetic energy and resulting crusting during the first rainfall experiments performed on the sub plots protected by a mosquito net differ from those performed without net only by the rainfall characteristics droplet size and kinetic energy as already discussed without raindrop impact results are reproducible runoff slowly increases during the rainfall event in the same manner fig 2 in contrast with raindrop impact the results are influenced by the plot characteristics runoff is higher in plots a than in plots b fig 2 according to rawls et al 1990 surface sealing depends on soil properties presence and characteristics of aggregates and organic matter at the soil surface and to land use practices assouline and mualem 1997 showed that it also depends on rainfall characteristics all the sub plots had the same soil properties table 1 same land use practices and were subject to the same rainfall intensity with identical drop characteristics however they did not have exactly the same surface features table 4 the variability of infiltrability on bare plots has already been observed in the houay pano catchment patin et al 2012 proposed that infiltrability during a natural rainfall event should be considered as a random function in space and time that is described for each land use by a log normal probability density function for bare soils they obtained a median infiltrability and a geometrical standard deviation equal to 10 mm h 1 and 2 9 mm h 1 respectively the infiltrabilities obtained in our experiments after three rainfall simulations between 15 and 23 mm h 1 table 5 are in this range of values 10 2 9 10 2 9 reflecting the local variations of initial surface properties 3 3 2 manure effect when the raindrop impact is reduced by the mosquito net the results are also reproducible during the second and third simulated rainfalls i e after the amendment with pig manure of two of the sub plots table 5 however the overland flow coefficient on amended soils increased more rapidly than on bare soils fig 2 comparison of total runoff on soils with or without manure fig 3 using the non parametric mann whitney analysis shows significantly higher runoff on manured soil p value 0 05 the decrease of infiltration on manured soils can be explained by the plugging of pores by manure particles at the soil surface bottom et al 1986 in contrast when the raindrop impact is reduced by the mosquito net the protecting role of various types of manures that has been observed and described in the literature mostaghimi et al 1989 gilley and risse 2000 roberts and clanton 2000 becomes much less important the experimental results also show that when bare soil is protected from raindrop impact the presence of pig manure at the surface reduces infiltration by a factor of about two in the field plants can play the same role as the mosquito net by protecting the soil from the raindrop effect hence higher runoff may be expected on vegetated fields where pigs are free to roam this overland flow enhancement can facilitate the transport of bacteria that are present in the manure and consequently can deteriorate water quality ackerman and taylor 1995 choudhary et al 1996 ramos et al 2006 results of the experiments with raindrop impact are very different the evolution over time of the overland flow coefficients depend more on initial soil surface features than on the presence or not of manure overland flow coefficients on plots a are always higher than those measured on plots b even during the first rainfall when there is no manure applied at the soil surface fig 2 non parametric mann whitney analysis of total runoff shows no significant difference between bare and manured soils p value 0 05 the manure application rates were perhaps too small to have a protecting effect and to reduce the sealing raindrop impact as suggested by roberts and clanton 2000 furthermore plots a and b were only very partially covered by disconnected small patches of pig manure although roberts and clanton added slurry to swine and dairy manure to completely cover the soil surface of their experimental columns 3 3 3 modelling of ks runoff experiments were modelled with the darcy continuum approach described in section 2 2 with a soil hydraulic conductivity that exponentially decreases over time of exposure to rainfall the formation of structural crusts observed after three successive rainfalls table 4 can explain this decrease almost all runoff experiments on sub plots without a mosquito net were correctly modelled with the same α value 4 2 h 1 which corresponds to a strong decrease of infiltrability during the rainfall events ribolzi et al 2011 expressed as the ratio of the rainfall intensity r and a dimensioning parameter τ from experiments performed on 30 and 75 slope at the plot scale they showed that less permeable erosion crusts formed on the 30 slope than the structural crusts that formed on the 75 slope they obtained τ 12 mm and 26 mm for the 30 and 75 slope respectively in the present study we obtain τ 22 mm for a 50 slope this value further highlights the strong dependence of infiltration rate on slope in contrast to this value of α all of runoff experiments with a mosquito net required a much smaller value of α α 0 48 h 1 such a value of α results in a very slow and quasi linear decrease of k s t the assumption that ks is constant over soil depth is subject to question as the modified hydraulic conductivity should only be imposed in the sealing layer several studies have shown that seal thickness depends on rainfall characteristics farres 1978 bedaiwy 2008 the increase of seal thickness with increasing rainfall duration was recently quantified from high resolution x ray computed tomography images of soil seal development under simulated rainfall armenise et al 2018 for a silty clay loam soil the seal thickness increased from 1 mm after 2 min of rainfall to 5 4 mm after 14 min of rainfall however as no information is available about the seal or crust thickness on the present plots we preferred not to add a new unknown parameter furthermore in layered media the median permeability is controlled by the least permeable layer 3 3 4 effect of successive rainfalls as can be clearly seen in fig 2 for each plot the overland flow coefficient increases during successive rainfalls for a given plot this increase is correctly modelled by a decrease of the initial hydraulic conductivity k 0 from one rainfall to the next table 5 the experiments were performed in may just before the beginning of the rainfall season the first simulation provides an indication of the behaviour of dry bare soils at the beginning of the monsoon with an infiltration capacity that progressively decreases over time of exposure to rainfall even if there was a four day gap between the first and second simulated rainfall the soil did not regain its initial properties indeed the leading cause of infiltration reduction was not the reversible clay swelling but rather the irreversible crusting of the soil surface as more rain fell more structural crusts were formed and the soil became less and less permeable 4 conclusion twenty four rainfall simulation experiments performed with or without raindrop impact on bare or amended soils led to the following conclusions raindrop impact drastically enhanced runoff generation on bare soils when raindrop impact was reduced runoff was on average reduced by 70 the energy of the raindrops induced a rapid evolution of the hydraulic properties of the soil resulting in a reduction of the hydraulic conductivity and a concomitant increase in runoff intensity a soil hydraulic conductivity that exponentially decreased over time of exposure to rainfall correctly modelled the temporal evolution of runoff under high intensity rainfall runoff on soils amended with pig manure was the same as on bare soils in contrast when the impact of raindrops was reduced with a 2 mm grid size wire screen runoff on amended soils was more than twice that of bare soils soil exposed to successive rainfalls became less and less permeable one of the main conclusions of this study is that on steep slopes and under high kinetic energy rainfall conditions surface runoff is very high and even a low cover such as a mosquito net can significantly reduce it this result is in agreement with recent studies that showed that when cultivation is abandoned which is the current tendency in vietnam natural regrowth reduces runoff lacombe et al 2016 the next step of this work will be to characterize the transport of faecal indicator bacteria from these steep slopes under high intensity rainfall indeed increased microbial pathogen dissemination and contamination of stream waters are crucial problems in rural southeast asia for the estimate of the flood and health risk it is essential that the future simulations better describe surface runoff and erosion at the catchment scale and take into account not only the spatial heterogeneity of the soil hydraulic conductivity but also its temporal

6716,the boussinesq equation is usually used to describe one dimensional unconfined groundwater movement solutions of this equation are important as they provide useful insights regarding the water table response to stream level variations and allow us to quantify the exchange flow between the stream and the aquifer due to the nonlinearity of the boussinesq equation the solutions are generally obtained using numerical methods however for certain classes of initial and boundary conditions there are both exact and approximate analytical solution techniques this work focuses on the latter approach a new mathematical technique for approximate solutions of the boussinesq equation describing flow in horizontal unconfined aquifers induced by sudden change in boundary head is presented the method applies to the problems of recharging and dewatering of an unconfined aquifer and approximate solutions to both problems are derived the solutions were obtained by introducing an empirical function with four parameters which might be obtained using a numerical fitting procedure results based on this technique were found to be easily calculated and to be in good agreement with those obtained using numerical calculation based on runge kutta approach a benchmark between the proposed solutions and five existing approximate analytical solutions shows that the present solutions are the most accurate approximate solutions among those tested applications of the solutions are presented in the context of estimating aquifer hydraulic parameters keywords boussinesq equation groundwater flow unconfined aquifer water table profile approximate solution 1 introduction groundwater flow in unconfined aquifer can be approximately modeled by the nonlinear boussinesq equation boussinesq 1904 brutsaert 2005 this equation is broadly used in many areas of hydrology including catchment hydrology design of site remediation baseflow studies and recession analysis irrigation and drainage and constructed subsurface wetlands troch et al 2013 rupp and selker 2006 dan et al 2012 lockington et al 2000 solutions to the boussinesq equation are therefore important as they provide useful insights into the response of the water table to stream level variations and allow the quantification of the exchange between the stream and the aquifer as a consequence they remain an object of active research bansal 2012 basha 2013 moutsopoulos 2013 chor et al 2013 olsen and telyakovskiy 2013 dias et al 2014 jiang and tang 2015 tang et al 2016 bartlett and porporato 2018 due to the nonlinearity of the boussinesq equation few exact and approximate solutions exist in the literature and they are only provided for problems with specific initial and boundary conditions barenblatt 1952 derived a series solution for a time dependent water head at the origin parlange et al 2000 obtained a polynomial exact solution of the boussinesq equation with special time dependent boundary condition the solution can describe water movement both in and out of an aquifer and is useful to check numerical schemes telyakovskiy et al 2002 proposed a cubic polynomial approximation to the similarity solution of the boussinesq equation for one dimensional unconfined groundwater flow in a horizontal initially dry aquifer with a power law inlet condition daly and porporato 2004 presented several exact solutions of the boussinesq equation describing the groundwater flow along a hillslope using a traveling wave transformation the practical applicability of their approach is limited by the fact that the same transformation must also apply to the initial and boundary conditions telyakovskiy and allen 2006 provided closed form approximate solutions to model horizontal infiltration described by the boussinesq equation in a semi infinite aquifer that is initially dry they are applicable to four types of time dependent boundary conditions two on head and two on flux telyakovskiy at al 2010 proposed power series solution to the boussinesq equation that use power flux boundary condition moutsopoulos 2013 used the adomian decomposition method to derive a semi analytical solution of the boussinesq equation by imposing a nonlinear robin boundary condition recently bartlett and porporato 2018 presented a class of exact solutions to the full nonlinear boussinesq equation that apply to sloping aquifers and account for source and sink terms such as bedrock seepage the solutions have an explicit dependence on the space coordinate and they are limited to specific time dependent boundary conditions and space dependent initial conditions that are generated from the general forms of the exact solutions troch et al 2013 presented a review about existing exact and approximate solutions of the boussinesq groundwater flow equations in the present work we focus only on the solutions of the problem involving sudden change in boundary head with constant initial and boundary conditions sudden changes in boundary head offer a realistic approach of real world problems this problem is an idealized formulation of the problem of water level prediction in an unconfining aquifer at early times due to water level changes at an adjacent water body this water body can be either natural such a river or lake or man made e g irrigation trench the solutions of this problem are useful for the computation of flow volumes stored or extracted from the aquifer tolikas et al 1984 lockington 1997 basha 2013 moreover the water level change in channel flooded plains created by recharge weirs constructed to enhance the rate of inflow to an adjacent aquifer can be approximated by a step raise previous studies e g revelli and ridolfi 2000 state that changes in trenches channels occur in times that are much shorter than those occurring in phreatic aquifers and therefore can be schematized by sharp jumps therefore approximate analytical solutions for problems with sudden jump are important in modeling such real cases few approximate solutions of the classical problem of the water table response to a sudden rise in the head have been developed in the past polubarinova kochina 1962 1977 presented analytical expressions for the boussinesq equation by applying a regular series expansion approach tolikas et al 1984 applied similarity transformation and polynomial approximation near the inflection point of the head profile to obtain simple approximate closed form solution lockington 1997 used a weighted residual method to derive simple analytical approximations to the solutions of the boussinesq equation the method was applied to both recharging and dewatering of an unconfined aquifer due to sudden change in head moutsopoulos 2010 applied the adomian s decomposition method to obtain a simple series solution with few terms he performed a benchmark test between different existing solutions of the problem which shows the advantage of his solution basha 2013 used a traveling wave technique combined with perturbation method to get an approximate solution to the one dimensional boussinesq equation the solution is presented in implicit form and holds also for time dependent boundary head chor et al 2013 derived a series solution for the nonlinear boussinesq equation in terms of the similarity variable of the boltzmann transformation in a semi infinite domain the solution applies for discharging aquifers with zero boundary head and constant initial head more recently jiang and tang 2015 adopted a decomposition method by separating the original problem into linear diffusion equation and two correction functions to develop a general approximate solution for the groundwater response problem the present study develops a new method to obtain efficient approximate solutions to the one dimensional boussinesq equation induced by sudden change in boundary head the method applies to both recharging and dewatering aquifers and the obtained solutions are presented in simple forms the nonlinear solutions are of a simple combination of power and exponential forms that describe the position of the water table as a function of head and time they are valid for constant boundary and initial conditions including zero head i e dry aquifer expressions of practical importance such as the exchange flow rates in the stream aquifer system and the associated flow volumes stored or extracted from the aquifer are easily obtained from the general form solutions additional results include analytical formulas for the recharging wetting and discharging dewatering fronts and an enhanced relationship for aquifer parameter estimation 2 governing equations the governing equation for one dimensional groundwater flow in a horizontal unconfined aquifer can be described by the boussinesq equation 1 s h t k x h h x where h is the piezometric head l i e the height of the water table measured from the impervious horizontal base of the aquifer x is the horizontal coordinate l t is the time t k is the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer l t and s is the specific yield the initial and boundary conditions are 2 h h x 0 t 0 3 h h 0 x 0 t 0 4 h h x t 0 where h 0 and h are given constant heads it should be noted that eq 1 with conditions 2 4 has two possible solutions for h depending on the relative values of h and h 0 h 0 h for recharge and h 0 h for discharge fig 1 shows a schematic representation of the flow system in recharging a and discharging b aquifers in the next a simple method is proposed to solve analytically the boussinesq eq 1 with boundary and initial conditions 2 4 for both the recharging and the dewatering of a homogeneous unconfined aquifer 3 approximate solutions 3 1 method of solution the following dimensionless head h and dimensionless similarity variable η are introduced depending on the problem of interest recharging or discharging 5 h h h 0 f o r r e c h a r g i n g h h f o r d i s c h a r g i n g and 6 η x k h 0 s t f o r r e c h a r g i n g x k h s t f o r d i s c h a r g i n g the substitution of 5 6 into 1 transforms this latter to the following ordinary differential equation ode 7 η 2 d h d η d d η h d h d η subject to the boundary conditions 8 h h 0 η 0 9 h h η where 10 h 0 1 f o r r e c h a r g i n g h 0 h μ f o r d i s c h a r g i n g and 11 h h h 0 1 μ f o r

limits h and h yields 12 h 1 2 h h η d h d η d h where h is the dummy variable eq 12 holds since the flux vanishes at h h let s introduce the following function f defined by 13 f h h h η d h eq 12 writes then as follows 14 h 1 2 f h f h where f h d η d h is the second derivative of f with respect to η the following mathematical expression of the function f h is proposed 15 f h a h h m e c h h n b h h where a b c m and n are unknown parameters to be determined later the choice of the functional form 15 is justified in section 3 2 based on 15 the analytical expression of η h f h is obtained as follows 16 η h sgn h h 0 a m n c h h n h h m 1 e c h h n b where sgn is the sign function defined by sgn h h 0 1 if h h 0 recharging case and sgn h h 0 1 if h h 0 discharging case let s denote by η f the penetration distance of the recharging discharging front i e the value of η at which h reaches h this gives from 16 b η f the number of the unknown parameters in 16 may be reduced by using condition 8 the analytical expression of the penetration distance of the recharging discharging front i e the wetting front as function of the remaining unknown parameters is then obtained as follows 17 η f sgn h h 0 a m n c h 0 h n h 0 h m 1 e c h 0 h n substitution of 17 into 16 i e b η f yields 18 η h sgn h h 0 a m n c h h n h h m 1 e c h h n m n c h 0 h n h 0 h m 1 e c h 0 h n eq 18 represents the general form of the proposed approximate solution in terms of the dimensionless variables it holds for both recharging and discharging cases the values of h h 0 and h are defined in eqs 5 10 and 11 depending on the problem in consideration the general form solution 18 expresses the similarity variable η defined by eq 6 as function of the normalized height of the water table h for any h between min h 0 h and max h 0 h to obtain a physically acceptable solution some conditions on the parameters a c m and n must be imposed by definition f is a nonnegative function of h for the recharging case and a negative function of h for the discharging case as can be shown from 13 therefore according to eq 14 f h must be negative for the recharging case and positive for the discharging case i e the dimensionless head h is nonnegative appendix a shows that f h is negative under the following conditions a 0 c 0 m 1 n 0 and 2 m n 1 0 while it is shown in appendix b that f d h 0 under the following conditions a 0 m 1 2 m n 1 0 and n 0 if c 0 or n 1 if c 0 the approximate solution in terms of the physical variables writes in the x t plane in the following implicit form after using 5 and 6 19 x a k h 0 s t m n c h h 0 1 μ n h h 0 1 μ m 1 e c h h 0 1 μ n m n c 1 1 μ n 1 1 μ m 1 e c 1 1 μ n for the recharging case and 20 x a k h s t m n c 1 h h n 1 h h m 1 e c 1 h h n m n c 1 μ n 1 μ m 1 e c 1 μ n for the discharging case eqs 19 and 20 involve four parameters a c m and n which must be determined as follows eq 14 may be rewritten in terms of the unknown parameters after using 15 this gives 21 h a 2 2 n 2 c 2 h h 2 n n c 2 m n 1 h h n m m 1 h h m 1 e c h h n h h m 1 e c h h n m n c h 0 h n h 0 h m 1 e c h 0 h n eq 21 shows that the normalized piezometric head h is expressed in terms of the unknown parameters by the mathematical expression of the right hand side rhs of 21 the unknown parameters a c m and n can be determined through curve fitting of h versus the mathematical expression defined by the rhs of 21 for min h 0 h h max h 0 h the fitting procedure is described in section 3 3 3 2 justification of the functional form 15 the function f h is defined as the sum of two terms the first one is a combination of power and exponential functions of h h while the second is a linear function of h h this special choice of f h is justified by the following points 1 the form 15 as function of h h is chosen in such a way that f h 0 this condition is required by definition of f h in 13 2 the product of power and exponential functions provides a continuous and infinitely differentiable function this would result in a well defined right hand side form of eq 21 since this form is defined as a product of f h and f h as shown in 14 3 the second term in 15 is defined in such a way that the normalized piezometric head h profile admits a recharging discharging front as shown in 17 and 18 it should be noted that the empirical function 15 is not unique and other functional forms would be possible however preliminary numerical experiments show that the proposed empirical function applies successfully to a wide range of nonlinearity level μ h 0 h 3 3 determination of fitting parameters the unknow parameters appearing in the proposed approximate solutions can be determined by curve fitting to do that the rhs of eq 21 is denoted by φ h a b m n therefore the segment 0 h 1 is divided into n equal intervals h i 1 h i with h 0 0 and h n 1 the parameters a b m and n are then determined by carrying out an optimization procedure on the quantity i 0 n φ h i a b m n h i 2 ε where ε is an arbitrary small number ε 0 in practical applications we take ε 10 6 preliminary numerical experiments show that the results of the fitting procedure are insensitive to n for n 50 in the present study all the examples are performed with n 1000 starting from an initial set of parameters the set which gives the best fit between the curve representing h and that representing φ h a b m n is adopted in the approximate solution in the present work the fitting procedure is performed by using the microsoft excel solver walsh and diamond 1995 4 flow rates and flow volumes in problems of recharge or discharge of an aquifer it is of practical importance to compute the flow rates and flow volumes as functions of time in this section simple formulas are given for that purpose the flow rate flux q at the stream aquifer boundary x 0 and the flow volume v or cumulative flow rate are defined by 22 q t k h 0 h x x 0 v t 0 t q τ d τ using 5 6 and 10 and the relationships h x x 0 d h d η η 0 η x x 0 and d h d η η 0 1 f h 0 we obtain the recharge and discharge rates q r and q d respectively as follows 23 q t q r t ks h 0 3 2 f h 0 2 t f o r r e c h a r g i n g q d t ks h 3 2 f h 0 2 t f o r d i s c h a r g i n g where the value of h 0 in 23 depends on the problem in consideration the stored recharged volume in an aquifer v r and the extracted discharged volume v d from an aquifer are then obtained from 22 and 23 as follows 24 v t v r t h 0 3 2 f h 0 kst f o r r e c h a r g i n g v d t h 3 2 f h 0 kst f o r d i s c h a r g i n g note that the flow rates are inversely proportional to t while the cumulative flow rates are proportional to t in other words the cumulative flow rates are inversely proportional to the flow rates v r h 0 3 k s f h 0 2 2 q r and v d h 3 k s f h 0 2 2 q d 5 application and discussion 5 1 comparison between water table heights the proposed approximate solution method is illustrated with few examples by comparing the results to various analytical approaches examples for both recharging and dewatering aquifers have been considered a benchmark test is carried out for the case of recharging aquifer between the proposed solution 16 a numerical solution and five existing analytical solutions the existing analytical solutions are presented in appendix c the numerical solution is obtained using the runge kutta approach presented in tolikas et al 1984 and moutsopoulos 2010 which is assumed to be the reference solution this numerical solution is quite accurate and has been previously used as reference solution in benchmarking study moutsopoulos 2010 the analytical solutions used in this test are the u expansion solution c 1 and c 2 of polubarinova kochina 1962 the solution c 3 and c 4 proposed by lockington 1997 the approximate solution defined by eqs c 7 and c 8 and derived by moutsopoulos 2010 the traveling wave solution c 9 c 10 presented by basha 2013 and the approximate explicit solution c 11 c 12 proposed by jiang and tang 2015 fig 2 shows the water table height as function of distance obtained by the runge kutta method the above cited analytical solutions and the present solution 19 a t 5 d for three values of μ the values of the parameters a c m and n obtained after the fitting procedure and used to produce the water table height from eq 19 are presented in table 1 the exact and fitted dimensionless heights h h h 0 defined by eq 21 for the three values of μ are shown in fig 3 it can be observed that for μ 1 5 all analytical solutions are close to the numerical solution except the solution of basha 2013 which shows a deviation for small values of the water table height for μ 3 the solution of jiang and tang 2015 shows discrepancies with the other solutions for large values of the water table height while the solution of basha 2013 deviates from the other solutions for small values of the water table height for μ 10 the solutions of polubarinova kochina 1962 and basha 2013 overestimate the water table height close to the initial value while the solution of jiang and tang 2015 not shown in the figure completely fails in summary the present solution and those proposed by lockington 1997 and moutsopoulos 2010 give the best results to evaluate the difference between the numerical results and the various analytical solutions an error ratio is used which is defined by e r h a h n h 0 100 where h a and h n are the predicted water table level by the analytical and numerical runge kutta methods respectively fig 4 shows a comparison of the error ratios for the present proposed method and from the other analytical methods for the three values of μ the results show that the present approximate solution gives the best results the smaller error ratios for all values of μ the second benchmarking test is performed for a dewatering aquifer with h 0 1 m and h 10 m which correspond to μ h 0 h 0 1 the proposed solution 18 is compared to the series solution derived by chor et al 2013 fig 5 a shows the comparison between the two solutions in terms of the dimensionless height h h h as function of dimensionless similarity variable η x k h s t the figure shows excellent match between the two solutions fig 5b shows the exact and fitted dimensionless heights the fitted dimensionless height is obtained from eq 21 the values of the fitted parameters obtained from the fitting procedure are presented in table 3 case h 10 it can be observed that the exact and fitted dimensionless heights are in good agreement they slightly differ near h 1 in order to qualitatively compare the two solutions fig 5c shows the absolute error between the two solutions the figure indicates a maximum absolute error of the order of 10 3 5 2 comparison between flow rates in this section the flow rates or fluxes are compared with other existing results lockington 1997 defined the recharging and discharging fluxes q r and q d in terms of recharge and discharge coefficients c r and c d as follows 25 q r c r h 0 h ks 2 t 26 q d c d h 0 h ks 2 t where c r and c d have units of l 0 5 and defined by 27 c r 1 2 μ h 0 h 2 1 μ 28 c d 1 2 μ h 0 h 2 1 μ accordingly the recharge and discharge coefficients obtained from the present work may be obtained by comparing q r defined in 23 with 25 and q d defined in 23 with 26 this yields 29 c r h 0 3 2 f h 0 h 0 h 30 c d h 3 2 f h 0 h 0 h in a similar way the recharge and discharge coefficients corresponding to the method of basha 2013 may be obtained based on his eqs 51 and 52 as follows 31 c r c s h 3 2 h 0 h 32 c d c s h 3 2 h 0 h where 33 c s μ 2 1 5 μ 2 12 μ 11 μ 1 note that c s 0 for recharging and c s 0 for dewatering i e discharging using 23 and c 7 the recharge coefficient corresponding to the method of moutsopoulos 2010 may be written as follows 34 c r 2 h 1 2 h 0 c 1 h 0 h in a similar way the recharge coefficient obtained from the method of jiang and tang 2015 may obtained from 23 and c 11 as follows 35 c r 2 h 0 π h 1 π 1 2 h 0 h 2 2 h the recharge discharge coefficients presented above are compared to each other s and with numerical solution for a range of values of μ resp 1 μ table 2 shows the values of the recharge coefficients obtained numerically from the present study and from other existing results for a range of values of μ from 1 1 to 20 for all these cases the value of h is kept constant equal to 1 m while the value of h 0 is varied the values of parameters a c m and n needed for the computation of the recharge coefficient obtained from this study are presented in table 1 for each value of μ the values of parameter c 1 used in eq 34 are also presented in table 1 the numerical values denoted by c r n were obtained using matlab these values are taken as reference values and the comparison between the various recharge coefficients is performed in terms of the percentage relative error 100 c r c r n c r n this example demonstrates the success of the present method in predicting the recharge coefficients indeed the best results are those obtained from the present study the results obtained from the method of lockington 1997 show a slightly smaller relative error only for the case of small value of μ 1 1 in a similar way the discharge coefficients obtained from the present work and the those obtained from the works of lockington 1997 and basha 2013 are compared to numerical values by means of percentage relative error for a range of values of 1 μ going from 1 1 to 20 the value of h 0 is fixed to 1 m while the value of h is varied the values of parameters a c m and n needed for the computation of the discharge coefficient obtained from this study are shown in table 3 the results of the comparison are presented in table 4 it can be shown that the best results are those obtained from the present method and from the method of lockington 1997 the relative errors obtained from the method of lockington 1997 are slightly better for small values of 1 μ while the present method shows better smaller relative errors for large values of μ both methods give small relative errors i e less than 0 03 while the method of basha 2013 results in larger relative errors i e 2 3 5 3 estimating of aquifer hydraulic parameters the method of recession slope analysis proposed by brutsaert and nieber 1977 is one of the few analytical tools which has been widely applied for estimating aquifer hydraulic parameters at the field scale and beyond brutsaert and lopez 1998 parlange et al 2001 mendoza el al 2003 rupp et al 2004 malvicini et al 2005 recession flow analysis is a hydrological technique used for forecasting drought flows aquifer characterization and investigating the groundwater regime in basins the method consists in plotting the observed recession slope of the drought flow hydrograph or d q d t against the discharge q such that d q d t f q where f is an arbitrary function and then compare observations with analytical solutions to the boussinesq equation for one dimensional flow in a rectangular horizontal aquifer several analytical solutions to the boussinesq equation boussinesq 1904 polubarinova kochina 1962 lockington 1997 rupp and selker 2005 basha 2013 show that the recession slope of the drought flow hydrograph can be expressed in the form 36 d q d t α q β where α is a function of the physical dimensions and hydraulic properties of the aquifer and β is a constant in eq 36 q is the total outflow discharge from the aquifer which is the integration of all flow q per unit width of aquifer entering a stream network of length l i e q 2 q l brutsaert and nieber 1977 using q d for q as defined in 23 yields 37 d q d t α q 3 α 1 2 k s h 3 l 2 f h 0 2 for μ 0 i e h 0 0 the values of the parameters a c m and n obtained from the fitting procedure are a 6 297805 c 0 013546 m 1 147199 and n 2 975891 respectively accordingly the coefficient α is equal to 1 1337 k s h 3 l 2 this value is very close to those obtained from the analytical solution of polubarinova kochina 1962 α 1 133 k s h 3 l 2 and from the analytical solution of lockington 1997 α 1 1361 k s h 3 l 2 see e g rupp and selker 2006 note that the value of parameter α obtained from the traveling wave analytical solution of basha 2013 is slightly higher i e α 1 158 k s h 3 l 2 eq 37 is useful for estimating the saturated hydraulic conductivity k indeed if the mean aquifer depth h and the specific yield are known a priori the hydraulic conductivity k can be obtained from 37 through curve fitting of d q d t versus q on a log log scale 6 conclusion this paper presents an efficient analytical method for approximate solutions of the one dimensional boussinesq groundwater flow equation in horizontal unconfined aquifers induced by sudden change in boundary head the method consists in introducing an empirical function with four parameters which might be obtained using a fitting procedure it preserves the inherent nonlinearity of the physical phenomenon and offer simple and accurate solutions for practical hydrological applications semi analytical approximate solutions to both problems of recharging and dewatering of an unconfined aquifer are derived in implicit forms analytical expressions for the exchange flow rates in the stream aquifer system and the associated flow volumes stored or extracted from the aquifer are easily obtained from the general form solutions for the case of recharging aquifer a benchmark test is carried out between the proposed solution five existing approximate solutions and one numerical solution obtained from the runge kutta approach the results in terms of hydraulic head profiles and flow rates show that the present solution is the most accurate one compared to the numerical solution for the case of dewatering aquifer the approximate solution is compared to an efficient series solution a maximum absolute error between the two solutions of the order of 10 3 is obtained the analytical flow rate is used in the context of estimating of aquifer hydraulic parameters based on the method of recession slope analysis the results compare well to existing ones an interesting direction for future work would be to extend the method to time dependent boundary conditions most of the existing exact approximate solutions which account for time dependent boundary heads are either series solutions or with specific boundary head generated by the general form of the solution therefore it would be useful to apply the method to problems with time dependent boundary head and compare with the existing ones declaration of interests none acknowledgments the data used to produce the results are taken from the literature and the data references are cited in the text the author would like to thank three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments on an earlier version of the manuscript their very comprehensive and valuable comments have significantly improved the quality of the initial manuscript appendix a negativity of f h for the recharging case as previously mentioned in section 3 the second derivative f h must be negative in order to get a physically correct solution a simple mathematical calculation shows after using 15 that h h h 1 μ a 1 f h a n 2 c 2 h 1 μ 2 n n c 2 m n 1 h 1 μ n m m 1 h 1 μ m 2 e c

n 0 and 2 m n 1 0 taking into account these conditions the function f h is negative if and only if a 0 appendix b nonnegativity of f h for the discharging case deriving twice f h as defined by 15 with

n 0 and 2 m n 1 0 if c 0 the function f d h is nonnegative and so f h if c 0 the above conditions are not sufficient to guaranty the nonnegativity of f d h in such case the additional condition n 1 is required therefore it will be shown that under the conditions a 0 c 0 m 1 n 1 and 2 m n 1 0 the function f d h is nonnegative to do so the derivative f d h is used which writes b 3 f d h n 2 c 1 h n 1 g d h where b 4 g d h 2 n c 1 h n 2 m n 1 eq b 3 shows that it is sufficient to prove that g d h 0 since c 0 let s calculate the derivative g d h which writes b 5 g d h 2 n 2 c 1 h n it is clear that g d h 0 indicating that g d h is an increasing function of h in the range μ h 1 thus if g d μ 0 then the function g d h and so f d h and f h is nonnegative eq 17 will be used to show that g d μ 0 indeed eq 17 implies that m n c 1 μ n 0 since a 0 and η f 0 therefore 2 n c 1 μ n 2 m adding the term 2 m n 1 to both sides of the latter inequality yields g d μ n 1 thus if n 1 g d μ 0 and then g d h 0 for any h between μ and 1 therefore f d h 0 and thus f h is nonnegative appendix c some existing approximate solutions this appendix presents some existing approximate solutions which are used to compare with those proposed in the present work polubarinova kochina 1962 1977 has developed three analytical expressions for the boussinesq eq 1 by applying a regular series expansion approach moutsopoulos 2010 carried out a benchmarking study between these solutions and other solutions and showed that the so called polubarinova kochina u expansion solution gives the best results among the

the inflection point of the water table upstream the inflection point the solution writes c 7 h h k 0 6 c k η k while downstream the inflection point it writes as c 8 h h ν η k 2 η η k a η η k λ where η x k h s t η k denotes the position of the inflection point ν the value of the dimensionless piezometric head at the inflection point c k are the coefficients of the adomian decomposition and a and λ

approximate solution to the boussinesq eq 1 subject to a time varying water level at the stream aquifer boundary the solution applies to both the recharging and the dewatering of an unconfined aquifer it has the advantage of handling the special case of uniform initial and boundary conditions of type 2 4 in such case the solution can be written in implicit form as follows c 9 x h ρ μ h h ln h h 1 μ

6716,the boussinesq equation is usually used to describe one dimensional unconfined groundwater movement solutions of this equation are important as they provide useful insights regarding the water table response to stream level variations and allow us to quantify the exchange flow between the stream and the aquifer due to the nonlinearity of the boussinesq equation the solutions are generally obtained using numerical methods however for certain classes of initial and boundary conditions there are both exact and approximate analytical solution techniques this work focuses on the latter approach a new mathematical technique for approximate solutions of the boussinesq equation describing flow in horizontal unconfined aquifers induced by sudden change in boundary head is presented the method applies to the problems of recharging and dewatering of an unconfined aquifer and approximate solutions to both problems are derived the solutions were obtained by introducing an empirical function with four parameters which might be obtained using a numerical fitting procedure results based on this technique were found to be easily calculated and to be in good agreement with those obtained using numerical calculation based on runge kutta approach a benchmark between the proposed solutions and five existing approximate analytical solutions shows that the present solutions are the most accurate approximate solutions among those tested applications of the solutions are presented in the context of estimating aquifer hydraulic parameters keywords boussinesq equation groundwater flow unconfined aquifer water table profile approximate solution 1 introduction groundwater flow in unconfined aquifer can be approximately modeled by the nonlinear boussinesq equation boussinesq 1904 brutsaert 2005 this equation is broadly used in many areas of hydrology including catchment hydrology design of site remediation baseflow studies and recession analysis irrigation and drainage and constructed subsurface wetlands troch et al 2013 rupp and selker 2006 dan et al 2012 lockington et al 2000 solutions to the boussinesq equation are therefore important as they provide useful insights into the response of the water table to stream level variations and allow the quantification of the exchange between the stream and the aquifer as a consequence they remain an object of active research bansal 2012 basha 2013 moutsopoulos 2013 chor et al 2013 olsen and telyakovskiy 2013 dias et al 2014 jiang and tang 2015 tang et al 2016 bartlett and porporato 2018 due to the nonlinearity of the boussinesq equation few exact and approximate solutions exist in the literature and they are only provided for problems with specific initial and boundary conditions barenblatt 1952 derived a series solution for a time dependent water head at the origin parlange et al 2000 obtained a polynomial exact solution of the boussinesq equation with special time dependent boundary condition the solution can describe water movement both in and out of an aquifer and is useful to check numerical schemes telyakovskiy et al 2002 proposed a cubic polynomial approximation to the similarity solution of the boussinesq equation for one dimensional unconfined groundwater flow in a horizontal initially dry aquifer with a power law inlet condition daly and porporato 2004 presented several exact solutions of the boussinesq equation describing the groundwater flow along a hillslope using a traveling wave transformation the practical applicability of their approach is limited by the fact that the same transformation must also apply to the initial and boundary conditions telyakovskiy and allen 2006 provided closed form approximate solutions to model horizontal infiltration described by the boussinesq equation in a semi infinite aquifer that is initially dry they are applicable to four types of time dependent boundary conditions two on head and two on flux telyakovskiy at al 2010 proposed power series solution to the boussinesq equation that use power flux boundary condition moutsopoulos 2013 used the adomian decomposition method to derive a semi analytical solution of the boussinesq equation by imposing a nonlinear robin boundary condition recently bartlett and porporato 2018 presented a class of exact solutions to the full nonlinear boussinesq equation that apply to sloping aquifers and account for source and sink terms such as bedrock seepage the solutions have an explicit dependence on the space coordinate and they are limited to specific time dependent boundary conditions and space dependent initial conditions that are generated from the general forms of the exact solutions troch et al 2013 presented a review about existing exact and approximate solutions of the boussinesq groundwater flow equations in the present work we focus only on the solutions of the problem involving sudden change in boundary head with constant initial and boundary conditions sudden changes in boundary head offer a realistic approach of real world problems this problem is an idealized formulation of the problem of water level prediction in an unconfining aquifer at early times due to water level changes at an adjacent water body this water body can be either natural such a river or lake or man made e g irrigation trench the solutions of this problem are useful for the computation of flow volumes stored or extracted from the aquifer tolikas et al 1984 lockington 1997 basha 2013 moreover the water level change in channel flooded plains created by recharge weirs constructed to enhance the rate of inflow to an adjacent aquifer can be approximated by a step raise previous studies e g revelli and ridolfi 2000 state that changes in trenches channels occur in times that are much shorter than those occurring in phreatic aquifers and therefore can be schematized by sharp jumps therefore approximate analytical solutions for problems with sudden jump are important in modeling such real cases few approximate solutions of the classical problem of the water table response to a sudden rise in the head have been developed in the past polubarinova kochina 1962 1977 presented analytical expressions for the boussinesq equation by applying a regular series expansion approach tolikas et al 1984 applied similarity transformation and polynomial approximation near the inflection point of the head profile to obtain simple approximate closed form solution lockington 1997 used a weighted residual method to derive simple analytical approximations to the solutions of the boussinesq equation the method was applied to both recharging and dewatering of an unconfined aquifer due to sudden change in head moutsopoulos 2010 applied the adomian s decomposition method to obtain a simple series solution with few terms he performed a benchmark test between different existing solutions of the problem which shows the advantage of his solution basha 2013 used a traveling wave technique combined with perturbation method to get an approximate solution to the one dimensional boussinesq equation the solution is presented in implicit form and holds also for time dependent boundary head chor et al 2013 derived a series solution for the nonlinear boussinesq equation in terms of the similarity variable of the boltzmann transformation in a semi infinite domain the solution applies for discharging aquifers with zero boundary head and constant initial head more recently jiang and tang 2015 adopted a decomposition method by separating the original problem into linear diffusion equation and two correction functions to develop a general approximate solution for the groundwater response problem the present study develops a new method to obtain efficient approximate solutions to the one dimensional boussinesq equation induced by sudden change in boundary head the method applies to both recharging and dewatering aquifers and the obtained solutions are presented in simple forms the nonlinear solutions are of a simple combination of power and exponential forms that describe the position of the water table as a function of head and time they are valid for constant boundary and initial conditions including zero head i e dry aquifer expressions of practical importance such as the exchange flow rates in the stream aquifer system and the associated flow volumes stored or extracted from the aquifer are easily obtained from the general form solutions additional results include analytical formulas for the recharging wetting and discharging dewatering fronts and an enhanced relationship for aquifer parameter estimation 2 governing equations the governing equation for one dimensional groundwater flow in a horizontal unconfined aquifer can be described by the boussinesq equation 1 s h t k x h h x where h is the piezometric head l i e the height of the water table measured from the impervious horizontal base of the aquifer x is the horizontal coordinate l t is the time t k is the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer l t and s is the specific yield the initial and boundary conditions are 2 h h x 0 t

analytically the boussinesq eq 1 with boundary and initial conditions 2 4 for both the recharging and the dewatering of a homogeneous unconfined aquifer 3 approximate solutions 3 1 method of solution

writes then as follows 14 h 1 2 f h f h where f h d η d h is the second derivative of f with respect to η the following mathematical expression of the function f h is proposed 15 f h a h h m e c h h n b h h where a b c m and n are unknown parameters to be determined later the choice of the functional form 15 is justified in section 3 2 based on 15 the analytical expression of η h f h is obtained as follows 16 η h sgn h h 0 a m n c h h n h h m 1 e c h h n b where sgn is the sign function defined by sgn h h 0 1 if h h 0 recharging case and sgn h h 0 1 if h h 0 discharging case let s denote by η f the penetration distance of the recharging discharging front i e the value of η at which h reaches h this gives from 16 b η f the number of the unknown parameters in 16 may be reduced by using condition 8 the analytical expression of the penetration distance of the recharging discharging front i e the wetting front as function of the remaining unknown parameters is then obtained as follows 17 η f sgn h h 0 a m n c h 0 h n h 0 h m 1 e c h 0 h n substitution of 17 into 16 i e b η f yields 18 η h sgn h h 0 a m n c h h n h h m 1 e c h h n m n c h 0 h n h 0 h m 1 e c h 0 h n eq 18 represents the general form of the proposed approximate solution in terms of the dimensionless variables it holds for both recharging and discharging cases the values of h h 0 and h are defined in eqs 5 10 and 11 depending on the problem in consideration the general form solution 18 expresses the similarity variable η defined by eq 6 as function of the normalized height of the water table h for any h between min h 0 h and max h 0 h to obtain a physically acceptable solution some conditions on the parameters a c m and n must be imposed by definition f is a nonnegative function of h for the recharging case and a negative function of h for the discharging case as can be shown from 13 therefore according to eq 14 f h must be negative for the recharging case and positive for the discharging case i e the dimensionless head h is nonnegative appendix a shows that f h is negative under the following conditions a 0 c 0 m 1 n 0 and 2 m n 1 0 while it is shown in appendix b that f d h 0 under the following conditions a 0 m 1 2 m n 1 0 and n 0 if c 0 or n 1 if c 0 the approximate solution in terms of the physical variables writes in the x t plane in the following implicit form after using 5

μ m 1 e c 1 μ n for the discharging case eqs 19 and 20 involve four parameters a c m and n which must be determined as follows eq 14 may be rewritten in terms of the unknown parameters after using 15 this gives 21 h a 2 2 n 2 c 2 h h 2 n n c 2 m n 1 h h n m m 1 h h m 1 e c h h n h h m 1 e c h h n m n c h 0 h n h 0 h m 1 e c h 0 h n eq 21 shows that the normalized piezometric head h is expressed in terms of the unknown parameters by the mathematical expression of the right hand side rhs of 21 the unknown parameters a c m and n can be determined through curve fitting of h versus the mathematical expression defined by the rhs of 21 for min h 0 h h max h 0 h the fitting procedure is described in section 3 3 3 2 justification of the functional form 15 the function f h is defined as the sum of two terms the first one is a combination of power and exponential functions of h h while the second is a linear function of h h this special choice of f h is justified by the following points 1 the form 15 as function of h h is chosen in such a way that f h 0 this condition is required by definition of f h in 13 2 the product of power and exponential functions provides a continuous and infinitely differentiable function this would result in a well defined right hand side form of eq 21 since this form is defined as a product of f h and f h as shown in 14 3 the second term in 15 is defined in such a way that the normalized piezometric head h profile admits a recharging discharging front as shown in 17 and 18 it should be noted that the empirical function 15 is not unique and other functional forms would be possible however preliminary numerical experiments show that the proposed empirical function applies successfully to a wide range of nonlinearity level μ h 0 h 3 3 determination of fitting parameters the unknow parameters appearing in the proposed approximate solutions can be determined by curve fitting to do that the rhs of eq 21 is denoted by φ h a b m n therefore the segment 0 h 1 is divided into n equal intervals h i 1 h i with h 0 0 and h n 1 the parameters a b m and n are then determined by carrying out an optimization procedure on the quantity i 0 n φ h i a b m n h i 2 ε where ε is an arbitrary small number ε 0 in practical applications we take ε 10 6 preliminary numerical experiments show that the results of the fitting procedure are insensitive to n for n 50 in the present study all the examples are performed with n 1000 starting from an initial set of parameters the set which gives the best fit between the curve representing h and that representing φ h a b m n is adopted in the approximate solution in the present work the fitting procedure is performed by using the microsoft excel solver walsh and diamond 1995 4 flow rates and flow volumes in problems of recharge or discharge of an aquifer it is of practical importance to compute the flow rates and flow volumes as functions of time in this section simple formulas are given for that purpose the flow rate flux q at the stream aquifer boundary x 0 and the flow volume v or cumulative flow rate are defined by 22 q t k h 0 h x x 0 v t 0 t q τ d τ using 5 6 and 10 and the relationships h x x 0 d h d η η 0 η x x 0 and d h d η η 0 1 f h 0 we obtain the recharge and discharge rates q r and q d respectively as follows 23 q t q r t ks h 0 3 2 f h 0 2 t f o r r e c h a r

present solution 19 a t 5 d for three values of μ the values of the parameters a c m and n obtained after the fitting procedure and used to produce the water table height from eq 19 are presented in table 1 the exact and fitted dimensionless heights h h h 0 defined by eq 21 for the three values of μ are shown in fig 3 it can be observed that for μ 1 5 all analytical solutions are close to the numerical solution except the solution of basha 2013 which shows a deviation for small values of the water table height for μ 3 the solution of jiang and tang 2015 shows discrepancies with the other solutions for large values of the water table height while the solution of basha 2013 deviates from the other solutions for small values of the water table height for μ 10 the solutions of polubarinova kochina 1962 and basha 2013 overestimate the water table height close to the initial value while the solution of jiang and tang 2015 not shown in the figure completely fails in summary the present solution and those proposed by lockington 1997 and moutsopoulos 2010 give the best results to evaluate the difference between the numerical results and the various analytical solutions an error ratio is used which is defined by e r h a h n h 0 100 where h a and h n are the predicted water table level by the analytical and numerical runge kutta methods respectively fig 4 shows a comparison of the error ratios for the present proposed method and from the other analytical methods for the three values of μ the results show that the present approximate solution gives the best results the smaller error ratios for all values of μ the second benchmarking test is performed for a dewatering aquifer with h 0 1 m and h 10 m which correspond to μ h 0 h 0 1 the proposed solution 18 is compared to the series solution derived by chor et al 2013 fig 5 a shows the comparison between the two solutions in terms of the dimensionless height h h h as function of dimensionless similarity

of recharge and discharge coefficients c r and c d as follows 25 q r c r h 0 h ks 2 t 26 q d c d h 0 h ks 2 t where c r and c d have units of l 0 5 and defined by 27 c r 1 2 μ h 0 h 2 1 μ 28 c d 1 2 μ h 0 h 2 1 μ accordingly the recharge and discharge coefficients obtained from the present work may be obtained by comparing q r defined in 23 with 25 and q d defined in 23 with 26 this yields 29 c r h

obtained from 23 and c 11 as follows 35 c r 2 h 0 π h 1 π 1 2 h 0 h 2 2 h the recharge discharge coefficients presented above are compared to each other s and with numerical solution for a range of values of μ resp 1 μ table 2 shows the values of the recharge coefficients obtained numerically from the present study and from other existing results for a range of values of μ from 1 1 to 20 for all these cases the value of h is kept constant equal to 1 m while the value of h 0 is varied the values of parameters a c m and n needed for the computation of the recharge coefficient obtained from this study are presented in table 1 for each value of μ the values of parameter c 1 used in eq 34 are also presented in table 1 the numerical values denoted by c r n were obtained using matlab these values are taken as reference values and the comparison between the various recharge coefficients is performed in terms of the percentage relative error 100 c r c r n c r n this example demonstrates the success of the present method in predicting the recharge coefficients indeed the best results are those obtained from the present study the results obtained from the method of lockington 1997 show a slightly smaller relative error only for the case of small value of μ 1 1 in a similar way the discharge coefficients obtained from the present work and the those obtained from the works of lockington 1997 and basha 2013 are compared to numerical values by means of percentage relative error for a range of values of 1 μ going from 1 1 to 20 the value of h 0 is fixed to 1 m while the value of h is varied the values of parameters a c m and n needed for the computation of the discharge coefficient obtained from this study are shown in table 3 the results of the comparison are presented in table 4 it can be shown that the best results are those obtained from the present method and from the method of lockington 1997 the relative errors obtained from the method of lockington 1997 are slightly better for small values of 1 μ while the present method shows better smaller relative errors for large values of μ both methods give small relative errors i e less than 0 03 while the method of basha 2013 results in larger relative errors i e 2 3 5 3 estimating of aquifer hydraulic parameters the method of recession slope analysis proposed by brutsaert and nieber 1977 is one of the few analytical tools which has been widely applied for estimating aquifer hydraulic parameters at the field scale and beyond brutsaert and lopez 1998 parlange et al 2001 mendoza el al 2003 rupp et al 2004 malvicini et al 2005 recession flow analysis is a hydrological technique used for forecasting drought flows aquifer characterization and investigating the groundwater regime in basins the method consists in plotting the observed recession slope of the drought flow hydrograph or d q d t against the discharge q such that d q d t f q where f is an arbitrary function and then compare observations with analytical solutions to the boussinesq equation for one dimensional flow in a rectangular horizontal aquifer several analytical solutions to the boussinesq equation boussinesq 1904 polubarinova kochina 1962 lockington 1997 rupp and selker 2005 basha 2013 show that the recession slope of the drought flow hydrograph can be expressed in the form 36 d q d t α q β where α is a function of the physical dimensions and hydraulic properties of the aquifer and β is a constant in eq 36 q is the total outflow discharge from the aquifer which is the integration of all flow q per unit width of aquifer entering a stream network of length l i e q 2 q l brutsaert and nieber 1977 using q d for q as defined in 23 yields 37 d q d t α q 3 α 1 2 k s h 3 l 2 f h 0 2 for μ 0 i e h 0 0 the values of the parameters a c m and n obtained from the fitting procedure are a 6 297805 c 0 013546 m 1 147199 and n 2 975891 respectively accordingly the coefficient α is equal to 1 1337 k s h 3 l 2 this value is very close to those obtained from the analytical solution of polubarinova kochina 1962 α 1 133 k s h 3 l 2 and from the analytical solution of lockington 1997 α 1 1361 k s h 3 l 2 see e g rupp and selker 2006 note that the value of parameter α obtained from the traveling wave analytical solution of basha 2013 is slightly higher i e α 1 158 k s h 3 l 2 eq 37 is useful for estimating the saturated hydraulic conductivity k indeed if the mean aquifer depth h and the specific yield are known a priori the hydraulic conductivity k can be obtained from 37 through curve fitting of d q d t versus q on a log log scale 6 conclusion this paper presents an efficient analytical method for approximate solutions of the one dimensional boussinesq groundwater flow equation in horizontal unconfined aquifers induced by sudden change in boundary head the method consists in introducing an empirical function with four parameters which might be obtained using a fitting procedure it preserves the inherent nonlinearity of the physical phenomenon and offer simple and accurate solutions for practical hydrological applications semi analytical approximate solutions to both problems of recharging and dewatering of an unconfined aquifer are derived in implicit forms analytical expressions for the exchange flow rates in the stream aquifer system and the associated flow volumes stored or extracted from the aquifer are easily obtained from the general form solutions for the case of recharging aquifer a benchmark test is carried out between the proposed solution five existing approximate solutions and one numerical solution obtained from the runge kutta approach the results in terms of hydraulic head profiles and flow rates show that the present solution is the most accurate one compared to the numerical solution for the case of dewatering aquifer the approximate solution is compared to an efficient series solution a maximum absolute error between the two solutions of the order of 10 3 is obtained the analytical flow rate is used in the context of estimating of aquifer hydraulic parameters based on the method of recession slope analysis the results compare well to existing ones an interesting direction for future work would be to extend the method to time dependent boundary conditions most of the existing exact approximate solutions which account for time dependent boundary heads are either series solutions or with specific boundary head generated by the general form of the solution therefore it would be useful to apply the method to problems with time dependent boundary head and compare with the existing ones declaration of interests none acknowledgments the data used to produce the results are taken from the literature and the data references are cited in the text the author would like to thank three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments on an earlier version of the manuscript their very comprehensive and valuable comments have significantly improved the quality of the initial manuscript appendix a negativity of f h for the recharging case as previously mentioned in section 3 the second derivative f h must be negative in order to get a physically correct solution a simple mathematical calculation shows after using 15 that h h h 1 μ a 1 f h a n 2 c 2 h 1 μ 2 n n c 2 m n 1 h 1 μ n m m 1 h 1 μ m 2 e c

required therefore it will be shown that under the conditions a 0 c 0 m 1 n 1 and 2 m n 1 0 the function f d h is nonnegative to do so the derivative f d h is used which writes b 3 f d h n 2 c 1 h n 1

g d h 0 indicating that g d h is an increasing function of h in the range μ h 1 thus if g d μ 0 then the function g d h and so f d h and f h is nonnegative eq 17 will be used to show that g d μ 0 indeed eq 17 implies that m n c 1 μ n 0 since a 0 and η f 0 therefore 2 n c 1 μ n 2 m adding the term 2 m n 1 to both sides of the latter inequality yields g d μ n 1 thus if n 1 g d μ 0 and then g d h 0 for any h between μ and 1 therefore f d h 0 and thus f h is nonnegative appendix c some existing approximate solutions this appendix presents some existing approximate solutions which are used to compare with those proposed in the present work polubarinova kochina 1962 1977 has developed three analytical expressions for the boussinesq eq 1 by applying a regular series expansion approach moutsopoulos 2010 carried out a benchmarking study between these solutions and other solutions and showed that the so called polubarinova kochina u expansion solution gives the best results among the three solutions therefore in the present work only the u expansion solution is used this solution is approximated by the first three terms of the series according to the formula c 1 u h h 0 1 l u 1 l

η x k h s t η k denotes the position of the inflection point ν the value of the dimensionless piezometric head at the inflection point c k are the coefficients of the adomian decomposition and a and λ

approximate solution to the boussinesq eq 1 subject to a time varying water level at the stream aquifer boundary the solution applies to both the recharging and the dewatering of an unconfined aquifer

6717,soil moisture plays a fundamental role in the mass and energy balance between the land surface and the atmosphere making its knowledge essential for several hydrological and climatic applications the aim of this study is to extend the current knowledge of soil moisture spatial temporal variability at the catchment scale up to 500 km2 the main implication is to provide guidelines to obtain soil moisture values representative of the mean behaviour at the medium sized river basin scale which is useful for remote sensing validation analysis and rainfall runoff modeling to this end 23 measurements campaigns were carried out during a time span of 14 months at 20 sites located within the upper chiascio river basin a catchment with a drainage area of about 460 km2 in the umbria region central italy the data set allowed the analysis of both soil moisture temporal stability and its dynamics on the basis of statistical and temporal stability approaches it was investigated how factors such as climatic regime and geomorphology influence soil moisture behaviour for the investigated area the spatial variability of soil moisture was higher in dry periods with respect to wet periods mainly due to the rainfall pattern characteristics during different periods of the year soil moisture values recorded during wet periods showed a better correlation than those recorded during dry periods the maximum number of required samples to obtain the mean areal soil moisture with an absolute error of 3 vol vol was found equal to 12 the temporal stability analysis showed that during wet periods just one optimal measurement point can provide values of soil moisture representative of the catchment mean behaviour while during dry periods the number of optimal measurement points became equal to two therefore at the adopted spatial scale the use of a single measurement point can lead to significant errors from the perspective of soil moisture dynamics the decomposition of the spatial variance showed that the contribution of the time invariant component temporal mean of each site was predominant on respect to the total spatial variance of absolute soil moisture data for almost the whole observation period results provided guidance to optimize soil moisture sampling by performing targeted measurements at a few selected points representative of the catchment mean behaviour keywords soil moisture spatial variability temporal stability catchment scale in situ measurements 1 introduction soil moisture is of paramount importance for many hydrological processes brocca et al 2017a its knowledge is relevant in several fields which include rainfall runoff partitioning blöschl and sivaplan 1995 brocca et al 2010b koster et al 2010 mirus and loague 2013 landslide forecasting brocca et al 2012a soil nutrient cycling processes schjonning et al 2003 drought monitoring and agriculture crow et al 2012 champagne et al 2015 the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture content raises many challenges to its definition at various scales small scale variations due to geomorphological characteristics and soil properties such as the saturated hydraulic conductivity occur in the spatial range of a few tens of meters and in the temporal range of a few days western et al 2004 large scale variations affect very extensive areas such as whole basins 100 km2 and are also caused by atmospheric forcings practically ground based measurements and remote sensing techniques can be used to characterize at each scale the spatiotemporal variation of soil water content ground based measurements such as time domain reflectometry neutron probes capacitance probes and gravimetric analyses provide detailed information on the soil moisture values when careful calibration of devices is available romano 2014 however these techniques are time consuming very expensive and provide information only in selected points to overcome this issue the use of sensors on board of satellite platforms has been spreading over the past few decades fang and lakshmi 2013 brocca et al 2017b this technology allows to remotely sense various meteorological data including soil moisture over large domain but is limited by the low spatial resolution ranging from 1 km e g sentinel 1 bauer marschallinger et al 2018 to 40 km e g smap entekhabi et al 2010 and by the inherent bias of the measurement thus requiring an accurate on site verification prior their use within model and applications for these reasons traditional measurement methods are necessary and still widely used however given the high costs an effort is required to identify soil moisture sampling optimization schemes for reducing the number of measurements as few as possible in accordance with the desired accuracy and the site characteristics several authors investigated the possibility to optimize the sampling scheme through specific soil moisture field campaigns in experimental areas characterized by dimension up to few square kilometers by using the statistical analysis bell et al 1980 famiglietti et al 1999 brocca et al 2007 wang et al 2008 the temporal stability analysis vauchad et al 1985 grayson and western 1998 martinez fernandez and ceballos 2005 brocca et al 2009 zhou et al 2013 or both jacobs et al 2004 choi and jacobs 2007 brocca et al 2010a hu et al 2010 brocca et al 2012b baroni et al 2013 liao et al 2017 lai et al 2017 2018 recently mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 considering a very large scale the entire switzerland area showed that the spatial variability of soil moisture is predominantly determined by a time invariant component and that statistical and temporal stability analysis can lead to different results by considering temporal anomalies rather than absolute soil moisture values mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 concluded their analysis encouraging further studies at different scale to investigate the spatio temporal characteristics of temporal soil moisture anomalies in addition to assessments of those of absolute soil moisture all these studies highlighted that soil moisture spatial variability increases with the extension of the investigated area and that soil moisture patterns show a significant temporal stability thus making just one optimal measurement point able to represent the areal mean behaviour however at the catchment scale for large areas especially during seasons with strong propensity for the development of convective rainfall systems as stated in terms of optimal sampling scheme for the small scale could fail therefore the main objective of this paper aimed at the determination of an optimal soil moisture sampling scheme is to investigate the soil water content behaviour at a scale in which the rainfall spatial variability may play an important role for this purpose the analysis carried out in this paper is based on a long measurement period which has been divided into wet and dry sub periods in order to explore the influence of convective and frontal rainfall systems on soil moisture variability at the same spatial scale on the basis of the methodology proposed by mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 the secondary objective of this paper is to evaluate the roles of the time invariant contribution of the temporal anomalies in the determination of the spatial variability of soil moisture 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the soil moisture measurements were carried out in 20 experimental sites located in the upper chiascio river basin which is an inland area in the umbria region with a drainage area of approximately 460 km2 fig 1 the basin was mainly characterized by an apennine climate with an altitude between 320 and 1550 m a s l and a mean slope of 24 the mean annual temperature was 13 0 c and the mean annual precipitation was 1050 mm generally with the highest monthly values recorded in the autumn and winter seasons 2 2 soil moisture measurements the selection of the 20 experimental sites for the monitoring of soil moisture was based on the necessity to have heterogeneity in terms of land use topography texture and vegetation cover with this choice site number and position we tried to represent the entire catchment considering also the necessity to conduct each measurement campaign in the same day as shown in table 1 the distribution of soil texture classes of the measurement points was fairly uniform with most of the sites located in silty clay loam and clay loam respectively 30 and 35 of the total soils the terrain of the experimental sites was mostly flat with 70 of the measurement points placed in flat areas and 30 in hilly areas with regard to land use the area where the experimental sites are located was predominantly cultivated with small wooded areas and semi natural environments the sampling scheme adopted was designed to have a number of measurement points and measurement campaigns that can catch the soil moisture spatial and temporal variability in fact experimental sites were located on an extended area and the measurement campaigns were prolonged to capture the alternation between dry and wet periods the 23 monitoring campaigns covered a time span ranging from march 2014 to may 2015 and were distanced between them for about two weeks each during each field campaign four measures were carried out at each of the 20 monitored sites and the mean value was considered as the reference value to be stored in the database the soil moisture was measured through a portable unit using two wire connector type time domain reflectometry probes tdr of the soil moisture equipment corporation trase tdr which provides a soil moisture measurement representative for a soil layer depth of 15 cm to obtain the volumetric soil moisture once the dielectric constant is measured the standard calibration curve was used skaling 1992 the equipment has a quoted error within 2 vol vol except for the texture classes given in table 1 a detailed characterization of the study soils is delayed for future developments which could also highlight further aspects of interest 2 3 rainfall data the rainfall pattern that affected the study basin during the measurement period was analysed in order to separate dry from wet periods the daily rainfall data recorded by 14 rain gauges located within the area of interest was collected and spatially averaged by using the thiessen polygon method 2 4 statistical analysis the main statistical features of the soil moisture data set were determined and analysed in terms of spatial and temporal variability let us denote θ i j the soil moisture measured at site i i 1 n during the sampling day j j 1 m with n 20 and m 23 the spatial mean referred to each sampling day θ j is given by 1 θ j 1 n i 1 n θ i j in a similar way the temporal mean for each measurement point θ i is calculated by 2 θ i 1 m j 1 m θ i j the coefficient of variation for each sampling day c v j is obtained from the relation 3 c v j σ j θ j 1 n 1 i 1 n θ i j θ j 2 θ j where σ j is the spatial standard deviation for each site the coefficient of variation in time c v i and the temporal standard deviation σ i can be defined analogously the number of required samples for estimating the mean value within a specific absolute error nrs can be obtained from the knowledge of σ j through the following implicit relation wang et al 2008 4 n r s t 1 α 2 n r s 1 2 σ j 2 a e 2 where t 1 α 2 n r s 1 2 is the value of the student s t distribution at the confidence level 1 α 2 nrs is the number of the degrees of freedom and ae indicates the absolute error considered expressed in volumetric soil moisture vol vol 2 5 temporal stability the temporal stability analysis introduced by vauchad et al 1985 allows to identify the measurement points where the observed values of soil moisture are representative of the mean soil moisture of the entire monitored area this is extremely important because it permits to install a small number of probes in a few selected points for retrieving the average soil moisture over a large area furthermore the knowledge of the temporal persistence of soil moisture patterns provides support in determining the frequency of measurements under different wetness conditions the temporal stability analysis is carried out using the relative differences method which is described below considering the spatial mean for each sampling day previously introduced the relative difference δ i j referring to site i and sampling day j is calculated by 5 δ i j θ i j θ j θ j for each measurement point i the mean δ i and the standard deviation σ δ i of the relative differences can be obtained by 6 δ i 1 m j 1 m δ i j 7 σ δ i 1 m 1 j 1 m δ i j δ i 2 the δ i quantifies how much the soil moisture recorded at a sampling point departs from the mean spatial value during the measurement period the σ δ i is an index of the temporal variability the representative sites of the mean value in time are characterized by lower values of δ i and σ δ i jacobs et al 2004 defined a single metric to identify the best sampling point the index of time stability its that combines the δ i and its σ δ i it can be calculated for each site as follows 8 i ts i δ i 2 σ δ i 2 1 2 it is noteworthy that originally in jacobs et al 2004 this index was called root mean square error rmse in this study the wording its zhao et al 2010 penna et al 2013 is employed instead of rmse in order to disambiguate the index of time stability from the common definition of the rmse according to this method optimal measurement points are characterized by low values of the its the main advantage of the its approach is that it allows to identify representative sampling sites by considering just one parameter 2 6 decomposition of soil moisture spatial variance the soil moisture dynamics were studied on the basis of the approach introduced by mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 according to this method the spatial variance of soil moisture data can be decomposed in the following three components 9 σ 2 θ i j σ 2 θ i σ 2 a i j 2 c o v θ i a i j where σ 2 θ i is the spatial variance of the temporal mean σ 2 a i j is the spatial variance of the temporal anomalies a i j which quantify how much each observed value deviates from the temporal mean and can be calculated as 10 a i j θ i j θ i the third component of the right side in eq 8 is the spatial covariance between the temporal mean soil moisture of a site and the temporal anomaly 2 7 data processing the observed data were analysed both in their completeness and by considering partial sets based on temporal and spatial criteria specifically the values of soil moisture recorded during wet and dry periods were compared as well as those observed in flat and hilly areas the separation between dry and wet periods was determined by analysing the rainfall measurements occurred in the experimental area in the measurement period for each day in which a measurement campaign was carried out it was calculated the mean of the daily rainfall recorded by 14 rain gauges installed thereabout the experimental sites this operation was repeated for the five days previous each measurement campaign the spatial averages were then summed obtaining the values of api5 referred to each sampling day the periods in which these values were found higher than a mean threshold value were classified as wet otherwise as dry 3 results 3 1 statistical analysis the time series of soil moisture values observed at each site their spatial mean and the average rainfall over the study area during the measurement period are shown in fig 2 the spatial mean soil moisture responds to the precipitation input with sudden increments after significant events and slow decrements in the absence of precipitation two wet and two dry periods have been identified in the time interval of interest the spatial mean the spatial standard deviation and the coefficient of variation of the soil moisture obtained during each measurement campaign are contained in table 2 it also shows the associated value of api5 the average value considering 14 rain gauges and its coefficient of variation cv api5 the behaviour of the cv api5 values reported in table 2 evidences the different rainfall patterns during the various periods of the year in presence of prevailing convective systems mainly observed during dry periods the average cv api5 is equal to 1 03 while with prevailing frontal systems typically observed during wet periods this value become 0 63 as expected for both soil moisture and api5 the values of the coefficient of variation of the soil moisture obtained during each measurement campaign were lower during the wet periods in fact during the dry season the average c v j of soil moisture was equal to 0 21 while for the wet season it was equal to 0 16 globally i e by considering the entire data set the average value of c v j was equal to 0 19 this is an index of the low variability of soil moisture field during the wet periods when the investigated area is interested by spatially uniform rainfall systems during the dry period instead the soil moisture field is less uniform as a response to isolated convective rainfall systems that determine significant spatial differences in the soil moisture values the decreasing trend between c v j and θ j is shown in fig 3 this behaviour indicates a lower variability of absolute soil moisture under increasing wetness conditions and it is consistent with the behaviour observed in most of the previous analogous studies e g bell et al 1980 famiglietti et al 1999 2008 brocca et al 2010a 2012b conducted in smaller areas the assumption that the relationship between c v j and θ j is represented by an exponential law allows to establish the maximum nrs for estimating the mean soil moisture value with a specific absolute error ae as a function of the average wetness conditions by using eq 4 the nrs values were calculated for an ae equal to 3 and 4 see fig 4 by assuming the relation between c v j and θ j as exponential eq 4 provides nrs as a function of the mean soil moisture within a certain level of confidence for instance by considering a confidence interval of 95 to obtain the average soil moisture with an ae of 3 a maximum nrs of 12 was required this value was found for a mean soil moisture of 30 vol vol and was the maximum of the curve shown in fig 4 obtained by fitting the values calculated with eq 4 by considering the entire set of soil moisture measurements brocca et al 2012b on the basis of soil moisture data recorded during a time span of about one year over two areas with a smaller extension 178 and 242 km2 but comparable to those of interest in this study found a maximum nrs value up to 3 ae 4 obviously with the increase of the ae the nrs decreases reaching the value of 7 for absolute an error of 4 this method allows to plan a reliable in situ monitoring with respect to a fixed accuracy also at a catchment spatial scale 3 2 temporal stability analysis in order to check out which sites are the most suitable to obtain the benchmark soil moisture i e the areal mean calculated considering all the 20 sites the relative differences method was applied for this purpose the values of δ i σ δ i and its were considered and compared the application of the its method to values of δ i and σ δ i that vary in ranges quite different from each other could provide unreliable results if the aim is to identify a measurement point temporally stable and representative of the mean soil moisture for the entire study area without any standardisation it could happen that an experimental site shows a low value of its because of a low value of σ δ i but a relatively high value of δ i thus making that point temporally stable but distant from the areal mean soil moisture in this case the recorded values should be scaled in order to obtain the areal mean because of this the identification of optimal measurement point was here addressed by comparing temporal stability analysis with correlation analysis always keeping in mind that the final aim is to identify temporally stable sites that could also provide a soil moisture value representative of the catchment mean behaviour this procedure was applied for the entire data set and considering the partition between wet and dry periods in order to highlight the influence of climate conditions on soil moisture variability distinguishing between values observed in flat areas from those in hilly areas it was also possible to evaluate the geomorphological characteristics that experimental sites should have to be considered as optimal measurement sites the most representative site of the entire study basin in terms of mean soil moisture was the number 8 of fig 1 fig 5 a shows the good determination coefficient r2 equal to 0 837 between the values found at site 8 and the areal mean soil moisture fig 6 a shows the rank ordered mean relative difference with the corresponding standard deviation for each experimental site on the same chart also the its associated to each measurement point is shown site 8 showed good characteristics in terms of temporal stability as δ i was close to zero and σ δ i represented by the vertical bar was very low the its values were minimal for sites 8 and 1 but the latter showed a significant value of δ i by considering the entire data set the values of σ δ i varied between a minimum and a maximum of 7 6 and 19 7 in absolute value respectively in particular for the site number 8 values of δ i 0 003 σ δ i 9 7 and its 9 were found the same analyses were also carried out separately during wet and dry periods and results are shown in figs 5b and c and 6b and c in the dry periods the site where the soil moisture values were closer to the average of the study basin was the number 16 with r2 equal to 0 725 fig 5b which also showed good characteristics in terms of temporal stability i e low values of δ i σ δ i and its even if these values are worse than those relative to sites 8 and 1 conversely during the wet periods the site 8 was the optimal one with r2 equal to 0 857 fig 5c and the lowest values of δ i σ δ i and its while there is no doubt that during the wet periods the site 8 was the optimal one for the dry periods further evaluations are needed together with site 8 site 16 could be chosen as optimal for this period because it showed the best determination coefficient with the spatial mean and consequently a δ i closer to zero for this site the its wasn t the lowest one because of a σ δ i higher than other sites i e site 1 this is probably due to a few values recorded during the transition periods when the catchment is not yet in uniform wetness conditions it can be observed that both sites 8 and 16 were located in flat areas also if not statistically significant this interesting indication could be the object of future developments in the spatial correlation triangle shown in fig 7 the generic box identified by the i th line and j th column expresses the correlation between the values of soil moisture measured during the i th campaign and those measured in the j th campaign higher correlations are represented with darker cells it can be seen that the values of soil moisture measured during campaigns carried out in wet periods were highly correlated each other while lower values were obtained between campaigns carried out during dry periods relatively high correlations were also observed between measurement campaigns belonging to wet periods distant in time about 5 months the spatial correlation between measurements carried out during wet periods reached values of 0 94 and always remained larger than 0 71 another aspect of interest was that in accordance with previous studies mohanty and skaggs 2001 cosh et al 2004 martinez fernandez and ceballos 2005 brocca et al 2012b in most cases measurements campaigns during the transition periods were those that show the lower correlation values finally campaigns taken during different dry seasons were occasionally negatively correlated with each other these results provided useful information for optimize a soil moisture monitoring for instance with the objective to validate soil moisture estimation from remote sensing transition periods should be avoided or alternatively an adequate number of sampling points should be adopted the same analysis was carried out with data separated by site geomorphology measurements in flat sites provided values of soil moisture positively correlated with each other over time and significantly higher than those observed in hilly sites where the correlation was high solely between adjacent measurement campaigns see fig 8 during the wet periods there was an increase in the spatial correlation between the average soil moisture over hilly areas and the areal mean value the same happened with the average water content over flat areas 3 3 decomposition of soil moisture spatial variance the analyses previously described aimed to identify the most representative sites of the mean catchment soil moisture behaviour were carried out in terms of absolute values of soil moisture however some studies e g mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 brocca et al 2014 suggested that the temporal anomalies the absolute soil moisture minus the seasonal mean can show a different behaviour with respect to the absolute values on the basis of this new perspective fig 9 shows the time evolution of the terms that contribute to the determination of spatial variance of soil moisture according to eq 9 in most cases the dominant contribution was the one related to the temporal mean the influence of temporal anomalies was higher during dry periods and in some cases larger than that related to the temporal mean these results were in line with what previously mentioned about the lower stability of soil moisture values observed during the dry season during the wet periods the contribution of the covariance was often close to zero while the time invariant term was dominant 4 discussion 4 1 statistical and temporal stability analyses the combination of statistical and temporal stability analysis allowed us to highlight that also at the large scale up to 500 km2 soil moisture field showed temporal stability properties in fact considering the whole data set soil moisture measurements in site 8 represented the areal mean with r2 equal to 0 837 and rmse equal to 2 4 vol vol during the wet periods the performances of the same experimental site rose with a higher determination coefficient and a smaller root mean square error r2 equal to 0 857 and rmse equal to 1 2 vol vol during the dry periods there was a loss in the accuracy of the estimation the mean of the values recorded in the optimal measurement points sites 8 and 16 for this period was able to reproduce the catchment mean behaviour with r2 equal to 0 846 and rmse equal to 1 6 vol vol considering a third experimental site during the dry periods no significant advantage was gained in fact involving also the measurements detected in site 1 that showed good temporal stability properties the areal mean was reproduced without an increase in r2 and with a restrained decrease in the rmse reaching the value of 1 2 vol vol these results allow us to affirm that a single optimal measurement point should be enough during the wet periods while during the dry periods a couple of selected sites could be necessary in order to optimize the soil moisture monitoring over the investigated area not only the number and the location of optimal measurement points but also the frequency of sampling is of paramount the lower variability of soil moisture during the wet periods suggests that during wet seasons the sampling can be addressed less frequently than in dry and transition between dry to wet and vice versa periods when the lower temporal persistence of the soil moisture field makes necessary to sample more frequently this result is in accordance with previous studies zhao et al 2010 the lower correlation obtained during the dry periods and thus the lower temporal stability was also confirmed by σ δ i observed in the two periods it ranged between 3 6 and 12 6 during the wet periods and between 8 1 and 23 during the dry ones at the scale considered in this paper climatic factors address the soil moisture behaviour in the same way for different morphological conditions in fact soil moisture values recorded in flat sites were more correlated with the areal mean than those found in hilly areas both for the dry and wet seasons although the different number of flat and hilly sites may influence this result it is equally true that a drainage slower than in the inclined slopes associated with the absence of horizontal fluxes may explain this phenomenon making this morphologic feature relevant for the identification of optimal measurement points especially at the catchment scale considered in this paper characterized by high possibility to find a variable geomorphology finally we remark that the magnitude of c v j values was in agreement with results obtained in previous studies characterized by similar conditions famiglietti et al 1999 western and blöschl 1999 more specifically a comparison with studies conducted in central italy brocca et al 2007 2009 2010a 2012b showed how the average value of c v j increases with the size of the investigated area assuming values equal to i 0 06 0 08 at local scale 1 500 m2 ii 0 10 at small plot scale 501 5000 m2 iii 0 15 at plot scale 5001 100 000 m2 and iv 0 20 at small catchment scale 50 240 km2 in this work the experimental area was larger than those examined in the above mentioned studies and the heterogeneity of topography and land use was more significant therefore we expect to find a higher value of c v j that however is consistent 0 20 with the values observed for areas equal to 240 km2 consequently at least in central italy it might be assumed that the average value of c v j equal to 0 20 represents an upper limit of the expected spatial variability of soil moisture observations this result is very important when a distributed rainfall runoff model has to be used 4 2 decomposition of soil moisture spatial variance considering the entire measurement period in accordance with mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 and brocca et al 2014 the component due to the temporal mean provided the highest contribution 61 to the total variance also if the spatial variability of temporal anomalies can never be neglected during the wet periods the landscape and soil characteristics such as texture and land cover exert a large influence on the soil moisture spatial distribution larger than the contribute related to the climatic factors which mainly impact the anomaly term this can be also associated to the type of precipitation systems that affect the mediterranean area which are synoptic during the winter season and more convective all through the summer during the transition periods the gap between the contribution of the temporal mean and of the anomalies decreased in favour of the latter as also demonstrated in a recent study see i e gao et al 2015 and the climatic factors become significant likely due the alternation of warm and cold days determined by weather variability during the summer months june july and august the contributions of temporal mean and anomalies reached the maximum annual values with first still dominating the second but less than during the wet season this result reinforces what previously mentioned about the analysis of the correlation between the measurement campaigns in relation to the lower reliability of soil moisture surveys carried out during the dry and especially transient periods moreover another important aspect to be considered for the analysis of the time variant and time invariant component is the spatial scale results depends on the spatial heterogeneities of time invariant components such as soil texture and vegetation that are expected to be less variable at smaller spatial scale in this study we have performed the analysis at basin scale 500 km2 that is much smaller than the region investigated in mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 31500 km2 and much larger than those considered in gao et al 2015 0 6 km2 as expected we have obtained that the time invariant component is less more important than in mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 gao et al 2015 with results similar to those found in brocca et al 2014 who analysed different networks at different spatial scales 5 conclusions soil moisture measurements carried out in 20 experimental sites in the upper chiascio river basin for a period longer than one year have been used to investigate the soil moisture behaviour at a spatial scale 500 km2 in which the rainfall spatial variability may play an important role based on results obtained from statistical and temporal stability analyses as well as from the decomposition of the soil moisture spatial variance the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the maximum number of required samples nrs considering an absolute error ae of 3 vol vol and intermediate wetness conditions is equal to 12 2 soil moisture exhibits greater variability during dry and transition periods in fact the average coefficient of variation for the dry season is equal to 0 21 while for the wet one it is equal to 0 16 3 also for areas up to 500 km2 the soil moisture field exhibits temporal stability more specifically during wet periods one optimal measurement site allows estimating the areal mean value with a good agreement r2 0 857 and rmse 1 2 vol vol while during dry periods a couple of representative sites becomes necessary in this way the catchment mean pattern is reproduced with r2 0 846 and rmse 1 6 vol vol the most representative sites are located over flat areas this last result distinctive of the large scale adopted in this paper is mainly due to the rainfall pattern characteristics during different periods of the year 4 the total spatial variance of absolute soil moisture data is predominantly determined by the time invariant component due to the temporal mean of each site however during the summer season and the transition periods the gap between the contribution of the temporal mean and of the anomalies significantly decreases these results represent a useful support to optimize any soil moisture sampling over areas with dimension up to 500 km2 further analyses aimed to investigate deeper layers or to assess the effects of different land uses and soil properties on the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture in the study basin are still needed declaration of interest none acknowledgment this work was partially funded by the italian ministry of education

6717,soil moisture plays a fundamental role in the mass and energy balance between the land surface and the atmosphere making its knowledge essential for several hydrological and climatic applications the aim of this study is to extend the current knowledge of soil moisture spatial temporal variability at the catchment scale up to 500 km2 the main implication is to provide guidelines to obtain soil moisture values representative of the mean behaviour at the medium sized river basin scale which is useful for remote sensing validation analysis and rainfall runoff modeling to this end 23 measurements campaigns were carried out during a time span of 14 months at 20 sites located within the upper chiascio river basin a catchment with a drainage area of about 460 km2 in the umbria region central italy the data set allowed the analysis of both soil moisture temporal stability and its dynamics on the basis of statistical and temporal stability approaches it was investigated how factors such as climatic regime and geomorphology influence soil moisture behaviour for the investigated area the spatial variability of soil moisture was higher in dry periods with respect to wet periods mainly due to the rainfall pattern characteristics during different periods of the year soil moisture values recorded during wet periods showed a better correlation than those recorded during dry periods the maximum number of required samples to obtain the mean areal soil moisture with an absolute error of 3 vol vol was found equal to 12 the temporal stability analysis showed that during wet periods just one optimal measurement point can provide values of soil moisture representative of the catchment mean behaviour while during dry periods the number of optimal measurement points became equal to two therefore at the adopted spatial scale the use of a single measurement point can lead to significant errors from the perspective of soil moisture dynamics the decomposition of the spatial variance showed that the contribution of the time invariant component temporal mean of each site was predominant on respect to the total spatial variance of absolute soil moisture data for almost the whole observation period results provided guidance to optimize soil moisture sampling by performing targeted measurements at a few selected points representative of the catchment mean behaviour keywords soil moisture spatial variability temporal stability catchment scale in situ measurements 1 introduction soil moisture is of paramount importance for many hydrological processes brocca et al 2017a its knowledge is relevant in several fields which include rainfall runoff partitioning blöschl and sivaplan 1995 brocca et al 2010b koster et al 2010 mirus and loague 2013 landslide forecasting brocca et al 2012a soil nutrient cycling processes schjonning et al 2003 drought monitoring and agriculture crow et al 2012 champagne et al 2015 the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture content raises many challenges to its definition at various scales small scale variations due to geomorphological characteristics and soil properties such as the saturated hydraulic conductivity occur in the spatial range of a few tens of meters and in the temporal range of a few days western et al 2004 large scale variations affect very extensive areas such as whole basins 100 km2 and are also caused by atmospheric forcings practically ground based measurements and remote sensing techniques can be used to characterize at each scale the spatiotemporal variation of soil water content ground based measurements such as time domain reflectometry neutron probes capacitance probes and gravimetric analyses provide detailed information on the soil moisture values when careful calibration of devices is available romano 2014 however these techniques are time consuming very expensive and provide information only in selected points to overcome this issue the use of sensors on board of satellite platforms has been spreading over the past few decades fang and lakshmi 2013 brocca et al 2017b this technology allows to remotely sense various meteorological data including soil moisture over large domain but is limited by the low spatial resolution ranging from 1 km e g sentinel 1 bauer marschallinger et al 2018 to 40 km e g smap entekhabi et al 2010 and by the inherent bias of the measurement thus requiring an accurate on site verification prior their use within model and applications for these reasons traditional measurement methods are necessary and still widely used however given the high costs an effort is required to identify soil moisture sampling optimization schemes for reducing the number of measurements as few as possible in accordance with the desired accuracy and the site characteristics several authors investigated the possibility to optimize the sampling scheme through specific soil moisture field campaigns in experimental areas characterized by dimension up to few square kilometers by using the statistical analysis bell et al 1980 famiglietti et al 1999 brocca et al 2007 wang et al 2008 the temporal stability analysis vauchad et al 1985 grayson and western 1998 martinez fernandez and ceballos 2005 brocca et al 2009 zhou et al 2013 or both jacobs et al 2004 choi and jacobs 2007 brocca et al 2010a hu et al 2010 brocca et al 2012b baroni et al 2013 liao et al 2017 lai et al 2017 2018 recently mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 considering a very large scale the entire switzerland area showed that the spatial variability of soil moisture is predominantly determined by a time invariant component and that statistical and temporal stability analysis can lead to different results by considering temporal anomalies rather than absolute soil moisture values mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 concluded their analysis encouraging further studies at different scale to investigate the spatio temporal characteristics of temporal soil moisture anomalies in addition to assessments of those of absolute soil moisture all these studies highlighted that soil moisture spatial variability increases with the extension of the investigated area and that soil moisture patterns show a significant temporal stability thus making just one optimal measurement point able to represent the areal mean behaviour however at the catchment scale for large areas especially during seasons with strong propensity for the development of convective rainfall systems as stated in terms of optimal sampling scheme for the small scale could fail therefore the main objective of this paper aimed at the determination of an optimal soil moisture sampling scheme is to investigate the soil water content behaviour at a scale in which the rainfall spatial variability may play an important role for this purpose the analysis carried out in this paper is based on a long measurement period which has been divided into wet and dry sub periods in order to explore the influence of convective and frontal rainfall systems on soil moisture variability at the same spatial scale on the basis of the methodology proposed by mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 the secondary objective of this paper is to evaluate the roles of the time invariant contribution of the temporal anomalies in the determination of the spatial variability of soil moisture 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the soil moisture measurements were carried out in 20 experimental sites located in the upper chiascio river basin which is an inland area in the umbria region with a drainage area of approximately 460 km2 fig 1 the basin was mainly characterized by an apennine climate with an altitude between 320 and 1550 m a s l and a mean slope of 24 the mean annual temperature was 13 0 c and the mean annual precipitation was 1050 mm generally with the highest monthly values recorded in the autumn and winter seasons 2 2 soil moisture measurements the selection of the 20 experimental sites for the monitoring of soil moisture was based on the necessity to have heterogeneity in terms of land use topography texture and vegetation cover with this choice site number and position we tried to represent the entire catchment considering also the necessity to conduct each measurement campaign in the same day as shown in table 1 the distribution of soil texture classes of the measurement points was fairly uniform with most of the sites located in silty clay loam and clay loam respectively 30 and 35 of the total soils the terrain of the experimental sites was mostly flat with 70 of the measurement points placed in flat areas and 30 in hilly areas with regard to land use the area where the experimental sites are located was predominantly cultivated with small wooded areas and semi natural environments the sampling scheme adopted was designed to have a number of measurement points and measurement campaigns that can catch the soil moisture spatial and temporal variability in fact experimental sites were located on an extended area and the measurement campaigns were prolonged to capture the alternation between dry and wet periods the 23 monitoring campaigns covered a time span ranging from march 2014 to may 2015 and were distanced between them for about two weeks each during each field campaign four measures were carried out at each of the 20 monitored sites and the mean value was considered as the reference value to be stored in the database the soil moisture was measured through a portable unit using two wire connector type time domain reflectometry probes tdr of the soil moisture equipment corporation trase tdr which provides a soil moisture measurement representative for a soil layer depth of 15 cm to obtain the volumetric soil moisture once the dielectric constant is measured the standard calibration curve was used skaling 1992 the equipment has a quoted error within 2 vol vol except for the texture classes given in table 1 a detailed characterization of the study soils is delayed for future developments which could also highlight further aspects of interest 2 3 rainfall data the rainfall pattern that affected the study basin during the measurement period was analysed in order to separate dry from wet periods the daily rainfall data recorded by 14 rain gauges located within the area of interest was collected and spatially averaged by using the thiessen polygon method 2 4 statistical analysis the main statistical features of the soil moisture data set were determined and analysed in terms of spatial and temporal variability let us denote θ i j the soil moisture measured at site i i 1 n during the sampling day j j 1 m with n 20 and m 23 the spatial mean referred to each sampling day θ j is given by 1 θ j 1 n i 1 n θ i j in a similar way the temporal mean for each measurement point θ i is calculated by 2 θ i 1 m j 1 m θ i j the coefficient of variation for each sampling day c v j is obtained from the relation 3 c v j σ j θ j 1 n 1 i 1 n θ i j θ j 2 θ j where σ j is the spatial standard deviation for each site the coefficient of variation in time c v i and the temporal standard deviation σ i can be defined analogously the number of required samples for estimating the mean value within a specific absolute error nrs can be obtained from the knowledge of σ j through the following implicit relation wang et al 2008 4 n r s t 1 α 2 n r s 1 2 σ j 2 a e 2 where t 1 α 2 n r s 1 2 is the value of the student s t distribution at the confidence level 1 α 2 nrs is the number of the degrees of freedom and ae indicates the absolute error considered expressed in volumetric soil moisture vol vol 2 5 temporal stability the temporal stability analysis introduced by vauchad et al 1985 allows to identify the measurement points where the observed values of soil moisture are representative of the mean soil moisture of the entire monitored area this is extremely important because it permits to install a small number of probes in a few selected points for retrieving the average soil moisture over a large area furthermore the knowledge of the temporal persistence of soil moisture patterns provides support in determining the frequency of measurements under different wetness conditions the temporal stability analysis is carried out using the relative differences method which is described below considering the spatial mean for each sampling day previously introduced the relative difference δ i j referring to site i and sampling day j is calculated by 5 δ i j θ i j θ j θ j for each measurement point i the mean δ i and the standard deviation σ δ i of the relative differences can be obtained by 6 δ i 1 m j 1 m δ i j 7 σ δ i 1 m 1 j 1 m δ i j δ i 2 the δ i quantifies how much the soil moisture recorded at a sampling point departs from the mean spatial value during the measurement period the σ δ i is an index of the temporal variability the representative sites of the mean value in time are characterized by lower values of δ i and σ δ i jacobs et al 2004 defined a single metric to identify the best sampling point the index of time stability its that combines the δ i and its σ δ i it can be calculated for each site as follows 8 i ts i δ i 2 σ δ i 2 1 2 it is noteworthy that originally in jacobs et al 2004 this index was called root mean square error rmse in this study the wording its zhao et al 2010 penna et al 2013 is employed instead of rmse in order to disambiguate the index of time stability from the common definition of the rmse according to this method optimal measurement points are characterized by low values of the its the main advantage of the its approach is that it allows to identify representative sampling sites by considering just one parameter 2 6 decomposition of soil moisture spatial variance the soil moisture dynamics were studied on the basis of the approach introduced by mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 according to this method the spatial variance of soil moisture data can be decomposed in the following three components 9 σ 2 θ i j σ 2 θ i σ 2 a i j 2 c o v θ i a i j where σ 2 θ i is the spatial variance of the temporal mean σ 2 a i j is the spatial variance of the temporal anomalies a i j which quantify how much each observed value deviates from the temporal mean and can be calculated as 10 a i j θ i j θ i the third component of the right side in eq 8 is the spatial covariance between the temporal mean soil moisture of a site and the temporal anomaly 2 7 data processing the observed data were analysed both in their completeness and by considering partial sets based on temporal and spatial criteria specifically the values of soil moisture recorded during wet and dry periods were compared as well as those observed in flat and hilly areas the separation between dry and wet periods was determined by analysing the rainfall measurements occurred in the experimental area in the measurement period for each day in which a measurement campaign was carried out it was calculated the mean of the daily rainfall recorded by 14 rain gauges installed thereabout the experimental sites this operation was repeated for the five days previous each measurement campaign the spatial averages were then summed obtaining the values of api5 referred to each sampling day the periods in which these values were found higher than a mean threshold value were classified as wet otherwise as dry 3 results 3 1 statistical analysis the time series of soil moisture values observed at each site their spatial mean and the average rainfall over the study area during the measurement period are shown in fig 2 the spatial mean soil moisture responds to the precipitation input with sudden increments after significant events and slow decrements in the absence of precipitation two wet and two dry periods have been identified in the time interval of interest the spatial mean the spatial standard deviation and the coefficient of variation of the soil moisture obtained during each measurement campaign are contained in table 2 it also shows the associated value of api5 the average value considering 14 rain gauges and its coefficient of variation cv api5 the behaviour of the cv api5 values reported in table 2 evidences the different rainfall patterns during the various periods of the year in presence of prevailing convective systems mainly observed during dry periods the average cv api5 is equal to 1 03 while with prevailing frontal systems typically observed during wet periods this value become 0 63 as expected for both soil moisture and api5 the values of the coefficient of variation of the soil moisture obtained during each measurement campaign were lower during the wet periods in fact during the dry season the average c v j of soil moisture was equal to 0 21 while for the wet season it was equal to 0 16 globally i e by considering the entire data set the average value of c v j was equal to 0 19 this is an index of the low variability of soil moisture field during the wet periods when the investigated area is interested by spatially uniform rainfall systems during the dry period instead the soil moisture field is less uniform as a response to isolated convective rainfall systems that determine significant spatial differences in the soil moisture values the decreasing trend between c v j and θ j is shown in fig 3 this behaviour indicates a lower variability of absolute soil moisture under increasing wetness conditions and it is consistent with the behaviour observed in most of the previous analogous studies e g bell et al 1980 famiglietti et al 1999 2008 brocca et al 2010a 2012b conducted in smaller areas the assumption that the relationship between c v j and θ j is represented by an exponential law allows to establish the maximum nrs for estimating the mean soil moisture value with a specific absolute error ae as a function of the average wetness conditions by using eq 4 the nrs values were calculated for an ae equal to 3 and 4 see fig 4 by assuming the relation between c v j and θ j as exponential eq 4 provides nrs as a function of the mean soil moisture within a certain level of confidence for instance by considering a confidence interval of 95 to obtain the average soil moisture with an ae of 3 a maximum nrs of 12 was required this value was found for a mean soil moisture of 30 vol vol and was the maximum of the curve shown in fig 4 obtained by fitting the values calculated with eq 4 by considering the entire set of soil moisture measurements brocca et al 2012b on the basis of soil moisture data recorded during a time span of about one year over two areas with a smaller extension 178 and 242 km2 but comparable to those of interest in this study found a maximum nrs value up to 3 ae 4 obviously with the increase of the ae the nrs decreases reaching the value of 7 for absolute an error of 4 this method allows to plan a reliable in situ monitoring with respect to a fixed accuracy also at a catchment spatial scale 3 2 temporal stability analysis in order to check out which sites are the most suitable to obtain the benchmark soil moisture i e the areal mean calculated considering all the 20 sites the relative differences method was applied for this purpose the values of δ i σ δ i and its were considered and compared the application of the its method to values of δ i and σ δ i that vary in ranges quite different from each other could provide unreliable results if the aim is to identify a measurement point temporally stable and representative of the mean soil moisture for the entire study area without any standardisation it could happen that an experimental site shows a low value of its because of a low value of σ δ i but a relatively high value of δ i thus making that point temporally stable but distant from the areal mean soil moisture in this case the recorded values should be scaled in order to obtain the areal mean because of this the identification of optimal measurement point was here addressed by comparing temporal stability analysis with correlation analysis always keeping in mind that the final aim is to identify temporally stable sites that could also provide a soil moisture value representative of the catchment mean behaviour this procedure was applied for the entire data set and considering the partition between wet and dry periods in order to highlight the influence of climate conditions on soil moisture variability distinguishing between values observed in flat areas from those in hilly areas it was also possible to evaluate the geomorphological characteristics that experimental sites should have to be considered as optimal measurement sites the most representative site of the entire study basin in terms of mean soil moisture was the number 8 of fig 1 fig 5 a shows the good determination coefficient r2 equal to 0 837 between the values found at site 8 and the areal mean soil moisture fig 6 a shows the rank ordered mean relative difference with the corresponding standard deviation for each experimental site on the same chart also the its associated to each measurement point is shown site 8 showed good characteristics in terms of temporal stability as δ i was close to zero and σ δ i represented by the vertical bar was very low the its values were minimal for sites 8 and 1 but the latter showed a significant value of δ i by considering the entire data set the values of σ δ i varied between a minimum and a maximum of 7 6 and 19 7 in absolute value respectively in particular for the site number 8 values of δ i 0 003 σ δ i 9 7 and its 9 were found the same analyses were also carried out separately during wet and dry periods and results are shown in figs 5b and c and 6b and c in the dry periods the site where the soil moisture values were closer to the average of the study basin was the number 16 with r2 equal to 0 725 fig 5b which also showed good characteristics in terms of temporal stability i e low values of δ i σ δ i and its even if these values are worse than those relative to sites 8 and 1 conversely during the wet periods the site 8 was the optimal one with r2 equal to 0 857 fig 5c and the lowest values of δ i σ δ i and its while there is no doubt that during the wet periods the site 8 was the optimal one for the dry periods further evaluations are needed together with site 8 site 16 could be chosen as optimal for this period because it showed the best determination coefficient with the spatial mean and consequently a δ i closer to zero for this site the its wasn t the lowest one because of a σ δ i higher than other sites i e site 1 this is probably due to a few values recorded during the transition periods when the catchment is not yet in uniform wetness conditions it can be observed that both sites 8 and 16 were located in flat areas also if not statistically significant this interesting indication could be the object of future developments in the spatial correlation triangle shown in fig 7 the generic box identified by the i th line and j th column expresses the correlation between the values of soil moisture measured during the i th campaign and those measured in the j th campaign higher correlations are represented with darker cells it can be seen that the values of soil moisture measured during campaigns carried out in wet periods were highly correlated each other while lower values were obtained between campaigns carried out during dry periods relatively high correlations were also observed between measurement campaigns belonging to wet periods distant in time about 5 months the spatial correlation between measurements carried out during wet periods reached values of 0 94 and always remained larger than 0 71 another aspect of interest was that in accordance with previous studies mohanty and skaggs 2001 cosh et al 2004 martinez fernandez and ceballos 2005 brocca et al 2012b in most cases measurements campaigns during the transition periods were those that show the lower correlation values finally campaigns taken during different dry seasons were occasionally negatively correlated with each other these results provided useful information for optimize a soil moisture monitoring for instance with the objective to validate soil moisture estimation from remote sensing transition periods should be avoided or alternatively an adequate number of sampling points should be adopted the same analysis was carried out with data separated by site geomorphology measurements in flat sites provided values of soil moisture positively correlated with each other over time and significantly higher than those observed in hilly sites where the correlation was high solely between adjacent measurement campaigns see fig 8 during the wet periods there was an increase in the spatial correlation between the average soil moisture over hilly areas and the areal mean value the same happened with the average water content over flat areas 3 3 decomposition of soil moisture spatial variance the analyses previously described aimed to identify the most representative sites of the mean catchment soil moisture behaviour were carried out in terms of absolute values of soil moisture however some studies e g mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 brocca et al 2014 suggested that the temporal anomalies the absolute soil moisture minus the seasonal mean can show a different behaviour with respect to the absolute values on the basis of this new perspective fig 9 shows the time evolution of the terms that contribute to the determination of spatial variance of soil moisture according to eq 9 in most cases the dominant contribution was the one related to the temporal mean the influence of temporal anomalies was higher during dry periods and in some cases larger than that related to the temporal mean these results were in line with what previously mentioned about the lower stability of soil moisture values observed during the dry season during the wet periods the contribution of the covariance was often close to zero while the time invariant term was dominant 4 discussion 4 1 statistical and temporal stability analyses the combination of statistical and temporal stability analysis allowed us to highlight that also at the large scale up to 500 km2 soil moisture field showed temporal stability properties in fact considering the whole data set soil moisture measurements in site 8 represented the areal mean with r2 equal to 0 837 and rmse equal to 2 4 vol vol during the wet periods the performances of the same experimental site rose with a higher determination coefficient and a smaller root mean square error r2 equal to 0 857 and rmse equal to 1 2 vol vol during the dry periods there was a loss in the accuracy of the estimation the mean of the values recorded in the optimal measurement points sites 8 and 16 for this period was able to reproduce the catchment mean behaviour with r2 equal to 0 846 and rmse equal to 1 6 vol vol considering a third experimental site during the dry periods no significant advantage was gained in fact involving also the measurements detected in site 1 that showed good temporal stability properties the areal mean was reproduced without an increase in r2 and with a restrained decrease in the rmse reaching the value of 1 2 vol vol these results allow us to affirm that a single optimal measurement point should be enough during the wet periods while during the dry periods a couple of selected sites could be necessary in order to optimize the soil moisture monitoring over the investigated area not only the number and the location of optimal measurement points but also the frequency of sampling is of paramount the lower variability of soil moisture during the wet periods suggests that during wet seasons the sampling can be addressed less frequently than in dry and transition between dry to wet and vice versa periods when the lower temporal persistence of the soil moisture field makes necessary to sample more frequently this result is in accordance with previous studies zhao et al 2010 the lower correlation obtained during the dry periods and thus the lower temporal stability was also confirmed by σ δ i observed in the two periods it ranged between 3 6 and 12 6 during the wet periods and between 8 1 and 23 during the dry ones at the scale considered in this paper climatic factors address the soil moisture behaviour in the same way for different morphological conditions in fact soil moisture values recorded in flat sites were more correlated with the areal mean than those found in hilly areas both for the dry and wet seasons although the different number of flat and hilly sites may influence this result it is equally true that a drainage slower than in the inclined slopes associated with the absence of horizontal fluxes may explain this phenomenon making this morphologic feature relevant for the identification of optimal measurement points especially at the catchment scale considered in this paper characterized by high possibility to find a variable geomorphology finally we remark that the magnitude of c v j values was in agreement with results obtained in previous studies characterized by similar conditions famiglietti et al 1999 western and blöschl 1999 more specifically a comparison with studies conducted in central italy brocca et al 2007 2009 2010a 2012b showed how the average value of c v j increases with the size of the investigated area assuming values equal to i 0 06 0 08 at local scale 1 500 m2 ii 0 10 at small plot scale 501 5000 m2 iii 0 15 at plot scale 5001 100 000 m2 and iv 0 20 at small catchment scale 50 240 km2 in this work the experimental area was larger than those examined in the above mentioned studies and the heterogeneity of topography and land use was more significant therefore we expect to find a higher value of c v j that however is consistent 0 20 with the values observed for areas equal to 240 km2 consequently at least in central italy it might be assumed that the average value of c v j equal to 0 20 represents an upper limit of the expected spatial variability of soil moisture observations this result is very important when a distributed rainfall runoff model has to be used 4 2 decomposition of soil moisture spatial variance considering the entire measurement period in accordance with mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 and brocca et al 2014 the component due to the temporal mean provided the highest contribution 61 to the total variance also if the spatial variability of temporal anomalies can never be neglected during the wet periods the landscape and soil characteristics such as texture and land cover exert a large influence on the soil moisture spatial distribution larger than the contribute related to the climatic factors which mainly impact the anomaly term this can be also associated to the type of precipitation systems that affect the mediterranean area which are synoptic during the winter season and more convective all through the summer during the transition periods the gap between the contribution of the temporal mean and of the anomalies decreased in favour of the latter as also demonstrated in a recent study see i e gao et al 2015 and the climatic factors become significant likely due the alternation of warm and cold days determined by weather variability during the summer months june july and august the contributions of temporal mean and anomalies reached the maximum annual values with first still dominating the second but less than during the wet season this result reinforces what previously mentioned about the analysis of the correlation between the measurement campaigns in relation to the lower reliability of soil moisture surveys carried out during the dry and especially transient periods moreover another important aspect to be considered for the analysis of the time variant and time invariant component is the spatial scale results depends on the spatial heterogeneities of time invariant components such as soil texture and vegetation that are expected to be less variable at smaller spatial scale in this study we have performed the analysis at basin scale 500 km2 that is much smaller than the region investigated in mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 31500 km2 and much larger than those considered in gao et al 2015 0 6 km2 as expected we have obtained that the time invariant component is less more important than in mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 gao et al 2015 with results similar to those found in brocca et al 2014 who analysed different networks at different spatial scales 5 conclusions soil moisture measurements carried out in 20 experimental sites in the upper chiascio river basin for a period longer than one year have been used to investigate the soil moisture behaviour at a spatial scale 500 km2 in which the rainfall spatial variability may play an important role based on results obtained from statistical and temporal stability analyses as well as from the decomposition of the soil moisture spatial variance the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the maximum number of required samples nrs considering an absolute error ae of 3 vol vol and intermediate wetness conditions is equal to 12 2 soil moisture exhibits greater variability during dry and transition periods in fact the average coefficient of variation for the dry season is equal to 0 21 while for the wet one it is equal to 0 16 3 also for areas up to 500 km2 the soil moisture field exhibits temporal stability more specifically during wet periods one optimal measurement site allows estimating the areal mean value with a good agreement r2 0 857 and rmse 1 2 vol vol while during dry periods a couple of representative sites becomes necessary in this way the catchment mean pattern is reproduced with r2 0 846 and rmse 1 6 vol vol the most representative sites are located over flat areas this last result distinctive of the large scale adopted in this paper is mainly due to the rainfall pattern characteristics during different periods of the year 4 the total spatial variance of absolute soil moisture data is predominantly determined by the time invariant component due to the temporal mean of each site however during the summer season and the transition periods the gap between the contribution of the temporal mean and of the anomalies significantly decreases these results represent a useful support to optimize any soil moisture sampling over areas with dimension up to 500 km2 further analyses aimed to investigate deeper layers or to assess the effects of different land uses and soil properties on the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture in the study basin are still needed declaration of interest none acknowledgment this work was partially funded by the italian ministry of education

6718,stable isotope ratios δ2h and δ18o in precipitation not only show a certain response to climate change at different time scales but also have strong linkages to extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones hurricanes typhoons typhoon activity in the coastal region of southeast china is quite intense bringing huge amounts of moisture thus contributing to extreme rainfall in this region the existing isotope data in southeast china is available on a monthly or daily temporal resolution which is inadequate to study 1 2 day long typhoon rainfall events at a particular location in this study hourly rainfall δ2h and δ18o data are collected for eight typhoon events from 2013 to 2017 in fuzhou southeast china the total correlation between δ2h and δ18o is obtained as δ2h 7 41 δ18o 0 81 r2 0 96 n 220 all the eight typhoon events reveal a similar variability pattern in δ18o values which can be divided into three stages more positive δ18o values occur in the first and third stages while the second stage is dominated by most negative δ18o values exhibiting an inverted u shaped pattern the positive δ18o values during the first and third stages are governed by re evaporation the precipitation during the second stage has distinctly lower δ18o values than the weighted average δ18o of summer precipitation in fuzhou some of these values are slightly lower than those of the water vapor over the pacific ocean s surface no significant relationship is observed between precipitation δ18o and temperature as well as the amount of precipitation during the second stage we hypothesize that the significant 18o depletion is mainly caused by the rain shield effect which refers to combination of large scale convection high condensation efficiency and recycling of isotopically depleted vapor in rain shield areas leading to very negative δ18o values during typhoon system these findings suggest the use of stable isotope ratios as important tracers of typhoon water keywords typhoon rainfall stable isotope ratios southeast china rain shield effect 1 introduction as an important part of the global water cycle stable isotopes in modern precipitation contain rich climatic and environmental information e g araguás araguás et al 2000 xie et al 2011 ren et al 2017 stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes δ2h and δ18o in precipitation have been widely used in studies pertaining to the hydrological cycle and climatology e g tian et al 2007 yao et al 2013 brenčič et al 2015 srivastava et al 2015 since 1961 the international atomic energy agency iaea and the world meteorological organization wmo established the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip program to survey stable isotopes in worldwide precipitation the acquired data have greatly improved our knowledge of isotopic compositions in precipitation and their response to environmental changes e g gat 1996 bowen and wilkinson 2002 vuille et al 2005 a notable positive correlation between δ2h and δ18o is called meteoric water line mwl and can be observed in precipitations lakes and rivers around the world the global meteoric water line gmwl is given as δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 and plays an important role in the study of stable isotopes in precipitation araguás araguás et al 1998 tian et al 2001 zhou and li 2017 the apparent correlations between stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in precipitation and meteorological and geographical parameters are known as isotope effects and include the temperature amount altitude and latitude effects dansgaard 1964 among them the temperature effect and the amount effect are particularly important dansgaard 1964 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 baldini et al 2010 previous studies have found that change in the sources of water vapor also has an important impact on stable isotope ratios in precipitation hoffmann and heimann 1997 breitenbach et al 2010 peng et al 2010 chen and li 2018 considerable research has been conducted on stable isotope ratios in precipitation on monthly and daily basis in different regions of the world e g gammons et al 2006 liu et al 2010 stumpp et al 2014 zhang and wang 2016 however the precise relationship between stable isotopic compositions and meteorological parameters during extreme precipitation events remain controversial in some cases the variation of isotope compositions during the extreme rainfall event is also attributed to change in moisture sources xie et al 2011 li et al 2015 in general heavy precipitation caused by extreme weather such as torrential rain or tropical cyclones is categorized as an extreme precipitation event tropical cyclones are characterized by strong wind high intensity precipitation and a wide range of impacts zhang et al 2018 the stable isotope compositions of precipitation in tropical cyclones could be used as tracers of the storm structure dynamic evolution and its water and energy budgets lawrence et al 1982 2002 lawrence and gedzelman 1996 good et al 2014 munksgaard et al 2015 the mean δ18o values in hurricane precipitations are obviously lower than those of other tropical and summer precipitation systems and the isotope ratios decrease inward toward the center of the hurricane lawrence and gedzelman 1996 gedzelman et al 2003 lawrence et al 1998 explained that the low stable isotope ratios in hurricanes result from their high and deep clouds large size and longevity and the inward decrease is due to isotope exchange between precipitation and depleted vapor in the atmospheric boundary layer while studying the typhoon shanshan similar results were found by fudeyasu et al 2008 who attributed this low stable isotope ratio to the rainout effect ohsawa and yusa 2000 suggested that the stable isotope ratios decrease with the reduction of distance between the typhoon and observation site and this phenomenon is related to the isotopic fractionation of water vapor therefore a clear understanding of the short term isotopic variability of tropical cyclones is fundamental in interpreting precipitation isotopes in tropical and subtropical regions the coastal area of south china is especially vulnerable to landfalling typhoons from the western north pacific zhang et al 2009 2011 typhoons bring abundant water vapor from the ocean and provide favorable environments for the initiation of extreme precipitation in the coastal and landward regions of china zhang et al 2018 typhoon activity in southeast china is very intense during summer and autumn one of the regions with the largest number of landfalling typhoons in china is fujian province zhang et al 2009 from may 2000 to october 2017 fujian province experienced 141 typhoons of which 42 made landfall owing to the changes in the environment and the underlying surface the structure path and intensity of typhoons change significantly during the process of moving and making landfall on the mainland chen et al 2010 thus understanding this variability and the fundamental causes behind it are important to interpret the hydrological cycle during typhoon events stable isotopes in precipitation have been broadly utilized in hydrological and meteorological studies hoefs 2015 he et al 2018a thus clarifying the variations in the characteristics of typhoon precipitation δ18o and the influencing factors during its occurrence are of great significance the existing monthly precipitation isotopic data in southern china are presented by gnip while daily records are generated by xie et al 2011 and chen et al 2016 since the impact of typhoon precipitation lasts for only 1 2 days at a particular location the existing stable isotope data is inadequate for intra event comparison in this study we report hourly precipitation δ2h and δ18o collected during eight typhoon events from 2013 to 2017 in fuzhou southeast china the major objectives are 1 to investigate the intra event variability of precipitation stable isotopes during typhoon events 2 to examine the influence of meteorological parameters at the sampling site on precipitation stable isotopes and 3 to explore the factors impacting significant 18o depletion in the rain during typhoon events 2 sampling site the precipitation samples were collected at the top of a 20 m high building that hosts the school of geographical sciences in fujian normal university 26 05 n 119 30 e 31 m a s

climate it has hot and rainy summers and warm and dry winters instrumental meteorological data from the fuzhou meteorological station 1981 2010 26 08 n 119 28 e 84 m a s l shows that the average annual temperature is 20 c and the average annual precipitation is 1390 mm the monthly average maximum and minimum temperature is 29 c and 11 c occurring in july and january respectively more than 80

typhoons affect or make landfall every year the amount of precipitation during typhoon usually account for 50 80 of the monthly precipitation during summer monsoon jjas and 6 17 of the annual precipitation 3 materials and methods from 2013 to 2017 eight typhoon events had a significant impact on fuzhou fig 1 among them seven typhoons originated from the western north pacific and the remaining one originated from the south china sea fig 1 and table 1 during their respective development four of them reached the lifetime maximum intensity of a super typhoon two others were classified as typhoon while the remaining two typhoons were categorized as strong typhoon and tropical storm table 1 and supplementary table s1 the total accumulated precipitation during each of these typhoons range from 50 mm to 300 mm during the entire sampling period table 1 more details about eight typhoons are given in supplementary text s1 owing to changes in precipitation amounts the samples of typhoon precipitation were collected at different time intervals 0 5 h 2 h a clean 2 l glass beaker was used to collect the typhoon precipitation the beaker was placed on a shelf about 1 5 m above ground and packed with tinfoil a funnel was placed on top of the beaker to prevent evaporation once the sampling was completed each sample was immediately poured into 50 ml and 2 ml polypropylene colorless plastic bottles with no air headspace these bottles were sealed with parafilm sealing membrane to prevent evaporation and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c to avoid isotopic fractionation until stable isotopic analysis could be performed a total of 220 samples were collected during the 8 typhoons stable isotope compositions δ2h and δ18o of the samples were measured using lgr dlt 100

2017 together with gnip based monthly precipitation δ2h and δ18o from 1985 to 1992 are presented in table 1 the δ2h and δ18o values of all typhoon precipitation samples vary greatly from 10 to 122 and from 2 6 to 17 respectively table 1 and supplementary table s2 the gnip based monthly precipitation δ2h and δ18o ranges from 1 to 104 7 and from 0 92 to 14 16 respectively table 1 both δ2h and δ18o of all typhoon events exhibit larger amplitude than monthly precipitation gnip based weighted mean precipitation δ18o value during summer jjas between 1985 and 1992 is 8 1 table 1 marking this δ18o 8 1 as the background value the characteristics of typhoon precipitation δ18o over the entire events are divided into three stages figs 2 and s2 the δ18o values are generally positive during the first stage 2 6 to 9 9 followed by a significant decrease during the second stage 6 3 to 17 while the third stage is marked with a gradual increase 3 3 to 10 7 during the first and third stages the relatively enriched δ18o values show wide fluctuations while the excessively negative δ18o values during the second stage are relatively steady the variation in δ18o in the process of typhoon precipitation shows an inverted u shaped pattern fig 2 4 2 inter event variability significant variation in δ2h and δ18o values of the precipitation is also observed within each typhoon event typhoon dujuan 2015 and typhoon nesat 2017 reveals the largest range for δ2h 17 to 110 and δ18o 2 6 to 15 5 respectively however typhoon nesat 2017 show the smallest range for δ2h 37 to 102 while typhoon matmo 2014 and typhoon soudelor 2015 show the smallest range for δ18o 7 2 to 15 4 and 3 2 to 11 4 respectively table 1 nevertheless there is a minimal difference in the lowest precipitation δ2h and δ18o values between the typhoon events which ranges from 102 to 122 and 13 6 to 17 respectively table 1 although typhoon soudelor 2015 is an exception as it shows relatively enriched values of δ2h and δ18o 85 and 11 4 respectively the weighted mean δ2h and δ18o values during typhoon events and monthly precipitation also vary considerably typhoon dujuan 2015 and typhoon trami 2013 show the largest and smallest weighted mean values for both δ2h 53 and 101 and δ18o 7 4 and 13 2 respectively gnip based δ2h and δ18o values during summer jjas ranges from 14 1 to 84 and from 0 92 to 11 78 respectively and the weighted mean values are 58 7 and 8 1 respectively table 1 the most negative δ2h and δ18o values in typhoon precipitation are significantly lower than those of the monthly precipitation events in fuzhou which is probably because the gnip datasets are weighed by monthly average precipitation to provide a comprehensive picture the δ18o values of a total of 137 typhoon precipitation samples 62 of the total number of typhoon precipitation samples are lower than 8 1 4 3 correlation analysis between stable isotopes and meteorological parameters correlations between local meteorological parameters air temperature precipitation amount and relative humidity and δ18o of typhoon precipitation for different time periods are given in table 2 during the entire sampling period the first and third stages there is a weak positive correlation between temperature and δ18o and a weak negative correlation between relative humidity and δ18o table 2 the correlation coefficient r are 0 33 p 0 01 n 171 0 30 p 0 01 n 85 between δ18o and temperature and 0 33 p 0 01 n 171 0 24 p 0 05 n 85 between δ18o and relative humidity during the entire period and the first and third stages respectively there is no apparent correlation between meteorological parameters and precipitation δ18o for the second stage table 2 the correlations between δ18o and meteorological parameters suggest that stable isotopes of typhoon precipitation are not controlled by local meteorological variables on the ground the temperature and relative humidity recorded by the rain gauge or meteorological station can only partially represent the atmospheric conditions below the clouds he et al 2018b however variability in these data can also provide some insights to explain the isotopic evolution pattern e g higher temperature and lower relative humidity may imply a higher re evaporation 4 4 deuterium excess d excess deuterium excess d excess defined as d δ2h 8 δ18o is generally controlled by evaporative conditions combining sea surface temperature humidity and wind speed dansgaard 1964 merlivat and jouzel 1979 benetti et al 2014 d excess values of typhoon precipitation also observed to vary greatly through time from 21 9 to 25 5 fig s3 more than 80 of the total number of typhoon precipitation samples shows d excess value of less than 10 the mean d excess value is 6 3 unlike δ18o d excess values exhibit irregular variability with no inverted u shaped variability with the raindrops fall below the cloud it can be affected by sub cloud evaporation which increases 18o and decreases deuterium excess hollins et al 2018 there is an inverse relationship existing between δ18o and d excess values r 0 4 p 0 01 suggesting the occurrence of re evaporation to some extent of raindrops during typhoon events he et al 2018b 5 discussion 5 1 correlation between δ2h and δ18o in typhoon precipitation the mwl of typhoon precipitation in fuzhou is presented as δ2h 7 41 δ18o 0 81 r2 0 96 n 220 both the slope and intercept are slightly smaller than those of the gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 and the lmwl δ2h 8 84 δ18o 16 94 r2 0 96 n 48 fig 3 the lmwl is established from the δ2h and δ18o values of fuzhou station as per gnip data from january 1988 to december 1991 previous studies suggest that the degree of precipitation re evaporation is likely associated with the relative humidity conditions in different environments lee and fung 2008 he et al 2018b before and after typhoon landfall the relative humidity is low ranging from 63 to 95 more than 50 of these values are lower than 90 the δ18o values of typhoon precipitation are relatively enriched 8 and appears in the lower right of the gmwl and lmwl plots fig 3 previously analysis suggests that southeast china is strongly affected by the western north pacific subtropical high in summer lin and wang 2016 water vapor evaporates to some extent before and after typhoon landfall which usually results in heavy isotope enrichment of typhoon precipitation and the relatively enriched precipitation δ18o values due to the isotopic non equilibrium fractionation the rain shield area of a typhoon affects the sampling site increasing relative humidity to 100 the δ18o values of typhoon precipitation are significantly negative 8 and plot closely to the gmwl and the lmwl fig 3 which indicates very weak re evaporation of precipitation during this period the effect of re evaporation before and after typhoon landfall leads to smaller slope and intercept of the mwl of typhoon precipitation in fuzhou compared to the corresponding values of the gmwl and lmwl 5 2 stage characteristics of δ18o the first stage shows relatively enriched δ18o values ranging from 2 6 to 9 9 with a weighted mean of 6 5 fig 2 during a typhoon re evaporation has the greatest impact at the initial stage of precipitation as the vapor content in the air is lower muller et al 2015 precipitation during this stage is mainly influenced by the water vapor in the periphery of rain shield and is characterized by higher temperature less precipitation amount and lower relative humidity fig 2 when the typhoon approaches the sampling site supplementary fig s2 the precipitation δ18o values gradually become negative fig 2 during the second stage the δ18o values vary from 6 3 to 17 with a weighted mean of 12 fig 2 more than 80 of the δ18o values range from 9 to 17 and 30 of these values are even lower than the original δ18o value of water vapor in the clouds 13 siegenthaler 1979 only four relatively enriched δ18o values exceeded 8 1 for typhoon soudelor 2015 which may be attributed to the changes in meteorological conditions the temperature drops slightly as the δ18o value decreases and is maintained at 24 c to 26 c fig 2 precipitation during this stage is mainly influenced by the rain shield area of the typhoon the precipitation accounts for 70 90 of the total amount during each typhoon with an exception of typhoon dujuan 2015 where it sums up for only 30 moreover the average relative humidity is more than 90 during this stage fig 2 furthermore the δ18o values are significantly negative remaining relatively steady with smaller fluctuations as compared to the other two stages during the third stage the δ18o values vary from 3 3 to 10 7 with a weighted mean of 7 3 fig 2 as the typhoon moves longer distance away from our sampling site supplementary fig s2 the precipitation amount decreases and the mean δ18o value increases gradually with time however the mean δ18o value is still relatively lower than the first stage which may be related to the third stage precipitation that is partially influenced by the depletion of heavy isotope in the residual water vapor of the second stage overall the precipitation δ18o variability in each typhoon is characterized by three stages fig 2 these stage characteristics are independent of source regions the western north pacific and the south china sea our results indicate that change in moisture sources may exert a negligible influence on the δ18o previous studies suggest no significant difference in seawater δ18o and surface temperature between the tropical oceans legrande and schmidt 2006 cai et al 2017 he et al 2018a the consistent inverted u shaped pattern in δ18o variability despite different sources likely implies similar microphysical processes governing the general evolution of precipitation δ18o during typhoons in addition to the stage characteristics the variation in δ18o values in typhoon precipitation also shows a spatial structure as shown in fig 4 variation characteristics of the δ18o values correspond well with the distance between the typhoon center and the sampling site lawrence and gedzelman 1996 ohsawa and yusa 2000 gedzelman et al 2003 fudeyasu et al 2008 as the distance decreases the values of precipitation δ18o during eight typhoons gets more negative r 0 4 and p 0 01 and the most negative values generally occur within 20 km 300 km range typhoon haitang 2017 is an exception because some of the lowest δ18o values occur beyond 300 km fig 4 this typhoon originated in the northern part of the south china sea and its precipitation process got concentrated mainly after the landfall in the mainland fig 2 although the typhoon center is located away from fuzhou the sampling site continues to experience rain due to the effects of the residual water vapor therefore some of the most negative δ18o values for typhoon haitang 2017 occur beyond 300 km 5 3 rain shield effect of δ18o in typhoon precipitation based on the correlation analysis between δ18o and meteorological parameters it is observed that stable isotopes of typhoon precipitation are not controlled by local meteorological variables on the ground therefore we attempt to understand this phenomenon via two perspectives viz 1 oxygen isotopic fractionation and 2 the microphysical process of the typhoon system the classic rayleigh fractionation pattern of precipitation siegenthaler 1979 indicates that the initial δ18o value in sea water is 0 fig 5 a when sea water evaporates the lighter 16o is concentrated in the water vapor and thus the δ18o value of the water vapor in clouds is more negative using the fractionation factors 1 0793 and 1 00937 for δ2h and δ18o respectively of water evaporation from ocean surface under isotope equilibrium fractionation conditions at 25 c majoube 1971 the δ2h and δ18o values are calculated to be 79 and 9 4 respectively lawrence et al 2004 however the evaporation in a natural environment occurs mostly under non equilibrium fractionation conditions thus the actual δ18o value of water vapor is more negative than the δ18o value under equilibrium fractionation 13 fig 5a for instance craig and gordon 1965 found that the initial δ18o values of the water vapor over the north pacific ocean ranges from 10 5 to 14 when water vapor is transported to the mainland the heavier 18o will drop preferentially during the condensation and precipitation processes the earliest precipitation δ18o value is relatively enriched 3 fig 5a it is close to that of the ocean water and usually represents the first portion of condensate from undisturbed ocean moisture darling et al 2006 as water vapor moves inland and continues to form precipitation the residual water vapor gets increasingly depleted in 18o and the δ18o value of water vapor in clouds is more negative 15 fig 5a with the process of continuous precipitation stable isotopes are affected by temperature amount latitude and continental effects therefore the δ18o value of precipitation gradually becomes further negative 5 fig 5a this observation is consistent with a previous study by liu et al 2008 which suggests average annual precipitation δ18o value in southeast china at 5 to 7 southeast china is strongly affected by the western north pacific subtropical high during summer lin and wang 2016 thus the vapor content of the air is lower and the initial stage of precipitation tends to re evaporate muller et al 2015 when the periphery of rain shield approaches the sampling site re evaporation enriches the mean δ18o values of precipitation ranging from 5 to 7 fig 5b however the precipitation δ18o values during the second stage of typhoon events are extremely negative ranging from 6 3 to 17 fig 2 with a mean value is 12 fig 5b some of these values are slightly above that of the water vapor over the pacific ocean surface therefore it can t be interpreted by the classic rayleigh fractionation pattern we hypothesize that the extremely negative δ18o values during the second stage of typhoon precipitation are mainly caused by the rain shield effect typhoons include a highly efficient precipitation system as shown in fig 2 the precipitation accounts for 70 90 of the total amount and the average relative humidity is more than 90 during the second stage typhoons are characterized by intense large scale convective activity and strong cyclonic circulation specifically in the eye wall and spiral rain bands greatest wind speeds and heaviest rainfall always occur in these regions lutgens and tarbuck 2013 during the convective updraft water vapor rapidly condenses and raindrops fall in a saturated environment fig 6 the high condensation efficiency of rainstorms could lead to extremely negative precipitation δ18o values lawrence and gedzelman 1996 convective clouds not only have rotational and deep intense updrafts but tend to have relatively weak downdrafts houze 2010 as shown in fig 6 the isotopically depleted remnant vapor after the condensation reaches the sub cloud layer and towards the typhoon center along with the downdrafts typhoon is fueled by the latent heat when huge quantities of vapor condense lutgens and tarbuck 2013 therefore a large quantity of warm moist vapor is continuously supplied from the ocean surface fig 6 as the inward rush of surface vapor approaches the center of the typhoon it turns upward the isotopically depleted vapor is also taken up into the subsequent convective condensation process risi et al 2008 2010 kurita 2013 lekshmy et al 2014 munksgaard et al 2015 this successive convective condensation and precipitation cycles make the isotopic compositions of precipitation and vapor more depleted hence recycling of isotopically depleted vapor also plays an important role in the rain 18o depletion during the typhoon system in conclusion combination of large scale convection high condensation efficiency and recycling of isotopically depleted vapor in rain shield areas leading to very negative δ18o values during typhoon system as the typhoon makes landfall in the land the supply of ocean surface vapor is cut off lutgens and tarbuck 2013 as a consequence the recycling of isotopically depleted vapor ceases when the typhoon moves inland and forms precipitation even in some regions farther away from the landfall area the δ18o values also become increasingly negative fig 5b this result is consistent with the classic rayleigh fractionation pattern of precipitation the results of precipitation δ18o for typhoon nesat 2017 collected in fuzhou and sanming 150 km west of fuzhou supplementary fig s4 show that the δ18o values in fuzhou and sanming vary from 2 6 to 15 5 and from 8 to 17 9 respectively fig 7 and supplementary table s2 during the second stage in sanming the δ18o values vary from 15 7 to 17 9 and the weighted mean δ18o is 17 which is significantly lower than the weighted average δ18o value of 13 7 during the second stage of typhoon precipitation in fuzhou the mean δ18o values during the first and third stages in sanming also become more negative than those for fuzhou fig 7 as the typhoon moves inland preferable removal of heavy isotopes during the successive condensation causes a general shift towards depleted precipitation δ18o from the coastal fuzhou to the inland areas sanming fig 5b 6 conclusions this study presents the results of hourly stable isotope compositions δ2h and δ18o in precipitation collected from eight typhoons from 2013 to 2017 in fuzhou southeast china the δ2h and δ18o values of all typhoon precipitation samples vary greatly from 10 to 122 and from 2 6 to 17 respectively the most negative δ2h and δ18o values in typhoon precipitation are significantly lower than those of the monthly precipitation events the mwl of typhoon precipitation is presented as δ2h 7 41 δ18o 0 81 r2 0 96 n 220 and the slope and intercept are slightly smaller than those of the gmwl and the lmwl the analysis suggests significant re evaporation of precipitation during before and after typhoon landfall resulting in heavy isotope enrichment in typhoon precipitation this leads to the smaller slope and intercept of the mwl for typhoon precipitation compared to those of the gmwl and lmwl the characteristics of δ18o variability during the entire process of typhoon precipitation can be divided into three stages relatively enriched δ18o values occur in the first and third stages while significantly negative δ18o values occur in the second stage showing an inverted u shaped pattern southeast china is strongly affected by the western north pacific subtropical high during summer the positive δ18o values for typhoon precipitation during the first and third stages are governed by re evaporation there is no significant correlation between typhoon precipitation δ18o and meteorological parameters air temperature precipitation amount and relative humidity during the second stage this finding also demonstrates that the extremely negative δ18o values during the second stage are not controlled by local meteorological variables we hypothesize that the most negative δ18o values during the second stage are mainly caused by the rain shield effect that is combination of large scale convection high condensation efficiency and recycling of isotopically depleted vapor in rain shield areas leading to very negative δ18o values during typhoon system declaration of interest none acknowledgements this study was jointly supported

6718,stable isotope ratios δ2h and δ18o in precipitation not only show a certain response to climate change at different time scales but also have strong linkages to extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones hurricanes typhoons typhoon activity in the coastal region of southeast china is quite intense bringing huge amounts of moisture thus contributing to extreme rainfall in this region the existing isotope data in southeast china is available on a monthly or daily temporal resolution which is inadequate to study 1 2 day long typhoon rainfall events at a particular location in this study hourly rainfall δ2h and δ18o data are collected for eight typhoon events from 2013 to 2017 in fuzhou southeast china the total correlation between δ2h and δ18o is obtained as δ2h 7 41 δ18o 0 81 r2 0 96 n 220 all the eight typhoon events reveal a similar variability pattern in δ18o values which can be divided into three stages more positive δ18o values occur in the first and third stages while the second stage is dominated by most negative δ18o values exhibiting an inverted u shaped pattern the positive δ18o values during the first and third stages are governed by re evaporation the precipitation during the second stage has distinctly lower δ18o values than the weighted average δ18o of summer precipitation in fuzhou some of these values are slightly lower than those of the water vapor over the pacific ocean s surface no significant relationship is observed between precipitation δ18o and temperature as well as the amount of precipitation during the second stage we hypothesize that the significant 18o depletion is mainly caused by the rain shield effect which refers to combination of large scale convection high condensation efficiency and recycling of isotopically depleted vapor in rain shield areas leading to very negative δ18o values during typhoon system these findings suggest the use of stable isotope ratios as important tracers of typhoon water keywords typhoon rainfall stable isotope ratios southeast china rain shield effect 1 introduction as an important part of the global water cycle stable isotopes in modern precipitation contain rich climatic and environmental information e g araguás araguás et al 2000 xie et al 2011 ren et al 2017 stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes δ2h and δ18o in precipitation have been widely used in studies pertaining to the hydrological cycle and climatology e g tian et al 2007 yao et al 2013 brenčič et al 2015 srivastava et al 2015 since 1961 the international atomic energy agency iaea and the world meteorological organization wmo established the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip program to survey stable isotopes in worldwide precipitation the acquired data have greatly improved our knowledge of isotopic compositions in precipitation and their response to environmental changes e g gat 1996 bowen and wilkinson 2002 vuille et al 2005 a notable positive correlation between δ2h and δ18o is called meteoric water line mwl and can be observed in precipitations lakes and rivers around the world the global meteoric water line gmwl is given as δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 and plays an important role in the study of stable isotopes in precipitation araguás araguás et al 1998 tian et al 2001 zhou and li 2017 the apparent correlations between stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in precipitation and meteorological and geographical parameters are known as isotope effects and include the temperature amount altitude and latitude effects dansgaard 1964 among them the temperature effect and the amount effect are particularly important dansgaard 1964 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 baldini et al 2010 previous studies have found that change in the sources of water vapor also has an important impact on stable isotope ratios in precipitation hoffmann and heimann 1997 breitenbach et al 2010 peng et al 2010 chen and li 2018 considerable research has been conducted on stable isotope ratios in precipitation on monthly and daily basis in different regions of the world e g gammons et al 2006 liu et al 2010 stumpp et al 2014 zhang and wang 2016 however the precise relationship between stable isotopic compositions and meteorological parameters during extreme precipitation events remain controversial in some cases the variation of isotope compositions during the extreme rainfall event is also attributed to change in moisture sources xie et al 2011 li et al 2015 in general heavy precipitation caused by extreme weather such as torrential rain or tropical cyclones is categorized as an extreme precipitation event tropical cyclones are characterized by strong wind high intensity precipitation and a wide range of impacts zhang et al 2018 the stable isotope compositions of precipitation in tropical cyclones could be used as tracers of the storm structure dynamic evolution and its water and energy budgets lawrence et al 1982 2002 lawrence and gedzelman 1996 good et al 2014 munksgaard et al 2015 the mean δ18o values in hurricane precipitations are obviously lower than those of other tropical and summer precipitation systems and the isotope ratios decrease inward toward the center of the hurricane lawrence and gedzelman 1996 gedzelman et al 2003 lawrence et al 1998 explained that the low stable isotope ratios in hurricanes result from their high and deep clouds large size and longevity and the inward decrease is due to isotope exchange between precipitation and depleted vapor in the atmospheric boundary layer while studying the typhoon shanshan similar results were found by fudeyasu et al 2008 who attributed this low stable isotope ratio to the rainout effect ohsawa and yusa 2000 suggested that the stable isotope ratios decrease with the reduction of distance between the typhoon and observation site and this phenomenon is related to the isotopic fractionation of water vapor therefore a clear understanding of the short term isotopic variability of tropical cyclones is fundamental in interpreting precipitation isotopes in tropical and subtropical regions the coastal area of south china is especially vulnerable to landfalling typhoons from the western north pacific zhang et al 2009 2011 typhoons bring abundant water vapor from the ocean and provide favorable environments for the initiation of extreme precipitation in the coastal and landward regions of china zhang et al 2018 typhoon activity in southeast china is very intense during summer and autumn one of the regions with the largest number of landfalling typhoons in china is fujian province zhang et al 2009 from may 2000 to october 2017 fujian province experienced 141 typhoons of which 42 made landfall owing to the changes in the environment and the underlying surface the structure path and intensity of typhoons change significantly during the process of moving and making landfall on the mainland chen et al 2010 thus understanding this variability and the fundamental causes behind it are important to interpret the hydrological cycle during typhoon events stable isotopes in precipitation have been broadly utilized in hydrological and meteorological studies hoefs 2015 he et al 2018a thus clarifying the variations in the characteristics of typhoon precipitation δ18o and the influencing factors during its occurrence are of great significance the existing monthly precipitation isotopic data in southern china are presented by gnip while daily records are generated by xie et al 2011 and chen et al 2016 since the impact of typhoon precipitation lasts for only 1 2 days at a particular location the existing stable isotope data is inadequate for intra event comparison in this study we report hourly precipitation δ2h and δ18o collected during eight typhoon events from 2013 to 2017 in fuzhou southeast china the major objectives are 1 to investigate the intra event variability of precipitation stable isotopes during typhoon events 2 to examine the influence of meteorological parameters at the sampling site on precipitation stable isotopes and 3 to explore the factors impacting significant 18o depletion in the rain during typhoon events 2 sampling site the precipitation samples were collected at the top of a 20 m high building that hosts the school of geographical sciences in fujian normal university 26 05 n 119 30 e 31 m a s

climate it has hot and rainy summers and warm and dry winters instrumental meteorological data from the fuzhou meteorological station 1981 2010 26 08 n 119 28 e 84 m a s l shows that the average annual temperature is 20 c and the average annual precipitation is 1390 mm the monthly average maximum and minimum temperature is 29 c and 11 c occurring in july and january respectively more than 80 of average annual precipitation is concentrated in the rainy season from march to september supplementary fig s1 typhoon activities in the area mainly occur from june to september jjas with 1 2 typhoons affect or make landfall every year the amount of precipitation during typhoon usually account for 50 80 of the monthly precipitation during summer monsoon jjas and 6 17 of the annual precipitation 3 materials and methods from 2013 to 2017 eight typhoon events had a significant impact on fuzhou fig 1 among them seven typhoons originated from the western north pacific and the remaining one originated from the south china sea fig 1 and table 1 during their respective development four of them reached the lifetime maximum intensity of a super typhoon two others were classified as typhoon while the remaining two typhoons were categorized as strong typhoon and tropical storm table 1 and supplementary table s1 the total accumulated precipitation during each of these typhoons range from 50 mm to 300 mm during the entire sampling period table 1 more details about eight typhoons are given in supplementary text s1 owing to changes in precipitation amounts the samples of typhoon precipitation were collected at different time intervals 0 5 h 2 h a clean 2 l glass beaker was used to collect the typhoon precipitation the beaker was placed on a shelf about 1 5 m above ground and packed with tinfoil a funnel was placed on top of the beaker to prevent evaporation once the sampling was completed each sample was immediately poured into 50 ml and 2 ml polypropylene colorless plastic bottles with no air headspace these bottles were sealed with parafilm sealing membrane to prevent evaporation and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c to avoid isotopic fractionation until stable isotopic analysis could be performed a total of 220 samples were collected during the 8 typhoons stable isotope compositions δ2h and δ18o of the samples were measured using lgr dlt 100

2017 together with gnip based monthly precipitation δ2h and δ18o from 1985 to 1992 are presented in table 1 the δ2h and δ18o values of all typhoon precipitation samples vary greatly from 10 to 122 and from 2 6 to 17 respectively table 1 and supplementary table s2 the gnip based monthly precipitation δ2h and δ18o ranges from 1 to 104 7 and from 0 92 to 14 16 respectively table 1 both δ2h and δ18o of all typhoon events exhibit larger amplitude than monthly precipitation gnip based weighted mean precipitation δ18o value during summer jjas between 1985 and 1992 is 8 1 table 1 marking this δ18o 8 1 as the background value the characteristics of typhoon precipitation δ18o over the entire events are divided into three stages figs 2 and s2 the δ18o values are generally positive during the first stage 2 6 to 9 9 followed by a significant decrease during the second stage 6 3 to 17 while the third stage is marked with a gradual increase 3 3 to 10 7 during the first and third stages the relatively enriched δ18o values show wide fluctuations while the excessively negative δ18o values during the second stage are relatively steady the variation in δ18o in the process of typhoon precipitation shows an inverted u shaped pattern fig 2 4 2 inter event variability significant variation in δ2h and δ18o values of the precipitation is also observed within each typhoon event typhoon dujuan 2015 and typhoon nesat 2017 reveals the largest range for δ2h 17 to 110 and δ18o 2 6 to 15 5 respectively however typhoon nesat 2017 show the smallest range for δ2h 37 to 102 while typhoon matmo 2014 and typhoon soudelor 2015 show the smallest range for δ18o 7 2 to 15 4 and 3 2 to 11 4 respectively table 1 nevertheless there is a minimal difference in the lowest precipitation δ2h and δ18o values between the typhoon events which ranges from 102 to 122 and 13 6 to 17 respectively table 1 although typhoon soudelor 2015 is an exception as it shows relatively enriched values of δ2h and δ18o 85 and 11 4 respectively the weighted mean δ2h and δ18o values during typhoon events and monthly precipitation also vary considerably typhoon dujuan 2015 and typhoon trami 2013 show the largest and smallest weighted mean values for both δ2h 53 and 101 and δ18o 7 4 and 13 2 respectively gnip based δ2h and δ18o values during summer jjas ranges from 14 1 to 84 and from 0 92 to 11 78 respectively and the weighted mean values are 58 7 and 8 1 respectively table 1 the most negative δ2h and δ18o values in typhoon precipitation are significantly lower than those of the monthly precipitation events in fuzhou which is probably because the gnip datasets are weighed by monthly average precipitation to provide a comprehensive picture the δ18o values of a total of 137 typhoon precipitation samples 62 of the total number of typhoon precipitation samples are lower than 8 1 4 3 correlation analysis between stable isotopes and meteorological parameters correlations between local meteorological parameters air temperature precipitation amount and relative humidity and δ18o of typhoon precipitation for different time periods are given in table 2 during the entire sampling period the first and third stages there is a weak positive correlation between temperature and δ18o and a weak negative correlation between relative humidity and δ18o table 2 the correlation coefficient r are 0 33 p 0 01 n 171 0 30 p 0 01 n 85 between δ18o and temperature and 0 33 p 0 01 n 171 0 24 p 0 05 n 85 between δ18o and relative humidity during the entire period and the first and third stages respectively there is no apparent correlation between meteorological parameters and precipitation δ18o for the second stage table 2 the correlations between δ18o and meteorological parameters suggest that stable isotopes of typhoon precipitation are not controlled by local meteorological variables on the ground the temperature and relative humidity recorded by the rain gauge or meteorological station can only partially represent the atmospheric conditions below the clouds he et al 2018b however variability in these data can also provide some insights to explain the isotopic evolution pattern e g higher temperature and lower relative humidity may imply a higher re evaporation 4 4 deuterium excess d excess deuterium excess d excess defined as d δ2h 8 δ18o is generally controlled by evaporative conditions combining sea surface temperature humidity and wind speed dansgaard 1964 merlivat and jouzel 1979 benetti et al 2014 d excess values of typhoon precipitation also observed to vary greatly through time from 21 9 to 25 5 fig s3 more than 80 of the total number of typhoon precipitation samples shows d excess value of less than 10 the mean d excess value is 6 3 unlike δ18o d excess values exhibit irregular variability with no inverted u shaped variability with the raindrops fall below the cloud it can be affected by sub cloud evaporation which increases 18o and decreases deuterium excess hollins et al 2018 there is an inverse relationship existing between δ18o and d excess values r 0 4 p 0 01 suggesting the occurrence of re evaporation to some extent of raindrops during typhoon events he et al 2018b 5 discussion 5 1 correlation between δ2h and δ18o in typhoon precipitation the mwl of typhoon precipitation in fuzhou is presented as δ2h 7 41 δ18o 0 81 r2 0 96 n 220 both the slope and intercept are slightly smaller than those of the gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 and the lmwl δ2h 8 84 δ18o 16 94 r2 0 96 n 48 fig 3 the lmwl is established from the δ2h and δ18o values of fuzhou station as per gnip data from january 1988 to december 1991 previous studies suggest that the degree of precipitation re evaporation is likely associated with the relative humidity conditions in different environments lee and fung 2008 he et al 2018b before and after typhoon landfall the relative humidity is low ranging from 63 to 95 more than 50 of these values are lower than 90 the δ18o values of typhoon precipitation are relatively enriched 8 and appears in the lower right of the gmwl and lmwl plots fig 3 previously analysis suggests that southeast china is strongly affected by the western north pacific subtropical high in summer lin and wang 2016 water vapor evaporates to some extent before and after typhoon landfall which usually results in heavy isotope enrichment of typhoon precipitation and the relatively enriched precipitation δ18o values due to the isotopic non equilibrium fractionation the rain shield area of a typhoon affects the sampling site increasing relative humidity to 100 the δ18o values of typhoon precipitation are significantly negative 8 and plot closely to the gmwl and the lmwl fig 3 which indicates very weak re evaporation of precipitation during this period the effect of re evaporation before and after typhoon landfall leads to smaller slope and intercept of the mwl of typhoon precipitation in fuzhou compared to the corresponding values of the gmwl and lmwl 5 2 stage characteristics of δ18o the first stage shows relatively enriched δ18o values ranging from 2 6 to 9 9 with a weighted mean of 6 5 fig 2 during a typhoon re evaporation has the greatest impact at the initial stage of precipitation as the vapor content in the air is lower muller et al 2015 precipitation during this stage is mainly influenced by the water vapor in the periphery of rain shield and is characterized by higher temperature less precipitation amount and lower relative humidity fig 2 when the typhoon approaches the sampling site supplementary fig s2 the precipitation δ18o values gradually become negative fig 2 during the second stage the δ18o values vary from 6 3 to 17 with a weighted mean of 12 fig 2 more than 80 of the δ18o values range from 9 to 17 and 30 of these values are even lower than the original δ18o value of water vapor in the clouds 13 siegenthaler 1979 only four relatively enriched δ18o values exceeded 8 1 for typhoon soudelor 2015 which may be attributed to the changes in meteorological conditions the temperature drops slightly as the δ18o value decreases and is maintained at 24 c to 26 c fig 2 precipitation during this stage is mainly influenced by the rain shield area of the typhoon the precipitation accounts for 70 90 of the total amount during each typhoon with an exception of typhoon dujuan 2015 where it sums up for only 30 moreover the average relative humidity is more than 90 during this stage fig 2 furthermore the δ18o values are significantly negative remaining relatively steady with smaller fluctuations as compared to the other two stages during the third stage the δ18o values vary from 3 3 to 10 7 with a weighted mean of 7 3 fig 2 as the typhoon moves longer distance away from our sampling site supplementary fig s2 the precipitation amount decreases and the mean δ18o value increases gradually with time however the mean δ18o value is still relatively lower than the first stage which may be related to the third stage precipitation that is partially influenced by the depletion of heavy isotope in the residual water vapor of the second stage overall the precipitation δ18o variability in each typhoon is characterized by three stages fig 2 these stage characteristics are independent of source regions the western north pacific and the south china sea our results indicate that change in moisture sources may exert a negligible influence on the δ18o previous studies suggest no significant difference in seawater δ18o and surface temperature between the tropical oceans legrande and schmidt 2006 cai et al 2017 he et al 2018a the consistent inverted u shaped pattern in δ18o variability despite different sources likely implies similar microphysical processes governing the general evolution of precipitation δ18o during typhoons in addition to the stage characteristics the variation in δ18o values in typhoon precipitation also shows a spatial structure as shown in fig 4 variation characteristics of the δ18o values correspond well with the distance between the typhoon center and the sampling site lawrence and gedzelman 1996 ohsawa and yusa 2000 gedzelman et al 2003 fudeyasu et al 2008 as the distance decreases the values of precipitation δ18o during eight typhoons gets more negative r 0 4 and p 0 01 and the most negative values generally occur within 20 km 300 km range typhoon haitang 2017 is an exception because some of the lowest δ18o values occur beyond 300 km fig 4 this typhoon originated in the northern part of the south china sea and its precipitation process got concentrated mainly after the landfall in the mainland fig 2 although the typhoon center is located away from fuzhou the sampling site continues to experience rain due to the effects of the residual water vapor therefore some of the most negative δ18o values for typhoon haitang 2017 occur beyond 300 km 5 3 rain shield effect of δ18o in typhoon precipitation based on the correlation analysis between δ18o and meteorological parameters it is observed that stable isotopes of typhoon precipitation are not controlled by local meteorological variables on the ground therefore we attempt to understand this phenomenon via two perspectives viz 1 oxygen isotopic fractionation and 2 the microphysical process of the typhoon system the classic rayleigh fractionation pattern of precipitation siegenthaler 1979 indicates that the initial δ18o value in sea water is 0 fig 5 a when sea water evaporates the lighter 16o is concentrated in the water vapor and thus the δ18o value of the water vapor in clouds is more negative using the fractionation factors 1 0793 and 1 00937 for δ2h and δ18o respectively of water evaporation from ocean surface under isotope equilibrium fractionation conditions at 25 c majoube 1971 the δ2h and δ18o values are calculated to be 79 and 9 4 respectively lawrence et al 2004 however the evaporation in a natural environment occurs mostly under non equilibrium fractionation conditions thus the actual δ18o value of water vapor is more negative than the δ18o value under equilibrium fractionation 13 fig 5a for instance craig and gordon 1965 found that the initial δ18o values of the water vapor over the north pacific ocean ranges from 10 5 to 14 when water vapor is transported to the mainland the heavier 18o will drop preferentially during the condensation and precipitation processes the earliest precipitation δ18o value is relatively enriched 3 fig 5a it is close to that of the ocean water and usually represents the first portion of condensate from undisturbed ocean moisture darling et al 2006 as water vapor moves inland and continues to form precipitation the residual water vapor gets increasingly depleted in 18o and the δ18o value of water vapor in clouds is more negative 15 fig 5a with the process of continuous precipitation stable isotopes are affected by temperature amount latitude and continental effects therefore the δ18o value of precipitation gradually becomes further negative 5 fig 5a this observation is consistent with a previous study by liu et al 2008 which suggests average annual precipitation δ18o value in southeast china at 5 to 7 southeast china is strongly affected by the western north pacific subtropical high during summer lin and wang 2016 thus the vapor content of the air is lower and the initial stage of precipitation tends to re evaporate muller et al 2015 when the periphery of rain shield approaches the sampling site re evaporation enriches the mean δ18o values of precipitation ranging from 5 to 7 fig 5b however the precipitation δ18o values during the second stage of typhoon events are extremely negative ranging from 6 3 to 17 fig 2 with a mean value is 12 fig 5b some of these values are slightly above that of the water vapor over the pacific ocean surface therefore it can t be interpreted by the classic rayleigh fractionation pattern we hypothesize that the extremely negative δ18o values during the second stage of typhoon precipitation are mainly caused by the rain shield effect typhoons include a highly efficient precipitation system as shown in fig 2 the precipitation accounts for 70 90 of the total amount and the average relative humidity is more than 90 during the second stage typhoons are characterized by intense large scale convective activity and strong cyclonic circulation specifically in the eye wall and spiral rain bands greatest wind speeds and heaviest rainfall always occur in these regions lutgens and tarbuck 2013 during the convective updraft water vapor rapidly condenses and raindrops fall in a saturated environment fig 6 the high condensation efficiency of rainstorms could lead to extremely negative precipitation δ18o values lawrence and gedzelman 1996 convective clouds not only have rotational and deep intense updrafts but tend to have relatively weak downdrafts houze 2010 as shown in fig 6 the isotopically depleted remnant vapor after the condensation reaches the sub cloud layer and towards the typhoon center along with the downdrafts typhoon is fueled by the latent heat when huge quantities of vapor condense lutgens and tarbuck 2013 therefore a large quantity of warm moist vapor is continuously supplied from the ocean surface fig 6 as the inward rush of surface vapor approaches the center of the typhoon it turns upward the isotopically depleted vapor is also taken up into the subsequent convective condensation process risi et al 2008 2010 kurita 2013 lekshmy et al 2014 munksgaard et al 2015 this successive convective condensation and precipitation cycles make the isotopic compositions of precipitation and vapor more depleted hence recycling of isotopically depleted vapor also plays an important role in the rain 18o depletion during the typhoon system in conclusion combination of large scale convection high condensation efficiency and recycling of isotopically depleted vapor in rain shield areas leading to very negative δ18o values during typhoon system as the typhoon makes landfall in the land the supply of ocean surface vapor is cut off lutgens and tarbuck 2013 as a consequence the recycling of isotopically depleted vapor ceases when the typhoon moves inland and forms precipitation even in some regions farther away from the landfall area the δ18o values also become increasingly negative fig 5b this result is consistent with the classic rayleigh fractionation pattern of precipitation the results of precipitation δ18o for typhoon nesat 2017 collected in fuzhou and sanming 150 km west of fuzhou supplementary fig s4 show that the δ18o values in fuzhou and sanming vary from 2 6 to 15 5 and from 8 to 17 9 respectively fig 7 and supplementary table s2 during the second stage in sanming the δ18o values vary from 15 7 to 17 9 and the weighted mean δ18o is 17 which is significantly lower than the weighted average δ18o value of 13 7 during the second stage of typhoon precipitation in fuzhou the mean δ18o values during the first and third stages in sanming also become more negative than those for fuzhou fig 7 as the typhoon moves inland preferable removal of heavy isotopes during the successive condensation causes a general shift towards depleted precipitation δ18o from the coastal fuzhou to the inland areas sanming fig 5b 6 conclusions this study presents the results of hourly stable isotope compositions δ2h and δ18o in precipitation collected from eight typhoons from 2013 to 2017 in fuzhou southeast china the δ2h and δ18o values of all typhoon precipitation samples vary greatly from 10 to 122 and from 2 6 to 17 respectively the most negative δ2h and δ18o values in typhoon precipitation are significantly lower than those of the monthly precipitation events the mwl of typhoon precipitation is presented as δ2h 7 41 δ18o 0 81 r2 0 96 n 220 and the slope and intercept are slightly smaller than those of the gmwl and the lmwl the analysis suggests significant re evaporation of precipitation during before and after typhoon landfall resulting in heavy isotope enrichment in typhoon precipitation this leads to the smaller slope and intercept of the mwl for typhoon precipitation compared to those of the gmwl and lmwl the characteristics of δ18o variability during the entire process of typhoon precipitation can be divided into three stages relatively enriched δ18o values occur in the first and third stages while significantly negative δ18o values occur in the second stage showing an inverted u shaped pattern southeast china is strongly affected by the western north pacific subtropical high during summer the positive δ18o values for typhoon precipitation during the first and third stages are governed by re evaporation there is no significant correlation between typhoon precipitation δ18o and meteorological parameters air temperature precipitation amount and relative humidity during the second stage this finding also demonstrates that the extremely negative δ18o values during the second stage are not controlled by local meteorological variables we hypothesize that the most negative δ18o values during the second stage are mainly caused by the rain shield effect that is combination of large scale convection high condensation efficiency and recycling of isotopically depleted vapor in rain shield areas leading to very negative δ18o values during typhoon system declaration of interest none acknowledgements this study was jointly supported

6719,precipitation is a fundamental forcing variable in land surface modeling controlling several hydrological and biogeochemical processes e g runoff carbon cycling evaporation transpiration groundwater recharge and soil moisture however precipitation estimates from rain gauges ground based radars satellite sensors and numerical models are affected by significant uncertainties which can be amplified when exposed to highly non linear land model physics this work tests the hypothesis that precipitation data from different sources can be optimally merged to minimize the hydrologic response error in surface soil moisture simulations and maximize their correlation with ground observations multi objective optimization problem this hypothesis is tested by merging three precipitation products one satellite product a ground based dataset and model base estimates that force a land surface model trained to minimize soil moisture anomalies a monte carlo based algorithm is developed to generate weights to linearly combine these precipitation datasets optimal combinations of weights are identified by minimizing the errors and maximizing the correlation between the model simulated soil moisture and the satellite based smos soil moisture product the proposed methodology has been tested over oklahoma where high quality high resolution independent ground based soil moisture observations are available for validation purposes results show that there exist optimal combinations of these precipitation datasets that provide smaller errors and larger correlation coefficients between modeled soil moisture estimates and ground based data with respect to forcing the land surface model with single precipitation datasets specifically combining three precipitation products from different sources provides the largest correlation coefficient and the lowest root mean square error at several locations across oklahoma 1 introduction precipitation is the most influential meteorological forcing variable for land surface modeling providing moisture for processes such as runoff biogeochemical cycling evaporation transpiration groundwater recharge and soil moisture knowledge of the precipitation characteristics and patterns is crucial for understanding the complicated interactions among small and large scale components within the water and energy cycles the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation significantly impacts land surface state variables and fluxes gottschalck et al 2005 accurate precipitation information at fine space and time scales has been shown to improve our ability to simulate land surface hydrological processes and states including extreme events such as floods and droughts scofield and kuligowski 2003 however different types of precipitation estimates ground based estimates from rain gauges weather radars space based estimates from satellite sensors and numerical model based estimates might have variable accuracy and thus distinct hydrological utility in different regions maggioni and massari 2018 rain gauges are the only direct approach to measure precipitation although they provide high temporal resolutions obtaining a spatially representative estimate requires a very dense network kidd et al 2012 weather radars overcome this issue but their observational accuracy is affected by rain path attenuation lack of uniqueness in the reflectivity to rain rate relationship calibration issues contamination by ground returns sub resolution precipitation variability and complex terrain effects borga et al 2000 krajewski et al 2006 marzano et al 2004 both rain gauges and radars require considerable financial and technological investment for operational and maintenance cost satellite precipitation products are available globally and are derived from a range of satellite sensor observations most algorithms combine infrared ir imagery with passive microwave pmw observations e g huffman et al 2007 2014 joyce et al 2004 on one hand ir images are valuable because heavier rainfall is usually associated with larger and taller clouds with colder tops on the other hand emissions from raindrops cause an increase in the pmw radiation and the scattering due to precipitating ice particles produces a decrease in pmw radiation the blending of complementary information from ir radiances and pmw observations has been proven successful in rainfall estimation turk et al 1999 nevertheless satellite estimates can be affected by detection uncertainties biases and random errors which depend on the accuracy of the remote sensor retrieval error and the lack of continuity in the coverage by low earth orbiting satellites sampling error bell et al 2000 the performance of satellite precipitation products is influenced by seasonal precipitation patterns storm type and background surface ebert et al 2007 maggioni et al 2016 oliveira et al 2016 2018 numerical weather prediction nwp models represent a valid alternative to estimate global precipitation nwps are more accurate when predicting large scale organized systems than more localized events whose spatial and temporal variability cannot be explicitly captured by the model resolution moreover model re analysis precipitation products are the only available choice above 60 latitude and a valuable option above 35 latitude where they ingest a high number of ground observations in summary it is difficult to determine which precipitation product is optimal for a certain region and a certain season due to inconsistency among different datasets moreover obtaining precipitation information at the required accuracy level for hydrological applications and water resources management still remains a challenge there have been a number of attempts to improve the accuracy of precipitation products by merging surface gauge measurements with satellite based estimates smith et al 2006 huffman et al 2007 tian et al 2010 tobin and bennett 2010 for instance the recently developed multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep beck et al 2017 is a global precipitation dataset that spans from 1979 to 2016 and has a 0 1 3 hourly spatial temporal resolution mswep not only blends information from gauge and satellites but also with model reanalysis and covers the entire globe including the oceans similarly other attempts successfully used high resolution simulations from models like the weather research and forecasting model wrf for removing satellite rainfall biases in mountainous areas using a probability density function matching approach zhang et al 2013 2016 nikolopoulos et al 2015 more recently bhuiyan et al 2018 proposed the use of a nonparametric tree based quantile regression forest model to merge satellite and re analysis precipitation products with an air temperature dataset satellite soil moisture data and a terrain elevation dataset the merged product was used to force a hydrological model across the iberian peninsula and it was shown to reduce both systematic and random errors in streamflow simulations with respect to the individual precipitation products most merging techniques have been calibrated and evaluated to a precipitation ground reference e g rain gauge observations but only a few studies calibrated the merging algorithm based on the hydrological response for instance chiang et al 2007 used the recurrent neural network method to merge satellite and rain gauge estimates to improve the accuracy of streamflow simulations for flash flooding modeling yilmaz et al 2010 developed a merging method for multiple types of precipitation estimates by minimizing land surface modeling errors using the downhill simplex method their analyses have indicated that results from the optimally merged precipitation product present lower errors in land surface states and fluxes such as evapotranspiration discharge and skin temperature than do simulation results obtained by forcing the model using each precipitation product individually the main objective of this work is to develop an optimal precipitation dataset that combines the advantages of high resolution products for improving land surface modeling skills we focused here on improving a key land surface state soil moisture that determines the critical surface fluxes and water balance surface soil moisture controls the partitioning of available energy incident on the land surface and therefore it is a fundamental variable in the water cycle that impacts local weather such as cloud coverage and precipitation and hydrological parameters such as runoff and evapotranspiration betts and ball 1998 our hypothesis is that a combination of precipitation data from different sources optimized to minimize the hydrologic response error soil moisture runoff evapotranspiration etc has the potential to improve land surface model forecast skills ultimately this solution will optimally merge a wide range of precipitation information from satellites radars gauges and models trained to minimize errors in land model evaporation runoff and soil moisture response resulting in coupled forecast improvements in convection clouds precipitation boundary layer processes and atmospheric circulation this will be possible if using the optimized land surface variables fluxes to feed back into atmospheric models for improved meteorological forecasts the hypothesis is tested here by merging three precipitation products from satellite ground based and models trained to minimize satellite soil moisture i e smos anomalies we conducted an uncoupled demonstration over oklahoma where a high quality high resolution independent reference of ground based soil moisture observations is available for validating the proposed methodology the proposed methodology has been examined over oklahoma where high quality high resolution independent ground based soil moisture observations are available for validation purposes the next section describes all precipitation and soil moisture datasets the land surface model and the proposed methodological approach results are presented and discussed in section 3 whereas section 4 summarized the main conclusions highlights the limitations of this work and suggests future research directions 2 methodology this work proposes a novel method to improve land surface model skills by optimally merging precipitation estimates from different data sources to minimize the land surface simulation errors fig 1 specifically three precipitation estimates from satellite ground observations and models are merged to optimize surface soil moisture model estimates the experiment is conducted over oklahoma during 2014 using the community noah land surface model that integrates atmospheric forcings with land and vegetation parameters into a state of art land surface modeling system precipitation and soil moisture datasets summarized in table 1 the noah land surface model and the proposed approach adopted to achieve the above objectives are described next 2 1 precipitation dataset firstly the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center morphing cmorph joyce et al 2004 joyce and xie 2011 product was chosen as the satellite based product in this study the cmorph algorithm integrates infrared observations from geostationary satellites with passive microwave data in two steps 1 cloud system advections vectors from 30 minute intervals are generated and 2 at each location a time weighted linear interpolation is performed at consecutive times between the microwave sensor overpasses cmorph is available every half hour on a grid with a spacing of 8 km secondly a ground based precipitation estimate was considered the multi institutional north american land data assimilation system nldas provides retrospective and real time atmospheric forcing estimates to support land surface modeling hourly precipitation data are derived from a combination of 1 daily national center for environmental prediction climate prediction center cpc gauge based precipitation analyses and 2 hourly national weather service doppler radar based wsr 88d precipitation data which are used to temporally disaggregate the daily cpc analyses cosgrove et al 2003 this process exploits the accuracy of the rain gauge observations and the temporal and spatial resolution of a radar based dataset and it is considered to be one of the highest quality precipitation products over conus thirdly the model based precipitation estimates are obtained from the north american mesoscale forecast system nam project rogers et al 2009 the nam model is run four times daily and consists of two components the noaa environmental modeling system nems version of the non hydrostatic multi scale model in b grid nmmb and the ncep regional grid point statistical interpolation gsi analysis the nam model is initialized with a 12 h run of the nam data assimilation system which runs a sequence of four gsi analyses and 3 h nems nmmb forecasts using all available observations to provide a first guess to the nam analysis the ncep high resolution window forecast system hiresw consists of daily runs of the nems non hydrostatic multiscale model on b grid and the ncar advanced research wrf arw at 3 4 km resolution hereinafter we will refer to nam as to indicate the nam precipitation dataset maps of 2014 means and standard deviations of the three precipitation products are shown in fig 2 oklahoma is characterized by a wetter area in the southeastern region with a drying gradient moving towards the panhandle the yearly precipitation variability is low across the study region with higher standard deviations in the wetter area the spatial distribution of rainfall is similar in the three dataset but on average nam shows higher rainfall and higher variability compared to cmorph and nldas particularly in the wetter southeastern region the differences in the three datasets prove the inherent different information that each one of them provides 2 2 soil moisture dataset the oklahoma mesonet is an observational network of 115 meteorological stations across oklahoma that collects archives and quality controls atmospheric surface and soil data in real time since 1994 brock et al 1995 although several variables are monitored at these stations only soil moisture measurements are used here soil moisture soil water potential is recorded at four depths 5 25 60 and 75 cm every 30 min the high quality of this dataset has been proven in several applications spanning from numerical weather predictions to fire monitoring carlson and burgan 2003 and estimation of downward longwave radiation sridhar and elliott 2002 the mesonet stations used in this study are highlighted in fig 3 this ground based soil moisture dataset is used as a benchmark for comparisons with model simulated soil moisture to evaluate the framework developed in this study however the coverage of soil moisture ground observations is extremely limited satellite observations of microwave brightness temperature and backscatter can provide an estimate of soil moisture at large scales two recent satellite missions have the goal of measuring surface soil moisture globally the nasa soil moisture active passive smap mission entekhabi et al 2010 launched on january 31st 2015 measures land surface brightness temperature providing information on surface soil moisture top 5 cm of the soil column the usefulness of the smap based soil moisture product is limited by its course resolutions 36 km the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2010 is a european space agency esa satellite launched in 2009 with the goal of monitoring surface soil moisture with an accuracy of 4 every three days the calibration of the smos retrieval algorithm is based on in situ experiments and modeling activities that do not include the mesonet network observations a study by kerr et al 2012 compared area averaged smos soil moisture with independent ground based soil moisture in the little washita watershed in oklahoma and found a good agreement between the two the smos soil moisture product is used in this work at its native resolution of 25 km as the reference to minimize the error in the model simulations of soil moisture the choice of a satellite based product as reference is due to its global availability making the proposed methodology applicable anywhere around the world maps of the 2014 mean and standard deviation of this product are shown in fig 3 a wetter area is observed in the eastern part of oklahoma which also presents the larger variability higher standard deviation this is consistent with the precipitation spatial distributions presented in fig 2 for the three rainfall products 2 3 the noah model the noah land surface model noah lsm version 2 7 1 ek et al 2003 in one dimension sponsored by the noaa office of global programs ogp is adopted in this study noah lsm was developed by the national centers for environmental prediction ncep oregon state university osu the air force and the hydrology research laboratory at the national weather service noah lsm is updated with more advanced land physics compared to its ancestor oregon state university osu lsm including four soil layers snowpack and frozen soil physics koren et al 1999 as well as snow cover weighted surface fluxes among others it has been implemented in operational weather and climate models because of its moderate complexity and computational efficiency the meteorological forcing used for noah lsm are from phase 2 of the north american land data assimilation system phase 2 nldas 2 which has been improved over the previous version of nldas cosgrove et al 2003 the non precipitation land surface forcing fields for nldas 2 are derived from the ncep north american regional reanalysis narr mesinger et al 2006 while nldas used the eta data assimilation system edas rogers et al 1996 nldas 2 has a spatial resolution of 1 8 and temporal resolution hourly for the period of 1979 present also the parameterization used for vegetation type leaf area index lai soil type and elevation in noah lsm is the one from the nldas dataset 2 4 the experimental approach all precipitation and soil moisture products are rescaled and homogenized to the noah lsm spatial and temporal and resolution of 0 125 1 h for the year of 2014 then the model is forced with each individual precipitation dataset a combination of two of them and a combination of all three products to obtain surface soil moisture simulations precipitation products are linearly combined using a simple weighted average weights are randomly generated through monte carlo mc simulations mc techniques are based on the idea of using randomness to solve problems that are difficult to solve analytically like highly non linear differential equations and obtain numerical results thanks to repeated random sampling a mc approach is used to generate 3000 different combinations of weights of the precipitation products to force noah lsm first weights are only applied to single precipitation products i e weights equal to zero are assigned to the other two products which corresponds to assuming that there exists a bias in the dataset and correcting for it then a combination of two products is considered i e a weight equal to zero is assigned to one out of the three products and finally weights are applied to a combination of all three products fig 4 only positive weights are considered in this study as precipitation products are firstly tested individually with their corresponding weights and only secondarily in combination with other products in the first case negative weights would translate into negative precipitation and have not therefore used for the sake of consistency moreover weights are sampled independently for each grid point so that the same exact procedure could be applied to any other region since weights are not region dependent the performance of the merged precipitation estimates is then assessed in terms of two criteria minimum root mean square error rmse and maximum correlation coefficient cc between the model simulated soil moisture and the reference smos soil moisture product however the weight combination that minimizes the rmse does not necessarily maximize the cc and researchers and or end users may be more inclined to use one criterion versus the other depending on the research and or operational application therefore we are looking at a multiple criteria decision making problem where two objective functions are optimized simultaneously the pareto efficiency definition is used to identify the optimal combination of weights specifically a combination of weights is considered optimal or efficient or non dominated if there exist no other weight combination that improves one criterion e g rmse without deteriorating the other criterion e g cc the pareto frontier pf is the set of all pareto efficient points marler and arora 2004 this concept was introduced in economics by vilfredo pareto 1848 1923 but it has further expanded to several other fields such as engineering and science rubinstein and osborne 1994 the same framework could be easily applied to other or more criteria building the pf is a purely mathematical process in which the decision maker dm does not intervene however the question is how to choose one weight combination from all the points that belong to the pareto frontier one option would be to either minimize the rmse or to maximize the correlation depending on the dm s interests which would reduce the problem to a simple single criterion decision another viable alternative is the utopia point u method makowski 2010 according to this technique the dm picks the point on the pf that minimizes the distance from u which is the point in the objective space that minimizes or maximizes all the objectives all these three approaches minimum rmse maximum correlation and closer point to u are considered and investigated in the next section 3 results and discussion the performance of noah lsm forced with 3000 mc generated combinations of weights for the three different precipitation products is initially assessed over a single grid point point p1 in fig 3 this study considers weights ranging between 0 and 1 as a preliminary analysis shown in fig 5 demonstrated that increasing weights beyond 1 would not improve surface soil moisture simulations in terms of rmse which increases if weights greater than 1 are applied to the three precipitation products and cc which drops if weights greater than 1 are applied to cmorph and nldas whereas for nam it is maximized if a weight of 2 is applied since no a priori knowledge on the bias in the precipitation products is assumed the sum of the weights is not constrained to any value the 3 d plots in fig 6 show that there is no single combination of weights of the precipitation products that optimizes both criteria but rather a region in the weight space that maximizes cc and minimizes rmse this proves that our problem is a two objective or two criterion problem for p1 rmse values range between 0 05 m3 m3 and 0 2 m3 m3 whereas cc values range between 0 43 and 0 68 showing overall satisfactory performance of noah lsm in modeling surface soil moisture at this location the pareto frontiers are then constructed using the two objective functions defined above one that minimizes the rmse and the other that maximizes the cc the cc is multiplied by 1 in order to minimize both objective functions for identifying the optimal combination of weights to be applied to the precipitation products pfs are built for 12 mesonet oklahoma stations and the corresponding model grid cells the optimization is performed independently for the 12 locations during 2014 fig 7 shows pfs for each single precipitation product and for the combination of all three products since the goal is to minimize both objective functions the closer to the axes the more efficient the points are according to the two identified criteria although at location p9 the combination of three different precipitation datasets does not produce any notable improvement in the soil moisture simulation either in rmse or in cc at all other locations the single precipitation product forced simulation produces points that are dominated by the simulation forced with the combination of three precipitation products blue line in other words the pfs obtained with the merged precipitation product dominate i e are more efficient than the pfs obtained with the single products according to the rmse and cc criteria overall correlation coefficients range between 0 30 and 0 70 whereas rmses are as low as 0 05 m3 m3 and as high as 0 24 m3 m3 combining three products is particularly useful for improving the correlation between simulated soil moisture and smos as in most cases 9 locations out of 12 the pfs for the merged product blue solid lines reach to higher cc values than the single product forced simulations dashed lines fig 7 also shows that there is no single precipitation product that consistently performs better than the others if only one dataset had to be chosen nam would be the one carrying the lowest rmse and the highest cc in surface soil moisture simulations with respect to smos followed by nldas and cmorph this suggests that overall both nldas and cmorph are underestimating rainfall across the central southern part of oklahoma and nam produces precipitation estimates that better characterize the hydrological processes in the area however there are cases like p1 where cmorph performs better than nam and nldas and others like p2 where nam carries the lowest ccs and largest rmses therefore the safest choice would be to merge all three products to guarantee an appropriate characterization of soil moisture dynamics in the region similarly fig 8 shows the pfs for the combination of two and three precipitation products to verify whether one of the three precipitation products could be neglected without deteriorating the model skill merging three products never worsens the performance of noah lsm in estimating soil moisture at several locations by merging only two products we obtain skill metrics that are comparable to the three product combination nevertheless no two product combination is optimal for all locations at four locations the cmorph nam combination yields the worst performance at three locations cmorph nldas shows the poorest skill at two locations nldas nam has the largest rmses and lowest ccs and at the three remaining locations the skill of the four combinations is hardly discernible this analysis corroborates that the three precipitation product merging is recommended for soil moisture estimation in the region as it consistently outperforms or at the very least performs as well as any other option the next step would be to identify one combination of weights among all the optimal points on the pf to estimate soil moisture time series at the desired location however as discussed in the methodology section this is a political decision that the dms will make based on their interest and applications we here propose three possible methods to make that decision i maximum correlation regardless of rmse point a in fig 9 ii minimum rmse regardless of cc point b in fig 9 and iii the closest pf point to the utopia point point u in fig 9 we would like to stress that the choice of any point on the pf is arbitrary we then performed a validation exercise using a high quality independent dataset i e the mesonet station observations specifically the modeled soil moisture is compared to the top layer 5 cm soil moisture collected at the 12 mesonet stations highlighted in fig 3 the mean cc and rmse between the noah lsm simulated soil moisture and the mesonet soil moisture observations across the 12 stations are listed in table 2 for all model simulations with different combinations of precipitation inputs at the three decision points identified in fig 9 results in table 2 show that the combination of three precipitation products carries the maximum mean cc and minimum mean rmse for all the optimal points considered in the analysis i e a b and u when only one product was used cmorph outperformed nldas that outperformed nam when u was considered as the decision point when two products were combined cmorph nam outperformed cmorph nldas that outperformed nldas nam when u was considered as the decision point although improvements are small this study has demonstrated the hypothesis that a combination of precipitation data from different sources can be optimized to minimize the error in soil moisture simulations moreover this framework can be applied to different datasets different regions of the world different criteria and different land surface variables and fluxes 4 conclusions this work aims to merge precipitation estimates from different sources including ground based observations satellites and models to produce an estimate of precipitation that optimizes land surface model states and fluxes different sources of precipitation information a satellite products a ground radar dataset and model estimates have been considered to improve the skills of the noah land surface model in simulating surface soil moisture we developed a monte carlo based algorithm that generates weights to linearly and optimally combine these three precipitation datasets results showed that there were optimal combinations of precipitation data that provided better soil moisture model estimates than forcing noah lsm with single precipitation datasets in terms of both rmse and correlation coefficient specifically combining all three precipitation products from different sources provided the best correlations with ground observations and the lowest rmses at several locations across oklahoma however no single linear combination of weights of the precipitation products was found that optimized both criteria proving it to be a multi objective problem the pareto frontier was adopted as a way to present all optimal combinations of weights that would improve one criterion without deteriorating the other one then a few options to pick one single weigh combination from all the pareto efficient points were proposed including maximizing one criterion alone that being either cc or rmse and the closest pf point to the utopia point defined as the unattainable point in the objective space that optimizes all the objectives results presented here are limited by the short time series and small study region however this work is intended to propose a methodology a methodological framework that should be tested in the future across larger and more heterogeneous areas potentially at the global scale and over longer time periods other criteria such as relative bias and unbiased rmse could also be easily included in the framework if of interest to the end users another limitation is the comparison between volumetric soil moisture content from the model and observations which may be problematic given the inherent biases in the model soil moisture climatology and satellite observations as well as ground observation measurement representativeness errors this issue could potentially be fixed by adopting a cumulative density function cdf matching technique reichle and koster 2004 to remove any existing bias in the soil moisture products prior to optimization this may have the potential to improve errors in the modelled land surface fluxes and states we would also like to point out that the monte carlo based sampling can be relatively computationally inefficient but it is unlikely to be confined within a local minimum however in the case of larger domains algorithms such as the simplex simplex swarm or a posteriori error estimator can be used to improve the framework computational efficiency this work developed a technique that could potentially be applied to any precipitation product including the recent nasa integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm global precipitation measurement hou et al 2008 product imerg huffman et al 2014 future work should also investigate how performing a weighted combination of precipitation datasets may lead to extra days of precipitation for instance in cases when only one product has nonzero precipitation while this may improve soil moisture simulations it could have significant impacts elsewhere e g increased canopy evaporation decreased runoff when applying a similar method across a wider region spatially correlated weights should also be considered within the sampling model using a spatial correlation function moreover a similar approach that merges precipitation information from different sources could be easily adapted to optimize other land surface fluxes and variables including runoff evaporation transpiration and groundwater recharge although of higher complexity a multi variate optimization technique that simultaneously enhances two or more land surface model variables would ensure that the water budget was not altered to improve a model error declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

from raindrops cause an increase in the pmw radiation and the scattering due to precipitating ice particles produces a decrease in pmw radiation the blending of complementary information from ir radiances and pmw observations has been proven successful in rainfall estimation turk et al 1999 nevertheless satellite estimates can be affected by detection uncertainties biases and random errors which depend on the accuracy of the remote sensor retrieval error and the lack of continuity in the coverage by low earth orbiting satellites sampling error bell et al 2000 the performance of satellite precipitation products is influenced by seasonal precipitation patterns storm type and background surface ebert et al 2007 maggioni et al 2016 oliveira et al 2016 2018 numerical weather prediction nwp models represent a valid alternative to estimate global precipitation nwps are more accurate when predicting large scale organized systems than more localized events whose spatial and temporal variability cannot be explicitly captured by the model resolution moreover model re analysis precipitation products are the only available choice above 60 latitude and a valuable option above 35 latitude where they ingest a high number of ground observations in summary it is difficult to determine which precipitation product is optimal for a certain region and a certain season due to inconsistency among different datasets moreover obtaining precipitation information at the required accuracy level for hydrological applications and water resources management still remains a challenge there have been a number of attempts to improve the accuracy of precipitation products by merging surface gauge measurements with satellite based estimates smith et al 2006 huffman et al 2007 tian et al 2010 tobin and bennett 2010 for instance the recently developed multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep beck et al 2017 is a global precipitation dataset that spans from 1979 to 2016 and has a 0 1 3 hourly spatial temporal resolution mswep not only blends information from gauge and satellites but also with model reanalysis and covers the entire globe including the oceans similarly other attempts successfully used high resolution simulations from models like the weather research and forecasting model wrf for removing satellite rainfall biases in mountainous areas using a probability density function matching approach zhang et al 2013 2016 nikolopoulos et al 2015 more recently bhuiyan et al 2018 proposed the use of a nonparametric tree based quantile regression forest model to merge satellite and re analysis precipitation products with an air temperature dataset satellite soil moisture data and a terrain elevation dataset the merged product was used to force a hydrological model across the iberian peninsula and it was shown to reduce both systematic and random errors in streamflow simulations with respect to the individual precipitation products most merging techniques have been calibrated and evaluated to a precipitation ground reference e g rain gauge observations but only a few studies calibrated the merging algorithm based on the hydrological response for instance chiang et al 2007 used the recurrent neural network method to merge satellite and rain gauge estimates to improve the accuracy of streamflow simulations for flash flooding modeling yilmaz et al 2010 developed a merging method for multiple types of precipitation estimates by minimizing land surface modeling errors using the downhill simplex method their analyses have indicated that results from the optimally merged precipitation product present lower errors in land surface states and fluxes such as evapotranspiration discharge and skin temperature than do simulation results obtained by forcing the model using each precipitation product individually the main objective of this work is to develop an optimal precipitation dataset that combines the advantages of high resolution products for improving land surface modeling skills we focused here on improving a key land surface state soil moisture that determines the critical surface fluxes and water balance surface soil moisture controls the partitioning of available energy incident on the land surface and therefore it is a fundamental variable in the water cycle that impacts local weather such as cloud coverage and precipitation and hydrological parameters such as runoff and evapotranspiration betts and ball 1998 our hypothesis is that a combination of precipitation data from different sources optimized to minimize the hydrologic response error soil moisture runoff evapotranspiration etc has the potential to improve land surface model forecast skills ultimately this solution will optimally merge a wide range of precipitation information from satellites radars gauges and models trained to minimize errors in land model evaporation runoff and soil moisture response resulting in coupled forecast improvements in convection clouds precipitation boundary layer processes and atmospheric circulation this will be possible if using the optimized land surface variables fluxes to feed back into atmospheric models for improved meteorological forecasts the hypothesis is tested here by merging three precipitation products from satellite ground based and models trained to minimize satellite soil moisture i e smos anomalies we conducted an uncoupled demonstration over oklahoma where a high quality high resolution independent reference of ground based soil moisture observations is available for validating the proposed methodology the proposed methodology has been examined over oklahoma where high quality high resolution independent ground based soil moisture observations are available for validation purposes the next section describes all precipitation and soil moisture datasets the land surface model and the proposed methodological approach results are presented and discussed in section 3 whereas section 4 summarized the main conclusions highlights the limitations of this work and suggests future research directions 2 methodology this work proposes a novel method to improve land surface model skills by optimally merging precipitation estimates from different data sources to minimize the land surface simulation errors fig 1 specifically three precipitation estimates from satellite ground observations and models are merged to optimize surface soil moisture model estimates the experiment is conducted over oklahoma during 2014 using the community noah land surface model that integrates atmospheric forcings with land and vegetation parameters into a state of art land surface modeling system precipitation and soil moisture datasets summarized in table 1 the noah land surface model and the proposed approach adopted to achieve the above objectives are described next 2 1 precipitation dataset firstly the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center morphing cmorph joyce et al 2004 joyce and xie 2011 product was chosen as the satellite based product in this study the cmorph algorithm integrates infrared observations from geostationary satellites with passive microwave data in two steps 1 cloud system advections vectors from 30 minute intervals are generated and 2 at each location a time weighted linear interpolation is performed at consecutive times between the microwave sensor overpasses cmorph is available every half hour on a grid with a spacing of 8 km secondly a ground based precipitation estimate was considered the multi institutional north american land data assimilation system nldas provides retrospective and real time atmospheric forcing estimates to support land surface modeling hourly precipitation data are derived from a combination of 1 daily national center for environmental prediction climate prediction center cpc gauge based precipitation analyses and 2 hourly national weather service doppler radar based wsr 88d precipitation data which are used to temporally disaggregate the daily cpc analyses cosgrove et al 2003 this process exploits the accuracy of the rain gauge observations and the temporal and spatial resolution of a radar based dataset and it is considered to be one of the highest quality precipitation products over conus thirdly the model based precipitation estimates are obtained from the north american mesoscale forecast system nam project rogers et al 2009 the nam model is run four times daily and consists of two components the noaa environmental modeling system nems version of the non hydrostatic multi scale model in b grid nmmb and the ncep regional grid point statistical interpolation gsi analysis the nam model is initialized with a 12 h run of the nam data assimilation system which runs a sequence of four gsi analyses and 3 h nems nmmb forecasts using all available observations to provide a first guess to the nam analysis the ncep high resolution window forecast system hiresw consists of daily runs of the nems non hydrostatic multiscale model on b grid and the ncar advanced research wrf arw at 3 4 km resolution hereinafter we will refer to nam as to indicate the nam precipitation dataset maps of 2014 means and standard deviations of the three precipitation products are shown in fig 2 oklahoma is characterized by a wetter area in the southeastern region with a drying gradient moving towards the panhandle the yearly precipitation variability is low across the study region with higher standard deviations in the wetter area the spatial distribution of rainfall is similar in the three dataset but on average nam shows higher rainfall and higher variability compared to cmorph and nldas particularly in the wetter southeastern region the differences in the three datasets prove the inherent different information that each one of them provides 2 2 soil moisture dataset the oklahoma mesonet is an observational network of 115 meteorological stations across oklahoma that collects archives and quality controls atmospheric surface and soil data in real time since 1994 brock et al 1995 although several variables are monitored at these stations only soil moisture measurements are used here soil moisture soil water potential is recorded at four depths 5 25 60 and 75 cm every 30 min the high quality of this dataset has been proven in several applications spanning from numerical weather predictions to fire monitoring carlson and burgan 2003 and estimation of downward longwave radiation sridhar and elliott 2002 the mesonet stations used in this study are highlighted in fig 3 this ground based soil moisture dataset is used as a benchmark for comparisons with model simulated soil moisture to evaluate the framework developed in this study however the coverage of soil moisture ground observations is extremely limited satellite observations of microwave brightness temperature and backscatter can provide an estimate of soil moisture at large scales two recent satellite missions have the goal of measuring surface soil moisture globally the nasa soil moisture active passive smap mission entekhabi et al 2010 launched on january 31st 2015 measures land surface brightness temperature providing information on surface soil moisture top 5 cm of the soil column the usefulness of the smap based soil moisture product is limited by its course resolutions 36 km the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2010 is a european space agency esa satellite launched in 2009 with the goal of monitoring surface soil moisture with an accuracy of 4 every three days the calibration of the smos retrieval algorithm is based on in situ experiments and modeling activities that do not include the mesonet network observations a study by kerr et al 2012 compared area averaged smos soil moisture with independent ground based soil moisture in the little washita watershed in oklahoma and found a good agreement between the two the smos soil moisture product is used in this work at its native resolution of 25 km as the reference to minimize the error in the model simulations of soil moisture the choice of a satellite based product as reference is due to its global availability making the proposed methodology applicable anywhere around the world maps of the 2014 mean and standard deviation of this product are shown in fig 3 a wetter area is observed in the eastern part of oklahoma which also presents the larger variability higher standard deviation this is consistent with the precipitation spatial distributions presented in fig 2 for the three rainfall products 2 3 the noah model the noah land surface model noah lsm version 2 7 1 ek et al 2003 in one dimension sponsored by the noaa office of global programs ogp is adopted in this study noah lsm was developed by the national centers for environmental prediction ncep oregon state university osu the air force and the hydrology research laboratory at the national weather service noah lsm is updated with more advanced land physics compared to its ancestor oregon state university osu lsm including four soil layers snowpack and frozen soil physics koren et al 1999 as well as snow cover weighted surface fluxes among others it has been implemented in operational weather and climate models because of its moderate complexity and computational efficiency the meteorological forcing used for noah lsm are from phase 2 of the north american land data assimilation system phase 2 nldas 2 which has been improved over the previous version of nldas cosgrove et al 2003 the non precipitation land surface forcing fields for nldas 2 are derived from the ncep north american regional reanalysis narr mesinger et al 2006 while nldas used the eta data assimilation system edas rogers et al 1996 nldas 2 has a spatial resolution of 1 8 and temporal resolution hourly for the period of 1979 present also the parameterization used for vegetation type leaf area index lai soil type and elevation in noah lsm is the one from the nldas dataset 2 4 the experimental approach all precipitation and soil moisture products are rescaled and homogenized to the noah lsm spatial and temporal and resolution of 0 125 1 h for the year of 2014 then the model is forced with each individual precipitation dataset a combination of two of them and a combination of all three products to obtain surface soil moisture simulations precipitation products are linearly combined using a simple weighted average weights are randomly generated through monte carlo mc simulations mc techniques are based on the idea of using randomness to solve problems that are difficult to solve analytically like highly non linear differential equations and obtain numerical results thanks to repeated random sampling a mc approach is used to generate 3000 different combinations of weights of the precipitation products to force noah lsm first weights are only applied to single precipitation products i e weights equal to zero are assigned to the other two products which corresponds to assuming that there exists a bias in the dataset and correcting for it then a combination of two products is considered i e a weight equal to zero is assigned to one out of the three products and finally weights are applied to a combination of all three products fig 4 only positive weights are considered in this study as precipitation products are firstly tested individually with their corresponding weights and only secondarily in combination with other products in the first case negative weights would translate into negative precipitation and have not therefore used for the sake of consistency moreover weights are sampled independently for each grid point so that the same exact procedure could be applied to any other region since weights are not region dependent the performance of the merged precipitation estimates is then assessed in terms of two criteria minimum root mean square error rmse and maximum correlation coefficient cc between the model simulated soil moisture and the reference smos soil moisture product however the weight combination that minimizes the rmse does not necessarily maximize the cc and researchers and or end users may be more inclined to use one criterion versus the other depending on the research and or operational application therefore we are looking at a multiple criteria decision making problem where two objective functions are optimized simultaneously the pareto efficiency definition is used to identify the optimal combination of weights specifically a combination of weights is considered optimal or efficient or non dominated if there exist no other weight combination that improves one criterion e g rmse without deteriorating the other criterion e g cc the pareto frontier pf is the set of all pareto efficient points marler and arora 2004 this concept was introduced in economics by vilfredo pareto 1848 1923 but it has further expanded to several other fields such as engineering and science rubinstein and osborne 1994 the same framework could be easily applied to other or more criteria building the pf is a purely mathematical process in which the decision maker dm does not intervene however the question is how to choose one weight combination from all the points that belong to the pareto frontier one option would be to either minimize the rmse or to maximize the correlation depending on the dm s interests which would reduce the problem to a simple single criterion decision another viable alternative is the utopia point u method makowski 2010 according to this technique the dm picks the point on the pf that minimizes the distance from u which is the point in the objective space that minimizes or maximizes all the objectives all these three approaches minimum rmse maximum correlation and closer point to u are considered and investigated in the next section 3 results and discussion the performance of noah lsm forced with 3000 mc generated combinations of weights for the three different precipitation products is initially assessed over a single grid point point p1 in fig 3 this study considers weights ranging between 0 and 1 as a preliminary analysis shown in fig 5 demonstrated that increasing weights beyond 1 would not improve surface soil moisture simulations in terms of rmse which increases if weights greater than 1 are applied to the three precipitation products and cc which drops if weights greater than 1 are applied to cmorph and nldas whereas for nam it is maximized if a weight of 2 is applied since no a priori knowledge on the bias in the precipitation products is assumed the sum of the weights is not constrained to any value the 3 d plots in fig 6 show that there is no single combination of weights of the precipitation products that optimizes both criteria but rather a region in the weight space that maximizes cc and minimizes rmse this proves that our problem is a two objective or two criterion problem for p1 rmse values range between 0 05 m3 m3 and 0 2 m3 m3 whereas cc values range between 0 43 and 0 68 showing overall satisfactory performance of noah lsm in modeling surface soil moisture at this location the pareto frontiers are then constructed using the two objective functions defined above one that minimizes the rmse and the other that maximizes the cc the cc is multiplied by 1 in order to minimize both objective functions for identifying the optimal combination of weights to be applied to the precipitation products pfs are built for 12 mesonet oklahoma stations and the corresponding model grid cells the optimization is performed independently for the 12 locations during 2014 fig 7 shows pfs for each single precipitation product and for the combination of all three products since the goal is to minimize both objective functions the closer to the axes the more efficient the points are according to the two identified criteria although at location p9 the combination of three different precipitation datasets does not produce any notable improvement in the soil moisture simulation either in rmse or in cc at all other locations the single precipitation product forced simulation produces points that are dominated by the simulation forced with the combination of three precipitation products blue line in other words the pfs obtained with the merged precipitation product dominate i e are more efficient than the pfs obtained with the single products according to the rmse and cc criteria overall correlation coefficients range between 0 30 and 0 70 whereas rmses are as low as 0 05 m3 m3 and as high as 0 24 m3 m3 combining three products is particularly useful for improving the correlation between simulated soil moisture and smos as in most cases 9 locations out of 12 the pfs for the merged product blue solid lines reach to higher cc values than the single product forced simulations dashed lines fig 7 also shows that there is no single precipitation product that consistently performs better than the others if only one dataset had to be chosen nam would be the one carrying the lowest rmse and the highest cc in surface soil moisture simulations with respect to smos followed by nldas and cmorph this suggests that overall both nldas and cmorph are underestimating rainfall across the central southern part of oklahoma and nam produces precipitation estimates that better characterize the hydrological processes in the area however there are cases like p1 where cmorph performs better than nam and nldas and others like p2 where nam carries the lowest ccs and largest rmses therefore the safest choice would be to merge all three products to guarantee an appropriate characterization of soil moisture dynamics in the region similarly fig 8 shows the pfs for the combination of two and three precipitation products to verify whether one of the three precipitation products could be neglected without deteriorating the model skill merging three products never worsens the performance of noah lsm in estimating soil moisture at several locations by merging only two products we obtain skill metrics that are comparable to the three product combination nevertheless no two product combination is optimal for all locations at four locations the cmorph nam combination yields the worst performance at three locations cmorph nldas shows the poorest skill at two locations nldas nam has the largest rmses and lowest ccs and at the three remaining locations the skill of the four combinations is hardly discernible this analysis corroborates that the three precipitation product merging is recommended for soil moisture estimation in the region as it consistently outperforms or at the very least performs as well as any other option the next step would be to identify one combination of weights among all the optimal points on the pf to estimate soil moisture time series at the desired location however as discussed in the methodology section this is a political decision that the dms will make based on their interest and applications we here propose three possible methods to make that decision i maximum correlation regardless of rmse point a in fig 9 ii minimum rmse regardless of cc point b in fig 9 and iii the closest pf point to the utopia point point u in fig 9 we would like to stress that the choice of any point on the pf is arbitrary we then performed a validation exercise using a high quality independent dataset i e the mesonet station observations specifically the modeled soil moisture is compared to the top layer 5 cm soil moisture collected at the 12 mesonet stations highlighted in fig 3 the mean cc and rmse between the noah lsm simulated soil moisture and the mesonet soil moisture observations across the 12 stations are listed in table 2 for all model simulations with different combinations of precipitation inputs at the three decision points identified in fig 9 results in table 2 show that the combination of three precipitation products carries the maximum mean cc and minimum mean rmse for all the optimal points considered in the analysis i e a b and u when only one product was used cmorph outperformed nldas that outperformed nam when u was considered as the decision point when two products were combined cmorph nam outperformed cmorph nldas that outperformed nldas nam when u was considered as the decision point although improvements are small this study has demonstrated the hypothesis that a combination of precipitation data from different sources can be optimized to minimize the error in soil moisture simulations moreover this framework can be applied to different datasets different regions of the world different criteria and different land surface variables and fluxes 4 conclusions this work aims to merge precipitation estimates from different sources including ground based observations satellites and models to produce an estimate of precipitation that optimizes land surface model states and fluxes different sources of precipitation information a satellite products a ground radar dataset and model estimates have been considered to improve the skills of the noah land surface model in simulating surface soil moisture we developed a monte carlo based algorithm that generates weights to linearly and optimally combine these three precipitation datasets results showed that there were optimal combinations of precipitation data that provided better soil moisture model estimates than forcing noah lsm with single precipitation datasets in terms of both rmse and correlation coefficient specifically combining all three precipitation products from different sources provided the best correlations with ground observations and the lowest rmses at several locations across oklahoma however no single linear combination of weights of the precipitation products was found that optimized both criteria proving it to be a multi objective problem the pareto frontier was adopted as a way to present all optimal combinations of weights that would improve one criterion without deteriorating the other one then a few options to pick one single weigh combination from all the pareto efficient points were proposed including maximizing one criterion alone that being either cc or rmse and the closest pf point to the utopia point defined as the unattainable point in the objective space that optimizes all the objectives results presented here are limited by the short time series and small study region however this work is intended to propose a methodology a methodological framework that should be tested in the future across larger and more heterogeneous areas potentially at the global scale and over longer time periods other criteria such as relative bias and unbiased rmse could also be easily included in the framework if of interest to the end users another limitation is the comparison between volumetric soil moisture content from the model and observations which may be problematic given the inherent biases in the model soil moisture climatology and satellite observations as well as ground observation measurement representativeness errors this issue could potentially be fixed by adopting a cumulative density function cdf matching technique reichle and koster 2004 to remove any existing bias in the soil moisture products prior to optimization this may have the potential to improve errors in the modelled land surface fluxes and states we would also like to point out that the monte carlo based sampling can be relatively computationally inefficient but it is unlikely to be confined within a local minimum however in the case of larger domains algorithms such as the simplex simplex swarm or a posteriori error estimator can be used to improve the framework computational efficiency this work developed a technique that could potentially be applied to any precipitation product including the recent nasa integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm global precipitation measurement hou et al 2008 product imerg huffman et al 2014 future work should also investigate how performing a weighted combination of precipitation datasets may lead to extra days of precipitation for instance in cases when only one product has nonzero precipitation while this may improve soil moisture simulations it could have significant impacts elsewhere e g increased canopy evaporation decreased runoff when applying a similar method across a wider region spatially correlated weights should also be considered within the sampling model using a spatial correlation function moreover a similar approach that merges precipitation information from different sources could be easily adapted to optimize other land surface fluxes and variables including runoff evaporation transpiration and groundwater recharge although of higher complexity a multi variate optimization technique that simultaneously enhances two or more land surface model variables would ensure that the water budget was not altered to improve a model error declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have
