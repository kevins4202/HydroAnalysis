13395,high performance activated carbons from textile wastes were successfully developed for the removal of oxytetracycline otc from aqueous solution for this purpose textile wastes consist of cotton co polyester pe and cotton polyester co pe were subjected to hydrothermal carbonization htc as a pretreatment followed by chemical zncl2 and koh and physical co2 activation to obtain activated carbon results showed that both activation agents and textile waste types had considerable effects on activated carbon properties and otc removal the highest surface area was achieved by zncl2 activation of co 1906 m2 g and co pe hydrochars 1795 m2 g which exhibited the best oxytetracycline otc adsorption performance with a capacity of 621 2 mg g and 482 8 mg g respectively activated carbon fitted best to three parameter isotherm models namely sips or redlich peterson isotherms indicating that adsorption can proceed on both homogenous and heterogeneous surface depending on the concentration of otc molecules the three parameter sips isotherm model provided the best fit for co koh and co pe koh whereas adsorption of zncl2 and co2 activated carbons followed both redlich peterson isotherm model kinetic data of both activated carbons was best described by pseudo second order model also revealing that co zncl2 had faster adsorption rate than that of co pe zncl2 for co and co pe hydrochars the surface areas of koh and co2 activated carbons were relatively lower than zncl2 activated carbons nevertheless koh activation was rich in acidic surface groups while co2 activation led to form activated carbons with high carbon content 90 in the light of these findings hydrothermal carbonization can be considered as a pretreatment which allows conversion of textile wastes into promising precursor for porous carbon production while the process was not appropriate to produce solid fuel graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords textile wastes porous carbon adsorption hydrothermal carbonization 1 introduction chemical industries such as pharmaceutical textile plastics petroleum paper etc discharge a vast amount of wastewater which is severely contaminated with organic pollutants among these pollutants antibiotics are in the list of emerging group of environmental pollutants and increasing level of antibiotic concentration in aqueous systems has become global concern 1 even though the concentration of antibiotics in wastewater is low some types of antibiotics accumulate in the environment because of low biodegradability and cause potential risks for both human and aquatic environment such as antibiotic resistance in microorganisms acute chronic toxicity and cancer particularly the tetracycline antibiotics are known as being resistant to degradation and cannot easily be metabolized by humans and animals 2 therefore a special concern has been devoted to develop effective methods for removal of antibiotics from wastewater a variety of physicochemical and biological treatments have been investigated namely adsorption photo degradation catalytic oxidation chemical precipitation membrane filtration and bioremoval 2 3 due to the operation simplicity economic feasibility high efficiency adsorption has superiority in comparison with other removal technologies activated carbon is commonly used as an adsorbent for removal of tetracycline group antibiotics from wastewater in the literature various types of biomass including sewage and industrial sludge 4 corn stover 5 corn stalk 6 lotus stalk 7 garlic skin 8 pomelo peel 9 olive oil solid waste 10 willow branch 11 coconut shell 12 microalgae 13 etc have been tested to produce activated carbon via two main processes physical and chemical activation chemical activation is carried out in the presence of activating agent koh zncl2 h3po4 etc at a temperature range of 400 c 800 c while physical activation uses co2 steam or limited o2 air at higher temperatures 800 c the chemical and structural properties of activated carbon are mostly affected by biomass and activation type as well as activation conditions among physical activators co2 is more preferable as an activator due to its ease of handling and control clean and high activity on the other hand zncl2 and koh are the most common chemical activating agents and have some superiorities koh creates of micropores and ultramicropores and zncl2 activation takes place at lower activation temperatures 450 c 600 c chen et al 14 compared activated carbons obtained from chemical and physical activation processes and reported that chemical activation produced activated carbon with high porosity whereas co2 activation resulted in formation of lower surface area and higher micropore volume in a recent study by yagmur et al 15 influence of precursor type oleaster fruit and fruit fractions and activation agent koh and zncl2 on properties of activated carbon was comparatively investigated they found that activated carbons obtained from zncl2 activation had higher surface area and micropore volume than that from koh activation they also claimed that zncl2 produced activated carbon with high graphitization while aromatic structure was destroyed in presence of koh in the last decade hydrothermal carbonization has gained great attention as a pretreatment of biomass prior to activation processes or to utilize as solid fuel 16 hydrothermal carbonization htc is a thermochemical process which occurs at relatively low temperatures 180 300 c under autogenous pressure in presence of water although htc is mostly applied to biomass having high moisture content recirculation process can be also performed without extra water requirement which allows utilization of dry biomass in htc systems 17 a number of studies focus on improvement of fuel properties of biomass by htc treatment resulting in increased carbon content hhv value and reduced oxygen and ash content 18 htc pretreatment of biomass for activated carbon production was also attempted via two step process approach htc treatment physical chemical activation jain et al 19 40 reported that htc treatment of biomass enriched the oxygenated groups on the surface and increased the porosity which improved performance of the activation process recently a comprehensive review on htc pretreatment of biomass for activated carbon production has been provided by fernandez sanroman et al 16 although non activated hydrochars have been tested as adsorbent for pollutant removal in a number of studies hydrochar adsorption performance significantly enhanced by chemical or physical activation due to increase in the surface area formation of more homogeneous surface high porosity etc commercial utilization of biomass for activated carbon production is limited by undesirable properties such as high ash content low carbon content poor purity and heterogeneity alternatively textile wastes containing cotton and polyesters can overcome this problem yielding activated carbon with high reproducibility and purity excessive consumption of textile brings along a huge amount of textile waste even though governments charities and industrial enterprises encourage consumers for recycling and reducing of textile usage there is still a high output that goes to the landfill and burns in incinerators in europe only 1 5 millions tons of textiles are recycled which corresponds only 75 of total textile wastes 20 there are a few numbers of studies dealing with the production of activated carbon from textile wastes 21 23 xia et al 21 studied production of activated carbon from waste cotton via chemical activation zncl2 h3po4 and fecl3 and reported that zncl2 activated carbon exhibited highest cr vi adsorption performance in a study of yu et al 22 porous activated carbon derived from waste polyester fabric was successfully synthesized by zncl2 activation polyacrylonitrile which is one of the raw materials of textile fibers was also used to produce activated carbon via koh and co2 activation with a surface area of 2133 m2 g and 212 m2 g respectively 23 the main concern regarding production of activated carbon can be related to low bulk density of textile wastes causing difficulties during activation process particularly in large scale applications transformation of textile wastes into biochar by pyrolysis or hydrochar by hydrothermal carbonization can intensify the mass density as well as increase the carbon content a study by hanoglu et al 24 reported that pyrolysis of different types of textile wastes containing cotton viscose polyester acrylic and viscose enhanced carbon content and improved fuel properties of textile wastes in another study cotton textile waste derived biochar was obtained by pyrolysis at 700 c then activated with zncl2 25 however the surface area of obtained activated biochar was found relatively low 292 m2 g on the other hand htc of textile wastes were assessed in a limited number of studies to obtain microspheres and hydrochars as solid fuel 26 28 lin et al 26 summarized the combustion behavior of hydrochars obtained from textile wastes at different htc conditions they reported that htc treatment of cotton waste at 230 c for 1 h led to increase c content from 50 3 to 55 4 and reduce volatile matter from 81 1 to 74 8 based on combustion test ignition and burnout temperatures significantly decreased and maximum combustion rate was considerably improved which exhibited high reactivity against oxidative agents recently same research group also reported hydrothermal carbonization of municipal solid waste mixture containing waste textile 27 oxytetracycline otc a kind of tetracycline type antibiotics has a widespread usage in human and animal infection treatment because of its high activity in broad spectrum therefore special attention is focused on the removal of otc from aqueous solutions by adsorption with diverse range of adsorbents including activated carbons 6 9 29 33 it is clear that there is a research gap on utilization of different types of textile waste to produce activated carbon despite the extensive attention on production of activated carbon from biomass there are only few studies regarding the utilization of textile wastes as activated carbon precursor moreover to the best our knowledge utilization of hydrochars derived from textile wastes for activated carbon production hasn t been reported up to date herein textile wastes of cotton cotton polyester mixture and polyester were evaluated to produce activated carbon with chemical and physical activation methods prior to activation textile wastes were subjected to hydrothermal carbonization to improve activation process as in the case of biomass activation processes the change in chemical structure after htc was assessed by elemental tga and ftir analyses the effect of textile waste type and activation methods on chemical and morphological properties of activated carbon was comparatively investigated otc adsorption studies were also performed to discuss the relation between the properties and adsorption capacities of the produced activated carbons 2 material and methods 2 1 material cotton co cotton polyester co pe and polyester pe textile wastes were kindly supplied from a textile factory in izmir textile wastes were shredded into smaller pieces 5 mm with scissors zncl2 2h2o and koh were purchased from sigma aldrich oxytetracycline hydrochloride otc doga ilac purity 99 was used for the adsorption studies as a representative of antibiotics elemental analysis of textile wastes was given in table 1 2 2 production of hydrochar htc experiments were conducted in stainless steel reactor 0 45 l with a magnetic stirrer buchi glassuster under pressure a detailed description of the htc system has been reported in our previous study 18 10 g of textile wastes were mixed with 150 ml of water mixture was loaded to the reactor and the lid was sealed with o ring reactor was purged with n2 and the initial pressure was adjusted to 10 bar the reactor was then heated to the desired temperature with a heating rate of 5 c min and held at desired temperature for 1 h after 1 h reactor was rapidly cooled down to room temperature with the maximum cooling rate the hydrochar was collected by vacuum filtration and washed with deionized water finally hydrochar was dried at 100 c for 24 h htc temperature was screened from 210 c to 240 c depending on feedstock type to obtain brownish hydrochar fig s1 htc temperature was selected as 230 c for co and co pe considering the mass yield in case of pe carbonization did not take place even at higher temperature up to 280 c yielding only white powder instead of brownish hydrochar since mass yield of pe did not change with increasing temperature htc temperature was selected as 230 c for comparison although hydrochar was not obtained by htc of pe white solid product was also named as hydrochar hydrochars were denoted as co h co pe h and pe h for hydrochars derived from co co pe and pe respectively 2 3 activation of hydrochars hydrochars derived from textile waste were activated by chemical and physical methods activation conditions were determined based on optimum conditions in our previous studies 34 35 for zncl2 activation temperature of 500 c was selected which was found as optimum temperature in our previous study 34 in the same manner co2 activation temperature of 900 c was tested according to our previous study which was performed in the same system 35 since activated carbons produced from co h and co pe h at 900 c gave very low yield 9 co2 activation experiments were carried out at lower temperature 850 c for 3 h in case of koh activation the lowest temperature at which koh can be activated 700 c was selected due to the high reactivity of hydrochars for zncl2 and koh activation activator precursor ratio was fixed to 1 1 aiming less chemical consumption chemical activation was carried out by impregnation method with zncl2 and koh 10 g of zncl2 or koh was dissolved in approximately 20 ml of water 10 g of hydrochar was impregnated with zncl2 or koh solutions with a mass ratio of 1 1 the mixed slurry was dried in an oven overnight at 100 c the dried mixture was activated at 500 c for zncl2 and 700 c for koh under n2 flow 100 ml min for 1 h the reactor residue was then refluxed with 150 ml of 10 hcl solution for 1 h and filtered under vacuum washed with warm distilled water until no chloride ions was observed in filtrate the activated carbon samples were dried at 100 c for 24 h and sieved to the particle size less than 100 μm physical activation of hydrochar was performed under co2 atmosphere hydrochar was placed in a stainless steel pyrolysis reactor and heated to 850 c under n2 with a 100 ml min with a heating rate of 10 c min once the temperature inside the reactor reached to 850 c n2 flow was switched to co2 with a flow rate of 100 ml min for 3 h at the end of the activation time the reactor was allowed to cool down to room temperature under n2 flow all activated carbons were labeled as follows type of textile waste hydrochar co co pe or pe as their hydrochars activation method zncl2 koh or co2 and stored in sealed bottles for further analysis all htc experiments were conducted at least 3 times and activation experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate relative standard deviations for hydrochar and activated carbon yields were found to be less than 3 5 and 1 5 respectively 2 4 analysis elemental analysis of textile wastes hydrochars and activated carbons were carried out using elemental analyzer leco chns model according to astm 5291 96 proximate and elemental analyses were performed in duplicate relative deviation of analysis results was found to be less than 5 functional groups present in the textile wastes and corresponding activated carbons were determined by perkin elmer ftir spectroscopy coupled with attenuated total reflectance atr in the scanning range of 4000 600 cm 1 the surface functional groups of activated carbons was clarified by boehm titration 36 which is based on the assumption that naoh neutralizes all acidic groups carboxylic lactonic phenolic groups na2co3 neutralizes carboxyl groups and lactonic groups nahco3 neutralizes only carboxyl groups raman spectra of the activated carbons were recorded by using confocal raman spectrometer renishaw invia combined with a laser utilizing a lambda excitation of 514 nm all measurements were carried out with a 20 optical microscope and 2400 groove mm 1 density grating thermogravimetric analysis was performed by perkin elmer diamond tg dta analyzer at a heating rate of 10 c min in the temperature range of 25 c and 850 c under n2 flow 100 ml min to explore thermal behavior of textile wastes and their hydrochars brunauer emmett and teller bet surface area and pore volume of the activated carbons were analyzed by the help of n2 adsorption at 77 k quantachrome autosorb iq2 prior to measurement all activated carbons were degassed at 300 c for 3 h the morphology of activated carbon was explored by scanning electron microscopy sem and the images were taken at various magnitudes by thermo scientific apreo s microscope prior to analysis activated carbons were coated with gold to provide the necessary conductivity for high image quality 2 5 adsorption tests taking otc as an example of antibiotic pollutants the batch adsorption experiments were performed at different initial concentrations 50 800 mg l times 1 30h and activated carbon dosage 0 25 1 5 g l in a typical adsorption experiment activated carbon was added to 250 ml flask containing 50 ml of otc solution without ph adjustment ph ranges from 3 5 to 4 5 the mixtures for different experiments were shaken in an orbital shaker at 200 rpm at room temperature at the end of experiment suspension was filtered using a filter paper whatmann no 42 paper equilibrium concentration of the filtrates was determined immediately by a uv vis spectrometer uv 160a shimadzu at a wavelength of 276 nm all adsorption tests were performed in duplicate for each activated carbons and the results showed that the relative errors were less than 5 the amount of adsorbed otc qe mg g and removal efficiency were calculated by eqs 1 and 2 1 q e c i c e v m 2 removal efficiency c i c e c i 100 where ci mg l is initial concentration ce mg l is the concentration at equilibrium v l volume of otc solution and m g is the mass of activated carbons in order to examine the adsorption behavior of activated carbon two parameter models freundlich and langmuir model and three parameter models sips and redlich peterson were tested by interpreting the data from the adsorption experiments langmuir adsorption model presented a monolayer adsorption covering on the surface equally while freundlich model assumes that heterogeneous energies on adsorbent surface varied with surface coverage the redlich peterson model approaches the freundlich model at high concentrations and the langmuir isotherm at low concentration in contrast the sips model reduces to freundlich isotherm model at low adsorbate concentration while at high concentration it predicts a monolayer adsorption capacity characteristic of the langmuir isotherm nonlinear langmuir freundlich sips and redlich peterson adsorption isotherms were expressed by eqs 3 4 5 and 6 respectively 3 q e s m k l c e 1 k l c e 4 q e k f c e 1 n 5 q e q m k s c e n 1 k s c e

verified by the sum of squares error sse and r2 38 kinetic studies were performed using the selected activated carbons at the selected conditions with various times ranging from 10 to 300 min pseudo first order pseudo second order kinetic models and intra particle diffusion model were tested to identify the adsorption mechanism and rate limiting step and to demonstrate the adsorption process of otc the equations of pseudo first order eq 8 pseudo second order eq 9 intra particle diffusion model eq 10 and relevant parameters are expressed as follows 8 in q e q t in q e k 1 t 9 t q t 1 k 2 q e

elemental analysis of hydrochars and textile wastes elemental composition of textile wastes corresponding hydrochars and yields of hydrochars were listed in table 1 high heating value hhv energy density and energy yield were calculated according to previous study 24 the content of c in textile wastes were ranked in the order of pe co pe co nitrogen and ash content of textile wastes were probably originated from dyes and other additives carbon content of co h and co pe h was found to be higher than those of their parent textile wastes increase in c content with htc pretreatment of textile wastes may be arisen from mainly decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions 27 on the other hand h content of co pe considerably decreased after htc process apart from decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions dehydration and dehydrogenation reactions might also take place which are responsible of reduction of h content in hydrochar 28 39 the mass yields of co h and co pe h was found to be 62 1 and 52 1 respectively on the contrary to cotton based textile wastes htc of pe did not significantly change the elemental composition and gave relatively high mass yield of 83 9 table 1 it is noteworthy to say that pe fibers did not undergo carbonization reactions at severe conditions at 280 c 60 80 mpa remaining as white powder fig s1 this was probably due to the depolymerization of pe into lower molecular weight components under htc conditions the elemental composition of pe and pe h were in agreement with the findings of study by iniguez et al 40 which reported negligible difference in c content of raw polymer mixture and its hydrochars it should be also noted that htc treatment increased hhv values to some extent from 17 3 to 20 6 mj kg only for co whereas hhv value and energy density were remained nearly constant in case of co pe and pe therefore it can be concluded that htc of waste textiles is not an appropriate route for solid fuel production pyrolysis or torrefaction of textile waste is more promising technique for biochar production to use as solid fuel which was reported in previous study 24 they stated that biochar obtained from pyrolysis of cotton fiber hhv 16 2 mj kg at 300 c had a high calorific value of 28 0 mj kg with a high energy density 1 73 energy yield 87 47 3 1 2 tga analysis of textile wastes and their hydrochars tg and dtg curves under n2 atmosphere were obtained to examine thermal degradation behavior of textile wastes and their hydrochars fig 1 the weight loss around 90 100 c associated with moisture was observed in the case of co and co pe as indicated in dtg curves of co and co h htc pretreatment had a little impact on thermal decomposition fig 1 a temperature at maximum decomposition rate tm slightly shifted to lower temperature from 371 c to 352 c decomposition of pe gave only one peak with tm of 435 c fig 1 b after subjecting to htc a new peak was appeared at lower temperature range between 295 and 393 c tm 353 c and the intensity of peak at 435 c weakened due to the decomposition of pe into lower molecular weight compounds during htc depolymerization and or hydrolysis of pe may occur under htc conditions yielding less stable structures it is also important to note that depolymerization and or hydrolysis of pe was not accompanied by formation of water soluble fractions most of depolymerized pe products remained as water insoluble solid after htc treatment in case of co pe two clear peaks at the temperature ranges between 300 and 380 c and 380 470 c were observed partially overlapping with dtg curves of co and pe respectively fig 1 c former peak is associated with co and the latter peak is related to pe component after subjecting to htc treatment the intensity of second peak around 380 470 c dramatically dropped because of depolymerization of pe and one main peak was evolved close to the temperature range of the first peak tm 310 c shifting tm values of the main peaks to lower temperature ranges indicated that htc treatment had an adverse effect on thermal stability for each textile wastes it is due to the fact that textile wastes underwent hydrolysis reactions resulting in depolymerization of co and pe fibers moreover it is concluded that polymeric structures in textile wastes decompose into high volatile substances during htc process 26 our results clearly showed that the htc behaviors of textile wastes and biomass were distinctly different generally hydrochars derived from biomass have mostly higher thermal stability compared to their parent biomasses for example a study dealing with htc of pinewood dust stated that degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose led to production of more stable hydrochars which decomposed at higher temperatures 41 on the other hand gunarathne et al 42 also stated that depolymerization of hemicellulose took place during htc of brewery residues and some part of depolymerization products remained in hydrochar resulting a formation of dtg peak at earlier stages similar to our results iniguez et al 40 found that thermal stability of hydrochars from marine plastic debris at different temperatures was lower than raw waste 3 1 3 ftir spectra of textile wastes and hydrochars ftir spectroscopy was performed to investigate the impacts of hydrothermal treatment on the structure of textile wastes fig 2 as seen from fig 2 functional groups in co remained almost same after hydrothermal treatment the broad peak around 3330 cm 1 is associated to oh vibration owing to inter intra or free molecular bound hydroxyl group in co and coh a very small peak at 2900 cm 1 was observed which is due to ch stretching vibrations of alkyl aliphatic groups the main characteristic peaks were observed between 900 cm 1 and 1200 cm 1 the co stretching of ether c o c and hydroxyl c o h group in anhydroglucose ring appeared at 1160 and 1100 cm 1 respectively 43 the peak at 1030 cm 1 is associated with co stretching vibration of primary alcohols the peaks at 710 and 665 cm 1 are owing to oh out of plane bending of alcohols 44 in opposition to co and co pe based textile wastes htc process altered the chemical structure of pe even though the elemental composition was very similar the peak at 1714 cm 1 in spectra of pe is attributed to carbonyl stretching of ester group which is found in the polyester structure this characteristic carbonyl peak shifted to 1685 cm 1 after htc process randviir et al 45 reported that new peak at 1685 cm 1 instead of peak around 1714 cm 1 was related to formation of ketone or carboxylic acid which is conjugated with a phenyl ring or cc bond the existence of aromatic groups can be explained by cc aromatic stretching peak at 1409 cm 1 in both pe and pe h for pe the peak at 1240 cm 1 belongs to phenolic co stretching vibration and the peak at 1090 cm 1 belongs to co bending of the ester group for pe h the new peak was observed at 1280 cm 1 partially overlapped with the peak at 1240 cm 1 indicating oh stretching of phenolic compounds while new peaks appeared in pe h at 1130 cm 1 and 1100 cm 1 which are associated with co vibration of alcohol probably due to the dehydration of pe in htc in case of co pe ftir spectrum of raw waste and hydrochar illustrated that they had similar functional groups of both pe and co and their parent hydrochars respectively 3 2 characterization of activation carbon production 3 2 1 elemental analysis and yield of activated carbons hydrochars derived from textile wastes were subjected two different activation processes namely chemical with zncl2 and koh and physical with co2 activation in case of co2 activation hydrothermal treated pe was completely decomposed because of its high reactivity under activation conditions which was discarded for the characterization studies thus 8 different types of activated carbons were obtained and characterized in order to investigate potential application as carbon based adsorbent the mass yield and elemental composition of activated carbons were given in table 2 the mass yield of activated carbons obtained by chemical activation was higher than that by physical activation on the other hand the type of chemical activation agent had a little impact on mass yields of activated carbons among chemically activated carbons co derived activated carbons gave the highest mass yield 36 8 activated carbon with high c content was achieved in case of zncl2 and co2 activation the highest c content of activated carbons was obtained with co pe h which were 90 6 for zncl2 activation and 90 9 for co2 activation in fact reverse boundard reaction takes place co2 c s 2co where some part of carbon is gasified to form porous structure during co2 activation process co2 activation at higher temperatures induced the decomposition of most of oxygenated compounds in hydrochars 46 resulting in enrichment of c content in activated carbons on the other hand lower oxygen and higher c content of zncl2 activated carbons indicated that activation process proceeds through dehydration reactions rather than decarboxylation reactions 19 koh based activated carbons had relatively lower c content from 71 7 to 76 3 compared to zncl2 and co2 activation according to reactions given below koh is directly attacked to carbon in hydrochars to form porous network remaining activated carbon with lower c content and high o content 11 6koh 2c 2k 2 co 3 2 k 3h 2 12 2k 2 co 3 k 2 o co 2 13 2k 2 co 3 2c 2 k 3co 14 k 2 o c 2 k 3co for h content of activated carbons this also depends on activation agent in case of koh activation the main reason of low h content is related to dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by k2co3 k2o formed during activation 47 among all obtained activated carbons co2 activated carbons had the lowest h content due to the aromatization reactions high activation temperature 850 c 48 h c and o c ratios of activated carbons revealed that co2 produced highly condensed and aromatic structure lower h c ratio whereas koh activated carbons possessed more oxygenated structures higher o c ratio 3 2 2 functional groups of activated carbons 3 2 2 1 ftir analysis of activated carbon independently of waste type the presence of functional groups dramatically changed by activation method fig s2 the high activation temperature of co2 process led to decompose the functional groups yielding activated carbons with less oxygen content 49 it should be also noted that co2 activated carbons had lower ftir peak intensities peaks around 1380 cm 1 and 1210 cm 1 represent co stretching vibration the peak 1570 cm 1 can be associated with aromatic cc stretching while the peak around 1710 cm 1 refers to carbonyl groups in case of koh activated carbons the intensity of peaks in co koh was lower than that in pe and co pe hydrochars particularly peak around 1100 cm 1 which is related to co vibration in phenolic structure was not observed in case of co koh for pe koh and co pe koh the characteristic ester peak at 1710 cm 1 in pe h and co pe h fig 2 disappeared probably due to the reduction of carbonyl groups into alcohol co stretching at 1080 cm 1 and alkyl aryl ether or aryl alcohol co stretching at 1205 cm 1 the peak at 1570 cm 1 can be attributed cc in the aromatic structure of activated carbons the peaks of hydrochars activated by zncl2 had a broad peak around 1160 cm 1which can be associated with co vibrations aromatic cc stretching at 1570 cm 1 was also observed in zncl2 activated carbons the peaks between 900 and 700 cm 1 particularly in pe zncl2 and co pe zncl2 can attributable to ch out of plane bending vibrations 50 3 2 2 2 surface acidic groups of activated carbon the surface acidic functional groups containing oxygen groups were quantitatively determined by boehm titration and the results are represented in table 3 total acidic groups vary between 0 68 and 1 29 mmol g depending on the activation method and hydrochar types koh activated carbons possessed the highest total acidic groups for each textile waste type high oxygen content of koh activated carbons can be also correlated with the acidic oxygen containing functional groups 51 koh oxidized the surface of the carbonaceous material by the substitution of h atoms with ok group in koh 47 the enhancement of acidic oxygenated functional groups on the carbon surface was observed in previous studies related to koh activation of hydrochars 52 and polystyrene based cation exchangeable resin 47 no carboxylic groups were found in co2 activated carbons but they possessed phenolic and lactonic groups on the surface of activated carbons the presence of lactonic and phenolic groups was also indicated in ftir spectrum fig s2 these results imply that co2 activation at 850 c led to destruction of carboxylic group but a small amount of weak acidic surface groups remained in activated carbon structure as indicated from table 3 surface oxygenated groups of activated carbons were dominated by phenolic and carboxylic acid groups in zncl2 activated carbons 3 2 3 raman spectrum of activated carbon raman spectroscopy analysis was employed in order to characterize the crystalline structure of activated carbons fig s3 two strong peaks at 1340 cm 1 and 1595 cm 1 were clearly observed for spectrum of all activated carbon the d band peak at 1340 cm 1 indicated the structure of disordered and defected carbon while the latter peak at 1595 cm 1 g band was associated with in plane vibration of sp2 bonded carbon there was an obvious difference in the intensities of d and g bands with respect to activation type and precursors zncl2 activation led to an increase in the intensities of d and g band particularly in case of activated carbon derived from pe containing precursors i d i g ratio is commonly used to evaluate the extent of disordered structure and degree of graphitization in which lower i d i g ratio indicates higher graphitization degree with less disordered structure the lowest i d i g values were obtained in case of zncl2 activated carbons implying that zncl2 activation led to increase the degree of graphitization on the other hand the values i d i g for co zncl2 were found to be higher than that for pe zncl2 and co pe zncl2 it can be concluded that activated carbon having high graphitic carbon was obtained from zncl2 activation of pe containing precursors moreover a broad peak around 2800 cm 1 2d band was only observed in the spectrum of zncl2 activated carbons which corresponds to the multilayer graphene phase structure 53 the raman results are also consistent with the previous work related to production of activated carbon from oleaster fruit by koh and zncl2 activation 15 3 2 4 bet surface area and pore volume of activated carbons bet surface area micropore area and pore volumes were presented in table 4 considering hydrochar types zncl2 activated carbons had the highest surface area and micropore areas in case of co and co pe the surface areas of koh and co2 activated carbons were close while micropore area of koh activated carbons was higher than that of co2 activated carbons during the koh activation the reaction between metallic potassium and carbon atoms produces h2 co and co2 gases which generates microporous structure 54 55 in the previous studies higher surface area of koh activated carbons from different precursors was reported 47 51 activation temperature and koh precursor ratio impregnation ratio are the main driving forces of total surface and micropore area it can be also stated that high temperature and high impregnation koh precursor ratio could enhance the surface area at the expense of mass yield 56 57 in our study activation temperature and koh precursor ratio was selected as 700 c and 1 1 respectively which can be considered as moderate conditions for koh activation to avoid yield loss bet surface areas of co2 activated co and co pe were found to be 501 and 788 m2 g respectively which were found to be higher than that of wastewater sludge hydrochar 58 carbonized polyacrylonitrile 23 and lower than that of coconut shell 12 and polyurethane 59 co zncl2 and co pe zncl2 had the highest surface area and micropore volume among the activated carbons which correspond to 1906 m2 g 0 654 ml g and 1795 m2 g 682 ml g respectively it is noteworthy to indicate that pe zncl2 had relatively lower surface area than those activated by zncl2 according to the findings in previous studies two step procedure including htc followed by activation was compared with direct activation of textile wastes 21 22 and it was found that htc as pretreatment of textile waste could improve surface area and microporosity yu et al 22 activated polyester fabric at 500 c at a zncl2 precursor ratio of 1 10 yielding activated carbon with a surface area of 467 6 m2 g in our study the surface area of pe zncl2 activated carbon which was activated at same temperature with much lower zncl2 precursor ratio 1 1 was found to be 554 m2 g besides xia et al 21 found that activated carbon produced by zncl2 activation precursor zncl2 ratio 1 1 5 of cotton textile wastes had a surface area of 1854 70 m2 g which was slightly lower than co zncl2 in current study noting that microporous surface area of activated cotton textile waste 440 m2 g was significantly lower than that of co zncl2 1368 m2 g in literature no study has been reported regarding activation of textile waste hydrochars up to date besides htc activation process of biomass has been mostly performed in presence of koh 60 the surface areas of koh activated carbon from different hydrochars derived from starch sawdust hazelnut shell etc was much higher than that from textile wastes reported in current study on the other hand our results obtained from zncl2 activation experiments are in agreement with a previous study by zhu et al 61 they demonstrated the fabrication of high surface area activated carbons 1296 m2 g using salix psammophila hydrochar by zncl2 activation they also reported that the porosity of hydrochars obtained from different conditions had an influence of surface area of obtained activated carbon considering the discussion above it can be deduced that both activation agent and precursor type had strongly affect on the surface area and micropore volume of the activated carbons 3 2 5 sem images of activated carbons the surface morphologies of porous carbon obtained from textile waste hydrochars were determined by using sem analysis as seen from fig 3 the morphological difference between the activated carbons suggests that activation agent and precursor type plays an important role during activation process even though fiber like structure of co2 derived activated carbons co co2 and co pe co2 was almost preserved the original morphological structure of hydrochars obtained from textile wastes some parts were horizontally fractured and deformed particularly inner surface of fiber all textile waste derived hydrochars had a serious deformation during koh activation and obvious difference in morphology of activated carbons co koh exhibited cheese like porous structure with larger cavities whereas more disordered structure and smaller pores were observed in case of co pe koh and pe koh notably a large number of ultra micropores were seen on koh activated hydrochars images at higher magnification fig s4 it can be suggested that koh activation may take place over formation of ultra micropores subsequently collapse of these pores into large cavities leading to reduction of surface area 62 it should be also noted that ultra microporosity could not be measured by n2 adsorption due to the limitation of n2 diffusion at low temperature 196 c and pressure 63 in case of zncl2 activation different morphologies were observed depending on hydrochar type co zncl2 had smoother surface whereas the surface of co pe zncl2 was relatively rough and deformed nevertheless small pores on the surface were detected in sem images fig 3 which is in accordance with surface area of co zncl2 and co pe zncl2 on the other hand pe zncl2 exhibited a highly destructed and cracked morphology as in the case with pe koh 3 3 adsorption tests 3 3 1 effect of adsorption time on removal efficiencies and kinetic study to determine the equilibrium time batch experiments with various adsorption times between 1 and 30 h were carried out for each activated carbon with activated carbon amount of 0 05 g 1 g l in a 50 ml of 150 ppm otc solution removal efficiencies were presented in table 5 among the activated carbons the highest removal was achieved in case of co zncl2 and co pe zncl2 which is probably related to their higher surface areas table 4 otc adsorption was completed in 1 h for co zncl2 and co pe zncl2 while removal efficiencies reached 98 2 and 97 9 within 10 min respectively adsorption performance of co zncl2 and co pe zncl2 revealed that high porous area and pore volume facilitated faster mass transfer and enhanced the removal efficiency via pore filling mechanism 9 due to its relatively lower surface area 554 m2 g removal rate of otc with pe zncl2 was lower than that with co zncl2 and co pe zncl2 providing 88 7 removal of otc even after 30 h removal efficiency of co pe co2 altered from 61 8 to 82 4 with increase of adsorption time from 6 to 30 h which was close to that of pe zncl2 at 30 h nevertheless it is obviously seen that zncl2 had the most effective agent to obtain activated carbon for otc adsorption it is noteworthy to say that there was no correlation determined between surface area micropore volume and removal efficiency considering all obtained activated carbons besides pore filling mechanism adsorption is governed by various mechanisms namely electrostatic interaction van der waals force hydrophobic force hydrogen bonding π π interactions cation exchange and pore size selective adsorption etc 64 65 as confirmed by raman spectra zncl2 activated carbons had high ordered graphitic structure which provided the occurrence of π π electron donor acceptor interactions during otc adsorption overall it was concluded that besides high surface area and micropore volume graphitic structure of zncl2 activated carbons also contributed to higher adsorption performance via π π interaction between graphitic carbon in adsorbent and aromatic rings of otc molecules 9 on the other hand adsorption performance of koh activated carbons was lower even for adsorption time of 30 h ranging from 21 to 68 otc removal table 5 among the koh activated carbons removal efficiency of pe koh was relatively higher even though pe koh had the lowest surface area 363 m2 g it can be associated with presence of oxygenated functional groups and highest amount of surface acidic groups 7 acidic functional groups in pe koh may interact with otc via hydrogen bonding 66 among all activated carbons co koh exhibited the lowest removal efficiency 21 after 30 h as seen from sem images excessive formation of macropores and large cavities might have been resulted in poor adsorption performance according to the removal efficiencies it is deduced that the influence of activation type on adsorption performance was higher than that of hydrochar type in order to determine adsorption rate and potential rate limiting steps with kinetic models co zncl2 and co pe zncl2 were selected which exhibited best otc removal performance it is noteworthy to say that 150 ppm of otc was completely adsorbed even in 10 min therefore kinetic studies were performed at high otc concentration 500 ppm at the early stage of the adsorption adsorbed otc amount qt decreased rapidly and then otc adsorption rate became slower with the increasing time fig 4 a as seen from the linearity of first and second order kinetic models fig 4 b and c pseudo second order model satisfactorily fitted the experimental data for both activated carbons with correlation coefficient r2 0 99 values close to 1 table 6 calculated qe values from pseudo second order model were also closer to experimental qe values than that from pseudo first order model therefore it can be assumed that otc adsorption rate of otc with co zncl2 and co pe zncl2 was mainly controlled by chemisorption rate constant of second order model showed that co zncl2 had faster adsorption rate than that of co pe zncl2 adsorption mechanism is generally governed by three stages mass transfer external film resistance and internal diffusion mass transfer adsorption on surface active sites and intra particle diffusion by pore diffusion since second stage occurs rapidly the adsorption of large antibiotic molecules is controlled by mass transfer and or intra particle diffusion different diffusion mechanism can be explained by intra particle diffusion model eq 10 as shown in fig 4 d multi linearity of intra particle diffusion model revealed that the adsorption mechanism proceeded through different diffusion stages two stages were identified for co zncl2 while intra particle diffusion model co pe zncl2 possessed three stages the first stage was probably related to film diffusion of which rate constant ki1 was relatively higher than other stages 67 this result confirmed that the rate limiting step was likely due to internal diffusion mass transfer and intra particle diffusion into micropores moreover the linear plot did not pass through the origin ci 0 which means that there were other mechanisms than intra particle diffusion 9 68 in order to ensure adsorption equilibrium for all activated carbon 24 h was selected as the adsorption time for further studies at different adsorbent dosage and concentration 3 3 2 effect of activated carbon dosage effect of activated carbon dosage on otc adsorption was investigated for co zncl2 and co pe zncl2 which gave the highest removal efficiency as shown in fig 5 with increasing activated carbon dosage from 0 25 to 1 g l removal efficiency ascended from 25 8 and 24 3 to 98 8 and 95 8 for co zncl2 and co pe zncl2 respectively removal efficiency of otc proportionally increased with increasing activated carbon dosage from 0 25 to 1 g l in case of 1 g l dosage 100 removal cannot be completed due to the lack of accessible active sites since activated sites were mostly occupied by otc molecules and lower otc concentration in equilibrium therefore removal efficiency of otc could be completely accomplished with adsorbent amount of 1 5 g l 3 3 3 adsorption isotherms two langmuir and freundlich and three parameter sips and redlich peterson isotherm models were used to describe the adsorption performance of activated carbons for isotherm studies 1 g l of adsorbent dosage was selected equilibrium studies were carried out using initial otc concentrations between 50 and 250 ppm for 24 h since otc adsorption almost completed at these concentrations isotherm studies for co zncl2 and co pe zncl2 were conducted using solutions with initial otc concentrations ranging from 300 and 800 ppm isotherm constants sse and r2 values were shown in table 7 according to r2 and sse values three parameter isotherms were the best fit for all activated carbons activated carbons except for co koh and co pe koh followed redlich peterson isotherm model while otc adsorption with co koh and co pe koh obeyed sips isotherm models this indicated that adsorption process proceeded over both homogenous and heterogeneous surface in activated carbon depending on the concentration of otc molecules since both three parameter isotherms are hybrid adsorption mechanism they can overcome the limitations of the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models lower 1 n value of sips and redlich peterson models is an indication of heterogeneous structure and when it is close to 1 the models fall onto langmuir isotherms according to sips model co koh and co pe koh had lower 1 n values indicating that the heterogeneous adsorption mechanism took place on the other hand in case of activated carbons that followed redlich peterson models 1 n values were much closer to 1 which implied that otc adsorption was homogeneous among the obtained activated carbons freundlich adsorption capacity kf of co koh and co pe koh was the lowest 5 4 and 5 9 respectively which was in line with low removal efficiency of otc rl values were found between 0 and 1 revealing favorable adsorption behavior of activated carbons note that rl values of zncl2 and co2 activated carbons were zero or very close to zero which implied that the adsorption of otc was nearly irreversible in previous studies freundlich and langmuir models were mostly utilized to fit the otc adsorption isotherms with activated carbon 7 31 33 whereas limited studies were found which evaluated otc adsorption with three parameter model namely dubinin radushkevich 6 29 and brouers sotolongo isotherm 30 it was reported that langmuir model mostly provided better fit to otc adsorption isotherm comparing with the freundlich equations langmuir adsorption capacities of activated carbon can be used to compare adsorption performance of various adsorbents the maximum adsorption capacity sm was observed to be 621 2 and 482 8 mg g for co zncl2 and co pe zncl2 respectively in literature sm values of otp adsorption with carbon based adsorbents have been reported as 564 97 mg g for lotus stalk based activated carbon 7 58 85 mg g for magnetic montmorillonite biochar 33 325 59 mg g for multiwalled carbon nanotube loaded iron metal organic framework 31 72 9 mg g for iron loaded activated carbon derived from the corn stalk 6 407 5 mg g for koh activated tomato peeled biochar 9 534 8 mg g for mesoporous activated carbons 29 and 263 8 mg g for h3po4 activated forest residue 30 on the other hand sm values of activated carbon aerogel 32 and koh activated garlic peel with ultra high specific surface area 8 were found to be 813 80 mg g and 1393 8 mg g respectively which were higher than that of co zncl2 reported in current study besides hao et al 69 summarized maximum adsorption capacity of otc onto different adsorbents such as zeolite hydroxyapatite cufe2o4 nimgal ldh composite reduced graphene oxide with the zro2 nanocomposite etc varying between 33 3 mg g and 278 3 mg g 4 conclusion the aim of this study was to produce activated carbon from textile wastes as environmentally friendly and low cost adsorbent for otc removal from aqueous solution activated carbons were prepared by chemical zncl2 and koh and physical co2 activation of hydrochars which were previously obtained from cotton polyester and cotton polyster mixture fibers the results showed that zncl2 activated carbons had the best otc removal performance related to their higher surface area as well as highly graphitic structure specifically cotton based zncl2 activated carbon exhibited highest surface area 1906 m2 g and otc adsorption capacity 621 2 mg g whereas polyester based adsorbent had moderate adsorption performance and surface area in addition to high surface area highly graphitized structure of zncl2 activated carbons improved the otc performance by increasing the π π interaction between the adsorbent and otc molecules on the other hand although the highest surface functional groups were observed in case of koh activated carbons otc adsorption capacities were found to be relatively lower activated carbon fitted best to three parameter isotherm models namely sips or redlich peterson isotherms indicating that adsorption can proceed on both homogenous and heterogeneous surface depending on the concentration of otc molecules hydrothermal carbonization as a pretreatment can improve the activation performance of textile waste yielding activated carbon with higher surface area and micropore volume by using less activation agent as conclusion zncl2 activated carbons obtained from cotton or cotton polyester derived hydrochars can be utilized as an adsorbent due to its high removal performance abundance of resource and high purity considering its superior properties such as high porosity micropore volume and graphite like structure zncl2 activated carbons have also great potential for utilization in different advanced applications such as catalyst catalyst support electrode in super capacitance or h2 storage etc therefore further studies can focus on the production of porous carbon from raw and hydrothermally treated textile wastes at different zncl2 precursor ratios and its utilization particularly as energy storage material

13395,high performance activated carbons from textile wastes were successfully developed for the removal of oxytetracycline otc from aqueous solution for this purpose textile wastes consist of cotton co polyester pe and cotton polyester co pe were subjected to hydrothermal carbonization htc as a pretreatment followed by chemical zncl2 and koh and physical co2 activation to obtain activated carbon results showed that both activation agents and textile waste types had considerable effects on activated carbon properties and otc removal the highest surface area was achieved by zncl2 activation of co 1906 m2 g and co pe hydrochars 1795 m2 g which exhibited the best oxytetracycline otc adsorption performance with a capacity of 621 2 mg g and 482 8 mg g respectively activated carbon fitted best to three parameter isotherm models namely sips or redlich peterson isotherms indicating that adsorption can proceed on both homogenous and heterogeneous surface depending on the concentration of otc molecules the three parameter sips isotherm model provided the best fit for co koh and co pe koh whereas adsorption of zncl2 and co2 activated carbons followed both redlich peterson isotherm model kinetic data of both activated carbons was best described by pseudo second order model also revealing that co zncl2 had faster adsorption rate than that of co pe zncl2 for co and co pe hydrochars the surface areas of koh and co2 activated carbons were relatively lower than zncl2 activated carbons nevertheless koh activation was rich in acidic surface groups while co2 activation led to form activated carbons with high carbon content 90 in the light of these findings hydrothermal carbonization can be considered as a pretreatment which allows conversion of textile wastes into promising precursor for porous carbon production while the process was not appropriate to produce solid fuel graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords textile wastes porous carbon adsorption hydrothermal carbonization 1 introduction chemical industries such as pharmaceutical textile plastics petroleum paper etc discharge a vast amount of wastewater which is severely contaminated with organic pollutants among these pollutants antibiotics are in the list of emerging group of environmental pollutants and increasing level of antibiotic concentration in aqueous systems has become global concern 1 even though the concentration of antibiotics in wastewater is low some types of antibiotics accumulate in the environment because of low biodegradability and cause potential risks for both human and aquatic environment such as antibiotic resistance in microorganisms acute chronic toxicity and cancer particularly the tetracycline antibiotics are known as being resistant to degradation and cannot easily be metabolized by humans and animals 2 therefore a special concern has been devoted to develop effective methods for removal of antibiotics from wastewater a variety of physicochemical and biological treatments have been investigated namely adsorption photo degradation catalytic oxidation chemical precipitation membrane filtration and bioremoval 2 3 due to the operation simplicity economic feasibility high efficiency adsorption has superiority in comparison with other removal technologies activated carbon is commonly used as an adsorbent for removal of tetracycline group antibiotics from wastewater in the literature various types of biomass including sewage and industrial sludge 4 corn stover 5 corn stalk 6 lotus stalk 7 garlic skin 8 pomelo peel 9 olive oil solid waste 10 willow branch 11 coconut shell 12 microalgae 13 etc have been tested to produce activated carbon via two main processes physical and chemical activation chemical activation is carried out in the presence of activating agent koh zncl2 h3po4 etc at a temperature range of 400 c 800 c while physical activation uses co2 steam or limited o2 air at higher temperatures 800 c the chemical and structural properties of activated carbon are mostly affected by biomass and activation type as well as activation conditions among physical activators co2 is more preferable as an activator due to its ease of handling and control clean and high activity on the other hand zncl2 and koh are the most common chemical activating agents and have some superiorities koh creates of micropores and ultramicropores and zncl2 activation takes place at lower activation temperatures 450 c 600 c chen et al 14 compared activated carbons obtained from chemical and physical activation processes and reported that chemical activation produced activated carbon with high porosity whereas co2 activation resulted in formation of lower surface area and higher micropore volume in a recent study by yagmur et al 15 influence of precursor type oleaster fruit and fruit fractions and activation agent koh and zncl2 on properties of activated carbon was comparatively investigated they found that activated carbons obtained from zncl2 activation had higher surface area and micropore volume than that from koh activation they also claimed that zncl2 produced activated carbon with high graphitization while aromatic structure was destroyed in presence of koh in the last decade hydrothermal carbonization has gained great attention as a pretreatment of biomass prior to activation processes or to utilize as solid fuel 16 hydrothermal carbonization htc is a thermochemical process which occurs at relatively low temperatures 180 300 c under autogenous pressure in presence of water although htc is mostly applied to biomass having high moisture content recirculation process can be also performed without extra water requirement which allows utilization of dry biomass in htc systems 17 a number of studies focus on improvement of fuel properties of biomass by htc treatment resulting in increased carbon content hhv value and reduced oxygen and ash content 18 htc pretreatment of biomass for activated carbon production was also attempted via two step process approach htc treatment physical chemical activation jain et al 19 40 reported that htc treatment of biomass enriched the oxygenated groups on the surface and increased the porosity which improved performance of the activation process recently a comprehensive review on htc pretreatment of biomass for activated carbon production has been provided by fernandez sanroman et al 16 although non activated hydrochars have been tested as adsorbent for pollutant removal in a number of studies hydrochar adsorption performance significantly enhanced by chemical or physical activation due to increase in the surface area formation of more homogeneous surface high porosity etc commercial utilization of biomass for activated carbon production is limited by undesirable properties such as high ash content low carbon content poor purity and heterogeneity alternatively textile wastes containing cotton and polyesters can overcome this problem yielding activated carbon with high reproducibility and purity excessive consumption of textile brings along a huge amount of textile waste even though governments charities and industrial enterprises encourage consumers for recycling and reducing of textile usage there is still a high output that goes to the landfill and burns in incinerators in europe only 1 5 millions tons of textiles are recycled which corresponds only 75 of total textile wastes 20 there are a few numbers of studies dealing with the production of activated carbon from textile wastes 21 23 xia et al 21 studied production of activated carbon from waste cotton via chemical activation zncl2 h3po4 and fecl3 and reported that zncl2 activated carbon exhibited highest cr vi adsorption performance in a study of yu et al 22 porous activated carbon derived from waste polyester fabric was successfully synthesized by zncl2 activation polyacrylonitrile which is one of the raw materials of textile fibers was also used to produce activated carbon via koh and co2 activation with a surface area of 2133 m2 g and 212 m2 g respectively 23 the main concern regarding production of activated carbon can be related to low bulk density of textile wastes causing difficulties during activation process particularly in large scale applications transformation of textile wastes into biochar by pyrolysis or hydrochar by hydrothermal carbonization can intensify the mass density as well as increase the carbon content a study by hanoglu et al 24 reported that pyrolysis of different types of textile wastes containing cotton viscose polyester acrylic and viscose enhanced carbon content and improved fuel properties of textile wastes in another study cotton textile waste derived biochar was obtained by pyrolysis at 700 c then activated with zncl2 25 however the surface area of obtained activated biochar was found relatively low 292 m2 g on the other hand htc of textile wastes were assessed in a limited number of studies to obtain microspheres and hydrochars as solid fuel 26 28 lin et al 26 summarized the combustion behavior of hydrochars obtained from textile wastes at different htc conditions they reported that htc treatment of cotton waste at 230 c for 1 h led to increase c content from 50 3 to 55 4 and reduce volatile matter from 81 1 to 74 8 based on combustion test ignition and burnout temperatures significantly decreased and maximum combustion rate was considerably improved which exhibited high reactivity against oxidative agents recently same research group also reported hydrothermal carbonization of municipal solid waste mixture containing waste textile 27 oxytetracycline otc a kind of tetracycline type antibiotics has a widespread usage in human and animal infection treatment because of its high activity in broad spectrum therefore special attention is focused on the removal of otc from aqueous solutions by adsorption with diverse range of adsorbents including activated carbons 6 9 29 33 it is clear that there is a research gap on utilization of different types of textile waste to produce activated carbon despite the extensive attention on production of activated carbon from biomass there are only few studies regarding the utilization of textile wastes as activated carbon precursor moreover to the best our knowledge utilization of hydrochars derived from textile wastes for activated carbon production hasn t been reported up to date herein textile wastes of cotton cotton polyester mixture and polyester were evaluated to produce activated carbon with chemical and physical activation methods prior to activation textile wastes were subjected to hydrothermal carbonization to improve activation process as in the case of biomass activation processes the change in chemical structure after htc was assessed by elemental tga and ftir analyses the effect of textile waste type and activation methods on chemical and morphological properties of activated carbon was comparatively investigated otc adsorption studies were also performed to discuss the relation between the properties and adsorption capacities of the produced activated carbons 2 material and methods 2 1 material cotton co cotton polyester co pe and polyester pe textile wastes were kindly supplied from a textile factory in izmir textile wastes were shredded into smaller pieces 5 mm with scissors zncl2 2h2o and koh were purchased from sigma aldrich oxytetracycline hydrochloride otc doga ilac purity 99 was used for the adsorption studies as a representative of antibiotics elemental analysis of textile wastes was given in table 1 2 2 production of hydrochar htc experiments were conducted in stainless steel reactor 0 45 l with a magnetic stirrer buchi glassuster under pressure a detailed description of the htc system has been reported in our previous study 18 10 g of textile wastes were mixed with 150 ml of water mixture was loaded to the reactor and the lid was sealed with o ring reactor was purged with n2 and the initial pressure was adjusted to 10 bar the reactor was then heated to the desired temperature with a heating rate of 5 c min and held at desired temperature for 1 h after 1 h reactor was rapidly cooled down to room temperature with the maximum cooling rate the hydrochar was collected by vacuum filtration and washed with deionized water finally hydrochar was dried at 100 c for 24 h htc temperature was screened from 210 c to 240 c depending on feedstock type to obtain brownish hydrochar fig s1 htc temperature was selected as 230 c for co and co pe considering the mass yield in case of pe carbonization did not take place even at higher temperature up to 280 c yielding only white powder instead of brownish hydrochar since mass yield of pe did not change with increasing temperature htc temperature was selected as 230 c for comparison although hydrochar was not obtained by htc of pe white solid product was also named as hydrochar hydrochars were denoted as co h co pe h and pe h for hydrochars derived from co co pe and pe respectively 2 3 activation of hydrochars hydrochars derived from textile waste were activated by chemical and physical methods activation conditions were determined based on optimum conditions in our previous studies 34 35 for zncl2 activation temperature of 500 c was selected which was found as optimum temperature in our previous study 34 in the same manner co2 activation temperature of 900 c was tested according to our previous study which was performed in the same system 35 since activated carbons produced from co h and co pe h at 900 c gave very low yield 9 co2 activation experiments were carried out at lower temperature 850 c for 3 h in case of koh activation the lowest temperature at which koh can be activated 700 c was selected due to the high reactivity of hydrochars for zncl2 and koh activation activator precursor ratio was fixed to 1 1 aiming less chemical consumption chemical activation was carried out by impregnation method with zncl2 and koh 10 g of zncl2 or koh was dissolved in approximately 20 ml of water 10 g of hydrochar was impregnated with zncl2 or koh solutions with a mass ratio of 1 1 the mixed slurry was dried in an oven overnight at 100 c the dried mixture was activated at 500 c for zncl2 and 700 c for koh under n2 flow 100 ml min for 1 h the reactor residue was then refluxed with 150 ml of 10 hcl solution for 1 h and filtered under vacuum washed with warm distilled water until no chloride ions was observed in filtrate the activated carbon samples were dried at 100 c for 24 h and sieved to the particle size less than 100 μm physical activation of hydrochar was performed under co2 atmosphere hydrochar was placed in a stainless steel pyrolysis reactor and heated to 850 c under n2 with a 100 ml min with a heating rate of 10 c min once the temperature inside the reactor reached to 850 c n2 flow was switched to co2 with a flow rate of 100 ml min for 3 h at the end of the activation time the reactor was allowed to cool down to room temperature under n2 flow all activated carbons were labeled as follows type of textile waste hydrochar co co pe or pe as their hydrochars activation method zncl2 koh or co2 and stored in sealed bottles for further analysis all htc experiments were conducted at least 3 times and activation experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate relative standard deviations for hydrochar and activated carbon yields were found to be less than 3 5 and 1 5 respectively 2 4 analysis elemental analysis of textile wastes hydrochars and activated carbons were carried out using elemental analyzer leco chns model according to astm 5291 96 proximate and elemental analyses were performed in duplicate relative deviation of analysis results was found to be less than 5 functional groups present in the textile wastes and corresponding activated carbons were determined by perkin elmer ftir spectroscopy coupled with attenuated total reflectance atr in the scanning range of 4000 600 cm 1 the surface functional groups of activated carbons was clarified by boehm titration 36 which is based on the assumption that naoh neutralizes all acidic groups carboxylic lactonic phenolic groups na2co3 neutralizes carboxyl groups and lactonic groups nahco3 neutralizes only carboxyl groups raman spectra of the activated carbons were recorded by using confocal raman spectrometer renishaw invia combined with a laser utilizing a lambda excitation of 514 nm all measurements were carried out with a 20 optical microscope and 2400 groove mm 1 density grating thermogravimetric analysis was performed by perkin elmer diamond tg dta analyzer at a heating rate of 10 c min in the temperature range of 25 c and 850 c under n2 flow 100 ml min to explore thermal behavior of textile wastes and their hydrochars brunauer emmett and teller bet surface area and pore volume of the activated carbons were analyzed by the help of n2 adsorption at 77 k quantachrome autosorb iq2 prior to measurement all activated carbons were degassed at 300 c for 3 h the morphology of activated carbon was explored by scanning electron microscopy sem and the images were taken at various magnitudes by thermo scientific apreo s microscope prior to analysis activated carbons were coated with gold to provide the necessary conductivity for high image quality 2 5 adsorption tests taking otc as an example of antibiotic pollutants the batch adsorption experiments were performed at different initial concentrations 50 800 mg l times 1 30h and activated carbon dosage 0 25 1 5 g l in a typical adsorption experiment activated carbon was added to 250 ml flask containing 50 ml of otc solution without ph adjustment ph ranges from 3 5 to 4 5 the mixtures for different experiments were shaken in an orbital shaker at 200 rpm at room temperature at the end of experiment suspension was filtered using a filter paper whatmann no 42 paper equilibrium concentration of the filtrates was determined immediately by a uv vis spectrometer uv 160a shimadzu at a wavelength of 276 nm all adsorption tests were performed in duplicate for each activated carbons and the results showed that the relative errors were less than 5 the amount of adsorbed otc qe mg g and removal efficiency were calculated by eqs

activated carbons in order to examine the adsorption behavior of activated carbon two parameter models freundlich and langmuir model and three parameter models sips and redlich peterson were tested by interpreting the data from the adsorption experiments langmuir adsorption model presented a monolayer adsorption covering on the surface equally while freundlich model assumes that heterogeneous energies on adsorbent surface varied with surface coverage the redlich peterson model approaches the freundlich model at high concentrations and the langmuir isotherm at low concentration in contrast the sips model reduces to freundlich isotherm model at low adsorbate concentration while at high concentration it predicts a monolayer adsorption capacity characteristic of the langmuir isotherm

density and energy yield were calculated according to previous study 24 the content of c in textile wastes were ranked in the order of pe co pe co nitrogen and ash content of textile wastes were probably originated from dyes and other additives carbon content of co h and co pe h was found to be higher than those of their parent textile wastes increase in c content with htc pretreatment of textile wastes may be arisen from mainly decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions 27 on the other hand h content of co pe considerably decreased after htc process apart from decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions dehydration and dehydrogenation reactions might also take place which are responsible of reduction of h content in hydrochar 28 39 the mass yields of co h and co pe h was found to be 62 1 and 52 1 respectively on the contrary to cotton based textile wastes htc of pe did not significantly change the elemental composition and gave relatively high mass yield of 83 9 table 1 it is noteworthy to say that pe fibers did not undergo carbonization reactions at severe conditions at 280 c 60 80 mpa remaining as white powder fig s1 this was probably due to the depolymerization of pe into lower molecular weight components under htc conditions the elemental composition of pe and pe h were in agreement with the findings of study by iniguez et al 40 which reported negligible difference in c content of raw polymer mixture and its hydrochars it should be also noted that htc treatment increased hhv values to some extent from 17 3 to 20 6 mj kg only for co whereas hhv value and energy density were remained nearly constant in case of co pe and pe therefore it can be concluded that htc of waste textiles is not an appropriate route for solid fuel production pyrolysis or torrefaction of textile waste is more promising technique for biochar production to use as solid fuel which was reported in previous study 24 they stated that biochar obtained from pyrolysis of cotton fiber hhv 16 2 mj kg at 300 c had a high calorific value of 28 0 mj kg with a high energy density 1 73 energy yield 87 47 3 1 2 tga analysis of textile wastes and their hydrochars tg and dtg curves under n2 atmosphere were obtained to examine thermal degradation behavior of textile wastes and their hydrochars fig 1 the weight loss around 90 100 c associated with moisture was observed in the case of co and co pe as indicated in dtg curves of co and co h htc pretreatment had a little impact on thermal decomposition fig 1 a temperature at maximum decomposition rate tm slightly shifted to lower temperature from 371 c to 352 c decomposition of pe gave only one peak with tm of 435 c fig 1 b after subjecting to htc a new peak was appeared at lower temperature range between 295 and 393 c tm 353 c and the intensity of peak at 435 c weakened due to the decomposition of pe into lower molecular weight compounds during htc depolymerization and or hydrolysis of pe may occur under htc conditions yielding less stable structures it is also important to note that depolymerization and or hydrolysis of pe was not accompanied by formation of water soluble fractions most of depolymerized pe products remained as water insoluble solid after htc treatment in case of co pe two clear peaks at the temperature ranges between 300 and 380 c and 380 470 c were observed partially overlapping with dtg curves of co and pe respectively fig 1 c former peak is associated with co and the latter peak is related to pe component after subjecting to htc treatment the intensity of second peak around 380 470 c dramatically dropped because of depolymerization of pe and one main peak was evolved close to the temperature range of the first peak tm 310 c shifting tm values of the main peaks to lower temperature ranges indicated that htc treatment had an adverse effect on thermal stability for each textile wastes it is due to the fact that textile wastes underwent hydrolysis reactions resulting in depolymerization of co and pe fibers moreover it is concluded that polymeric structures in textile wastes decompose into high volatile substances during htc process 26 our results clearly showed that the htc behaviors of textile wastes and biomass were distinctly different generally hydrochars derived from biomass have mostly higher thermal stability compared to their parent biomasses for example a study dealing with htc of pinewood dust stated that degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose led to production of more stable hydrochars which decomposed at higher temperatures 41 on the other hand gunarathne et al 42 also stated that depolymerization of hemicellulose took place during htc of brewery residues and some part of depolymerization products remained in hydrochar resulting a formation of dtg peak at earlier stages similar to our results iniguez et al 40 found that thermal stability of hydrochars from marine plastic debris at different temperatures was lower than raw waste 3 1 3 ftir spectra of textile wastes and hydrochars ftir spectroscopy was performed to investigate the impacts of hydrothermal treatment on the structure of textile wastes fig 2 as seen from fig 2 functional groups in co remained almost same after hydrothermal treatment the broad peak around 3330 cm 1 is associated to oh vibration owing to inter intra or free molecular bound hydroxyl group in co and coh a very small peak at 2900 cm 1 was observed which is due to ch stretching vibrations of alkyl aliphatic groups the main characteristic peaks were observed between 900 cm 1 and 1200 cm 1 the co stretching of ether c o c and hydroxyl c o h group in anhydroglucose ring appeared at 1160 and 1100 cm 1 respectively 43 the peak at 1030 cm 1 is associated with co stretching vibration of primary alcohols the peaks at 710 and 665 cm 1 are owing to oh out of plane bending of alcohols 44 in opposition to co and co pe based textile wastes htc process altered the chemical structure of pe even though the elemental composition was very similar the peak at 1714 cm 1 in spectra of pe is attributed to carbonyl stretching of ester group which is found in the polyester structure this characteristic carbonyl peak shifted to 1685 cm 1 after htc process randviir et al 45 reported that new peak at 1685 cm 1 instead of peak around 1714 cm 1 was related to formation of ketone or carboxylic acid which is conjugated with a phenyl ring or cc bond the existence of aromatic groups can be explained by cc aromatic stretching peak at 1409 cm 1 in both pe and pe h for pe the peak at 1240 cm 1 belongs to phenolic co stretching vibration and the peak at 1090 cm 1 belongs to co bending of the ester group for pe h the new peak was observed at 1280 cm 1 partially overlapped with the peak at 1240 cm 1 indicating oh stretching of phenolic compounds while new peaks appeared in pe h at 1130 cm 1 and 1100 cm 1 which are associated with co vibration of alcohol probably due to the dehydration of pe in htc in case of co pe ftir spectrum of raw waste and hydrochar illustrated that they had similar functional groups of both pe and co and their parent hydrochars respectively 3 2 characterization of activation carbon production 3 2 1 elemental analysis and yield of activated carbons hydrochars derived from textile wastes were subjected two different activation processes namely chemical with zncl2 and koh and physical with co2 activation in case of co2 activation hydrothermal treated pe was completely decomposed because of its high reactivity under activation conditions which was discarded for the characterization studies thus 8 different types of activated carbons were obtained and characterized in order to investigate potential application as carbon based adsorbent the mass yield and elemental composition of activated carbons were given in table 2 the mass yield of activated carbons obtained by chemical activation was higher than that by physical activation on the other hand the type of chemical activation agent had a little impact on mass yields of activated carbons among chemically activated carbons co derived activated carbons gave the highest mass yield 36 8 activated carbon with high c content was achieved in case of zncl2 and co2 activation the highest c content of activated carbons was obtained with co pe h which were 90 6 for zncl2 activation and 90 9 for co2 activation in fact reverse boundard reaction takes place co2 c s 2co where some part of carbon is gasified to form porous structure during co2 activation process co2 activation at higher temperatures induced the decomposition of most of oxygenated compounds in hydrochars 46 resulting in enrichment of c content in activated carbons on the other hand lower oxygen and higher c content of zncl2 activated carbons indicated that activation process proceeds through dehydration reactions rather than decarboxylation reactions 19 koh based activated carbons had relatively lower c content from 71 7 to 76 3 compared to zncl2 and co2 activation according to reactions given below koh is directly attacked to carbon in hydrochars to form porous network remaining activated carbon with lower c content and high o content 11 6koh 2c 2k 2 co 3 2 k 3h 2 12 2k 2 co 3 k 2 o co 2 13 2k 2 co 3 2c 2 k 3co 14 k 2 o c 2 k 3co for h content of activated carbons this also depends on activation agent in case of koh activation the main reason of low h content is related to dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by k2co3 k2o formed during activation 47 among all obtained activated carbons co2 activated carbons had the lowest h content due to the aromatization reactions high activation temperature 850 c 48 h c and o c ratios of activated carbons revealed that co2 produced highly condensed and aromatic structure lower h c ratio whereas koh activated carbons possessed more oxygenated structures higher o c ratio 3 2 2 functional groups of activated carbons 3 2 2 1 ftir analysis of activated carbon independently of waste type the presence of functional groups dramatically changed by activation method fig s2 the high activation temperature of co2 process led to decompose the functional groups yielding activated carbons with less oxygen content 49 it should be also noted that co2 activated carbons had lower ftir peak intensities peaks around 1380 cm 1 and 1210 cm 1 represent co stretching vibration the peak 1570 cm 1 can be associated with aromatic cc stretching while the peak around 1710 cm 1 refers to carbonyl groups in case of koh activated carbons the intensity of peaks in co koh was lower than that in pe and co pe hydrochars particularly peak around 1100 cm 1 which is related to co vibration in phenolic structure was not observed in case of co koh for pe koh and co pe koh the characteristic ester peak at 1710 cm 1 in pe h and co pe h fig 2 disappeared probably due to the reduction of carbonyl groups into alcohol co stretching at 1080 cm 1 and alkyl aryl ether or aryl alcohol co stretching at 1205 cm 1 the peak at 1570 cm 1 can be attributed cc in the aromatic structure of activated carbons the peaks of hydrochars activated by zncl2 had a broad peak around 1160 cm 1which can be associated with co vibrations aromatic cc stretching at 1570 cm 1 was also observed in zncl2 activated carbons the peaks between 900 and 700 cm 1 particularly in pe zncl2 and co pe zncl2 can attributable to ch out of plane bending vibrations 50 3 2 2 2 surface acidic groups of activated carbon the surface acidic functional groups containing oxygen groups were quantitatively determined by boehm titration and the results are represented in table 3 total acidic groups vary between 0 68 and 1 29 mmol g depending on the activation method and hydrochar types koh activated carbons possessed the highest total acidic groups for each textile waste type high oxygen content of koh activated carbons can be also correlated with the acidic oxygen containing functional groups 51 koh oxidized the surface of the carbonaceous material by the substitution of h atoms with ok group in koh 47 the enhancement of acidic oxygenated functional groups on the carbon surface was observed in previous studies related to koh activation of hydrochars 52 and polystyrene based cation exchangeable resin 47 no carboxylic groups were found in co2 activated carbons but they possessed phenolic and lactonic groups on the surface of activated carbons the presence of lactonic and phenolic groups was also indicated in ftir spectrum fig s2 these results imply that co2 activation at 850 c led to destruction of carboxylic group but a small amount of weak acidic surface groups remained in activated carbon structure as indicated from table 3 surface oxygenated groups of activated carbons were dominated by phenolic and carboxylic acid groups in zncl2 activated carbons 3 2 3 raman spectrum of activated carbon raman spectroscopy analysis was employed in order to characterize the crystalline structure of activated carbons fig s3 two strong peaks at 1340 cm 1 and 1595 cm 1 were clearly observed for spectrum of all activated carbon the d band peak at 1340 cm 1 indicated the structure of disordered and defected carbon while the latter peak at 1595 cm 1 g band was associated with in plane vibration of sp2 bonded carbon there was an obvious difference in the intensities of d and g bands with respect to activation type and precursors zncl2 activation led to an increase in the intensities of d and g band particularly in case of activated carbon derived from pe containing precursors i d i g ratio is commonly used to evaluate the extent of disordered structure and degree of graphitization in which lower i d i g ratio indicates higher graphitization degree with less disordered structure the lowest i d i g values were obtained in case of zncl2 activated carbons implying that zncl2 activation led to increase the degree of graphitization on the other hand the values i d i g for co zncl2 were found to be higher than that for pe zncl2 and co pe zncl2 it can be concluded that activated carbon having high graphitic carbon was obtained from zncl2 activation of pe containing precursors moreover a broad peak around 2800 cm 1 2d band was only observed in the spectrum of zncl2 activated carbons which corresponds to the multilayer graphene phase structure 53 the raman results are also consistent with the previous work related to production of activated carbon from oleaster fruit by koh and zncl2 activation 15 3 2 4 bet surface area and pore volume of activated carbons bet surface area micropore area and pore volumes were presented in table 4 considering hydrochar types zncl2 activated carbons had the highest surface area and micropore areas in case of co and co pe the surface areas of koh and co2 activated carbons were close while micropore area of koh activated carbons was higher than that of co2 activated carbons during the koh activation the reaction between metallic potassium and carbon atoms produces h2 co and co2 gases which generates microporous structure 54 55 in the previous studies higher surface area of koh activated carbons from different precursors was reported 47 51 activation temperature and koh precursor ratio impregnation ratio are the main driving forces of total surface and micropore area it can be also stated that high temperature and high impregnation koh precursor ratio could enhance the surface area at the expense of mass yield 56 57 in our study activation temperature and koh precursor ratio was selected as 700 c and 1 1 respectively which can be considered as moderate conditions for koh activation to avoid yield loss bet surface areas of co2 activated co and co pe were found to be 501 and 788 m2 g respectively which were found to be higher than that of wastewater sludge hydrochar 58 carbonized polyacrylonitrile 23 and lower than that of coconut shell 12 and polyurethane 59 co zncl2 and co pe zncl2 had the highest surface area and micropore volume among the activated carbons which correspond to 1906 m2 g 0 654 ml g and 1795 m2 g 682 ml g respectively it is noteworthy to indicate that pe zncl2 had relatively lower surface area than those activated by zncl2 according to the findings in previous studies two step procedure including htc followed by activation was compared with direct activation of textile wastes 21 22 and it was found that htc as pretreatment of textile waste could improve surface area and microporosity yu et al 22 activated polyester fabric at 500 c at a zncl2 precursor ratio of 1 10 yielding activated carbon with a surface area of 467 6 m2 g in our study the surface area of pe zncl2 activated carbon which was activated at same temperature with much lower zncl2 precursor ratio 1 1 was found to be 554 m2 g besides xia et al 21 found that activated carbon produced by zncl2 activation precursor zncl2 ratio 1 1 5 of cotton textile wastes had a surface area of 1854 70 m2 g which was slightly lower than co zncl2 in current study noting that microporous surface area of activated cotton textile waste 440 m2 g was significantly lower than that of co zncl2 1368 m2 g in literature no study has been reported regarding activation of textile waste hydrochars up to date besides htc activation process of biomass has been mostly performed in presence of koh 60 the surface areas of koh activated carbon from different hydrochars derived from starch sawdust hazelnut shell etc was much higher than that from textile wastes reported in current study on the other hand our results obtained from zncl2 activation experiments are in agreement with a previous study by zhu et al 61 they demonstrated the fabrication of high surface area activated carbons 1296 m2 g using salix psammophila hydrochar by zncl2 activation they also reported that the porosity of hydrochars obtained from different conditions had an influence of surface area of obtained activated carbon considering the discussion above it can be deduced that both activation agent and precursor type had strongly affect on the surface area and micropore volume of the activated carbons 3 2 5 sem images of activated carbons the surface morphologies of porous carbon obtained from textile waste hydrochars were determined by using sem analysis as seen from fig 3 the morphological difference between the activated carbons suggests that activation agent and precursor type plays an important role during activation process even though fiber like structure of co2 derived activated carbons co co2 and co pe co2 was almost preserved the original morphological structure of hydrochars obtained from textile wastes some parts were horizontally fractured and deformed particularly inner surface of fiber all textile waste derived hydrochars had a serious deformation during koh activation and obvious difference in morphology of activated carbons co koh exhibited cheese like porous structure with larger cavities whereas more disordered structure and smaller pores were observed in case of co pe koh and pe koh notably a large number of ultra micropores were seen on koh activated hydrochars images at higher magnification fig s4 it can be suggested that koh activation may take place over formation of ultra micropores subsequently collapse of these pores into large cavities leading to reduction of surface area 62 it should be also noted that ultra microporosity could not be measured by n2 adsorption due to the limitation of n2 diffusion at low temperature 196 c and pressure 63 in case of zncl2 activation different morphologies were observed depending on hydrochar type co zncl2 had smoother surface whereas the surface of co pe zncl2 was relatively rough and deformed nevertheless small pores on the surface were detected in sem images fig 3 which is in accordance with surface area of co zncl2 and co pe zncl2 on the other hand pe zncl2 exhibited a highly destructed and cracked morphology as in the case with pe koh 3 3 adsorption tests 3 3 1 effect of adsorption time on removal efficiencies and kinetic study to determine the equilibrium time batch experiments with various adsorption times between 1 and 30 h were carried out for each activated carbon with activated carbon amount of 0 05 g 1 g l in a 50 ml of 150 ppm otc solution removal efficiencies were presented in table 5 among the activated carbons the highest removal was achieved in case of co zncl2 and co pe zncl2 which is probably related to their higher surface areas table 4 otc adsorption was completed in 1 h for co zncl2 and co pe zncl2 while removal efficiencies reached 98 2 and 97 9 within 10 min respectively adsorption performance of co zncl2 and co pe zncl2 revealed that high porous area and pore volume facilitated faster mass transfer and enhanced the removal efficiency via pore filling mechanism 9 due to its relatively lower surface area 554 m2 g removal rate of otc with pe zncl2 was lower than that with co zncl2 and co pe zncl2 providing 88 7 removal of otc even after 30 h removal efficiency of co pe co2 altered from 61 8 to 82 4 with increase of adsorption time from 6 to 30 h which was close to that of pe zncl2 at 30 h nevertheless it is obviously seen that zncl2 had the most effective agent to obtain activated carbon for otc adsorption it is noteworthy to say that there was no correlation determined between surface area micropore volume and removal efficiency considering all obtained activated carbons besides pore filling mechanism adsorption is governed by various mechanisms namely electrostatic interaction van der waals force hydrophobic force hydrogen bonding π π interactions cation exchange and pore size selective adsorption etc 64 65 as confirmed by raman spectra zncl2 activated carbons had high ordered graphitic structure which provided the occurrence of π π electron donor acceptor interactions during otc adsorption overall it was concluded that besides high surface area and micropore volume graphitic structure of zncl2 activated carbons also contributed to higher adsorption performance via π π interaction between graphitic carbon in adsorbent and aromatic rings of otc molecules 9 on the other hand adsorption performance of koh activated carbons was lower even for adsorption time of 30 h ranging from 21 to 68 otc removal table 5 among the koh activated carbons removal efficiency of pe koh was relatively higher even though pe koh had the lowest surface area 363 m2 g it can be associated with presence of oxygenated functional groups and highest amount of surface acidic groups 7 acidic functional groups in pe koh may interact with otc via hydrogen bonding 66 among all activated carbons co koh exhibited the lowest removal efficiency 21 after 30 h as seen from sem images excessive formation of macropores and large cavities might have been resulted in poor adsorption performance according to the removal efficiencies it is deduced that the influence of activation type on adsorption performance was higher than that of hydrochar type in order to determine adsorption rate and potential rate limiting steps with kinetic models co zncl2 and co pe zncl2 were selected which exhibited best otc removal performance it is noteworthy to say that 150 ppm of otc was completely adsorbed even in 10 min therefore kinetic studies were performed at high otc concentration 500 ppm at the early stage of the adsorption adsorbed otc amount qt decreased rapidly and then otc adsorption rate became slower with the increasing time fig 4 a as seen from the linearity of first and second order kinetic models fig 4 b and c pseudo second order model satisfactorily fitted the experimental data for both activated carbons with correlation coefficient r2 0 99 values close to 1 table 6 calculated qe values from pseudo second order model were also closer to experimental qe values than that from pseudo first order model therefore it can be assumed that otc adsorption rate of otc with co zncl2 and co pe zncl2 was mainly controlled by chemisorption rate constant of second order model showed that co zncl2 had faster adsorption rate than that of co pe zncl2 adsorption mechanism is generally governed by three stages mass transfer external film resistance and internal diffusion mass transfer adsorption on surface active sites and intra particle diffusion by pore diffusion since second stage occurs rapidly the adsorption of large antibiotic molecules is controlled by mass transfer and or intra particle diffusion different diffusion mechanism can be explained by intra particle diffusion model eq 10 as shown in fig 4 d multi linearity of intra particle diffusion model revealed that the adsorption mechanism proceeded through different diffusion stages two stages were identified for co zncl2 while intra particle diffusion model co pe zncl2 possessed three stages the first stage was probably related to film diffusion of which rate constant ki1 was relatively higher than other stages 67 this result confirmed that the rate limiting step was likely due to internal diffusion mass transfer and intra particle diffusion into micropores moreover the linear plot did not pass through the origin ci 0 which means that there were other mechanisms than intra particle diffusion 9 68 in order to ensure adsorption equilibrium for all activated carbon 24 h was selected as the adsorption time for further studies at different adsorbent dosage and concentration 3 3 2 effect of activated carbon dosage effect of activated carbon dosage on otc adsorption was investigated for co zncl2 and co pe zncl2 which gave the highest removal efficiency as shown in fig 5 with increasing activated carbon dosage from 0 25 to 1 g l removal efficiency ascended from 25 8 and 24 3 to 98 8 and 95 8 for co zncl2 and co pe zncl2 respectively removal efficiency of otc proportionally increased with increasing activated carbon dosage from 0 25 to 1 g l in case of 1 g l dosage 100 removal cannot be completed due to the lack of accessible active sites since activated sites were mostly occupied by otc molecules and lower otc concentration in equilibrium therefore removal efficiency of otc could be completely accomplished with adsorbent amount of 1 5 g l 3 3 3 adsorption isotherms two langmuir and freundlich and three parameter sips and redlich peterson isotherm models were used to describe the adsorption performance of activated carbons for isotherm studies 1 g l of adsorbent dosage was selected equilibrium studies were carried out using initial otc concentrations between 50 and 250 ppm for 24 h since otc adsorption almost completed at these concentrations isotherm studies for co zncl2 and co pe zncl2 were conducted using solutions with initial otc concentrations ranging from 300 and 800 ppm isotherm constants sse and r2 values were shown in table 7 according to r2 and sse values three parameter isotherms were the best fit for all activated carbons activated carbons except for co koh and co pe koh followed redlich peterson isotherm model while otc adsorption with co koh and co pe koh obeyed sips isotherm models this indicated that adsorption process proceeded over both homogenous and heterogeneous surface in activated carbon depending on the concentration of otc molecules since both three parameter isotherms are hybrid adsorption mechanism they can overcome the limitations of the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models lower 1 n value of sips and redlich peterson models is an indication of heterogeneous structure and when it is close to 1 the models fall onto langmuir isotherms according to sips model co koh and co pe koh had lower 1 n values indicating that the heterogeneous adsorption mechanism took place on the other hand in case of activated carbons that followed redlich peterson models 1 n values were much closer to 1 which implied that otc adsorption was homogeneous among the obtained activated carbons freundlich adsorption capacity kf of co koh and co pe koh was the lowest 5 4 and 5 9 respectively which was in line with low removal efficiency of otc rl values were found between 0 and 1 revealing favorable adsorption behavior of activated carbons note that rl values of zncl2 and co2 activated carbons were zero or very close to zero which implied that the adsorption of otc was nearly irreversible in previous studies freundlich and langmuir models were mostly utilized to fit the otc adsorption isotherms with activated carbon 7 31 33 whereas limited studies were found which evaluated otc adsorption with three parameter model namely dubinin radushkevich 6 29 and brouers sotolongo isotherm 30 it was reported that langmuir model mostly provided better fit to otc adsorption isotherm comparing with the freundlich equations langmuir adsorption capacities of activated carbon can be used to compare adsorption performance of various adsorbents the maximum adsorption capacity sm was observed to be 621 2 and 482 8 mg g for co zncl2 and co pe zncl2 respectively in literature sm values of otp adsorption with carbon based adsorbents have been reported as 564 97 mg g for lotus stalk based activated carbon 7 58 85 mg g for magnetic montmorillonite biochar 33 325 59 mg g for multiwalled carbon nanotube loaded iron metal organic framework 31 72 9 mg g for iron loaded activated carbon derived from the corn stalk 6 407 5 mg g for koh activated tomato peeled biochar 9 534 8 mg g for mesoporous activated carbons 29 and 263 8 mg g for h3po4 activated forest residue 30 on the other hand sm values of activated carbon aerogel 32 and koh activated garlic peel with ultra high specific surface area 8 were found to be 813 80 mg g and 1393 8 mg g respectively which were higher than that of co zncl2 reported in current study besides hao et al 69 summarized maximum adsorption capacity of otc onto different adsorbents such as zeolite hydroxyapatite cufe2o4 nimgal ldh composite reduced graphene oxide with the zro2 nanocomposite etc varying between 33 3 mg g and 278 3 mg g 4 conclusion the aim of this study was to produce activated carbon from textile wastes as environmentally friendly and low cost adsorbent for otc removal from aqueous solution activated carbons were prepared by chemical zncl2 and koh and physical co2 activation of hydrochars which were previously obtained from cotton polyester and cotton polyster mixture fibers the results showed that zncl2 activated carbons had the best otc removal performance related to their higher surface area as well as highly graphitic structure specifically cotton based zncl2 activated carbon exhibited highest surface area 1906 m2 g and otc adsorption capacity 621 2 mg g whereas polyester based adsorbent had moderate adsorption performance and surface area in addition to high surface area highly graphitized structure of zncl2 activated carbons improved the otc performance by increasing the π π interaction between the adsorbent and otc molecules on the other hand although the highest surface functional groups were observed in case of koh activated carbons otc adsorption capacities were found to be relatively lower activated carbon fitted best to three parameter isotherm models namely sips or redlich peterson isotherms indicating that adsorption can proceed on both homogenous and heterogeneous surface depending on the concentration of otc molecules hydrothermal carbonization as a pretreatment can improve the activation performance of textile waste yielding activated carbon with higher surface area and micropore volume by using less activation agent as conclusion zncl2 activated carbons obtained from cotton or cotton polyester derived hydrochars can be utilized as an adsorbent due to its high removal performance abundance of resource and high purity considering its superior properties such as high porosity micropore volume and graphite like structure zncl2 activated carbons have also great potential for utilization in different advanced applications such as catalyst catalyst support electrode in super capacitance or h2 storage etc therefore further studies can focus on the production of porous carbon from raw and hydrothermally treated textile wastes at different zncl2 precursor ratios and its utilization particularly as energy storage material

13396,hazardous effluents containing heavy metals and toxic compounds such as cyanide are among the contaminants produced annually by mining activities in this study the electrocoagulation method was used to simultaneously remove cyanide and lead from the synthetic and natural effluents of a gold mine processing plant the effect of four parameters including initial ph current intensity reaction time and electrode arrangement was investigated under different conditions results indicated that by increasing the current intensity to 300 ma at ph 9 for 40 min the cyanide and lead removal efficiencies were increased to 91 and 74 respectively in addition the highest cyanide and lead removal efficiencies at ph 9 and a current intensity of 300 ma after 40 min were 97 and 81 respectively the removal of 100 of cyanide in the presence of lead using fe as the anode electrode can be attributed to the higher oxidation rate of iron than aluminum and the formation of more flocs in the solution the removal of 94 of lead in the presence of cyanide using aluminum as the anode electrode can be related to ph limitations applied for the simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide as well as the dissolution of aluminum species at this ph preventing its complete removal overall it can be concluded that the electrocoagulation method is an effective technique for simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide from contaminated effluents keywords cyanide lead gold processing wastewater electrocoagulation 1 introduction due to the increasing development of various industries such as plating paper mining and mineral processing in both developed and developing countries the production of effluents containing heavy and toxic metals by these industries is increasing such contaminated effluents are directly or indirectly discharged and released into the environment and enter surface and groundwater the major heavy metals found in the effluents of various industries include zinc copper nickel mercury cadmium lead and chromium in some cases these effluents also contain toxic cyanide ions for instance electroplating metal processing such as gold and silver mining and steel production pesticide pharmaceutical and petroleum refineries nodal industries are among the industries producing large quantity of cyanide containing effluents 1 in this regard mining and mineral processing play a key role in the production of cyanide effluents accordingly the use of cyanide for leaching recovering and separating metals such as lead zinc and copper from slurry should be accompanied by programs aimed at controlling purifying and reducing cyanide concentrations in the effluents 2 several studies 3 have shown that less than 18 of annual cyanide consumption is related to mining and mineral processing activities the annual total amount of cyanide containing effluents discharged into the environment is estimated to be more than 1 million tons all cyanide species are toxic and harmful even at low concentrations thus it is necessary to treat and reduce their concentration in solution as much as possible according to the environmental standards 4 based on the standard given by the world health organization the maximum permissible concentration of cyanide in drinking water is 0 07 mg l it is worth nothing that very low and harmless amounts of cyanides are also present in plants and vegetables 5 the amount of cyanide in food which could lead to the death of 50 of the population is estimated to be between 1 and 3 mg kg of body weight 6 as announced by the mining industry the maximum concentration of weak acid dissociable wad cyanide in water which could be considered as harmless to wild life is 50 mg l in order to reduce the negative impact of wad cyanide on nature and wildlife its concentration in tailing ponds should be reduced to less than 50 mg l and the release of effluents into the environment should be prevented by taking into account environmental considerations 7 usepa estimated that in 2001 about 50 tons of cyanide entered us surface waters through mines and related metal resources 8 one of the prominent characteristics of heavy metals in wastewater is their non decomposition behavior so that after being absorbed by plants they enter the humans and animals bodies and accumulate there for instance an excess amount of zinc in the body causes problems such as stomach cramps skin irritations vomiting nausea and anemia for other elements such as copper nickel lead and cadmium similar problems occur ranging from muscle cramps to seizures and eventually death 9 in general to remove these contaminants from the effluents various methods have been invented which could be classified into three main categories of physical chemical and biological methods these methods include precipitation ion exchange adsorption membrane filtration and electrochemical processes the control and management of which is considered as a major challenge 10 the use of adsorption method is suitable in cases where high performance is required but is not economical for reasons such as limited regeneration and high cost 11 the use of various types of filtration methods has increased in recent years in many countries due to their advantages such as high efficiency selectivity and the need for little equipment however high operating costs have hindered the development and expansion of these methods 12 in the meantime new methods such as electrochemical methods including electro flotation electrocoagulation ec and electro deposition have been considered by researchers to eliminate a wide range of heavy and toxic pollutants 13 one of the most important issues for simultaneous removal of cyanide and heavy metals is ph which has not been addressed in recent research because the difference in ph values required to remove each separately is an important challenge for their simultaneous removal from the effluent heavy metals are removed at acidic ph but in order to remove cyanide from the effluent the effluent ph must be alkalized to prevent the production of hcn gas therefore the simultaneous removal of cyanide and heavy metals from industrial and mining effluents still remains as a serious challenge no research has been conducted in this regard in recent years and this has added to the appeal of the simultaneous removal of cyanide and lead in this research kobya et al 14 investigated the remediation of acidic electroplating effluents containing zinc and alkaline cyanide using electrocoagulation method their results showed that the maximum zinc and cyanide removal efficiency of 99 9 was obtained after 60 min with a current density of 60 a m2 and ph 9 5 14 in a study by mamelkina et al 4 electrocoagulation method was employed to remove cyanide from mine effluent they concluded that the use of iron as the anode electrode led to the complete removal of cyanide from the effluent while the use of aluminum as the anode electrode led to the removal of only 60 of cyanide 4 in another study conducted by mamelkina et al 15 the effect of parameters affecting the treatment of mineral effluents was investigated using electrocoagulation method the results showed that the parameters such as ph current density and initial contaminant concentration had a significant effect on the electrocoagulation method efficiency in removing contaminants 15 in a study conducted by mcbeath et al to simultaneously remove manganese and arsenic from the effluent using the combined electrocoagulation filtration method the results showed that using this combined method arsenic was almost completely eliminated and the final concentration of manganese was 98 97 μg l which was lower than the standard limit set by the world health organization 16 mousavi et al 17 investigated the parameters affecting the process of cyanide removal from wastewater using electrocoagulation method in batch and continuous operation results of batch experiments revealed that the use of iron and aluminum as anode cathode electrodes with a current density of 15 ma cm2 and aeration led to a removal efficiency of 98 in the continuous operation cyanide was completely removed from the effluent after 140 min 17 mansoorian et al 18 investigated the simultaneous removal of lead and zinc from the effluent of the battery industry using electrocoagulation method in this study using iron and stainless steel rod electrodes the maximum lead and zinc removal efficiencies were 97 2 and 95 5 with a current density of 6 ma cm2 using iron electrodes and 93 2 and 92 5 with a current density of 8 ma cm2 using stainless steel electrodes 18 rao et al 19 used electrocoagulation to simultaneously remove lead and nitrate from the effluents using aluminum and iron electrodes at low voltage their results showed that the maximum removal efficiency of 99 7 for lead ii and 57 6 for nitrate was obtained using the electrocoagulation method at ph 6 low voltage of 6 v and electrode distance of 2 cm they further reported that the use of kno3 instead of pb no3 2 prevented the removal of nitrate due to the presence of lead ii ions in the solution 19 kim et al 20 used electrocoagulation to remove some heavy metals including cu ni zn and cr in the presence of cyanide using iron and aluminum electrodes their results demonstrated that more than 95 of these four heavy metals were removed by using the electrocoagulation method 20 shaker et al 21 conducted a study to remove nickel and chromium from the effluent using copper electrodes the parameters studied in this test including ph current density electrode distance and reaction time were evaluated in both batch and continuous modes the results showed that the highest removal efficiencies of 99 96 for ni and 98 for cr were obtained at current intensities of 5 10 ma cm2 ph 9 2 and 4 cm distance between the electrodes in addition the electric energy consumption was higher in the batch mode than in the continuous mode 21 in a study conducted by sharma et al 22 on the removal of lead and chromium from plating effluents using electrocoagulation and copper electrodes the maximum removal efficiency of 91 7 for cr vi and 91 3 for lead was obtained within 90 min of ec at a current density of 73 5 a m2 and ph 3 5 it was found that energy consumption was inversely correlated with increasing ph 22 ahmad et al 23 investigated the removal of copper and zinc from water using electrocoagulation and iron electrodes the tests were performed with different concentrations 10 to 50 mg l of both contaminants in water at 25 v for 30 150 min the results showed that the maximum removal efficiency of both was 94 97 within 150 min 23 in a study conducted by saifullah khan et al with the aim of removing lead from the effluent using electrocoagulation method the results showed that the lead content in the effluent was completely removed at ph 6 and a current intensity of 0 3a within 13 min 24 in previous studies the simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide by electrocoagulation has not been studied also the parameters affecting the removal efficiency as well as the simultaneous removal efficiency of cyanide and lead have not been determined due to the presence of heavy metals and cyanide in gold processing effluents and the possibility of forming cyanide metal complexes with different stability and toxicity the simultaneous removal of heavy metals and cyanide from the effluents by conventional methods is an important demanding task although the effluents of gold processing plants contain heavy metals such as lead as well as toxic substances such as cyanide and cyanide metal complexes the simultaneous treatment of natural effluents of gold mills using electrochemical methods has not yet been investigated complete removal of all pollutants in the effluents of gold processing plants is a basic necessity while the most commonly used methods are not able to simultaneously remove heavy and toxic metals and cyanide metal complexes therefore the removal of these pollutants from the effluents of gold processing plants is a major problem on the other hand it is necessary to achieve the maximum efficiency in removing the expressed pollutants with the lowest cost and energy consumption therefore the innovation of this research is the application of a new electrocoagulation method with the least cost and energy consumption to simultaneously remove contaminants that could react and form complexes and reduce the possibility of competition in this research electrocoagulation method was used to simultaneously remove cyanide and lead from the effluents of gold processing plants the effects of different parameters including initial ph electrode arrangement current intensity electrode material and reaction time were also investigated 2 materials and methods two natural and artificial mine effluents were designated in this study electrocoagulation tests were performed for both artificial and natural mine effluents cyanide and lead were selected according to the composition of mineral effluents reported in previously published studies 25 26 sodium cyanide nacn 95 and lead ii nitrate pb no3 2 99 0 were purchased from merck co to prepare artificial wastewater sodium hydroxide naoh chemi pharma was used to adjust the ph of the solution in addition the electrolyte environment was created by the purchased sodium chloride nacl chemi pharma the water required for the production of natural and artificial effluents was also provided from a deionized water generator iron and aluminum sheets purchased from a local source with 12 4 0 1 cm dimensions were also used as the sacrificial electrodes the purity of the aluminum sheet used was 99 and the purity of the iron sheet was 90 the electrocoagulation unit shown in fig 1 consisted of a 400 ml plexiglas reactor in batch mode the volume of lead and cyanide containing effluent used for treatment was 300 ml the ec cell consisted of two iron or aluminum electrodes fixed in the reactor and connected to the power supply in a monopolar arrangement constant current was supplied by a laboratory power supply dizhang ps 605 that could adjust the voltage to a certain level this power supply was used to produce a constant current intensity while the total area of the anode was 48 cm2 the area of its operational part was equal to 20 cm2 about 300 ml of the effluent containing a certain concentration of cyanide and lead was poured into the reactor equipped with the stated electrodes the concentration of cyanide required for the production of artificial effluent was 198 mg l and the amount of lead required for the production of artificial effluent was 168 mg l by applying the direct current to the electrodes and adjusting the electric current intensity to the desired constant current value the reaction began and continued for a certain period of time all tests were performed at ambient temperature and pressure of 1 atm the content of the reactor was stirred using a magnetic stirrer at 60 rpm to completely mix the contaminants in the water the electrodes used in these tests were rectangular with the aforementioned dimensions the distance between the electrodes in the reactor was 2 cm the effluent was sampled at regular intervals and the suspensions were filtered using a paper filter with a pore size of 0 45 μm and the residue on the filter was analyzed for cyanide and lead the electrodes were washed with 1 n hcl as well as distilled water before starting the test current intensities used for cyanide removal were 100 200 and 300 ma these intensities for lead removal were 40 80 and 120 ma and for simultaneous cyanide and lead removal were 120 180 240 and 300 ma respectively 2 1 charge loading rate charge load cl is a common parameter in most experiments which is used to check and control the reaction rate this parameter is sometimes used as an important parameter for reactor design and is known and reported as a load density when using coulomb s law c l and as a constant current when using faraday s law 1 cl i tec ν in this regard the parameters i tec and ν are the applied current a the duration of the electrocoagulation process min and the volume of solution in the electrocoagulation reactor l or m3 respectively to calculate the metal load ml a form of faraday s law is used which is a kind of link between this parameter and the cl parameter described as follows 2 ml φ cl mw z f in which ф mw f and z are the current efficiency iron molecular weight faraday constant 96 485 c mol e and the number of electrons involved in the oxidation reduction reaction respectively z here is used for iron ii the value of ф is determined by linear regression of experimental metal dissolution determined by icp oes a total number of 40 tests were performed in this experiment factors studied in these tests included initial ph of the solution electrode type current intensity and reaction time the electrodes used in this study were made of iron and aluminum materials at the beginning of the tests which were performed in batch form different arrangements of the electrodes were examined such as monopolar iron electrode arrangement monopolar aluminum electrode arrangement iron as anode and aluminum as cathode and vice versa the reason for using these electrodes was their advantages both due to the significant results mentioned in the previously published literature using these two electrodes as well as due to their reasonable cost and ease of accessibility 25 26 finally given that no investigation has been conducted on simultaneous removal of cyanide and heavy metals from the gold mine effluent using the al fe electrode arrangement and considering the advantages of each of these electrodes in removing the desired contaminants we used al and fe electrodes to investigate the simultaneous removal of contaminants by taking into account their variable conditions and the possibility of forming different complexes 27 30 among the examined electrode arrangements the one with the highest cyanide removal rate under the provided conditions was selected for the other tests in this study the effect of different current intensities 100 200 300 ma and reaction times from 10 to 60 min at different phs from 7 to 13 was investigated on the performance of the ec process to remove cyanide from the synthetic effluents using the optimal arrangement of electrodes according to the previous works the best conditions with positive results mentioned in research on cyanide removal were selected and used to obtain the highest removal efficiency the reason for using mostly alkaline ph was to prevent the formation of hcn gas also according to previous and this research results the maximum amount of cyanide removal was obtained due to the use of fe as the anode and high current intensity as well as the probable formation of more flocs accordingly in order to investigate the effect of other parameters on cyanide removal the obtained optimal conditions were used the optimal test conditions for cyanide removal are presented in table 1 furthermore the effect of different current intensities from 40 to 120 ma and phs from 2 to 12 at different reaction times from 10 to 60 min was investigated on the ec performance to remove lead from the synthetic effluents also according to some previously conducted investigations obtaining positive results in the removal of heavy metals the best conditions were selected and used to obtain the highest removal efficiency the results of preliminary tests showed that the use of aluminum was directly associated with the removal of lead at a somewhat neutral ph the optimal test conditions for lead removal are given in table 2 finally in order to simultaneously remove lead and cyanide from the synthetic effluent the effect of different current intensities 120 180 240 300 ma and phs from 6 to 12 at different reaction times from 10 to 60 min was investigated on the ec performance furthermore by reviewing the available literature in relation to the simultaneous removal of heavy metals the best operating conditions obtained in these publications were employed in this test according to the optimal operating conditions the ph of the sample was set to be alkaline and fe was used as the anode electrode the optimal test conditions for the simultaneous removal of cyanide and lead are presented in table 3 samples of synthetic effluents containing cyanide in the synthetic state and or synthesized lead as well as natural mine effluents containing cyanide in the natural state and synthesized lead were produced separately under similar conditions cyanide containing natural mine effluent samples were collected from one of the active gold mines located in khorasan province iran the specifications of natural effluent samples prepared for the tests are presented in detail in the table below as shown in table 4 the effluent samples collected from the gold processing unit contained 2850 μg l cyanide 102 09 μg l mercury 81 88 μg l arsenic and 0 15 mg l lead the extracted samples were filtered through a 0 45 micron pore size paper filter a unicam 929 atomic absorption spectrophotometer was used to determine cyanide and lead while the ph was measured with an orion 920 ph meter the purpose of performing these tests was to determine the efficiency of the electrocoagulation process to simultaneously remove cyanide and lead from the effluents in these experiments the effect of the expressed parameters on the simultaneous removal of cyanide and lead was investigated 2 2 analyses the concentration of cyanide in the solution was determined by titration using standard agno3 solution as described in standard methods after distillation the cyanide in the adsorbent was titrated with standard silver nitrate all cn ions react with ag to form ag cn 2 solution complex as the excess amount of ag enters the titration medium the orange yellow color of the silver sensitive dimethylamino benzylidene rhodanine reagent changes into the onion skin color the sensitivity of rhodanine to silver is up to a concentration of 0 1 mg l if the titration shows a cyanide concentration of less than 1 mg l the measurement should be repeated by spectrophotometry or potentiometry due to the sensitivity of the titration method this method is suitable for determining cyanide concentrations higher than 1 mg l the concentration of lead in the solution was also determined using icp 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of initial ph 3 1 1 effect of initial ph on cyanide removal one of the key parameters affecting the electrocoagulation method efficiency is ph therefore the effect of effluent initial ph on the ec method performance to remove cyanide was investigated the conditions of which are given in table 1 the test results are also graphically presented in fig 2a as demonstrated in fig 2a the highest amount of cyanide removal was obtained at ph 10 after 10 min of applying ec the cyanide concentration decreased from 100 to 8 84 mg l indicating the highest removal efficiency of 91 by increasing the ph to 13 the cyanide removal efficiency decreased according to the limitations required for the treatment of cyanide containing effluents it is necessary to carry out the reaction under neutral to alkaline conditions by starting the ec reaction and producing o2 and hydroxyl ions cyanide in the anode is oxidized to cyanate ion cno at high phs which is further oxidized to carbonate or carbon dioxide and nitrogen 4 3 cn 2oh cno h 2 o 2e 4 2cno 4oh 2co 2 n 2 2h 2 o 6e by increasing ph of the solution large amounts of hydroxyl ions are produced accelerating the production of metal hydroxides such as fe oh 3 s or feooh s which in addition to having a large surface area tend to combine with other pollutants in the effluent thereby leading to the formation of insoluble compounds 33 according to the past literature and articles related to the removal of heavy metals using electrocoagulation it was determined that the main species in solution are iron hematite goethite and magnetite when using iron electrodes 35 in addition in addition based on the previous studies alkaline ph about 8 5 causes the complete oxidation of iron ions and the precipitation of insoluble compounds of fe oh 3 s or feooh s 25 26 29 these results are consistent with the findings of other studies showing that complete oxidation usually occurs at ph values of 8 to 9 and the performance at this ph is optimal 3 1 2 effect of initial ph on lead removal as demonstrated in fig 2b acidic ph had no significant effect on the removal of lead from the effluent by applying the electric current and starting the test the effluent became alkaline due to the production of hydroxide in the solution by increasing the ph the lead removal efficiency from the effluent also increased so that at ph 8 the highest lead removal efficiency of 91 was obtained using the current intensity of 80 ma for 10 min and al fe as anode cathode electrodes however by increasing the ph to 8 the removal efficiency was first increased but then decreased due to the superior repulsive force of the hydroxides according to the ph activity diagram of lead in the ph range of 4 6 the lead element is stable as an ion in solution while at ph 8 it decreases and precipitates in solution in order to remove the maximum amount of lead from the effluent the acidic ph of the effluent medium was first examined and aluminum electrodes were used as the sacrificial anode 38 according to the ph activity diagram of aluminum at phs less than 3 5 al3 hydrolysis products are mainly cationic species al oh 2 and al oh 2 which are not able to adsorb contaminants and al3 is the main species in solution according to the past works as well as numerous studies using aluminum electrodes in neutral conditions different types of aluminum hydroxide such as al oh 2 al6 oh 15 3 al7 oh 17 4 and al13 oh 34 5 are produced due to the large surface area of hydroxyl groups conditions are provided for the adsorption of as many heavy metal ions as possible 28 30 5 al 3 h 2 o al oh 2 h 6 al oh 2 2h 2 o al oh 3 2h 7 al oh 3 h 2 o al oh 4 h for ph values between 4 and 9 5 al oh 3 s is the predominant species in solution and for ph values higher than 10 al oh 4 is the predominant species in solution 41 8 2al 6h 2 o 2oh 2al oh 4 3h 2 accordingly in order to remove the maximum amount of lead from the effluent ph of the effluent medium should be kept in the range of 4 to 9 5 recent research has shown that the maximum performance of the electrocoagulation process using aluminum as anode is in the neutral ph range 42 while aluminum plays the role of an amphoteric substance in the effluent 43 in the present study based on the experiments performed with aluminum electrodes the optimal ph for removing the maximum amount of lead was determined to be 8 by examining the ph activity diagram of al3 species that are in equilibrium with al oh 3 it was determined that at ph 9 0 the predominant al3 species in solution is mainly al oh 4 this species is mostly soluble and does not precipitate thus based on the previous studies it seems that the possibility of forming al oh 3 flocs in this ph range is high which are amorphous and have a large surface area very suitable for the adsorption of lead ions in solution 44 3 1 3 effect of initial ph on simultaneous removal of the synthesized lead and cyanide from the synthetic and natural mine effluents in order to determine the effect of initial ph on the simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide ec experiments were performed using the optimal al fe electrode arrangement based on the previous test in which the fe electrode was used as the sacrificial anode as demonstrated in fig 2c the cyanide removal efficiency increased by increasing ph to 9 and then decreased while the lead removal efficiency decreased at ph values above 9 the difference between fig 2a and b with fig 2c is attributed to the fact that the tests a and b were performed for the removal of only one pollutant at different phs but the test c was performed for the simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide at a specific ph while there was the possibility of interaction between pollutants and its effect on the removal efficiency the results indicated that the highest removal rate of the synthesized lead and cyanide at ph 9 was 79 and 96 respectively the decrease in lead removal efficiency in the presence of cyanide can be attributed to the possible formation of cyanide lead complexes and their various species inhibiting the removal of lead in the presence of cyanide in addition according to previous and current investigations the highest removal rate of heavy metals including lead is mainly obtained under neutral to acidic ph which could be justified to some extent by reducing the removal efficiency of lead in the presence of cyanide due to ph limitations applied in this experiment according to pourbaix diagram of lead hydroxide metal hydroxides are unstable at ph above 9 and metal cations are easily separated and enter the solution it should be noted that the maximum solubility of fe oh 3 and al oh 3 is at ph values of 6 5 and 8 respectively therefore these factors reduce the efficiency of simultaneous removal of cyanide and lead compared to the removal efficiency of each separately obtained through experiments performed under specific operating conditions for each 45 as mentioned earlier the natural mine effluent was used in order to create natural conditions according to fig 2d the efficiency of simultaneous removal of cyanide and lead in the natural effluent was lower than that in the artificial effluent with similar operating conditions the reason for this could be related to the presence of various heavy metals and other pollutants in the natural mine effluent as well as the formation of different cyanide metal complexes reducing the efficiency of simultaneous removal of these two contaminants 3 2 effect of applied current intensity and reaction time 3 2 1 effect of current intensity and reaction time on cyanide removal from the synthetic effluent the current intensity applied to the sacrificial anode has been shown to regulate the production and release of coagulant ions in solution the bubble production flow the growth of flocs and ultimately the reaction rate in the ec reactor 38 accordingly in order to investigate the effect of current intensity on the performance of ec method to remove cyanide in the synthetic effluent experiments were performed by applying different current intensities presented in table 3 considering that the highest amount of lead removal was obtained at 120 ma and the highest amount of cyanide removal was obtained at 300 ma thus in order to remove lead and cyanide at the same time it was tried to check the current intensity in terms of both lead and cyanide removal so that the highest removal efficiency could be achieved for both for this reason the current intensity in the range of 120 to 300 ma was considered as presented in fig 3a the current intensity was directly related to the cyanide removal rate over time the effect of current intensity at the beginning of the reaction was very evident by increasing the current intensity from 100 to 200 ma the cyanide removal efficiency increased from 80 to 95 after 60 min in addition by increasing the current intensity to 300 ma the cyanide content was completely eliminated from the effluent after 60 min fig 3a therefore the ecp method could be considered as an effective method for rapid removal of high concentrations of cyanide from effluents 3 2 2 effect of current intensity and reaction time on lead removal from the synthetic effluent the effect of current intensity at different reaction times was investigated on the performance of electrocoagulation process to remove lead from the synthetic effluent the results of which are presented in table 2 as shown in fig 3b the effect of current intensity on lead removal in the early minutes was evident by increasing the current intensity from 40 to 80 ma the lead removal efficiency increased from 84 to 91 after 60 min in addition by increasing the current intensity to 120 ma the lead content was entirely eliminated after 60 min fig 3b therefore the electrocoagulation method could be considered as a reasonable option for fast removal of lead from the effluent due to the use of an aluminum anode to remove lead by increasing the current intensity the formation of aluminum hydroxide species in the solution increases and causes lead to be trapped in the solution precipitate and leave the solution 3 2 3 effect of current intensity and reaction time on simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide from the synthetic effluent the effect of different current intensities 120 180 240 and 300 ma and reaction times 10 to 60 min was investigated on electrocoagulation process performance to simultaneously remove the synthesized lead and cyanide from the synthetic effluent these tests were performed using the electrocoagulation method and fe al as anode cathode electrodes at ph 9 as shown in fig 3c by increasing the current intensity from 120 to 300 ma the cyanide removal efficiency also increased from 60 to more than 99 and the lead removal efficiency increased from 69 to 86 in addition by increasing the current intensity changes in lead removal efficiency increased compared to changes in cyanide removal efficiency from the effluent the removal of cyanide and lead from the effluent during the ec process depends on iron oxy hydroxyl species and ph produced according to fig 3c the simultaneous presence of lead and cyanide in the effluent caused a sharp decrease in lead and cyanide removal efficiencies at current intensities of 120 to 300 ma respectively the main mechanisms involved in the simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide from the effluent using iron as the anode include oxidation of fe to fe2 and reaction with hydroxides in solution to form iron hydroxide polyoxyhydroxide polyhydroxide flocs 33 lead and cyanide are then adsorbed onto these flocs and form complexes that cause the flocs to precipitate the adsorption process in this case includes the processes of complexation coagulation deposition and neutralization of surface load 14 by increasing the current intensity the removal of lead and cyanide was also increased which is due to further degradation and oxidation of anode increased concentration of metal ions in solution faster formation of ferric hydroxide from iron formation of larger oxygen bubbles by anode and removal of lead through flotation 18 however the removal efficiency of lead and cyanide from the effluent each separately at similar densities was much higher than their simultaneous removal efficiencies furthermore by increasing the current intensity changes in lead removal efficiency increased compared to changes in cyanide removal efficiency from the effluent 3 2 4 effect of current intensity and reaction time on simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide from the natural mine effluent in order to compare the results of experiments on artificial and natural effluents samples of natural mine effluent were collected and similar tests were performed on them under the same operating conditions the effect of different current intensities 120 180 240 and 300 ma and reaction times 10 to 60 min was investigated on the performance of electrocoagulation process to simultaneously remove lead and cyanide from the natural mine effluent considering that the highest amount of lead removal was obtained at 120 ma and the highest amount of cyanide removal was obtained at 300 ma thus in order to remove lead and cyanide at the same time it was tried to check the current intensity in terms of both lead and cyanide removal so that the highest removal efficiency could be achieved for both as shown in fig 3d by increasing the current intensity from 120 to 300 ma the cyanide removal efficiency increased from 81 to 93 and the lead removal efficiency increased from 53 to 83 the efficiencies obtained for the simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide using natural effluents were lower than those obtained using synthetic effluents which could be due to the fact that in the natural effluent in addition to lead and cyanide there are other pollutants and their complexes wad sad which may be very strong in terms of their bonds making them very difficult to eliminate pollutants and their complexes may compete with the simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide therefore the sum of these factors affects the simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide and ultimately reduces their removal efficiency 3 3 effect of electrode arrangement 3 3 1 effect of electrode arrangement on cyanide removal from the synthetic effluent another key parameter playing a significant role in the removal of cyanide and other metals from the effluent is the material and arrangement of the electrodes in order to remove cyanide from the effluent in batch mode in ec method different al fe electrode arrangements were examined table 1 fig 4a represents the effect of electrode arrangement on cyanide removal this figure shows that the maximum cyanide removal efficiencies using al fe fe fe al al and fe al as cathode anode electrode arrangements were 87 80 32 and 29 respectively accordingly the maximum amount of cyanide removal was obtained by applying the optimal operating conditions and using the al fe electrode arrangement in which fe played the role of a sacrificial anode fig 4a the high efficiency of the iron electrode is due to its higher oxidation rate than aluminum 46 the oxidation potential of iron 0 447 v is higher than that of aluminum 1 662 v also low price and availability are two other advantages of using iron therefore iron is used as a sacrificial anode to remove most contaminants from effluents 17 due to the fact that the oxidation rate of iron is directly related to the oxidation potential of iron thus the oxidation rate of iron is higher than that of aluminum by applying an electric current the anode begins to be oxidized and ferrous ions are released into the solution fe2 ions are highly unstable and oxidized to fe3 ions under intense oxidation at the same time the ferrous ion reacts with the free cyanide to form hexacyanoferrate iii finally the final product called prussian blue is produced and precipitated depending on the ph of the solution 4 as a result due to the higher oxidation rate of iron and the production of more coagulants in the al fe electrode arrangement with fe as the anode the highest cyanide removal efficiency from the effluent is obtained 47 9 fe s fe 2 aq 2e 10 h 2 o 2 h 1 2 o 2 2 e 11 2h 2 o 2e h 2 g 2oh 12 fe 2 6cn fe cn 6 4 13 2fe 2 fe cn 6 4 fe 2 fe cn 6 14

mechanisms involved in cyanide removal from the effluent with an alkaline environment using electrocoagulation method include oxidation of ferrous ions to ferric production of porous metal hydroxides trapping cyanide and other heavy metals in the effluent and their precipitation in general several mechanisms are involved in the treatment of wastewater including adsorption co sedimentation flotation and coagulation the above conclusion is well supported by other research in this field 4 3 3 2 effect of electrode arrangement on lead removal from the synthetic effluent in order to remove lead from the effluent in batch mode in ec method different al fe electrode arrangements were examined which are presented in table 2 according to fig 4b showing the effect of electrode arrangement on lead removal the maximum lead removal efficiencies using fe al al al fe fe and al fe as cathode anode electrode arrangements were 90 84 67 and 45 respectively therefore the maximum amount of lead removal was obtained by applying the optimal operating conditions and using the fe al electrode arrangement in which al played the role of a sacrificial anode fig 4b 17 al s al 3 aq 3e 18 3 h 2 o 3 e

effluent to remove the synthesized cyanide and lead simultaneously from the effluent by ecp method after applying the optimal operating conditions ph 10 current intensity of 300 ma and reaction time of 30 min the effect of electrode arrangement was investigated after 30 min from the start of the test the highest simultaneous removal efficiencies of the synthesized cyanide and lead using fe al and al fe as cathode anode electrode arrangements were equal to 63 and 100 as well as 96 and 76 respectively fig 4c according to the explanations given in section 3 3 due to the high oxidation potential of iron compared to aluminum when an iron electrode is used as the sacrificial anode a large amount of coagulant is oxidized by electric current and enters the solution therefore cyanide removal through coagulation flocculation as well as flotation processes results in a high cyanide removal efficiency when aluminum is used as the sacrificial electrode some of its hydroxide species are soluble in the effluent and do not precipitate 3 3 4 effect of electrode arrangement on simultaneous removal of the synthesized lead and cyanide from the natural mine effluent after preparing the natural mine effluent samples in order to compare the results of experiments in the natural and artificial states the same experiments were performed on the natural mine effluents under similar operating conditions at ph 10 and current intensity of 300 ma for 30 min using iron and aluminum electrodes after 30 min from the start of the test the highest simultaneous removal efficiencies of the synthesized lead and cyanide using fe al and al fe as cathode anode electrode arrangements were equal to 94 and 48 as well as 60 and 85 respectively fig 4d as mentioned earlier the main reason for the decrease in lead removal efficiency in the presence of cyanide at a certain ph value is the presence of oxy hydroxide species and their complexes they have good solubility and do not precipitate easily in addition the removal efficiency of cyanide and lead in the natural case was lower than that in the laboratory case which could be attributed to the presence of other species in solution and their competitive behavior at a certain ph it can be concluded that the maximum removal efficiency is obtained when iron used as the sacrificial electrode and the current intensity set to 300 ma comparing the samples taken before the test with those taken at different time intervals it was found that the amount of iron and aluminum in the effluents 0 01 and 0 03 mg l was lower than the allowable international standard limits in water the maximum removal efficiency of cn was around 87 using iron electrode moreover the maximum removal efficiency of pb was around 90 using al electrode however in the case of simultaneous removal of cn and pb 96 and 100 of cn and pb were eliminated from the synthetic effluent respectively when the natural mine effluent was examined the maximum simultaneous removal efficiencies of cn and pb were 94 and 60 respectively table 4 the higher removal efficiency obtained due to the use of iron electrode compared to aluminum electrode could be attributed to the higher oxidation potential of iron at the beginning of the reaction causing more coagulation bonds to enter the solution the removal efficiency if lead and cyanide using different electrode arrangement are presented in table 5 3 4 energy consumption and metal loading one of the most important operational parameters which directly affects the final operating costs is energy consumption energy consumption during experiments is calculated according to 21 ec u i t 1000 v where u i and t are the applied voltage electric current and time respectively v is the volume of treated effluent in cubic meters the maximum amounts of energy consumed to separately and simultaneously remove cyanide and lead were 18 7 2 and 18 kwh m3 respectively in addition table 6 summarizes the energy consumption values at all current intensities for various pollutants according to the calculations performed to measure the metal loading it was found that with increasing the current intensity the rate of cyanide removal lead removal and simultaneous cyanide and lead removal increased table 7 it is clear that further clr leads to an increase in removal efficiency so that with increasing the current intensity and charge loading within 60 min the cyanide removal efficiency increased from 80 to 100 this could be also applied to the removal of lead as well as the simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide the amount of cyanide and lead removal separately and simultaneously directly depends on the amount of coagulant production in the ec method the reason for this is the direct relationship between the applied load and the amount of coagulants produced 3 5 comparative study table 8 represents some of the studies conducted on removal of heavy metals and cyanide and compares the studied parameters as well as removal efficiencies with those in the present study results obtained in our research and the reviewed studies are also presented in this table along with optimal operating conditions provided for obtaining maximum efficiency according to the reviewed studies the highest removal efficiency of heavy metals is mainly obtained at acidic ph and that obtaining high removal efficiencies in most experiments concerning removal of a specific contaminant may be due to the absence of other ions in the presence of other ions in the effluent the efficiency of simultaneous removal of heavy metals decreases which is confirmed by the results of this study as well as some other investigations the difference in simultaneous removal efficiencies between the present and other studies is due to the use of iron electrodes instead of aluminum in addition to the longer duration of experiments which in turn increases the simultaneous removal efficiencies of cyanide and lead 4 conclusions treatment of cyanide effluents lead containing effluents and lead containing cyanide effluents was studied separately by electrocoagulation using aluminum iron electrodes in batch mode the reason for using iron and aluminum electrodes in the present study was the promising results obtained in some previous investigations using these two electrodes to remove heavy metals furthermore their reasonable price and ease of accessibility were other reasons for using these electrodes one more justifying reason is that so far no investigation has been conducted on simultaneous removal of cyanide and heavy metals from the gold mine effluent using the al fe electrode arrangement the obtained results indicate that the highest removal rate of lead and cyanide was 86 and 99 at ph 9 and a current intensity of 300 ma within 60 min respectively we further found that by increasing the current intensity the removal rate of pb and cn from the effluent also increases accordingly by increasing the current intensity from 120 to 300 ma the concentration of cyanide and lead ions in the artificial and natural effluents decreased and their removal efficiency reached 99 and 86 respectively in case of single ion removal the removal efficiencies increased and cyanide and lead were completely removed from the effluent within 60 min this might be attributed to the increase in the oxidation rate of fe to fe2 the increase in the current intensity and the production of more hydroxide polyoxyhydroxide polyhydroxide flocs therefore the main mechanisms involved in lead and cyanide removal from the effluent include adsorption coagulation and flotation our findings further revealed that cyanide could be completely removed in the presence of iron electrode as anode while 94 of pb was removed in the presence of aluminum electrode as anode the reason for selecting an iron electrode as the sacrificial electrode was the higher oxidation potential of iron than aluminum and the formation of more flocs in the solution for the simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide the most suitable sacrificial electrode was the iron electrode which resulted in the removal of 85 of lead and 60 of cyanide from the natural mine effluent in general it could be concluded that the electrocoagulation method has a reasonable ability to simultaneously remove toxic pollutants from the effluent and therefore can be considered as a suitable method for the treatment of gold mine processing effluents moreover it is suggested that sem images be used and analyzed before and after experiments to have better insight on the corrosion status of iron and aluminum electrode as well as removal mechanism of cyanide and lead from the effluent it is also suggested that future studies be performed to investigate the effect and competitive role of heavy metals in the presence of cyanide when using the electrocoagulation method for

13396,hazardous effluents containing heavy metals and toxic compounds such as cyanide are among the contaminants produced annually by mining activities in this study the electrocoagulation method was used to simultaneously remove cyanide and lead from the synthetic and natural effluents of a gold mine processing plant the effect of four parameters including initial ph current intensity reaction time and electrode arrangement was investigated under different conditions results indicated that by increasing the current intensity to 300 ma at ph 9 for 40 min the cyanide and lead removal efficiencies were increased to 91 and 74 respectively in addition the highest cyanide and lead removal efficiencies at ph 9 and a current intensity of 300 ma after 40 min were 97 and 81 respectively the removal of 100 of cyanide in the presence of lead using fe as the anode electrode can be attributed to the higher oxidation rate of iron than aluminum and the formation of more flocs in the solution the removal of 94 of lead in the presence of cyanide using aluminum as the anode electrode can be related to ph limitations applied for the simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide as well as the dissolution of aluminum species at this ph preventing its complete removal overall it can be concluded that the electrocoagulation method is an effective technique for simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide from contaminated effluents keywords cyanide lead gold processing wastewater electrocoagulation 1 introduction due to the increasing development of various industries such as plating paper mining and mineral processing in both developed and developing countries the production of effluents containing heavy and toxic metals by these industries is increasing such contaminated effluents are directly or indirectly discharged and released into the environment and enter surface and groundwater the major heavy metals found in the effluents of various industries include zinc copper nickel mercury cadmium lead and chromium in some cases these effluents also contain toxic cyanide ions for instance electroplating metal processing such as gold and silver mining and steel production pesticide pharmaceutical and petroleum refineries nodal industries are among the industries producing large quantity of cyanide containing effluents 1 in this regard mining and mineral processing play a key role in the production of cyanide effluents accordingly the use of cyanide for leaching recovering and separating metals such as lead zinc and copper from slurry should be accompanied by programs aimed at controlling purifying and reducing cyanide concentrations in the effluents 2 several studies 3 have shown that less than 18 of annual cyanide consumption is related to mining and mineral processing activities the annual total amount of cyanide containing effluents discharged into the environment is estimated to be more than 1 million tons all cyanide species are toxic and harmful even at low concentrations thus it is necessary to treat and reduce their concentration in solution as much as possible according to the environmental standards 4 based on the standard given by the world health organization the maximum permissible concentration of cyanide in drinking water is 0 07 mg l it is worth nothing that very low and harmless amounts of cyanides are also present in plants and vegetables 5 the amount of cyanide in food which could lead to the death of 50 of the population is estimated to be between 1 and 3 mg kg of body weight 6 as announced by the mining industry the maximum concentration of weak acid dissociable wad cyanide in water which could be considered as harmless to wild life is 50 mg l in order to reduce the negative impact of wad cyanide on nature and wildlife its concentration in tailing ponds should be reduced to less than 50 mg l and the release of effluents into the environment should be prevented by taking into account environmental considerations 7 usepa estimated that in 2001 about 50 tons of cyanide entered us surface waters through mines and related metal resources 8 one of the prominent characteristics of heavy metals in wastewater is their non decomposition behavior so that after being absorbed by plants they enter the humans and animals bodies and accumulate there for instance an excess amount of zinc in the body causes problems such as stomach cramps skin irritations vomiting nausea and anemia for other elements such as copper nickel lead and cadmium similar problems occur ranging from muscle cramps to seizures and eventually death 9 in general to remove these contaminants from the effluents various methods have been invented which could be classified into three main categories of physical chemical and biological methods these methods include precipitation ion exchange adsorption membrane filtration and electrochemical processes the control and management of which is considered as a major challenge 10 the use of adsorption method is suitable in cases where high performance is required but is not economical for reasons such as limited regeneration and high cost 11 the use of various types of filtration methods has increased in recent years in many countries due to their advantages such as high efficiency selectivity and the need for little equipment however high operating costs have hindered the development and expansion of these methods 12 in the meantime new methods such as electrochemical methods including electro flotation electrocoagulation ec and electro deposition have been considered by researchers to eliminate a wide range of heavy and toxic pollutants 13 one of the most important issues for simultaneous removal of cyanide and heavy metals is ph which has not been addressed in recent research because the difference in ph values required to remove each separately is an important challenge for their simultaneous removal from the effluent heavy metals are removed at acidic ph but in order to remove cyanide from the effluent the effluent ph must be alkalized to prevent the production of hcn gas therefore the simultaneous removal of cyanide and heavy metals from industrial and mining effluents still remains as a serious challenge no research has been conducted in this regard in recent years and this has added to the appeal of the simultaneous removal of cyanide and lead in this research kobya et al 14 investigated the remediation of acidic electroplating effluents containing zinc and alkaline cyanide using electrocoagulation method their results showed that the maximum zinc and cyanide removal efficiency of 99 9 was obtained after 60 min with a current density of 60 a m2 and ph 9 5 14 in a study by mamelkina et al 4 electrocoagulation method was employed to remove cyanide from mine effluent they concluded that the use of iron as the anode electrode led to the complete removal of cyanide from the effluent while the use of aluminum as the anode electrode led to the removal of only 60 of cyanide 4 in another study conducted by mamelkina et al 15 the effect of parameters affecting the treatment of mineral effluents was investigated using electrocoagulation method the results showed that the parameters such as ph current density and initial contaminant concentration had a significant effect on the electrocoagulation method efficiency in removing contaminants 15 in a study conducted by mcbeath et al to simultaneously remove manganese and arsenic from the effluent using the combined electrocoagulation filtration method the results showed that using this combined method arsenic was almost completely eliminated and the final concentration of manganese was 98 97 μg l which was lower than the standard limit set by the world health organization 16 mousavi et al 17 investigated the parameters affecting the process of cyanide removal from wastewater using electrocoagulation method in batch and continuous operation results of batch experiments revealed that the use of iron and aluminum as anode cathode electrodes with a current density of 15 ma cm2 and aeration led to a removal efficiency of 98 in the continuous operation cyanide was completely removed from the effluent after 140 min 17 mansoorian et al 18 investigated the simultaneous removal of lead and zinc from the effluent of the battery industry using electrocoagulation method in this study using iron and stainless steel rod electrodes the maximum lead and zinc removal efficiencies were 97 2 and 95 5 with a current density of 6 ma cm2 using iron electrodes and 93 2 and 92 5 with a current density of 8 ma cm2 using stainless steel electrodes 18 rao et al 19 used electrocoagulation to simultaneously remove lead and nitrate from the effluents using aluminum and iron electrodes at low voltage their results showed that the maximum removal efficiency of 99 7 for lead ii and 57 6 for nitrate was obtained using the electrocoagulation method at ph 6 low voltage of 6 v and electrode distance of 2 cm they further reported that the use of kno3 instead of pb no3 2 prevented the removal of nitrate due to the presence of lead ii ions in the solution 19 kim et al 20 used electrocoagulation to remove some heavy metals including cu ni zn and cr in the presence of cyanide using iron and aluminum electrodes their results demonstrated that more than 95 of these four heavy metals were removed by using the electrocoagulation method 20 shaker et al 21 conducted a study to remove nickel and chromium from the effluent using copper electrodes the parameters studied in this test including ph current density electrode distance and reaction time were evaluated in both batch and continuous modes the results showed that the highest removal efficiencies of 99 96 for ni and 98 for cr were obtained at current intensities of 5 10 ma cm2 ph 9 2 and 4 cm distance between the electrodes in addition the electric energy consumption was higher in the batch mode than in the continuous mode 21 in a study conducted by sharma et al 22 on the removal of lead and chromium from plating effluents using electrocoagulation and copper electrodes the maximum removal efficiency of 91 7 for cr vi and 91 3 for lead was obtained within 90 min of ec at a current density of 73 5 a m2 and ph 3 5 it was found that energy consumption was inversely correlated with increasing ph 22 ahmad et al 23 investigated the removal of copper and zinc from water using electrocoagulation and iron electrodes the tests were performed with different concentrations 10 to 50 mg l of both contaminants in water at 25 v for 30 150 min the results showed that the maximum removal efficiency of both was 94 97 within 150 min 23 in a study conducted by saifullah khan et al with the aim of removing lead from the effluent using electrocoagulation method the results showed that the lead content in the effluent was completely removed at ph 6 and a current intensity of 0 3a within 13 min 24 in previous studies the simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide by electrocoagulation has not been studied also the parameters affecting the removal efficiency as well as the simultaneous removal efficiency of cyanide and lead have not been determined due to the presence of heavy metals and cyanide in gold processing effluents and the possibility of forming cyanide metal complexes with different stability and toxicity the simultaneous removal of heavy metals and cyanide from the effluents by conventional methods is an important demanding task although the effluents of gold processing plants contain heavy metals such as lead as well as toxic substances such as cyanide and cyanide metal complexes the simultaneous treatment of natural effluents of gold mills using electrochemical methods has not yet been investigated complete removal of all pollutants in the effluents of gold processing plants is a basic necessity while the most commonly used methods are not able to simultaneously remove heavy and toxic metals and cyanide metal complexes therefore the removal of these pollutants from the effluents of gold processing plants is a major problem on the other hand it is necessary to achieve the maximum efficiency in removing the expressed pollutants with the lowest cost and energy consumption therefore the innovation of this research is the application of a new electrocoagulation method with the least cost and energy consumption to simultaneously remove contaminants that could react and form complexes and reduce the possibility of competition in this research electrocoagulation method was used to simultaneously remove cyanide and lead from the effluents of gold processing plants the effects of different parameters including initial ph electrode arrangement current intensity electrode material and reaction time were also investigated 2 materials and methods two natural and artificial mine effluents were designated in this study electrocoagulation tests were performed for both artificial and natural mine effluents cyanide and lead were selected according to the composition of mineral effluents reported in previously published studies 25 26 sodium cyanide nacn 95 and lead ii nitrate pb no3 2 99 0 were purchased from merck co to prepare artificial wastewater sodium hydroxide naoh chemi pharma was used to adjust the ph of the solution in addition the electrolyte environment was created by the purchased sodium chloride nacl chemi pharma the water required for the production of natural and artificial effluents was also provided from a deionized water generator iron and aluminum sheets purchased from a local source with 12 4 0 1 cm dimensions were also used as the sacrificial electrodes the purity of the aluminum sheet used was 99 and the purity of the iron sheet was 90 the electrocoagulation unit shown in fig 1 consisted of a 400 ml plexiglas reactor in batch mode the volume of lead and cyanide containing effluent used for treatment was 300 ml the ec cell consisted of two iron or aluminum electrodes fixed in the reactor and connected to the power supply in a monopolar arrangement constant current was supplied by a laboratory power supply dizhang ps 605 that could adjust the voltage to a certain level this power supply was used to produce a constant current intensity while the total area of the anode was 48 cm2 the area of its operational part was equal to 20 cm2 about 300 ml of the effluent containing a certain concentration of cyanide and lead was poured into the reactor equipped with the stated electrodes the concentration of cyanide required for the production of artificial effluent was 198 mg l and the amount of lead required for the production of artificial effluent was 168 mg l by applying the direct current to the electrodes and adjusting the electric current intensity to the desired constant current value the reaction began and continued for a certain period of time all tests were performed at ambient temperature and pressure of 1 atm the content of the reactor was stirred using a magnetic stirrer at 60 rpm to completely mix the contaminants in the water the electrodes used in these tests were rectangular with the aforementioned dimensions the distance between the electrodes in the reactor was 2 cm the effluent was sampled at regular intervals and the suspensions were filtered using a paper filter with a pore size of 0 45 μm and the residue on the filter was analyzed for cyanide and lead the electrodes were washed with 1 n hcl as well as distilled water before starting the test current intensities used for cyanide removal were 100 200 and 300 ma these intensities for lead removal were 40 80 and 120 ma and for simultaneous cyanide and lead removal were 120 180 240 and 300 ma respectively 2 1 charge loading rate charge load cl is a common parameter in most experiments which is used to check and control the reaction rate this parameter is sometimes used as an important parameter for reactor design and is known and reported as a load density when using coulomb s law c l and as a constant current when using faraday s law 1 cl i tec ν in this regard the parameters i tec and ν are the applied current a the duration of the electrocoagulation process min and the volume of solution in the electrocoagulation reactor l or m3 respectively to calculate the metal load ml a form of faraday s law is used which is a kind of link between this parameter and the cl parameter described as follows 2 ml φ cl mw z f in which ф mw f and z are the current efficiency iron molecular weight faraday constant 96 485 c mol e and the number of electrons involved in the oxidation reduction reaction respectively z here is used for iron ii the value of ф is determined by linear regression of experimental metal dissolution determined by icp oes a total number of 40 tests were performed in this experiment factors studied in these tests included initial ph of the solution electrode type current intensity and reaction time the electrodes used in this study were made of iron and aluminum materials at the beginning of the tests which were performed in batch form different arrangements of the electrodes were examined such as monopolar iron electrode arrangement monopolar aluminum electrode arrangement iron as anode and aluminum as cathode and vice versa the reason for using these electrodes was their advantages both due to the significant results mentioned in the previously published literature using these two electrodes as well as due to their reasonable cost and ease of accessibility 25 26 finally given that no investigation has been conducted on simultaneous removal of cyanide and heavy metals from the gold mine effluent using the al fe electrode arrangement and considering the advantages of each of these electrodes in removing the desired contaminants we used al and fe electrodes to investigate the simultaneous removal of contaminants by taking into account their variable conditions and the possibility of forming different complexes 27 30 among the examined electrode arrangements the one with the highest cyanide removal rate under the provided conditions was selected for the other tests in this study the effect of different current intensities 100 200 300 ma and reaction times from 10 to 60 min at different phs from 7 to 13 was investigated on the performance of the ec process to remove cyanide from the synthetic effluents using the optimal arrangement of electrodes according to the previous works the best conditions with positive results mentioned in research on cyanide removal were selected and used to obtain the highest removal efficiency the reason for using mostly alkaline ph was to prevent the formation of hcn gas also according to previous and this research results the maximum amount of cyanide removal was obtained due to the use of fe as the anode and high current intensity as well as the probable formation of more flocs accordingly in order to investigate the effect of other parameters on cyanide removal the obtained optimal conditions were used the optimal test conditions for cyanide removal are presented in table 1 furthermore the effect of different current intensities from 40 to 120 ma and phs from 2 to 12 at different reaction times from 10 to 60 min was investigated on the ec performance to remove lead from the synthetic effluents also according to some previously conducted investigations obtaining positive results in the removal of heavy metals the best conditions were selected and used to obtain the highest removal efficiency the results of preliminary tests showed that the use of aluminum was directly associated with the removal of lead at a somewhat neutral ph the optimal test conditions for lead removal are given in table 2 finally in order to simultaneously remove lead and cyanide from the synthetic effluent the effect of different current intensities 120 180 240 300 ma and phs from 6 to 12 at different reaction times from 10 to 60 min was investigated on the ec performance furthermore by reviewing the available literature in relation to the simultaneous removal of heavy metals the best operating conditions obtained in these publications were employed in this test according to the optimal operating conditions the ph of the sample was set to be alkaline and fe was used as the anode electrode the optimal test conditions for the simultaneous removal of cyanide and lead are presented in table 3 samples of synthetic effluents containing cyanide in the synthetic state and or synthesized lead as well as natural mine effluents containing cyanide in the natural state and synthesized lead were produced separately under similar conditions cyanide containing natural mine effluent samples were collected from one of the active gold mines located in khorasan province iran the specifications of natural effluent samples prepared for the tests are presented in detail in the table below as shown in table 4 the effluent samples collected from the gold processing unit contained 2850 μg l cyanide 102 09 μg l mercury 81 88 μg l arsenic and 0 15 mg l lead the extracted samples were filtered through a 0 45 micron pore size paper filter a unicam 929 atomic absorption spectrophotometer was used to determine cyanide and lead while the ph was measured with an orion 920 ph meter the purpose of performing these tests was to determine the efficiency of the electrocoagulation process to simultaneously remove cyanide and lead from the effluents in these experiments the effect of the expressed parameters on the simultaneous removal of cyanide and lead was investigated 2 2 analyses the concentration of cyanide in the solution was determined by titration using standard agno3 solution as described in standard methods after distillation the cyanide in the adsorbent was titrated with standard silver nitrate all cn ions react with ag to form ag cn 2 solution complex as the excess amount of ag enters the titration medium the orange yellow color of the silver sensitive dimethylamino benzylidene rhodanine reagent changes into the onion skin color the sensitivity of rhodanine to silver is up to a concentration of 0 1 mg l if the titration shows a cyanide concentration of less than 1 mg l the measurement should be repeated by spectrophotometry or potentiometry due to the sensitivity of the titration method this method is suitable for determining cyanide concentrations higher than 1 mg l the concentration of lead in the solution was also determined using icp 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of initial ph 3 1 1 effect of initial ph on cyanide removal one of the key parameters affecting the electrocoagulation method efficiency is ph therefore the effect of effluent initial ph on the ec method performance to remove cyanide was investigated the conditions of which are given in table 1 the test results are also graphically presented in fig 2a as demonstrated in fig 2a the highest amount of cyanide removal was obtained at ph 10 after 10 min of applying ec the cyanide concentration decreased from 100 to 8 84 mg l indicating the highest removal efficiency of 91 by increasing the ph to 13 the cyanide removal efficiency decreased according to the limitations required for the treatment of cyanide containing effluents it is necessary to carry out the reaction under neutral to alkaline conditions by starting the ec reaction and producing o2 and hydroxyl ions cyanide in the anode is oxidized to cyanate ion cno at high phs which is further oxidized to carbonate or carbon dioxide and nitrogen 4 3 cn 2oh cno h 2 o 2e 4 2cno 4oh 2co 2 n 2 2h 2 o 6e by increasing ph of the solution large amounts of hydroxyl ions are produced accelerating the production of metal hydroxides such as fe oh 3 s or feooh s which in addition to having a large surface area tend to combine with other pollutants in the effluent thereby leading to the formation of insoluble compounds 33 according to the past literature and articles related to the removal of heavy metals using electrocoagulation it was determined that the main species in solution are iron hematite goethite and magnetite when using iron electrodes 35 in addition in addition based on the previous studies alkaline ph about 8 5 causes the complete oxidation of iron ions and the precipitation of insoluble compounds of fe oh 3 s or feooh s 25 26 29 these results are consistent with the findings of other studies showing that complete oxidation usually occurs at ph values of 8 to 9 and the performance at this ph is optimal 3 1 2 effect of initial ph on lead removal as demonstrated in fig 2b acidic ph had no significant effect on the removal of lead from the effluent by applying the electric current and starting the test the effluent became alkaline due to the production of hydroxide in the solution by increasing the ph the lead removal efficiency from the effluent also increased so that at ph 8 the highest lead removal efficiency of 91 was obtained using the current intensity of 80 ma for 10 min and al fe as anode cathode electrodes however by increasing the ph to 8 the removal efficiency was first increased but then decreased due to the superior repulsive force of the hydroxides according to the ph activity diagram of lead in the ph range of 4 6 the lead element is stable as an ion in solution while at ph 8 it decreases and precipitates in solution in order to remove the maximum amount of lead from the effluent the acidic ph of the effluent medium was first examined and aluminum electrodes were used as the sacrificial anode 38 according to the ph activity diagram of aluminum at phs less than 3 5 al3 hydrolysis products are mainly cationic species al oh 2 and al oh 2 which are not able to adsorb contaminants and al3 is the main species in solution according to the past works as well as numerous studies using aluminum electrodes in neutral conditions different types of aluminum hydroxide such as al oh 2 al6 oh 15 3 al7 oh 17 4 and al13 oh 34 5 are produced due to the large surface area of hydroxyl groups conditions are provided for the adsorption of as many heavy metal ions as possible 28 30 5 al 3 h 2 o al oh 2 h 6 al oh 2 2h 2 o al oh 3 2h 7 al oh 3 h 2 o al oh 4 h for ph values between 4 and 9 5 al oh 3 s is the predominant species in solution and for ph values higher than 10 al oh 4 is the predominant species in solution 41 8 2al 6h 2 o 2oh 2al oh 4 3h 2 accordingly in order to remove the maximum amount of lead from the effluent ph of the effluent medium should be kept in the range of 4 to 9 5 recent research has shown that the maximum performance of the electrocoagulation process using aluminum as anode is in the neutral ph range 42 while aluminum plays the role of an amphoteric substance in the effluent 43 in the present study based on the experiments performed with aluminum electrodes the optimal ph for removing the maximum amount of lead was determined to be 8 by examining the ph activity diagram of al3 species that are in equilibrium with al oh 3 it was determined that at ph 9 0 the predominant al3 species in solution is mainly al oh 4 this species is mostly soluble and does not precipitate thus based on the previous studies it seems that the possibility of forming al oh 3 flocs in this ph range is high which are amorphous and have a large surface area very suitable for the adsorption of lead ions in solution 44 3 1 3 effect of initial ph on simultaneous removal of the synthesized lead and cyanide from the synthetic and natural mine effluents in order to determine the effect of initial ph on the simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide ec experiments were performed using the optimal al fe electrode arrangement based on the previous test in which the fe electrode was used as the sacrificial anode as demonstrated in fig 2c the cyanide removal efficiency increased by increasing ph to 9 and then decreased while the lead removal efficiency decreased at ph values above 9 the difference between fig 2a and b with fig 2c is attributed to the fact that the tests a and b were performed for the removal of only one pollutant at different phs but the test c was performed for the simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide at a specific ph while there was the possibility of interaction between pollutants and its effect on the removal efficiency the results indicated that the highest removal rate of the synthesized lead and cyanide at ph 9 was 79 and 96 respectively the decrease in lead removal efficiency in the presence of cyanide can be attributed to the possible formation of cyanide lead complexes and their various species inhibiting the removal of lead in the presence of cyanide in addition according to previous and current investigations the highest removal rate of heavy metals including lead is mainly obtained under neutral to acidic ph which could be justified to some extent by reducing the removal efficiency of lead in the presence of cyanide due to ph limitations applied in this experiment according to pourbaix diagram of lead hydroxide metal hydroxides are unstable at ph above 9 and metal cations are easily separated and enter the solution it should be noted that the maximum solubility of fe oh 3 and al oh 3 is at ph values of 6 5 and 8 respectively therefore these factors reduce the efficiency of simultaneous removal of cyanide and lead compared to the removal efficiency of each separately obtained through experiments performed under specific operating conditions for each 45 as mentioned earlier the natural mine effluent was used in order to create natural conditions according to fig 2d the efficiency of simultaneous removal of cyanide and lead in the natural effluent was lower than that in the artificial effluent with similar operating conditions the reason for this could be related to the presence of various heavy metals and other pollutants in the natural mine effluent as well as the formation of different cyanide metal complexes reducing the efficiency of simultaneous removal of these two contaminants 3 2 effect of applied current intensity and reaction time 3 2 1 effect of current intensity and reaction time on cyanide removal from the synthetic effluent the current intensity applied to the sacrificial anode has been shown to regulate the production and release of coagulant ions in solution the bubble production flow the growth of flocs and ultimately the reaction rate in the ec reactor 38 accordingly in order to investigate the effect of current intensity on the performance of ec method to remove cyanide in the synthetic effluent experiments were performed by applying different current intensities presented in table 3 considering that the highest amount of lead removal was obtained at 120 ma and the highest amount of cyanide removal was obtained at 300 ma thus in order to remove lead and cyanide at the same time it was tried to check the current intensity in terms of both lead and cyanide removal so that the highest removal efficiency could be achieved for both for this reason the current intensity in the range of 120 to 300 ma was considered as presented in fig 3a the current intensity was directly related to the cyanide removal rate over time the effect of current intensity at the beginning of the reaction was very evident by increasing the current intensity from 100 to 200 ma the cyanide removal efficiency increased from 80 to 95 after 60 min in addition by increasing the current intensity to 300 ma the cyanide content was completely eliminated from the effluent after 60 min fig 3a therefore the ecp method could be considered as an effective method for rapid removal of high concentrations of cyanide from effluents 3 2 2 effect of current intensity and reaction time on lead removal from the synthetic effluent the effect of current intensity at different reaction times was investigated on the performance of electrocoagulation process to remove lead from the synthetic effluent the results of which are presented in table 2 as shown in fig 3b the effect of current intensity on lead removal in the early minutes was evident by increasing the current intensity from 40 to 80 ma the lead removal efficiency increased from 84 to 91 after 60 min in addition by increasing the current intensity to 120 ma the lead content was entirely eliminated after 60 min fig 3b therefore the electrocoagulation method could be considered as a reasonable option for fast removal of lead from the effluent due to the use of an aluminum anode to remove lead by increasing the current intensity the formation of aluminum hydroxide species in the solution increases and causes lead to be trapped in the solution precipitate and leave the solution 3 2 3 effect of current intensity and reaction time on simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide from the synthetic effluent the effect of different current intensities 120 180 240 and 300 ma and reaction times 10 to 60 min was investigated on electrocoagulation process performance to simultaneously remove the synthesized lead and cyanide from the synthetic effluent these tests were performed using the electrocoagulation method and fe al as anode cathode electrodes at ph 9 as shown in fig 3c by increasing the current intensity from 120 to 300 ma the cyanide removal efficiency also increased from 60 to more than 99 and the lead removal efficiency increased from 69 to 86 in addition by increasing the current intensity changes in lead removal efficiency increased compared to changes in cyanide removal efficiency from the effluent the removal of cyanide and lead from the effluent during the ec process depends on iron oxy hydroxyl species and ph produced according to fig 3c the simultaneous presence of lead and cyanide in the effluent caused a sharp decrease in lead and cyanide removal efficiencies at current intensities of 120 to 300 ma respectively the main mechanisms involved in the simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide from the effluent using iron as the anode include oxidation of fe to fe2 and reaction with hydroxides in solution to form iron hydroxide polyoxyhydroxide polyhydroxide flocs 33 lead and cyanide are then adsorbed onto these flocs and form complexes that cause the flocs to precipitate the adsorption process in this case includes the processes of complexation coagulation deposition and neutralization of surface load 14 by increasing the current intensity the removal of lead and cyanide was also increased which is due to further degradation and oxidation of anode increased concentration of metal ions in solution faster formation of ferric hydroxide from iron formation of larger oxygen bubbles by anode and removal of lead through flotation 18 however the removal efficiency of lead and cyanide from the effluent each separately at similar densities was much higher than their simultaneous removal efficiencies furthermore by increasing the current intensity changes in lead removal efficiency increased compared to changes in cyanide removal efficiency from the effluent 3 2 4 effect of current intensity and reaction time on simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide from the natural mine effluent in order to compare the results of experiments on artificial and natural effluents samples of natural mine effluent were collected and similar tests were performed on them under the same operating conditions the effect of different current intensities 120 180 240 and 300 ma and reaction times 10 to 60 min was investigated on the performance of electrocoagulation process to simultaneously remove lead and cyanide from the natural mine effluent considering that the highest amount of lead removal was obtained at 120 ma and the highest amount of cyanide removal was obtained at 300 ma thus in order to remove lead and cyanide at the same time it was tried to check the current intensity in terms of both lead and cyanide removal so that the highest removal efficiency could be achieved for both as shown in fig 3d by increasing the current intensity from 120 to 300 ma the cyanide removal efficiency increased from 81 to 93 and the lead removal efficiency increased from 53 to 83 the efficiencies obtained for the simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide using natural effluents were lower than those obtained using synthetic effluents which could be due to the fact that in the natural effluent in addition to lead and cyanide there are other pollutants and their complexes wad sad which may be very strong in terms of their bonds making them very difficult to eliminate pollutants and their complexes may compete with the simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide therefore the sum of these factors affects the simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide and ultimately reduces their removal efficiency 3 3 effect of electrode arrangement 3 3 1 effect of electrode arrangement on cyanide removal from the synthetic effluent another key parameter playing a significant role in the removal of cyanide and other metals from the effluent is the material and arrangement of the electrodes in order to remove cyanide from the effluent in batch mode in ec method different al fe electrode arrangements were examined table 1 fig 4a represents the effect of electrode arrangement on cyanide removal this figure shows that the maximum cyanide removal efficiencies using al fe fe fe al al and fe al as cathode anode electrode arrangements were 87 80 32 and 29 respectively accordingly the maximum amount of cyanide removal was obtained by applying the optimal operating conditions and using the al fe electrode arrangement in which fe played the role of a sacrificial anode fig 4a the high efficiency of the iron electrode is due to its higher oxidation rate than aluminum 46 the oxidation potential of iron 0 447 v is higher than that of aluminum 1 662 v also low price and availability are two other advantages of using iron therefore iron is used as a sacrificial anode to remove most contaminants from effluents 17 due to the fact that the oxidation rate of iron is directly related to the oxidation potential of iron thus the oxidation rate of iron is higher than that of aluminum by applying an electric current the anode begins to be oxidized and ferrous ions are released into the solution fe2 ions are highly unstable and oxidized to fe3 ions under intense oxidation at the same time the ferrous ion reacts with the free cyanide to form hexacyanoferrate iii finally the final product called prussian blue is produced and precipitated depending on the ph of the solution 4 as a result due to the higher oxidation rate of iron and the production of more coagulants in the al fe electrode arrangement with fe as the anode the highest cyanide removal efficiency from the effluent is obtained 47 9 fe s fe 2 aq 2e 10 h 2 o 2 h 1 2 o 2 2 e 11 2h 2 o 2e h 2 g 2oh 12 fe 2 6cn fe cn 6 4 13 2fe 2 fe cn 6 4 fe 2 fe cn 6 14

mechanisms involved in cyanide removal from the effluent with an alkaline environment using electrocoagulation method include oxidation of ferrous ions to ferric production of porous metal hydroxides trapping cyanide and other heavy metals in the effluent and their precipitation in general several mechanisms are involved in the treatment of wastewater including adsorption co sedimentation flotation and coagulation the above conclusion is well supported by other research in this field 4 3 3 2 effect of electrode arrangement on lead removal from the synthetic effluent in order to remove lead from the effluent in batch mode in ec method different al fe electrode arrangements were examined which are presented in table 2 according to fig 4b showing the effect of electrode arrangement on lead removal the maximum lead removal efficiencies using fe al al al fe fe and al fe as cathode anode electrode arrangements were 90 84 67 and 45 respectively therefore the maximum amount of lead removal was obtained by applying the optimal operating conditions and using the fe al electrode arrangement in which al played the role of a sacrificial anode fig 4b 17 al s al 3 aq 3e 18 3 h 2 o 3 e 3 2 h 2 g 3 o h 19 al 3 aq 3h 2 o al oh 3 s 3h 20 pb 2 aq al n oh 3n floc pb al precipitate complex 3 3 3 effect of electrode arrangement on simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide from the synthetic effluent to remove the synthesized cyanide and lead simultaneously from the effluent by ecp method after applying the optimal operating conditions ph 10 current intensity of 300 ma and reaction time of 30 min the effect of electrode arrangement was investigated after 30 min from the start of the test the highest simultaneous removal efficiencies of the synthesized cyanide and lead using fe al and al fe as cathode anode electrode arrangements were equal to 63 and 100 as well as 96 and 76 respectively fig 4c according to the explanations given in section 3 3 due to the high oxidation potential of iron compared to aluminum when an iron electrode is used as the sacrificial anode a large amount of coagulant is oxidized by electric current and enters the solution therefore cyanide removal through coagulation flocculation as well as flotation processes results in a high cyanide removal efficiency when aluminum is used as the sacrificial electrode some of its hydroxide species are soluble in the effluent and do not precipitate 3 3 4 effect of electrode arrangement on simultaneous removal of the synthesized lead and cyanide from the natural mine effluent after preparing the natural mine effluent samples in order to compare the results of experiments in the natural and artificial states the same experiments were performed on the natural mine effluents under similar operating conditions at ph 10 and current intensity of 300 ma for 30 min using iron and aluminum electrodes after 30 min from the start of the test the highest simultaneous removal efficiencies of the synthesized lead and cyanide using fe al and al fe as cathode anode electrode arrangements were equal to 94 and 48 as well as 60 and 85 respectively fig 4d as mentioned earlier the main reason for the decrease in lead removal efficiency in the presence of cyanide at a certain ph value is the presence of oxy hydroxide species and their complexes they have good solubility and do not precipitate easily in addition the removal efficiency of cyanide and lead in the natural case was lower than that in the laboratory case which could be attributed to the presence of other species in solution and their competitive behavior at a certain ph it can be concluded that the maximum removal efficiency is obtained when iron used as the sacrificial electrode and the current intensity set to 300 ma comparing the samples taken before the test with those taken at different time intervals it was found that the amount of iron and aluminum in the effluents 0 01 and 0 03 mg l was lower than the allowable international standard limits in water the maximum removal efficiency of cn was around 87 using iron electrode moreover the maximum removal efficiency of pb was around 90 using al electrode however in the case of simultaneous removal of cn and pb 96 and 100 of cn and pb were eliminated from the synthetic effluent respectively when the natural mine effluent was examined the maximum simultaneous removal efficiencies of cn and pb were 94 and 60 respectively table 4 the higher removal efficiency obtained due to the use of iron electrode compared to aluminum electrode could be attributed to the higher oxidation potential of iron at the beginning of the reaction causing more coagulation bonds to enter the solution the removal efficiency if lead and cyanide using different electrode arrangement are presented in table 5 3 4 energy consumption and metal loading one of the most important operational parameters which directly affects the final operating costs is energy consumption energy consumption during experiments is calculated according to 21 ec u i t 1000 v where u i and t are the applied voltage electric current and time respectively v is the volume of treated effluent in cubic meters the maximum amounts of energy consumed to separately and simultaneously remove cyanide and lead were 18 7 2 and 18 kwh m3 respectively in addition table 6 summarizes the energy consumption values at all current intensities for various pollutants according to the calculations performed to measure the metal loading it was found that with increasing the current intensity the rate of cyanide removal lead removal and simultaneous cyanide and lead removal increased table 7 it is clear that further clr leads to an increase in removal efficiency so that with increasing the current intensity and charge loading within 60 min the cyanide removal efficiency increased from 80 to 100 this could be also applied to the removal of lead as well as the simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide the amount of cyanide and lead removal separately and simultaneously directly depends on the amount of coagulant production in the ec method the reason for this is the direct relationship between the applied load and the amount of coagulants produced 3 5 comparative study table 8 represents some of the studies conducted on removal of heavy metals and cyanide and compares the studied parameters as well as removal efficiencies with those in the present study results obtained in our research and the reviewed studies are also presented in this table along with optimal operating conditions provided for obtaining maximum efficiency according to the reviewed studies the highest removal efficiency of heavy metals is mainly obtained at acidic ph and that obtaining high removal efficiencies in most experiments concerning removal of a specific contaminant may be due to the absence of other ions in the presence of other ions in the effluent the efficiency of simultaneous removal of heavy metals decreases which is confirmed by the results of this study as well as some other investigations the difference in simultaneous removal efficiencies between the present and other studies is due to the use of iron electrodes instead of aluminum in addition to the longer duration of experiments which in turn increases the simultaneous removal efficiencies of cyanide and lead 4 conclusions treatment of cyanide effluents lead containing effluents and lead containing cyanide effluents was studied separately by electrocoagulation using aluminum iron electrodes in batch mode the reason for using iron and aluminum electrodes in the present study was the promising results obtained in some previous investigations using these two electrodes to remove heavy metals furthermore their reasonable price and ease of accessibility were other reasons for using these electrodes one more justifying reason is that so far no investigation has been conducted on simultaneous removal of cyanide and heavy metals from the gold mine effluent using the al fe electrode arrangement the obtained results indicate that the highest removal rate of lead and cyanide was 86 and 99 at ph 9 and a current intensity of 300 ma within 60 min respectively we further found that by increasing the current intensity the removal rate of pb and cn from the effluent also increases accordingly by increasing the current intensity from 120 to 300 ma the concentration of cyanide and lead ions in the artificial and natural effluents decreased and their removal efficiency reached 99 and 86 respectively in case of single ion removal the removal efficiencies increased and cyanide and lead were completely removed from the effluent within 60 min this might be attributed to the increase in the oxidation rate of fe to fe2 the increase in the current intensity and the production of more hydroxide polyoxyhydroxide polyhydroxide flocs therefore the main mechanisms involved in lead and cyanide removal from the effluent include adsorption coagulation and flotation our findings further revealed that cyanide could be completely removed in the presence of iron electrode as anode while 94 of pb was removed in the presence of aluminum electrode as anode the reason for selecting an iron electrode as the sacrificial electrode was the higher oxidation potential of iron than aluminum and the formation of more flocs in the solution for the simultaneous removal of lead and cyanide the most suitable sacrificial electrode was the iron electrode which resulted in the removal of 85 of lead and 60 of cyanide from the natural mine effluent in general it could be concluded that the electrocoagulation method has a reasonable ability to simultaneously remove toxic pollutants from the effluent and therefore can be considered as a suitable method for the treatment of gold mine processing effluents moreover it is suggested that sem images be used and analyzed before and after experiments to have better insight on the corrosion status of iron and aluminum electrode as well as removal mechanism of cyanide and lead from the effluent it is also suggested that future studies be performed to investigate the effect and competitive role of heavy metals in the presence of cyanide when using the electrocoagulation method for

13397,microbial fuel cells mfc can effectively control the methane emissions from constructed wetland cw in this study the effect of rhizosphere locations on the reduction of methane emission from cw by operating mfc was further studied according to results operating mfc in cw improved the cod removal and inhibited the methane emission from cw by 1 3 plants cyperus alternifolius roots at anode were more conducive to cw mfc power generation the highest power density 47 813 mw m3 was observed in cw mfc with rhizosphere at anode the rhizosphere in cathode could improve cw mfc cod removal operating mfc led to the competition between electrogens and methanogens which changed the microbial community structure and biochemical processes in cw proteobacteria as the main electricigen in cw mfcs were specifically enriched in cw mfc with rhizosphere located in cathode as the dominant archaea methanobacteria and methanomicrobia were specifically enriched in cw mfc with rhizosphere located in anode graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords electrochemical methane control plant root location up flow constructed wetland microbial fuel cell microbial community 1 introduction constructed wetlands as a low cost and effective water treatment technology are widely used for the treatment of agricultural wastewater antibiotic wastewater livestock and poultry wastewater industrial wastewater 1 2 however during the operation of constructed wetlands large amounts of methane and carbon dioxide were detected to be emitted into the atmosphere 1 2 5 as the greenhouse gas next to co2 methane plays a crucial role in climate warming with an annual growth rate of 0 4 and a contribution rate of about 20 to global warming 6 therefore methane control in constructed wetlands is urgently needed through hydrological water level control physical aeration chemical chemicals addition redox potential control regulation numerous studies have been conducted to inhibit the methane emissions from constructed wetlands 7 8 9 10 however microbial and bioelectrochemical approach of the methane control from cws were rarely reported the relevant explorations are worthy to be carried out microbial fuel cell mfc is an environmental treatment and energy technology which can convert organic or reduced compounds to electrical energy through electrochemical reactions 11 the electrochemically active bacteria eab in the anode anaerobic zone produce electrons which are transferred through an external circuit to the cathode aerobic zone electron acceptor thus generating a current 12 13 as constructed wetlands especially vertical flow constructed wetlands has a significant redox gradient along the depth the incorporation of cw and mfc is achievable 14 15 since the constructed wetland microbial fuel cell cw mfc technology was proposed by yadav et al 16 for the first time in 2012 numerous studies on electrode materials electrode position plant species have been conducted to improve the performance of electricity generation and wastewater treatment efficiency 15 18 19 37 low ce coulomb efficiency and voltage which currently hindering the application of cw mfcs could be resulted by electrons or organic substrates competition between electricigens and other microorganisms usually methanogens 12 the electricity generation and pollutant removal of cw mfc could be improved by introducing plants especially cyperus involucratus rottboll arundo donax canna indica 13 15 the organic acids amino acids carbohydrates dead plant organics produced by plant roots can be converted into electrical energy by eabs 20 in current studies plant roots were put mostly in the cathode because the oxygen excreted by plant roots can serve as the electron acceptor in the cathode 21 22 theoretically more organic matter can be provided when the plant roots are in the anode of cw mfcs which is conducive to electricity generation since the anodes of cw mfcs are mostly under anoxic conditions rather than anaerobic conditions 23 the small amount of oxygen secreted by plant roots might have little effect on the oxygen environment of the anodes however cw mfcs with plants in the anode have been rarely reported there is no research on the effect of plant position on methane production and emissions in mfc cws despite cw mfcs hold great promise for wastewater treatment and energy recovery in the future their development is currently hampered by low electricity generation efficiency the interaction of microorganisms in the anodic zone methanogens electricigens plant decomposing bacteria etc plays a decisive role in the electricity generation and methane emission of cw mfcs 24 25 due to the similar living conditions anaerobic environment low redox potential etc the competition for substrates h2 acetate glucose organics and roots exudates etc between methanogens and electricigens is common existed in the anode of cw mfcs which may inhibit the power generation performance of cw mfcs 21 recent studies have shown that acetic acidophilic methanogen play an important role in the decomposition of organic matter in cw mfcs and hydrogenophilic methanogens may be the main electron donor competitors of electricigens 20 24 to date the competitive mechanism and microbiological process is unclear which deserve further study to maximize the benefits of cw mfcs in terms of efficient bioelectricity generation and methane emission reduction in conclusion the microbiological process of methane control in cw mfcs and the effect of plant roots position on the methane emission electricity generation of cw mfcs and need further study in this study the mechanisms of the competition between electrogenesis and methanogenesis were investigated methane emission bioelectricity generation and wastewater treatment performance of cw mfcs with plant roots in different zone anode cathode were studied under different hrt hydraulic retention time 2 materials and methods 2 1 cw mfc system configuration three identical integrated lab scale upflow cw mfc systems rac cw mfc rcc cw mfc oc cw mfc were constructed on sichuan agricultural university

the operational taxonomic units otus and shannon diversity index was produced by mothur program 3 results 3 1 methane emissions when influent cod was 200 mg l and hrt was 24 h the total methane emissions of the close circuit cw mfcs were 29 21 rcc cw mfc and 33 01 mg m2 day rac cw mfc which were lower than a third of that of the open circuit cw mfc according to fig 1 b methane emissions were positively correlated with hrt which was due to the higher organic load johansson et al 28 found that the average methane emission flux of wetlands was about 141 mg m2 day in the study of surface flow constructed wetlands for deep sewage treatment cw mfc can indeed reduce methane emission of constructed wetlands the closed circuit cw mfc system can effectively reduce the methane emissions of the wetland system which may be due to the competition of organic matter between methanogens and methanogens and the electronic competitive advantage of the anode region electrode to methanogens studies have shown that electricity producing bacteria can use organic matter to generate electricity which will compete with methanogens for organic matter 29 the anode layer in closed circuit mfc cw has a higher redox potential which makes it easier for electron producing bacteria to capture electrons than methanogens the growth of methanogens was inhibited because of their competitive advantage over methanogens 30 rosa et al 31 constructed soil mfc in flooded paddy fields planted with rice during the experiment methane emissions from mfc were reduced by about 50 compared with the control group however the influence of plant root location on system methane emission was not significant 3 2 wastewater treatment the water quality parameters cod orp do and ph were investigated as shown in fig 1 c hrt is directly proportional to the cod removal rates of the systems the highest cod removal rate was observed in rcc cw mfc 98 665 0 204 when hrt was 96 h under the same operating conditions the cod removal efficiency of the three systems was ranked as follows rcc cw mfc rac cw mfc oc cw mfc when hrt was 24 h cod removal rate of rcc cw mfc was 4 63 higher than that of oc cw mfc since the cathodic current can promote microbial activity and improve microbial metabolism 32 33 operating mfc could significantly improve the cod removal of cw the results are similar to the that of previous studies 32 33 when hrt was 48 h the cod removal of rac cw mfc was 1 61 lower than that of rcc cw mfc indicating that plant roots located at the cathode could improve the cod removal when plants roots were in cathode zone small organic molecules in the effluent could be recaptured before flowing out 34 oxidation reduction potential orp reflects the concentration of organic substrates and dissolved oxygen concentration do in the reaction system as well as the activity of organics and certain toxic compounds 34 do is an important parameter affecting the aerobic phase operation of the bioreactor 35 to monitor the operation of each layer of the reactor 7 sampling points were set in each reactor ranging from 0 to 6 where 0 and 6 are the influent and effluent respectively as shown in fig 2 a c under different hrt the orp of each water layer in the oc cw mfc open circuit cw mfc is higher than that of cc cw mfc close circuit cw mfc and the orp of rcc cw mfc is higher than that of rac cw mfc hrt is positively correlated with orp as hrt reduction leads to increased hydraulic load accelerated aerobic rate of microorganisms to organic matter and increased accumulation of reducing substances in the system which eventually results in the decrease of orp 33 36 fig 2 d f showed that the do of rac cw mfc was significantly higher than that of rcc cw mfc in each water layer of the system increasing the concentration of cathode do not only improves the efficiency of aerobic degradation but also means an increase in the concentration of electron acceptors which is conducive to improving the power generation of cw mfcs 33 36 as shown in fig 2 g i with the increase of hrt the ph value of the effluent decreased all reactors were operated in a neutral to acidic environment ph was from 6 13 to 7 19 the ph value of rac cw mfc in the anode water layer was higher than rcc cw mfc while that of rcc cw mfc in the cathode water layer was higher than rac cw mfc which may be caused by the accumulation of sugars microorganisms and other organic substances secreted by wetland plant roots 3 3 electricity generation during the stable operation of the cw mfc system the average voltage of rac cw mfc 211 69 mv were higher than that of rcc cw mfc 173 97 mv fig 3a indicating that plant roots in the anode are more beneficial to the biological electricity generation of cw mfc which was consistent with previous studies 34 the sugars organic acids amino acids polymeric carbohydrates dead cell materials etc produced by plant roots can be converted into electrical energy by eabs 20 according to fig 3 b when hrt was 96 h the current and power densities of rcc cw mfc 167 10 ma m3 32 25 mw m3 and rac cw mfc 203 46 ma m3 47 81 mw m3 observed the maximum more organic matter can be provided when the plant roots are in the anode zone of cw mfcs which may result in a higher power generation efficiency since the influent cod content of our study was low 200 mg l the power generation efficiency of rac cw mfc had a greater advantage with the increase of hrt which is consistent with previous study 34 what s more excessive root secretion of organic matter is not conducive to the cathode to produce high orp 34 as shown in fig 2 the redox gradient along the depth in rac cw mfc fig 2b was significantly greater than that in rcc cw mfc fig 2c which may play an important role in electricity generation efficiency of cw mfcs 38 39 the electrochemical characteristics of cw mfcs are explained in detail through polarization curves and power density curves fig 4 with the increase of current density the voltage decreased sharply especially in rac cw mfc as the location of the root oxygen secretion was different the catalytic activity of rcc cathode for oxygen was higher than that of rac cathode 40 as presented in fig 3 c with the increase of hrt the internal resistance of rac cw mfc decreased from 908 ω to 610 ω and then increased to 813 ω while the internal resistance of rcc cw mfc increased from 377 ω to 863 ω and then decreased to 495 ω this may be because when the hrt is shortened the water flow will increase the shear action on the biofilm reduce the attachment of non conductive substances on the biofilm improve the electron transfer efficiency between the microorganism and the electrode thus reducing the internal resistance of the battery 41 in our study the internal resistance of rac cw mfc was greater than that of rcc cw mfc in most case which may be related to the oxygen secreted by the anode root as the concentration of do at anode compartment rac cw mfc didn t increased the related microbial process of interception of partial hydrogen ions by oxygen may have occurred increasing the difficulty of hydrogen penetration despite the fact that the anodic roots exudates may provide a richer substrate for electricigens they may also have increased the resistance of the upward transport of hydrogen ions leading to greater internal resistance coulomb efficiency ce is an important parameter that characterizes the conversion of organic matter into electrons in mfc the ce of cw mfcs was positively correlated with hrt in most cases fig 3 d when hrt was 48 h and 96 h the ce of rac 43 and 93 respectively were higher than that of rcc 29 and 76 respectively indicating the longer the sewage stayed in the systems the higher the degree of organic degradation was and the better the bioelectrical performance was according to fig 2 the redox gradient along the depth in rac cw mfc fig 2b was greater than that in rcc cw mfc fig 2c which may result in the higher ce of rac cw mfc than that of rcc cw mfc 38 3 4 bacterial community dynamic analysis to investigate the effects of plant root location electrical conditions and hrt on the bacterial community of the constructed wetlands high throughput sequencing technology was used to determine the microbial diversity indices of a1 a2 and a3 systems at different hrts out numbers the alpha diversity simpson and shannon and richness chao1 and ace indices were measured in table 2 since each otu corresponds to a bacterial species the diversity and abundance of different microorganisms in the samples were evaluated through otu analysis the otu numbers of a2 and a3 are always greater than that of a1 a1 a2 and a3 represent oc cw mfc rac cw mfc and rcc cw mfc respectively indicating that the formation of electrical closed loop can promote system biodiversity which is consistent with previous studies 38 simpson and shannon reflected microbial community diversity from different angles the smaller the simpsons diversity index the higher the biodiversity and the larger the shannon index the higher the biodiversity 20 as shown in fig 5 shorter hrt 24 h was more conducive to the biodiversity of the system under different hrts the biodiversity of a2 is always higher than that of a3 suggesting that planting at the anode is more conducive to the biodiversity of the system including the cathode and anode layers furthermore the values of chao1 and ace could be used to predict the richness of microbial communities 45 when hrt 24 h the chao1 and ace in a3 1888 1861 were greater than that in a2 1813 1828 while when hrt 96 h the chao1 and ace in a3 1851 1850 were less that in a2 1940 1917 which indicated that hrt affected the richness of microbial communities differently when the root positions were different the microbial community structure of the electrode layer provides important information for understanding the active microbial population in the process of ecological power generation and bioremediation fig 6 shows the microbial community structure at phylum and class level in the anode and cathode of the three systems under different hrts the predominant phyla in these three systems were proteobacteria similar to previous study 43 chloroflexi 5 78 10 91 in cathode 10 37 20 28 in anode and planctomycetes 6 96 11 16 in cathode 4 27 10 70 in anode proteobacteria accounted for 38 06 55 73 and 28 07 60 46 of total composition in cathode and anode respectively the presence of plants in the cw mfc reactor led to the abundance of proteobacteria especially deltaproteobacteria 20 betaprobacteria alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria as the dominant class in cw mfcs played an important role in bioelectricity generation and the degradation of nitrate and nitrite 48 the increase of hrt led to an increase in the proportion of proteobacteria in the cathode bacterial community of a1 and a3 and a decrease in that of a2 it indicates that when the plant root is at the cathode the long hrt is more conducive to the increase of proteobacteria in the cathode while when the plant root is at the anode the short hrt is more beneficial to proteobacteria in cathode with the increases of hrt the relative abundance of proteus in the anode microbial communities of the three systems increased indicating that the long hydraulic time is beneficial to the growth of proteobacteria in the anode the comparison between cw a1 and cw mfc a3 system showed that the operation of mfc in cw was conducive to the growth of proteobacteria which was similar to the previous results 49 according to the comparison between rac cw mfc a2 and rcc cw mfc a3 systems plant roots in the cathode were more conducive to the growth of proteobacteria in addition to proteobacteria actinobacteria 7 44 9 77 in cathode 4 83 10 55 in anode acidobacteria 5 87 9 41 in cathode 3 17 6 35 in anode and firmicutes 0 51 1 39 in cathode 1 21 3 21 in anode in the system are also the electrogenic bacteria 20 when hrt was 96 h the relative abundance of actinobacteria in the anodes of a1 a2 and a3 systems was 4 83 10 55 and 6 30 respectively with the hrt shortened to 24 h the relative amount of actinobacteria in cw mfcs changed differently in a2 the relative amount of actinobacteria decreased by 11 66 while in a1 and a3 that increased by 101 86 and 24 76 respectively which showed that operating mfc in cw had a stabilizing effect on the change of actinobacteria abundance nmds nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis reflects the species information contained in the sample in the form of points on the multidimensional space and the distance between points reflects the degree of difference between different samples 42 the plant root position and hrt had great influence on the biological species in the system especially in the anode of the system fig 6c according to previous studies acidobacteria lives in an oligotrophic niche and its abundance is inversely related to nutrient availability 51 when the hrt was 96 h the relative abundance of acidobacteria in the anodes were 3 17 a1 6 35 a2 and 4 33 a3 and the abundance of acidobacteria in a2 anode layer increased with the increase of hrt while the opposite in a1 and a3 anode layer suggesting the plants have participated in the competition of the anodic bacteria as the hrt increased the abundance of acidobacteria in a2 cathode layer has significantly decreased by 32 45 which may because the accumulation of organic compounds synthesized by roots 20 clostridium which belongs to firmicutes have the ability to hydrolyze cellulose from dead plant roots into smaller compounds that can be exploited by the electrochemically active bacteria eab plant roots at the anode layer are more beneficial to the growth of clostridia previous study have reported that proteobacteria and firmicutes are the main eab in the up flow microbial fuel cell coupled constructed wetland reactors 20 however in this experiment firmicutes accounted for 1 21 3 21 of total composition which was much less than pervious study 53 it may be because the system has fewer plant roots and most of the nutrients in the system are small molecules so the number of proteus bacteria is greater and the number of firmicutes bacteria is less 3 5 archaeal community dynamic analysis the biosynthetic pathway of methane includes the biosynthesis with h2 co2 as the substrate acetic acid as the substrate and methyl compounds as the substrate previous study have shown that 67 of natural methane is produced by acetate substrates while less than 33 of natural methane is produced by h2 co2 conversion 11 the archaeal biological structure of the system hrt 96 h was composed of methanobacteria 10 63 71 19 methanomicrobia 13 63 52 09 thermoplasmata 9 08 20 67 halobacteria 4 55 10 59 unclassified bacteria 1 55 6 01 fig 7 of which methanobacteria and methanomicrobia are hydrogen methanogenic bacteria halobacteria is acetic acid methanogenic bacteria thermoplasmatale is autotrophic or heterotrophic organisms 55 comparing the a2 and a3 systems hrt 96 h the methanobacteria content in the a2 system was 26 18 more than a3 and methanomicrobia is 45 05 less indicating that the relative abundance of methanobacteria and methanomicrobia in the anode of the system was significantly affected by plant root location the specific competitive relationship between the two bacteria needs further study on their functions and survival in the system as hrt increased from 24 h to 96 h the archaeal community structure in the a3 system changed significantly including methanobacteria increased by 61 83 methanomicrobia decreased by 29 53 thermoplasmata increased by 50 40 halobacteria decreased by 73 21 for oc cw mfc system the change of hrt mainly changed the competition between the methanogens with hydrogen as nutrients methanobacteria and methanomicrobia the change in the hrt had the opposite effect on the change in the relative quantities between methanobacteria and methanomicrobia in the a1 and a3 systems indicating that the formation of a closed circuit had a significant effect on the competition between the two methanogenic bacteria however the change of hrt had little effect on the community structure of archaea in a2 system indicating that plant roots planted at the anode had a positive effect on the stability of the microbial structure of archaea in the system the relative abundance of hydrophophilic methanogens in cw mfc with close circuit was significantly higher than that in oc cw mfc and the relative abundance of acetotrophic methanogenesis in cw mfc with close circuit was significantly lower than that in oc cw mfc fig 7 c the result was similar to the previous study 20 the hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the system will compete with eab for h2 as electron acceptor nutritive methanogens were generally at a disadvantage in the intense competition with the eab this may be the reason for the decrease of ce the competition between eab and hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the cw mfc system needs to be further explored to improve the power generation efficiency of the system 4 conclusion this study indicated that cw mfc can significantly inhibit the methane emission due to the competition electrons and organic substrates between electricigens and methanogens the location of the rhizosphere played an important role in the bioelectricity generation and cod removal of cw mfcs when the influent cod was 200 mg l the rhizosphere located in the anode was more conducive to the electricity generation efficiency of cw mfcs and rcc cw mfc had better cod removal rate in this study the rhizosphere did not increase the do of anode but the internal resistance of cw mfc under varied hrt rac cw mfc had a more stable microbial community structure than rcc cw mfc there was a significant negative correlation between methane emissions and the abundance of proteobacteria this results suggest that operating mfc in cws can effectively control the methane emission and reasonable rhizosphere location and hrt are necessary to maximize

13397,microbial fuel cells mfc can effectively control the methane emissions from constructed wetland cw in this study the effect of rhizosphere locations on the reduction of methane emission from cw by operating mfc was further studied according to results operating mfc in cw improved the cod removal and inhibited the methane emission from cw by 1 3 plants cyperus alternifolius roots at anode were more conducive to cw mfc power generation the highest power density 47 813 mw m3 was observed in cw mfc with rhizosphere at anode the rhizosphere in cathode could improve cw mfc cod removal operating mfc led to the competition between electrogens and methanogens which changed the microbial community structure and biochemical processes in cw proteobacteria as the main electricigen in cw mfcs were specifically enriched in cw mfc with rhizosphere located in cathode as the dominant archaea methanobacteria and methanomicrobia were specifically enriched in cw mfc with rhizosphere located in anode graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords electrochemical methane control plant root location up flow constructed wetland microbial fuel cell microbial community 1 introduction constructed wetlands as a low cost and effective water treatment technology are widely used for the treatment of agricultural wastewater antibiotic wastewater livestock and poultry wastewater industrial wastewater 1 2 however during the operation of constructed wetlands large amounts of methane and carbon dioxide were detected to be emitted into the atmosphere 1 2 5 as the greenhouse gas next to co2 methane plays a crucial role in climate warming with an annual growth rate of 0 4 and a contribution rate of about 20 to global warming 6 therefore methane control in constructed wetlands is urgently needed through hydrological water level control physical aeration chemical chemicals addition redox potential control regulation numerous studies have been conducted to inhibit the methane emissions from constructed wetlands 7 8 9 10 however microbial and bioelectrochemical approach of the methane control from cws were rarely reported the relevant explorations are worthy to be carried out microbial fuel cell mfc is an environmental treatment and energy technology which can convert organic or reduced compounds to electrical energy through electrochemical reactions 11 the electrochemically active bacteria eab in the anode anaerobic zone produce electrons which are transferred through an external circuit to the cathode aerobic zone electron acceptor thus generating a current 12 13 as constructed wetlands especially vertical flow constructed wetlands has a significant redox gradient along the depth the incorporation of cw and mfc is achievable 14 15 since the constructed wetland microbial fuel cell cw mfc technology was proposed by yadav et al 16 for the first time in 2012 numerous studies on electrode materials electrode position plant species have been conducted to improve the performance of electricity generation and wastewater treatment efficiency 15 18 19 37 low ce coulomb efficiency and voltage which currently hindering the application of cw mfcs could be resulted by electrons or organic substrates competition between electricigens and other microorganisms usually methanogens 12 the electricity generation and pollutant removal of cw mfc could be improved by introducing plants especially cyperus involucratus rottboll arundo donax canna indica 13 15 the organic acids amino acids carbohydrates dead plant organics produced by plant roots can be converted into electrical energy by eabs 20 in current studies plant roots were put mostly in the cathode because the oxygen excreted by plant roots can serve as the electron acceptor in the cathode 21 22 theoretically more organic matter can be provided when the plant roots are in the anode of cw mfcs which is conducive to electricity generation since the anodes of cw mfcs are mostly under anoxic conditions rather than anaerobic conditions 23 the small amount of oxygen secreted by plant roots might have little effect on the oxygen environment of the anodes however cw mfcs with plants in the anode have been rarely reported there is no research on the effect of plant position on methane production and emissions in mfc cws despite cw mfcs hold great promise for wastewater treatment and energy recovery in the future their development is currently hampered by low electricity generation efficiency the interaction of microorganisms in the anodic zone methanogens electricigens plant decomposing bacteria etc plays a decisive role in the electricity generation and methane emission of cw mfcs 24 25 due to the similar living conditions anaerobic environment low redox potential etc the competition for substrates h2 acetate glucose organics and roots exudates etc between methanogens and electricigens is common existed in the anode of cw mfcs which may inhibit the power generation performance of cw mfcs 21 recent studies have shown that acetic acidophilic methanogen play an important role in the decomposition of organic matter in cw mfcs and hydrogenophilic methanogens may be the main electron donor competitors of electricigens 20 24 to date the competitive mechanism and microbiological process is unclear which deserve further study to maximize the benefits of cw mfcs in terms of efficient bioelectricity generation and methane emission reduction in conclusion the microbiological process of methane control in cw mfcs and the effect of plant roots position on the methane emission electricity generation of cw mfcs and need further study in this study the mechanisms of the competition between electrogenesis and methanogenesis were investigated methane emission bioelectricity generation and wastewater treatment performance of cw mfcs with plant roots in different zone anode cathode were studied under different hrt hydraulic retention time 2 materials and methods 2 1 cw mfc system configuration three identical integrated lab scale upflow cw mfc systems rac cw mfc rcc cw mfc oc cw mfc were constructed on sichuan agricultural university campus sichuan china the main structure of the cw mfc reactor was made of organic glass with internal diameter 160 mm height 470 mm and total volume 9 45 l the substrates from the bottom to the top

each phase varied hrts there were 3 experimental groups and 9 effective biological replicates after biological information analysis we obtained the comprehensive biological information analysis data of 3 groups both bioinformatics and statistical analysis were carried out the specific procedure was according our previous studies 24 26 total dna was extracted from the cw mfc samples using mo bio

the operational taxonomic units otus and shannon diversity index was produced by mothur program 3 results 3 1 methane emissions when influent cod was 200 mg l and hrt was 24 h the total methane emissions of the close circuit cw mfcs were 29 21 rcc cw mfc and 33 01 mg m2 day rac cw mfc which were lower than a third of that of the open circuit cw mfc according to fig 1 b methane emissions were positively correlated with hrt which was due to the higher organic load johansson et al 28 found that the average methane emission flux of wetlands was about 141 mg m2 day in the study of surface flow constructed wetlands for deep sewage treatment cw mfc can indeed reduce methane emission of constructed wetlands the closed circuit cw mfc system can effectively reduce the methane emissions of the wetland system which may be due to the competition of organic matter between methanogens and methanogens and the electronic competitive advantage of the anode region electrode to methanogens studies have shown that electricity producing bacteria can use organic matter to generate electricity which will compete with methanogens for organic matter 29 the anode layer in closed circuit mfc cw has a higher redox potential which makes it easier for electron producing bacteria to capture electrons than methanogens the growth of methanogens was inhibited because of their competitive advantage over methanogens 30 rosa et al 31 constructed soil mfc in flooded paddy fields planted with rice during the experiment methane emissions from mfc were reduced by about 50 compared with the control group however the influence of plant root location on system methane emission was not significant 3 2 wastewater treatment the water quality parameters cod orp do and ph were investigated as shown in fig 1 c hrt is directly proportional to the cod removal rates of the systems the highest cod removal rate was observed in rcc cw mfc 98 665 0 204 when hrt was 96 h under the same operating conditions the cod removal efficiency of the three systems was ranked as follows rcc cw mfc rac cw mfc oc cw mfc when hrt was 24 h cod removal rate of rcc cw mfc was 4 63 higher than that of oc cw mfc since the cathodic current can promote microbial activity and improve microbial metabolism 32 33 operating mfc could significantly improve the cod removal of cw the results are similar to the that of previous studies 32 33 when hrt was 48 h the cod removal of rac cw mfc was 1 61 lower than that of rcc cw mfc indicating that plant roots located at the cathode could improve the cod removal when plants roots were in cathode zone small organic molecules in the effluent could be recaptured before flowing out 34 oxidation reduction potential orp reflects the concentration of organic substrates and dissolved oxygen concentration do in the reaction system as well as the activity of organics and certain toxic compounds 34 do is an important parameter affecting the aerobic phase operation of the bioreactor 35 to monitor the operation of each layer of the reactor 7 sampling points were set in each reactor ranging from 0 to 6 where 0 and 6 are the influent and effluent respectively as shown in fig 2 a c under different hrt the orp of each water layer in the oc cw mfc open circuit cw mfc is higher than that of cc cw mfc close circuit cw mfc and the orp of rcc cw mfc is higher than that of rac cw mfc hrt is positively correlated with orp as hrt reduction leads to increased hydraulic load accelerated aerobic rate of microorganisms to organic matter and increased accumulation of reducing substances in the system which eventually results in the decrease of orp 33 36 fig 2 d f showed that the do of rac cw mfc was significantly higher than that of rcc cw mfc in each water layer of the system increasing the concentration of cathode do not only improves the efficiency of aerobic degradation but also means an increase in the concentration of electron acceptors which is conducive to improving the power generation of cw mfcs 33 36 as shown in fig 2 g i with the increase of hrt the ph value of the effluent decreased all reactors were operated in a neutral to acidic environment ph was from 6 13 to 7 19 the ph value of rac cw mfc in the anode water layer was higher than rcc cw mfc while that of rcc cw mfc in the cathode water layer was higher than rac cw mfc which may be caused by the accumulation of sugars microorganisms and other organic substances secreted by wetland plant roots 3 3 electricity generation during the stable operation of the cw mfc system the average voltage of rac cw mfc 211 69 mv were higher than that of rcc cw mfc 173 97 mv fig 3a indicating that plant roots in the anode are more beneficial to the biological electricity generation of cw mfc which was consistent with previous studies 34 the sugars organic acids amino acids polymeric carbohydrates dead cell materials etc produced by plant roots can be converted into electrical energy by eabs 20 according to fig 3 b when hrt was 96 h the current and power densities of rcc cw mfc 167 10 ma m3 32 25 mw m3 and rac cw mfc 203 46 ma m3 47 81 mw m3 observed the maximum more organic matter can be provided when the plant roots are in the anode zone of cw mfcs which may result in a higher power generation efficiency since the influent cod content of our study was low 200 mg l the power generation efficiency of rac cw mfc had a greater advantage with the increase of hrt which is consistent with previous study 34 what s more excessive root secretion of organic matter is not conducive to the cathode to produce high orp 34 as shown in fig 2 the redox gradient along the depth in rac cw mfc fig 2b was significantly greater than that in rcc cw mfc fig 2c which may play an important role in electricity generation efficiency of cw mfcs 38 39 the electrochemical characteristics of cw mfcs are explained in detail through polarization curves and power density curves fig 4 with the increase of current density the voltage decreased sharply especially in rac cw mfc as the location of the root oxygen secretion was different the catalytic activity of rcc cathode for oxygen was higher than that of rac cathode 40 as presented in fig 3 c with the increase of hrt the internal resistance of rac cw mfc decreased from 908 ω to 610 ω and then increased to 813 ω while the internal resistance of rcc cw mfc increased from 377 ω to 863 ω and then decreased to 495 ω this may be because when the hrt is shortened the water flow will increase the shear action on the biofilm reduce the attachment of non conductive substances on the biofilm improve the electron transfer efficiency between the microorganism and the electrode thus reducing the internal resistance of the battery 41 in our study the internal resistance of rac cw mfc was greater than that of rcc cw mfc in most case which may be related to the oxygen secreted by the anode root as the concentration of do at anode compartment rac cw mfc didn t increased the related microbial process of interception of partial hydrogen ions by oxygen may have occurred increasing the difficulty of hydrogen penetration despite the fact that the anodic roots exudates may provide a richer substrate for electricigens they may also have increased the resistance of the upward transport of hydrogen ions leading to greater internal resistance coulomb efficiency ce is an important parameter that characterizes the conversion of organic matter into electrons in mfc the ce of cw mfcs was positively correlated with hrt in most cases fig 3 d when hrt was 48 h and 96 h the ce of rac 43 and 93 respectively were higher than that of rcc 29 and 76 respectively indicating the longer the sewage stayed in the systems the higher the degree of organic degradation was and the better the bioelectrical performance was according to fig 2 the redox gradient along the depth in rac cw mfc fig 2b was greater than that in rcc cw mfc fig 2c which may result in the higher ce of rac cw mfc than that of rcc cw mfc 38 3 4 bacterial community dynamic analysis to investigate the effects of plant root location electrical conditions and hrt on the bacterial community of the constructed wetlands high throughput sequencing technology was used to determine the microbial diversity indices of a1 a2 and a3 systems at different hrts out numbers the alpha diversity simpson and shannon and richness chao1 and ace indices were measured in table 2 since each otu corresponds to a bacterial species the diversity and abundance of different microorganisms in the samples were evaluated through otu analysis the otu numbers of a2 and a3 are always greater than that of a1 a1 a2 and a3 represent oc cw mfc rac cw mfc and rcc cw mfc respectively indicating that the formation of electrical closed loop can promote system biodiversity which is consistent with previous studies 38 simpson and shannon reflected microbial community diversity from different angles the smaller the simpsons diversity index the higher the biodiversity and the larger the shannon index the higher the biodiversity 20 as shown in fig 5 shorter hrt 24 h was more conducive to the biodiversity of the system under different hrts the biodiversity of a2 is always higher than that of a3 suggesting that planting at the anode is more conducive to the biodiversity of the system including the cathode and anode layers furthermore the values of chao1 and ace could be used to predict the richness of microbial communities 45 when hrt 24 h the chao1 and ace in a3 1888 1861 were greater than that in a2 1813 1828 while when hrt 96 h the chao1 and ace in a3 1851 1850 were less that in a2 1940 1917 which indicated that hrt affected the richness of microbial communities differently when the root positions were different the microbial community structure of the electrode layer provides important information for understanding the active microbial population in the process of ecological power generation and bioremediation fig 6 shows the microbial community structure at phylum and class level in the anode and cathode of the three systems under different hrts the predominant phyla in these three systems were proteobacteria similar to previous study 43 chloroflexi 5 78 10 91 in cathode 10 37 20 28 in anode and planctomycetes 6 96 11 16 in cathode 4 27 10 70 in anode proteobacteria accounted for 38 06 55 73 and 28 07 60 46 of total composition in cathode and anode respectively the presence of plants in the cw mfc reactor led to the abundance of proteobacteria especially deltaproteobacteria 20 betaprobacteria alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria as the dominant class in cw mfcs played an important role in bioelectricity generation and the degradation of nitrate and nitrite 48 the increase of hrt led to an increase in the proportion of proteobacteria in the cathode bacterial community of a1 and a3 and a decrease in that of a2 it indicates that when the plant root is at the cathode the long hrt is more conducive to the increase of proteobacteria in the cathode while when the plant root is at the anode the short hrt is more beneficial to proteobacteria in cathode with the increases of hrt the relative abundance of proteus in the anode microbial communities of the three systems increased indicating that the long hydraulic time is beneficial to the growth of proteobacteria in the anode the comparison between cw a1 and cw mfc a3 system showed that the operation of mfc in cw was conducive to the growth of proteobacteria which was similar to the previous results 49 according to the comparison between rac cw mfc a2 and rcc cw mfc a3 systems plant roots in the cathode were more conducive to the growth of proteobacteria in addition to proteobacteria actinobacteria 7 44 9 77 in cathode 4 83 10 55 in anode acidobacteria 5 87 9 41 in cathode 3 17 6 35 in anode and firmicutes 0 51 1 39 in cathode 1 21 3 21 in anode in the system are also the electrogenic bacteria 20 when hrt was 96 h the relative abundance of actinobacteria in the anodes of a1 a2 and a3 systems was 4 83 10 55 and 6 30 respectively with the hrt shortened to 24 h the relative amount of actinobacteria in cw mfcs changed differently in a2 the relative amount of actinobacteria decreased by 11 66 while in a1 and a3 that increased by 101 86 and 24 76 respectively which showed that operating mfc in cw had a stabilizing effect on the change of actinobacteria abundance nmds nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis reflects the species information contained in the sample in the form of points on the multidimensional space and the distance between points reflects the degree of difference between different samples 42 the plant root position and hrt had great influence on the biological species in the system especially in the anode of the system fig 6c according to previous studies acidobacteria lives in an oligotrophic niche and its abundance is inversely related to nutrient availability 51 when the hrt was 96 h the relative abundance of acidobacteria in the anodes were 3 17 a1 6 35 a2 and 4 33 a3 and the abundance of acidobacteria in a2 anode layer increased with the increase of hrt while the opposite in a1 and a3 anode layer suggesting the plants have participated in the competition of the anodic bacteria as the hrt increased the abundance of acidobacteria in a2 cathode layer has significantly decreased by 32 45 which may because the accumulation of organic compounds synthesized by roots 20 clostridium which belongs to firmicutes have the ability to hydrolyze cellulose from dead plant roots into smaller compounds that can be exploited by the electrochemically active bacteria eab plant roots at the anode layer are more beneficial to the growth of clostridia previous study have reported that proteobacteria and firmicutes are the main eab in the up flow microbial fuel cell coupled constructed wetland reactors 20 however in this experiment firmicutes accounted for 1 21 3 21 of total composition which was much less than pervious study 53 it may be because the system has fewer plant roots and most of the nutrients in the system are small molecules so the number of proteus bacteria is greater and the number of firmicutes bacteria is less 3 5 archaeal community dynamic analysis the biosynthetic pathway of methane includes the biosynthesis with h2 co2 as the substrate acetic acid as the substrate and methyl compounds as the substrate previous study have shown that 67 of natural methane is produced by acetate substrates while less than 33 of natural methane is produced by h2 co2 conversion 11 the archaeal biological structure of the system hrt 96 h was composed of methanobacteria 10 63 71 19 methanomicrobia 13 63 52 09 thermoplasmata 9 08 20 67 halobacteria 4 55 10 59 unclassified bacteria 1 55 6 01 fig 7 of which methanobacteria and methanomicrobia are hydrogen methanogenic bacteria halobacteria is acetic acid methanogenic bacteria thermoplasmatale is autotrophic or heterotrophic organisms 55 comparing the a2 and a3 systems hrt 96 h the methanobacteria content in the a2 system was 26 18 more than a3 and methanomicrobia is 45 05 less indicating that the relative abundance of methanobacteria and methanomicrobia in the anode of the system was significantly affected by plant root location the specific competitive relationship between the two bacteria needs further study on their functions and survival in the system as hrt increased from 24 h to 96 h the archaeal community structure in the a3 system changed significantly including methanobacteria increased by 61 83 methanomicrobia decreased by 29 53 thermoplasmata increased by 50 40 halobacteria decreased by 73 21 for oc cw mfc system the change of hrt mainly changed the competition between the methanogens with hydrogen as nutrients methanobacteria and methanomicrobia the change in the hrt had the opposite effect on the change in the relative quantities between methanobacteria and methanomicrobia in the a1 and a3 systems indicating that the formation of a closed circuit had a significant effect on the competition between the two methanogenic bacteria however the change of hrt had little effect on the community structure of archaea in a2 system indicating that plant roots planted at the anode had a positive effect on the stability of the microbial structure of archaea in the system the relative abundance of hydrophophilic methanogens in cw mfc with close circuit was significantly higher than that in oc cw mfc and the relative abundance of acetotrophic methanogenesis in cw mfc with close circuit was significantly lower than that in oc cw mfc fig 7 c the result was similar to the previous study 20 the hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the system will compete with eab for h2 as electron acceptor nutritive methanogens were generally at a disadvantage in the intense competition with the eab this may be the reason for the decrease of ce the competition between eab and hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the cw mfc system needs to be further explored to improve the power generation efficiency of the system 4 conclusion this study indicated that cw mfc can significantly inhibit the methane emission due to the competition electrons and organic substrates between electricigens and methanogens the location of the rhizosphere played an important role in the bioelectricity generation and cod removal of cw mfcs when the influent cod was 200 mg l the rhizosphere located in the anode was more conducive to the electricity generation efficiency of cw mfcs and rcc cw mfc had better cod removal rate in this study the rhizosphere did not increase the do of anode but the internal resistance of cw mfc under varied hrt rac cw mfc had a more stable microbial community structure than rcc cw mfc there was a significant negative correlation between methane emissions and the abundance of proteobacteria this results suggest that operating mfc in cws can effectively control the methane emission and reasonable rhizosphere location and hrt are necessary to maximize

13398,constructed wetlands cws could be a sustainable approach to address the issue of low cost treatment of domestic wastewaters in rural and sub urban areas the present study compiles the results of a mesoscale study of tidal flow constructed wetlands tf cws with biochar bc incorporation and typha plantation p the decision appeared to be decent for treating wastewater or various parameters like biochemical oxygen demand bod nitrate no3 n sulphate so4 2 chemical oxygen demand cod phosphate po4 3 and coliforms in tf cw with tidal flow mode with effluent recirculation three setups of tf cw sb substrate bc sbp substrate bc p and sp a substrate p operated for 216 h and changes in studied parameters were recorded the enhanced results were obtained for the maximum removal of cod bod nh4 n no3 n po4 so4 2 and coliforms 94 77 96 07 85 65 64 05 71 69 77 61 and 97 27 respectively in sbp followed by sp and sb presence of carbon source in support matrix could enhance microbial activities providing extra adsorptive surface and oxygen retention which could be advantageous for tf cws thus the study suggests that tf cws with effluent re circulation and bc addition in the substratum can be an effective strategy to operate a cw effectively in remote areas for domestic and rural wastewater treatment with low energy input graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biochar n mineralization cod typha sp fecal coliform removal 1 introduction over time freshwater supply and water resource sustainability are seen to be the major threats to healthy living in urban and suburban areas even these issues can lead to the deficiency of water in the upcoming times treating wastewater can be considered as an option of water resource for various agricultural and industrial applications with industrial and agricultural wastewaters there has been enhancement in the level of nutrients as well as organic matter load in the receiving estuaries and freshwater streams as given by caselles osorio et al 1 these developments have led to a decrease in the level of oxygen and therefore there has been mortality of aquatic organisms apart from that quick algal growth and phytomass are seen as the major effect of these discharge so effective management before the discharge of such wastewater requires particular attention as several consequences such as eutrophication and degradation of freshwater resources are caused due to a large amount of nitrogen n and other wastewater nutrients released into the water streams 2 3 water quality maintenance has turned to be a serious issue all over the world because of the huge rise in population development of societies and industrial settlement numerous technologies have been applied for wastewater treatment like as activated sludge 4 tf trickling filter sbr sequencing batch reactor 5 and membrane separation 6 these technologies are somewhat expensive and not completely visible for prevalent applications particularly in the provincial areas for resolving these issues there has to be the treatment of the wastewater streams near the source as per caselles osorio et al 1 this would include the usage of constructed wetlands cws as well as lagoons names in the peri urban and rural areas while in the case of urban regions there is the use of developed and large wastewater treatment plants so there is a need of implementing sustainable feasible and eco friendly technology such as cws for the treatment of water in remote and rural areas 7 8 when a comparison is made among the technologies for n removal then conventional physicochemical methods can be replaced by the cws as they have got less economic expenditures for removing contaminants they also have less effect on the environment because the energy invested is also lower 9 in the recent past the cws has evolved from theoretical aspects into the practical scenario and it is found highly suitable for treating diverse water bodies like agricultural drainage run off domestic wastewater rivers and lakes and for industrial discharge also 7 10 11 out of the diverse kinds of cws tidal flow constructed wetlands tf cws have got high attention because of the fluctuation in water treatment patterns which offer suitable environments for the anaerobic and aerobic organisms tidal flow means that there is a recurring fed batch operation wherein cws have periodical filling with water and then they are drained by the recurring cycles oxygen get diffused into the bed and then squeezing out in next cycle leading to alternating anaerobic and aerobic environment to encourage dissimilatory nitrate reduction and nitrification processes 12 cws are described as complete biologically diverse and naturally efficient ecosystems they are advantageous in terms of being technically possible in all areas with a low cost to treat wastewater apart from their positive impacts in water treatment they also have aesthetic value cws are been created in such a manner that they utilize the operations of the natural method including soil treatment linked microbial collections and wetland vegetation for assistance in the treatment of wastewater 13 14 furthermore there is an expanding role of cws in the filtration of pollutants by the roots towards above the ground and underneath along with the prevention of clogging of the filter media 13 for the success of cws there is one most significant factor i e media as it controls the environmental situation within the porous spaces where the treatment procedure takes place the media has to possess the below attributes to take the treatment to an advanced level a it should be able to provide both an anaerobic and aerobic environment in the matrix for boosting up de nitrification nitrification processes and removal of the organic matter and b moreover if media provides an internal carbon source then the dependence of the de nitrification process on the carbon present in wastewater will reduce yet most of the cases traditional substrates such as gravels sand etc have been applied for treating water in wetlands but the traditional substrates fail to provide a carbon source as well as the required aerobic conditions in the system so their reduction capacities for pollutants is usually far limited 15 16 a critical wetland element is media because it leads to the hosting of microbial population developing aerobic anaerobic pores within the bed matrix in which the degradation kinetics proceed also reported in the previous literature 15 17 particular materials like the wetland media could supply ingredients needed for microbial metabolism and chemical adsorption of wastewater pollutants organic and construction materials are remarkable illustrations of those particular materials that enhanced chemical and microbial pollutant removing kinetics in subsurface flow wetlands due to exclusive physicochemical attributes 18 20 these kinds of salient attributes of organic and other materials may be used for maximizing pollutants removal rates in wetlands so selecting the substrate turns to be a significant aspect for removing pollutants because the different kinds of a microorganism growing in the substrate layer which is accountable to remove a pollutant microorganisms growth not only depends upon plants and substrate matrix it also depends on the conditions like anaerobic aerobic etc yet their growth is also dependent on the features of used substrates some researchers used natural and waste materials as fundamental media in tf cws which recorded an efficient performance of tf cws 21 22 for dealing with the substrate issue in cws bc has been widely utilized it is applied as a substrate in cws 7 8 as a change because of its higher capacity to remove pollutants and reduce greenhouse gas ghgs emissions this capacity is because of its large surface area high porosity and strong cation exchange capability 23 24 different factors affect the performance and efficiency for removing nitrogen in cws like the kind of substrate environmental factors the creation of steady and effective linked microbial bio films the applied hydraulic load hl and carbon source etc 25 27 with the past literature it is indicated that dozing of carbon in the cws leads to improvement in the microbial colonization as well as their functioning it also improves the effectiveness of the complete removal process due to its absorption phenomena of chemical substances from the wastewater 28 29 as given by gagnon et al 30 the incorporation of carbon stocks in the cw arrangements could lead to the higher efficiency of nitrogen reduction yet just a few types of research have been performed with bc packed tidal flow constructed wetlands in the past research performed by saeed et al 31 regarding tf cws where there has been the comparative assessment of diverse substrate material organic coal bc and coco peat waste slag constructional concrete block gravel wherein it showed effective outcomes for nitrogen and organic matter with the organic substrate 71 85 and 84 96 when compared to the constructional substrate i e just 49 69 and 74 95 respectively in tf cws in another study i e by li et al 32 there was an investigation of four systems tf cw and along with the intermittent aeration wherein they recorded the best performance in tf cw with bc with an efficacy of 98 3 for the nh4 n reduction as work by feng et al 33 there was improved nitrogen removal efficacy in cws when the anaerobically digested swine wastewater was treated in a batch arrangement their research revealed that the inclusion of bc leads to improvement in nitrogen elimination by 30 9 to 40 1 in comparison to the arrangements lacking bc moreover by this research it is indicated that n2o emission fluxes could be reduced after the bc used in such treatment arrangement in one more investigation by jia et al 34 it was observed that high rate nitrate and heavy metal reduction from groundwater when treated by cw which was transformed with iron carbon based fec substrate in the bottom medium there was around an 87 reduction of nitrate in such systems with low nitrous oxide n2o emission rates while experiments moreover heavy metals total cr and total pb was decreased by 19 43 in fec spiked cws zhong et al 35 revealed incorporation of bc in cws could be a supportable approach for the enhancement of nitrogen reduction in cws moreover they reported effective improvement in the elimination of tn and no3 n by 59 8 93 0 and 83 1 100 respectively bolton et al 36 reported that bc incorporation in cw enhanced phosphorous reduction from sewage water it was revealed that adsorption might have played a vital role in overall p removal from wastewater at the time of the treatment with the assessment it was revealed bc enhanced p reduction i e 77 during the experimentation phase apart from that few of the studies show that bc along with the zeolites reflected improved outcomes of wastewater pollutants removal like as given in the study by guo et al 37 when bc zeolite is added to cw then there is a significant increase in the arsenic elimination by 53 56 in arsenic containing biogas slurry of a pig farm with the zeolite bc amended cws there was evidence of high elimination of nh4 n tp and cod which showed the scaling effect of adsorptive attributes of bc on pollutants elimination rates in another study by abedi and mojiri 38 evaluated the impact of bc zeolite on the removal efficacy of cws and their outcomes revealed around 99 9 elimination of cod nh4 n phenol pb and mn as of the wastewater even there was a reduction in the n2o emission rate in cws amended with bc besides the improved oxygen supply in a cw change of bc might be a sustainable way to increase the working capability of such systems for treating domestic wastewater in a study by ji et al 34 it was given that bc amended cw with better aeration could lead to significant improvement in the working capacity of a cw and it also assists in the lessening of ghgs from cws while the treatment procedure bc increased the microbial community biodiversity and affluence in the substratum the present study was designed to evaluate the natural method for recharging dissolved oxygen do in the cws to achieve sustainable development goals as in the past various strategies has been implied to enhance the oxygen levels in wetlands such as aeration by external means this external supply of oxygen requires the energy input hence it adds to the cost and maintenance further in the remote areas and the villages there is still a struggle for electricity so the supply of oxygen by external means is not possible in such areas therefore this study aims for refinement in design by making changes in the configuration and operational strategy of cws furthermore this study targets to explore the effluent re circulation along with the tidal flow operational strategy in vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland vssfcws this study mainly aims 1 to investigate the working of tf cws for the removal of nutrients and coliforms with effluent re circulation 2 the study targets to check the relevance of bc in tf cws with and without plantation for nutrient and coliform reduction with effluent re circulation strategy 3 the study also targets to evaluate the do recharging by natural means i e tidal flow operational mode the obtained results from the study will be beneficial for providing a sustainable approach to treat wastewater and do recharge by natural method in wetlands 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the experimental setup of tf cws the experimental reactor units used to remove contaminants from vertical sub surface flow constructed wetlands vssfcws were established in a plastic container the reactors were operated with down flow and tidal flow operational mode in mesoscales vssfcws the reactors were operated as sb sbp and sp a sb reactor unit with the incorporation of bc no typha sp plantation b sbp reactor unit with the incorporation of bc and typha sp plantation c sp reactor unit with typha sp plantation but no bc addition the three identical reactor units operated in the outdoor of doon university dehradun india which were exposed to the natural climatic conditions from october to january 2020 21 the reactor units established with different compositions are described in fig 1 reactor units were made of a plastic container with the dimension ø 33 5 cm and 37 cm height and 30 l in capacity the reactor units consisted of four layers of different compositions and depths as per chand et al 7 tidal flow with effluent re circulation was the strategy implied during the study in the vssfcws reactor units to observe the reduction of nutrients from the wetlands tidal flow operation mainly implies the dry and wet phases in the wetlands where the wet period is the flooding period and the dry phase is when the reactor is drained out and left for dissolved oxygen do enrichment in the present study with the concept of fill and draw reactors were kept flooded for 3 days and then the reactors were given a 24 hour dry phase the whole experiment was carried in 3 cycles where each cycle was of 3 days the effluent of the first drain was used as an influent for the next cycle and the sequence followed till the last cycle the main reason for tidal mode operation was to ensure an alternating aerobic and anaerobic environment inside the reactor bed 32 39 as the process of tidal flow ensure the replenishment of oxygen levels in the reactor bed after effluent draining 40 the experiment started in the morning hours and the wastewater was filled into the reactor units continuously for 35 45 min until the flood condition appeared in the system the hydraulic retention time hrt was counted after filling of complete wastewater in vssfcws 2 2 analytical procedures and sampling the inlet and outlet samples 150 ml were taken for analysis each morning to see the reduction in each reactor unit to get more consistent outcomes specimens samples of water from the outlet were collected in 3 batches with 15 min gap and then taken for the analyses the characteristics of domestic wastewater cod bod nh4 n no3 n po4 3 coliforms and tn were analysed using industry standard methods as outlined in apha 41 apart from that ph values of the samples were measured using a ph meter and the dissolved oxygen do was assessed using a do meter hq40d hach usa all solutions and standards were made with ar grade chemicals that were primarily provided by merck germany and had a purity of 99 2 3 statistical analysis three cycles of vf cw were performed to get an average trend of results all observations were presented in mean with standard deviation anova one way followed by post hoc hsd turkey s multiple ranged tests was used to check the significant difference among sb sbp and sp for various physicochemical properties of treated water by tf cws all tests were performed using ibm spss 20 chicago usa software and box plots and whisker plots were prepared using statistica statistica inc software package 3 results and discussion 3 1 do dynamics in tf cws the profile of do levels in various tf cws reactor units is shown in fig 2 the average do concentration of the wastewater at 0 h was 6 16 mg l 1 the do levels were satisfactory with the tidal flow strategy the variation could be seen in the do levels after each cycle a do levels in the reactor units at the end of the first cycle were as sb 1 88 mg l 1 sp 3 37 mg l 1 and sbp 3 60 mg l 1 b duirng the initial period of the second cycle do levels were sb 4 17 mg l 1 sp 4 79 mg l 1 and sbp 5 58 mg l 1 and by the end of the third cycle it reached to 0 81 mg l 1 sb 2 57 mg l 1 sp and 3 06 mg l 1 sbp reactor unit the result of the study indicates the significance of the tidal flow operational strategy which can be seen through the end of the cycle to the start of a new cycle the influence of plant stands and bc in wetlands on do levels could also be seen through this as the air diffusion and oxygen delivery from plant roots become the primary sources of oxygen 23 adding to that bc in the substrate matrix can be a valuable addition because of its porous morphology cracks and holes that can provide a suitable space for do retention 7 32 the tidal flow operational strategy seems to be a good option for the do recharge in the cws all the reactor units showed good do levels by the virtue of which we could see the enhanced removal result in the reactor units 3 2 cod dynamics in tf cws the average influent load in the tf cws of cod was 360 08 mg l 1 table 1 the maximum cod removal efficacy was achieved in the sbp i e 40 94 89 44 and 94 77 followed by sp 28 90 79 41 and 84 72 and sb 15 75 45 47 and 61 85 with hrt of 72 144 and 216 h respectively as described in fig 3 the cod removal results could be directly related to the do present in the reactor units as cod removal depends on the aerobic degradation performed by microorganisms and the dynamic of oxidative chemical processes in the medium when there is no external source of air atmospheric diffusion becomes the major source of oxygen in a conventional wetland and oxygen is supplied through the roots of plants 23 apart from that role of bc is also vital in the reactor units as bc has porous morphology cracks and holes that can provide a suitable space for do retention thus here can be a valuable addition for do enrichments 7 32 the results reveal a major distinction between sb sp and sbp reactor units in terms of do environment in the reactor units as it reflects the importance of plants and bc incorporation together the typha sp leaf might have contributed to high respiration and photosynthesis activities in tf cws leading to efficient oxygen supply in its rhizome in wetlands similarly the bc porous morphology could have been attributed to the do retention in wetlands further during the study cod removal in the sb was very low in the first cycle of 3 days it was 15 75 which could be due to the high organic load the competitive environment for the oxygen consumption nitrification process and organic matter degradation the result of sb reflects the importance of plants stand in the wetlands as the results are on the lower side in the first cycle than that of sbp 40 94 and sp 28 90 previous literature also reported that apart from air diffusion the plant rhizome is the primary source of oxygen in the cws supplying oxygen to the submerged substrate 42 this further facilitates the microbial growth by the virtue of rapid degradation of organic load in wastewater occurs 23 43 during the second cycle of 3 d an increase in efficacy was observed in all the reactors with effluent recirculation this phenomenon on increase could be understood by the tidal flow operation mode since the tf cws mechanism ensures the oxygen in the cws due to its repeated filling and drawing wet and dry period concept thus media pores get filled by air through atmospheric diffusion this hypothesis is also supported by the present study which is reflecting in the do levels this procedure allows the development of aerobic conditions inside the reactor bed 12 44 which helps in the enhanced degradation of organic matter due to increased do levels as a result of which increased removal results can be observed over the period further in the third cycle of the study maximum removal results were observed for sb 61 85 sbp 94 77 and sp 84 72 the possible mechanisms for the cod reduction in the tf cws could be understood as a whenever bc addition is there with an appropriate quantity in cws then there is huge surface area and porosity which leads to higher adsorption and upgrading of redox responses 28 45 some of the factors involved in the increased cod reduction might be due to the molecules intermolecular hydrogen bonding π π interaction and electrostatic attraction repulsion 28 46 b bc incorporation in the medium also provides the advantageous space for microbial activities 8 which results in an improved reduction c cod removal is co related with oxygen recharge in the reactor units through the flood and drains concept of the tidal flow strategy which effectively helped to improve the do concentration in the cws d further there can be an enhancement in cod reduction by the root zone treatment i e phytoremediation and the microbial degradation of organics 42 and 5 apart from this other factors that could be involved in the reduction of the cod in cws could be precipitation anaerobic digestion and oxidation 47 48 which could also play an important role further the do levels were comparable with saeed and sun 15 and zhou et al 23 the decrease in sb reactor do levels below the limitation 1 5 mg l 1 could be due to organic matter degradation microbial activities and nh4 n oxidation in the tf cws 32 3 3 bod reduction in tf cws typha sp developed well in the bc gravel based cws when filled with domestic wastewater the intensification of the plants has an impact on treatment procedures in the system and it adds to the elimination of bod5 and wastewater nutrients the elimination of bod5 ranged from 34 66 mg l 1 to 123 66 mg l 1 in sb 11 83 to 109 66 mg l 1 in the sp and 6 5 to 98 66 mg l 1 in the spb reactor the related values with bc and plant stand appeared to be the best among all the reactor units bod5 eliminations are attained by recirculation in tf cws are represented in fig 4 the availability of do was not the limiting aspect it was in supportive ranges in favour of the heterotrophic organics degradation kinetics because of the tf cws operation the reduction phenomena could be related to the overall organic load in cws microbial activities like both aerobic and anaerobic and also the virtue of the physical procedures of filtration and sedimentation 7 8 49 dyamanagowdru and lokeshappa 50 reported that the bod5 reduction efficacy up to 70 in cws fixed with v zizanioide with hrt of 6 d for domestic wastewater treatment in the present study the enhanced removal efficacy can be attributed to diverse factors like wastewater recirculation oxygen transfers by tidal flow approach bc and the root system of typha sp which enhanced in due course as per alemu et al 51 90 of bod5 reduction was reported when the experiment was carried out through an anaerobic sbr reactor coupled with cws operated with 5 d hrt for the treatment of tannery effluent one more study in kenya which was conducted in pilot hssfcw planted with cyperus papyrus for the treatment of domestic wastewater revealed an efficacy of 60 7 for bod5 52 a similar pilot study with the use of hssfcw for treating domestic wastewater reflected an elimination rate for bod5 of 70 3 with 5 d hrt and bod5 of 86 4 with 10 d hrt 53 when a comparison is made with the above mentioned studies we got comparatively superior reduction results for bod5 for both planted and non planted the results of the present study showed that the cw planted with typha incorporated with bc eliminated bod5 to 96 07 than sp reactor bod5 92 81 and the least reduction in sb 78 89 with tf cws operational strategy fig 4 the existence of plants and the selection of appropriate wetland plants have been demonstrated the enhanced pollutant elimination by cws 54 as given by akratos and tsihrintzis 55 88 3 and 84 5 elimination of bod5 was achieved in hssfcw with typha latifolia and phragmites australis respectively 3 4 nh4 n reduction in tf cws the reduction of nitrogen in cws is directly co related with oxygen levels in the wetlands the present adapting the tidal flow operational strategy proved to be effective in maintaining the do levels in the cws as do is one of the requirements for effective nitrification with higher do loads in wetlands though the n transformation in cws is dependent on both nitrification and denitrification processes i e openly influenced by the level of oxygen 49 56 57 as illustrated in fig 5 nh4 n reduction is directly influenced by the do levels during the study the tf cws proved to be effective for reducing the nh4 n with all the reactor units especially with the sbp reactor which came out with the best performance the results revealed the maximum of 43 76 69 93 and 85 65 with hrt of 72 144 and 216 h respectively the reason for the effectiveness of the reactor unit spb could be explained by the incorporation of bc in the substrate matrix which has the potential to adsorb more nh4 n 58 not only does adsorption bc addition promotes plants growth this also contributes to the nh4 n reduction through assimilation by plant roots the significance of plants is revealed through the results of this study when compared with the sb reactor unit and also acknowledged by previous literature 23 59 60 the important parameter for nitrification is the presence of oxygen and during the study do concentration was quite good in the spb reactor in previous literature s it is documented that when do exceeds the limit of 1 5 mg l 1 the nitrification is carried out easily 58 61 this fact is also acknowledged by hu et al 27 revealing that do must be greater than 1 5 mg l 1 for nitrification to meet the above requirement of do in the reactor units tidal flow operational strategy came out as the best low cost do recharge strategy all this was supported by the incorporation of bc and plant stand in the sbp reactor unit which benefited the growth of nitrifying bacteria and benefited the nitrification 2nh4 3o2 2no 2 2h2o 4h energy and no 2 h2o no3 2h 2e 7 further the maximum efficacy of the spb reactor was followed up by the sp reactor unit with 18 82 48 08 and 73 27 with and cyclic hrt of 72 144 and 216 h respectively tf cws with effluent re circulation seems to be working for the reduction of nh4 n in the sp reactor unit but the results reflect the importance of bc incorporation in the wetlands with the plant stand as when we compare the results with the spb reactor it s significantly showing the lower removal results this suggests that bc addition could enhance the reduction in cws this is also been acknowledged in previous literature s that when bc with plant stand could benefit plant growth and provide appropriate microclimate for nh4 n oxidizing bacteria which has a significant impact on nh4 n reduction 46 62 apart from that bc is also vital in the reactor units as bc has porous morphology cracks and holes that can provide a suitable space for do retention thus here can be a valuable addition for do enrichments 7 32 the lower efficacy could also be explained through the competitive environment for consumption of oxygen which is caused by the virtue of organic matter degradation and nitrification process for oxygen tidal flow operation strategy utilized for the oxygen recharge which helped the cause in the present study for effective reduction adding to that other factors influencing reduction are such as sand gravels adsorption plant uptake ammonia volatilization and exchange of cations for ammonium 58 63 now coming to the least effective reactor which disappointed in terms of the removal efficacy sb reactor didn t stand up to the mark with the other two reactors showing the efficacy of 24 80 43 18 and 49 32 reduction this lower reduction could be understood by the lower do profile in the sb reactor this is simply because the competitive environment in the reactor unit for oxygen consumption caused by nitrification process as well as organic matter degradation comprehensively could become a reason for lower reduction of nh4 n 9 the process of nh4 n transformation in cws implies nh4 n to no2 n conversion and then further to no3 n that is mostly influenced by do level in the reactor units 18 further the reactor units reduction mechanism was mainly influenced by the bc due to porous structure 46 and also the morphological advantage with cracks and holes on the surface that provide space microbial attachment 60 which was one of the factors for the reduction in sb reactor now comparing all three reactors it is suggested that bc incorporation and addition of plant in the cws could improve the reduction of nh4 n moreover srivastava et al 64 documented that presence of so4 2 provides an electron acceptor for the reduction of nh4 by the virtue of which enhanced efficacy could be obtained further some of the earlier studies have also acknowledged the significance of oxygen in the wetlands and researchers have tested various methods such as continuous aeration intermittent aeration tidal flow etc for nh4 n reduction 65 68 all this indicates that do concentration is vital for the nh4 n reduction cws 3 5 no3 n removal in tf cws in the present study tf cws showed a limited reduction no3 n this was mainly because of the do concentration as the nitrification occurs smoothly when do levels are higher than 1 50 mg l 1 and denitrification when the do levels are less than 0 50 mg l 1 56 as we can see through the do profile i e do was not the limiting factor during the study due to the tidal flow operational strategy as a result of which during the first cycle we could see a negative response of the no3 n in all the reactor units this increase in the concentration of no3 n values was the result of the nitrification process in which nh4 n was gradually transformed into no3 n 32 gradually after the first cycle the reduction started to appear in the reactors units by the end of the third cycle the spb reactor shows a significant amount of reduction i e 64 05 which was followed by the sb 48 94 and sp 45 03 the reason for the slight reduction during the second cycle and a promising reduction during the third cycle could be possible due to the presence of plant stand and the incorporation of the bc in the spb reactor unit could have helped the reduction of no3 n by the virtue of adsorption and uptake by plant simultaneously 69 this is also further documented in the previous literature the no3 n reduction is mainly influenced by plant uptake microbial denitrification microbe catabolism and adsorption 70 71 further a study conducted in horizontal flow constructed wetland by kasak et al 69 revealed promising no3 n reduction with bc incorporation in planted typha latifolia cw as the tf cws were not deficient in the do with and without bc hence the main path of reduction during the study would be adsorption and plant uptake mechanism simultaneously apart from that during the study domestic wastewater was used containing so4 2 as well as documented in previous literature so4 2 and no3 n when co existed the priority is given to the decrease of no3 n mainly related to the difference in energy released during the reduction mechanisms of these two wastewater nutrients 72 73 3 6 po4 3 removal in tf cws the results are illustrated in fig 6 revealing the po4 3 reduction in all three reactor units the spb was the most dominant reactor in terms of reduction of po4 3 with a maximum efficacy of 71 69 then after that sp reactor unit possessed efficacy of 63 43 and the least effective reactor unit was the sb reactor which showed an efficacy of 41 12 a significant difference in the reduction capabilities of the reactor units could be seen as all the units were operated under the tidal operational condition the variation in reduction capabilities could be due to the incorporation of bc and the presence absence of plants in the reactor unit 46 as the po4 3 reduction is mainly dominated by the precipitation adsorption or accumulation processes in mineral media 46 48 another factor could be microbial inhabitation of porous bc which could promote the bioconversion of liable p into microbial biomass apart from that bc mesopores are also capable to store dissolve organic matters as feedstock for such microbes involved in p biostabilization as well 74 ayaz et al 75 reported that the addition of zeolites in cws play a vital role in po4 3 reduction from wastewater and therefore substrate filling in cws directly affects the po4 3 reduction from such systems few previous reports also suggest p transformation mediated by microbes and plant uptake as well in cws 7 29 previous literature also suggested that p removal is mainly influenced by the media adsorption kinetics in tf cws 31 a media based investigation made by kizito et al 28 for po4 3 p reduction reported 0 9 0 2 mg g 1 adsorption capacity for gravels and 2 2 0 2 and 3 3 0 6 mg g 1 in corn cob bc packed system and wood bc packed system respectively which reflects the importance of amendment in cws media apart from the conventional ones other mechanisms could be the polyphosphates synthesis by the bacterial community which could be found under some conditions like aerobiosis but it is however reversible by nature phosphate release under an aerobiosis 8 71 in an investigation dhanya and jaya 76 reported the efficacy of 70 3 for po4 3 removal in wetlands with vetiver grass which is comparable with the present study similarly angassa et al 49 revealed the efficacy of 86 7 and 85 6 with plant stand vetiveria zizanioide and phragmites karka respectively in hssfcws the difference occurring in our study could be due to the plant species as different plant species have different nutrient treatment capabilities 71 and the presence of bc apart from that operational parameters such as flooding aeration intermittent tidal etc also influence the removal of the po4 3 in the cws 3 7 so4 2 removal in tf cws tf cws utilized for the reduction of the so4 2 with recurring cycles with effluent re circulation showed promising results which are illustrated in fig 6 the mean influent load of the so4 2 84 54 mg l 1 reduced to 18 2 to 80 37 mg l 1 in the effluent of tf cws the present observed the dominating nature of sbp in reduction of so4 2 during the monitoring period with the efficacy of 61 76 73 92 and 77 61 followed by sp 23 24 52 11 and 60 42 and sb 22 63 40 0 and 51 77 in 72 144 216 h respectively the reduction of so4 2 in wetlands is mainly influenced by various mechanisms i e uptake by the plant nitrate removal mechanisms precipitating with metal ions dissimilatory sulphate reduction oxidative chemical processes etc 7 71 77 factors responsible for the sulphate reducing bacterial activity are such as a support matrix for microbial attachment near neutral ph so4 2 source and c source 70 78 further in the sbp setup the addition of bc and plant stand could have enhanced the reduction of so4 2 as bc is a porous material that could provide an adsorptive surface 7 apart from the mechanism like plant uptake microbial oxidation might be a prominent process for so4 2 removal from wastewater in tf cws other mechanisms in sulphate reduction could be immobilization inside the wetlands that have been planted chemical as well as biological oxidation processes and rigorous dissimilatory sulphate etc 71 79 further the hypothesis is supported by the lower reduction of so4 2 in the sp setup than the sbp set up suggesting that tidal operation in combination with substrate incorporation of bc with plant stand could provide enhanced reduction results for so4 2 a study conducted by chen et al 77 documented that during aerobic treatments sulphate and nitrate removal is combined with sulphur oxidation in cws resulting in simultaneous sulphate and nitrate reduction in water it is presumed that nitrification during tidal operation mode could have played a vital role in the overall removal of so4 2 in sbp and sp set up further an investigation by 79 for the treatment of dairy wastewater reported removal of so4 2 47 hfcw and 41 4 vfcw which is less than our study 3 8 reduction of coliform in tf cws the reduction in tf cws is illustrated in fig 7 the influent load of coliform in wastewater was 3000 mpn 100 mg l 1 and which abridged to a significant number i e 872 mpn 100 mg l 1 sb 81 mpn 100 mg l 1 sbp and 415 mpn 100 mg l 1 sp in the treated water after a complete cycle the maximum reduction of the population of total coliforms appeared in sbp 97 27 followed by sp 86 16 and sb 70 93 the reduction pattern in tf cws for coliforms suggests a continuous decrease cycle after cycle until the process comes to an end the coliforms reduction in wetlands is the result of filtration through porous medium 80 the use of finer bedding material and a longer hydraulic retention period can help achieve optimum overall coliform elimination 48 the overall coliforms eradication results in this investigation are consistent with mbow et al 81 90 in hfcws and upper than results reported by nguyen et al 82 70 in bc packed combined vfcw and free flow cws total coliform removal is a complicated process that is controlled by several factors including retention duration ph do medium texture rhizome root structure and influent load the sbp exhibited better removal efficiency for the total coliforms population probably by the virtue of bc incorporation and supply of do load in the system de rozari et al 29 also reported significant removal of total coliforms in bc amended cw after system maturation the total coliform effluent load in tf cws also meets the desired standard as determined by the national agency for surface discharge of treated water 4 conclusion to enhance the oxygen levels in vssfcws a tidal flow operational strategy was developed with the incorporation of bc with conventional media and the integration of typha sp in the system the treatment using tf cws for nutrients and coliforms present in wastewater was greatly influenced by the tidal flow operation mode which ensures good do levels in the wetlands apart from that presence of plants with bc had a great impact on the reduction of pollutants the quality of water in the spb system was best with maximum efficacy for cod bod nh4 n no3 n po4 so4 2 and coliforms 94 77 96 07 85 65 64 05 71 69 77 61 and 97 27 respectively this finding suggests that tf cws with bc incorporation in the planted wetland that too with effluent re circulation can be handy for rural and domestic wastewater treatment but before getting to any conclusion researchers acknowledge that further investigation with a more rigorous methodology is desired since the study conducted is preliminary in general tidal flow operation for supplementary oxygen supply and bc in cws may provide an

13398,constructed wetlands cws could be a sustainable approach to address the issue of low cost treatment of domestic wastewaters in rural and sub urban areas the present study compiles the results of a mesoscale study of tidal flow constructed wetlands tf cws with biochar bc incorporation and typha plantation p the decision appeared to be decent for treating wastewater or various parameters like biochemical oxygen demand bod nitrate no3 n sulphate so4 2 chemical oxygen demand cod phosphate po4 3 and coliforms in tf cw with tidal flow mode with effluent recirculation three setups of tf cw sb substrate bc sbp substrate bc p and sp a substrate p operated for 216 h and changes in studied parameters were recorded the enhanced results were obtained for the maximum removal of cod bod nh4 n no3 n po4 so4 2 and coliforms 94 77 96 07 85 65 64 05 71 69 77 61 and 97 27 respectively in sbp followed by sp and sb presence of carbon source in support matrix could enhance microbial activities providing extra adsorptive surface and oxygen retention which could be advantageous for tf cws thus the study suggests that tf cws with effluent re circulation and bc addition in the substratum can be an effective strategy to operate a cw effectively in remote areas for domestic and rural wastewater treatment with low energy input graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biochar n mineralization cod typha sp fecal coliform removal 1 introduction over time freshwater supply and water resource sustainability are seen to be the major threats to healthy living in urban and suburban areas even these issues can lead to the deficiency of water in the upcoming times treating wastewater can be considered as an option of water resource for various agricultural and industrial applications with industrial and agricultural wastewaters there has been enhancement in the level of nutrients as well as organic matter load in the receiving estuaries and freshwater streams as given by caselles osorio et al 1 these developments have led to a decrease in the level of oxygen and therefore there has been mortality of aquatic organisms apart from that quick algal growth and phytomass are seen as the major effect of these discharge so effective management before the discharge of such wastewater requires particular attention as several consequences such as eutrophication and degradation of freshwater resources are caused due to a large amount of nitrogen n and other wastewater nutrients released into the water streams 2 3 water quality maintenance has turned to be a serious issue all over the world because of the huge rise in population development of societies and industrial settlement numerous technologies have been applied for wastewater treatment like as activated sludge 4 tf trickling filter sbr sequencing batch reactor 5 and membrane separation 6 these technologies are somewhat expensive and not completely visible for prevalent applications particularly in the provincial areas for resolving these issues there has to be the treatment of the wastewater streams near the source as per caselles osorio et al 1 this would include the usage of constructed wetlands cws as well as lagoons names in the peri urban and rural areas while in the case of urban regions there is the use of developed and large wastewater treatment plants so there is a need of implementing sustainable feasible and eco friendly technology such as cws for the treatment of water in remote and rural areas 7 8 when a comparison is made among the technologies for n removal then conventional physicochemical methods can be replaced by the cws as they have got less economic expenditures for removing contaminants they also have less effect on the environment because the energy invested is also lower 9 in the recent past the cws has evolved from theoretical aspects into the practical scenario and it is found highly suitable for treating diverse water bodies like agricultural drainage run off domestic wastewater rivers and lakes and for industrial discharge also 7 10 11 out of the diverse kinds of cws tidal flow constructed wetlands tf cws have got high attention because of the fluctuation in water treatment patterns which offer suitable environments for the anaerobic and aerobic organisms tidal flow means that there is a recurring fed batch operation wherein cws have periodical filling with water and then they are drained by the recurring cycles oxygen get diffused into the bed and then squeezing out in next cycle leading to alternating anaerobic and aerobic environment to encourage dissimilatory nitrate reduction and nitrification processes 12 cws are described as complete biologically diverse and naturally efficient ecosystems they are advantageous in terms of being technically possible in all areas with a low cost to treat wastewater apart from their positive impacts in water treatment they also have aesthetic value cws are been created in such a manner that they utilize the operations of the natural method including soil treatment linked microbial collections and wetland vegetation for assistance in the treatment of wastewater 13 14 furthermore there is an expanding role of cws in the filtration of pollutants by the roots towards above the ground and underneath along with the prevention of clogging of the filter media 13 for the success of cws there is one most significant factor i e media as it controls the environmental situation within the porous spaces where the treatment procedure takes place the media has to possess the below attributes to take the treatment to an advanced level a it should be able to provide both an anaerobic and aerobic environment in the matrix for boosting up de nitrification nitrification processes and removal of the organic matter and b moreover if media provides an internal carbon source then the dependence of the de nitrification process on the carbon present in wastewater will reduce yet most of the cases traditional substrates such as gravels sand etc have been applied for treating water in wetlands but the traditional substrates fail to provide a carbon source as well as the required aerobic conditions in the system so their reduction capacities for pollutants is usually far limited 15 16 a critical wetland element is media because it leads to the hosting of microbial population developing aerobic anaerobic pores within the bed matrix in which the degradation kinetics proceed also reported in the previous literature 15 17 particular materials like the wetland media could supply ingredients needed for microbial metabolism and chemical adsorption of wastewater pollutants organic and construction materials are remarkable illustrations of those particular materials that enhanced chemical and microbial pollutant removing kinetics in subsurface flow wetlands due to exclusive physicochemical attributes 18 20 these kinds of salient attributes of organic and other materials may be used for maximizing pollutants removal rates in wetlands so selecting the substrate turns to be a significant aspect for removing pollutants because the different kinds of a microorganism growing in the substrate layer which is accountable to remove a pollutant microorganisms growth not only depends upon plants and substrate matrix it also depends on the conditions like anaerobic aerobic etc yet their growth is also dependent on the features of used substrates some researchers used natural and waste materials as fundamental media in tf cws which recorded an efficient performance of tf cws 21 22 for dealing with the substrate issue in cws bc has been widely utilized it is applied as a substrate in cws 7 8 as a change because of its higher capacity to remove pollutants and reduce greenhouse gas ghgs emissions this capacity is because of its large surface area high porosity and strong cation exchange capability 23 24 different factors affect the performance and efficiency for removing nitrogen in cws like the kind of substrate environmental factors the creation of steady and effective linked microbial bio films the applied hydraulic load hl and carbon source etc 25 27 with the past literature it is indicated that dozing of carbon in the cws leads to improvement in the microbial colonization as well as their functioning it also improves the effectiveness of the complete removal process due to its absorption phenomena of chemical substances from the wastewater 28 29 as given by gagnon et al 30 the incorporation of carbon stocks in the cw arrangements could lead to the higher efficiency of nitrogen reduction yet just a few types of research have been performed with bc packed tidal flow constructed wetlands in the past research performed by saeed et al 31 regarding tf cws where there has been the comparative assessment of diverse substrate material organic coal bc and coco peat waste slag constructional concrete block gravel wherein it showed effective outcomes for nitrogen and organic matter with the organic substrate 71 85 and 84 96 when compared to the constructional substrate i e just 49 69 and 74 95 respectively in tf cws in another study i e by li et al 32 there was an investigation of four systems tf cw and along with the intermittent aeration wherein they recorded the best performance in tf cw with bc with an efficacy of 98 3 for the nh4 n reduction as work by feng et al 33 there was improved nitrogen removal efficacy in cws when the anaerobically digested swine wastewater was treated in a batch arrangement their research revealed that the inclusion of bc leads to improvement in nitrogen elimination by 30 9 to 40 1 in comparison to the arrangements lacking bc moreover by this research it is indicated that n2o emission fluxes could be reduced after the bc used in such treatment arrangement in one more investigation by jia et al 34 it was observed that high rate nitrate and heavy metal reduction from groundwater when treated by cw which was transformed with iron carbon based fec substrate in the bottom medium there was around an 87 reduction of nitrate in such systems with low nitrous oxide n2o emission rates while experiments moreover heavy metals total cr and total pb was decreased by 19 43 in fec spiked cws zhong et al 35 revealed incorporation of bc in cws could be a supportable approach for the enhancement of nitrogen reduction in cws moreover they reported effective improvement in the elimination of tn and no3 n by 59 8 93 0 and 83 1 100 respectively bolton et al 36 reported that bc incorporation in cw enhanced phosphorous reduction from sewage water it was revealed that adsorption might have played a vital role in overall p removal from wastewater at the time of the treatment with the assessment it was revealed bc enhanced p reduction i e 77 during the experimentation phase apart from that few of the studies show that bc along with the zeolites reflected improved outcomes of wastewater pollutants removal like as given in the study by guo et al 37 when bc zeolite is added to cw then there is a significant increase in the arsenic elimination by 53 56 in arsenic containing biogas slurry of a pig farm with the zeolite bc amended cws there was evidence of high elimination of nh4 n tp and cod which showed the scaling effect of adsorptive attributes of bc on pollutants elimination rates in another study by abedi and mojiri 38 evaluated the impact of bc zeolite on the removal efficacy of cws and their outcomes revealed around 99 9 elimination of cod nh4 n phenol pb and mn as of the wastewater even there was a reduction in the n2o emission rate in cws amended with bc besides the improved oxygen supply in a cw change of bc might be a sustainable way to increase the working capability of such systems for treating domestic wastewater in a study by ji et al 34 it was given that bc amended cw with better aeration could lead to significant improvement in the working capacity of a cw and it also assists in the lessening of ghgs from cws while the treatment procedure bc increased the microbial community biodiversity and affluence in the substratum the present study was designed to evaluate the natural method for recharging dissolved oxygen do in the cws to achieve sustainable development goals as in the past various strategies has been implied to enhance the oxygen levels in wetlands such as aeration by external means this external supply of oxygen requires the energy input hence it adds to the cost and maintenance further in the remote areas and the villages there is still a struggle for electricity so the supply of oxygen by external means is not possible in such areas therefore this study aims for refinement in design by making changes in the configuration and operational strategy of cws furthermore this study targets to explore the effluent re circulation along with the tidal flow operational strategy in vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland vssfcws this study mainly aims 1 to investigate the working of tf cws for the removal of nutrients and coliforms with effluent re circulation 2 the study targets to check the relevance of bc in tf cws with and without plantation for nutrient and coliform reduction with effluent re circulation strategy 3 the study also targets to evaluate the do recharging by natural means i e tidal flow operational mode the obtained results from the study will be beneficial for providing a sustainable approach to treat wastewater and do recharge by natural method in wetlands 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the experimental setup of tf cws the experimental reactor units used to remove contaminants from vertical sub surface flow constructed wetlands vssfcws were established in a plastic container the reactors were operated with down flow and tidal flow operational mode in mesoscales vssfcws the reactors were operated as sb sbp and sp a sb reactor unit with the incorporation of bc no typha sp plantation b sbp reactor unit with the incorporation of bc and typha sp plantation c sp reactor unit with typha sp plantation but no bc addition the three identical reactor units operated in the outdoor of doon university dehradun india which were exposed to the natural climatic conditions from october to january 2020 21 the reactor units established with different compositions are described in fig 1 reactor units were made of a plastic container with the dimension ø 33 5 cm and 37 cm height and 30 l in capacity the reactor units consisted of four layers of different compositions and depths as per chand et al 7 tidal flow with effluent re circulation was the strategy implied during the study in the vssfcws reactor units to observe the reduction of nutrients from the wetlands tidal flow operation mainly implies the dry and wet phases in the wetlands where the wet period is the flooding period and the dry phase is when the reactor is drained out and left for dissolved oxygen do enrichment in the present study with the concept of fill and draw reactors were kept flooded for 3 days and then the reactors were given a 24 hour dry phase the whole experiment was carried in 3 cycles where each cycle was of 3 days the effluent of the first drain was used as an influent for the next cycle and the sequence followed till the last cycle the main reason for tidal mode operation was to ensure an alternating aerobic and anaerobic environment inside the reactor bed 32 39 as the process of tidal flow ensure the replenishment of oxygen levels in the reactor bed after effluent draining 40 the experiment started in the morning hours and the wastewater was filled into the reactor units continuously for 35 45 min until the flood condition appeared in the system the hydraulic retention time hrt was counted after filling of complete wastewater in vssfcws 2 2 analytical procedures and sampling the inlet and outlet samples 150 ml were taken for analysis each morning to see the reduction in each reactor unit to get more consistent outcomes specimens samples of water from the outlet were collected in 3 batches with 15 min gap and then taken for the analyses the characteristics of domestic wastewater cod bod nh4 n no3 n po4 3 coliforms and tn were analysed using industry standard methods as outlined in apha 41 apart from that ph values of the samples were measured using a ph meter and the dissolved oxygen do was assessed using a do meter hq40d hach usa all solutions and standards were made with ar grade chemicals that were primarily provided by merck germany and had a purity of 99 2 3 statistical analysis three cycles of vf cw were performed to get an average trend of results all observations were presented in mean with standard deviation anova one way followed by post hoc hsd turkey s multiple ranged tests was used to check the significant difference among sb sbp and sp for various physicochemical properties of treated water by tf cws all tests were performed using ibm spss 20 chicago usa software and box plots and whisker plots were prepared using statistica statistica inc software package 3 results and discussion 3 1 do dynamics in tf cws the profile of do levels in various tf cws reactor units is shown in fig 2 the average do concentration of the wastewater at 0 h was 6 16 mg l 1 the do levels were satisfactory with the tidal flow strategy the variation could be seen in the do levels after each cycle a do levels in the reactor units at the end of the first cycle were as sb 1 88 mg l 1 sp 3 37 mg l 1 and sbp 3 60 mg l 1 b duirng the initial period of the second cycle do levels were sb 4 17 mg l 1 sp 4 79 mg l 1 and sbp 5 58 mg l 1 and by the end of the third cycle it reached to 0 81 mg l 1 sb 2 57 mg l 1 sp and 3 06 mg l 1 sbp reactor unit the result of the study indicates the significance of the tidal flow operational strategy which can be seen through the end of the cycle to the start of a new cycle the influence of plant stands and bc in wetlands on do levels could also be seen through this as the air diffusion and oxygen delivery from plant roots become the primary sources of oxygen 23 adding to that bc in the substrate matrix can be a valuable addition because of its porous morphology cracks and holes that can provide a suitable space for do retention 7 32 the tidal flow operational strategy seems to be a good option for the do recharge in the cws all the reactor units showed good do levels by the virtue of which we could see the enhanced removal result in the reactor units 3 2 cod dynamics in tf cws the average influent load in the tf cws of cod was 360 08 mg l 1 table 1 the maximum cod removal efficacy was achieved in the sbp i e 40 94 89 44 and 94 77 followed by sp 28 90 79 41 and 84 72 and sb 15 75 45 47 and 61 85 with hrt of 72 144 and 216 h respectively as described in fig 3 the cod removal results could be directly related to the do present in the reactor units as cod removal depends on the aerobic degradation performed by microorganisms and the dynamic of oxidative chemical processes in the medium when there is no external source of air atmospheric diffusion becomes the major source of oxygen in a conventional wetland and oxygen is supplied through the roots of plants 23 apart from that role of bc is also vital in the reactor units as bc has porous morphology cracks and holes that can provide a suitable space for do retention thus here can be a valuable addition for do enrichments 7 32 the results reveal a major distinction between sb sp and sbp reactor units in terms of do environment in the reactor units as it reflects the importance of plants and bc incorporation together the typha sp leaf might have contributed to high respiration and photosynthesis activities in tf cws leading to efficient oxygen supply in its rhizome in wetlands similarly the bc porous morphology could have been attributed to the do retention in wetlands further during the study cod removal in the sb was very low in the first cycle of 3 days it was 15 75 which could be due to the high organic load the competitive environment for the oxygen consumption nitrification process and organic matter degradation the result of sb reflects the importance of plants stand in the wetlands as the results are on the lower side in the first cycle than that of sbp 40 94 and sp 28 90 previous literature also reported that apart from air diffusion the plant rhizome is the primary source of oxygen in the cws supplying oxygen to the submerged substrate 42 this further facilitates the microbial growth by the virtue of rapid degradation of organic load in wastewater occurs 23 43 during the second cycle of 3 d an increase in efficacy was observed in all the reactors with effluent recirculation this phenomenon on increase could be understood by the tidal flow operation mode since the tf cws mechanism ensures the oxygen in the cws due to its repeated filling and drawing wet and dry period concept thus media pores get filled by air through atmospheric diffusion this hypothesis is also supported by the present study which is reflecting in the do levels this procedure allows the development of aerobic conditions inside the reactor bed 12 44 which helps in the enhanced degradation of organic matter due to increased do levels as a result of which increased removal results can be observed over the period further in the third cycle of the study maximum removal results were observed for sb 61 85 sbp 94 77 and sp 84 72 the possible mechanisms for the cod reduction in the tf cws could be understood as a whenever bc addition is there with an appropriate quantity in cws then there is huge surface area and porosity which leads to higher adsorption and upgrading of redox responses 28 45 some of the factors involved in the increased cod reduction might be due to the molecules intermolecular hydrogen bonding π π interaction and electrostatic attraction repulsion 28 46 b bc incorporation in the medium also provides the advantageous space for microbial activities 8 which results in an improved reduction c cod removal is co related with oxygen recharge in the reactor units through the flood and drains concept of the tidal flow strategy which effectively helped to improve the do concentration in the cws d further there can be an enhancement in cod reduction by the root zone treatment i e phytoremediation and the microbial degradation of organics 42 and 5 apart from this other factors that could be involved in the reduction of the cod in cws could be precipitation anaerobic digestion and oxidation 47 48 which could also play an important role further the do levels were comparable with saeed and sun 15 and zhou et al 23 the decrease in sb reactor do levels below the limitation 1 5 mg l 1 could be due to organic matter degradation microbial activities and nh4 n oxidation in the tf cws 32 3 3 bod reduction in tf cws typha sp developed well in the bc gravel based cws when filled with domestic wastewater the intensification of the plants has an impact on treatment procedures in the system and it adds to the elimination of bod5 and wastewater nutrients the elimination of bod5 ranged from 34 66 mg l 1 to 123 66 mg l 1 in sb 11 83 to 109 66 mg l 1 in the sp and 6 5 to 98 66 mg l 1 in the spb reactor the related values with bc and plant stand appeared to be the best among all the reactor units bod5 eliminations are attained by recirculation in tf cws are represented in fig 4 the availability of do was not the limiting aspect it was in supportive ranges in favour of the heterotrophic organics degradation kinetics because of the tf cws operation the reduction phenomena could be related to the overall organic load in cws microbial activities like both aerobic and anaerobic and also the virtue of the physical procedures of filtration and sedimentation 7 8 49 dyamanagowdru and lokeshappa 50 reported that the bod5 reduction efficacy up to 70 in cws fixed with v zizanioide with hrt of 6 d for domestic wastewater treatment in the present study the enhanced removal efficacy can be attributed to diverse factors like wastewater recirculation oxygen transfers by tidal flow approach bc and the root system of typha sp which enhanced in due course as per alemu et al 51 90 of bod5 reduction was reported when the experiment was carried out through an anaerobic sbr reactor coupled with cws operated with 5 d hrt for the treatment of tannery effluent one more study in kenya which was conducted in pilot hssfcw planted with cyperus papyrus for the treatment of domestic wastewater revealed an efficacy of 60 7 for bod5 52 a similar pilot study with the use of hssfcw for treating domestic wastewater reflected an elimination rate for bod5 of 70 3 with 5 d hrt and bod5 of 86 4 with 10 d hrt 53 when a comparison is made with the above mentioned studies we got comparatively superior reduction results for bod5 for both planted and non planted the results of the present study showed that the cw planted with typha incorporated with bc eliminated bod5 to 96 07 than sp reactor bod5 92 81 and the least reduction in sb 78 89 with tf cws operational strategy fig 4 the existence of plants and the selection of appropriate wetland plants have been demonstrated the enhanced pollutant elimination by cws 54 as given by akratos and tsihrintzis 55 88 3 and 84 5 elimination of bod5 was achieved in hssfcw with typha latifolia and phragmites australis respectively 3 4 nh4 n reduction in tf cws the reduction of nitrogen in cws is directly co related with oxygen levels in the wetlands the present adapting the tidal flow operational strategy proved to be effective in maintaining the do levels in the cws as do is one of the requirements for effective nitrification with higher do loads in wetlands though the n transformation in cws is dependent on both nitrification and denitrification processes i e openly influenced by the level of oxygen 49 56 57 as illustrated in fig 5 nh4 n reduction is directly influenced by the do levels during the study the tf cws proved to be effective for reducing the nh4 n with all the reactor units especially with the sbp reactor which came out with the best performance the results revealed the maximum of 43 76 69 93 and 85 65 with hrt of 72 144 and 216 h respectively the reason for the effectiveness of the reactor unit spb could be explained by the incorporation of bc in the substrate matrix which has the potential to adsorb more nh4 n 58 not only does adsorption bc addition promotes plants growth this also contributes to the nh4 n reduction through assimilation by plant roots the significance of plants is revealed through the results of this study when compared with the sb reactor unit and also acknowledged by previous literature 23 59 60 the important parameter for nitrification is the presence of oxygen and during the study do concentration was quite good in the spb reactor in previous literature s it is documented that when do exceeds the limit of 1 5 mg l 1 the nitrification is carried out easily 58 61 this fact is also acknowledged by hu et al 27 revealing that do must be greater than 1 5 mg l 1 for nitrification to meet the above requirement of do in the reactor units tidal flow operational strategy came out as the best low cost do recharge strategy all this was supported by the incorporation of bc and plant stand in the sbp reactor unit which benefited the growth of nitrifying bacteria and benefited the nitrification 2nh4 3o2 2no 2 2h2o 4h energy and no 2 h2o no3 2h 2e 7 further the maximum efficacy of the spb reactor was followed up by the sp reactor unit with 18 82 48 08 and 73 27 with and cyclic hrt of 72 144 and 216 h respectively tf cws with effluent re circulation seems to be working for the reduction of nh4 n in the sp reactor unit but the results reflect the importance of bc incorporation in the wetlands with the plant stand as when we compare the results with the spb reactor it s significantly showing the lower removal results this suggests that bc addition could enhance the reduction in cws this is also been acknowledged in previous literature s that when bc with plant stand could benefit plant growth and provide appropriate microclimate for nh4 n oxidizing bacteria which has a significant impact on nh4 n reduction 46 62 apart from that bc is also vital in the reactor units as bc has porous morphology cracks and holes that can provide a suitable space for do retention thus here can be a valuable addition for do enrichments 7 32 the lower efficacy could also be explained through the competitive environment for consumption of oxygen which is caused by the virtue of organic matter degradation and nitrification process for oxygen tidal flow operation strategy utilized for the oxygen recharge which helped the cause in the present study for effective reduction adding to that other factors influencing reduction are such as sand gravels adsorption plant uptake ammonia volatilization and exchange of cations for ammonium 58 63 now coming to the least effective reactor which disappointed in terms of the removal efficacy sb reactor didn t stand up to the mark with the other two reactors showing the efficacy of 24 80 43 18 and 49 32 reduction this lower reduction could be understood by the lower do profile in the sb reactor this is simply because the competitive environment in the reactor unit for oxygen consumption caused by nitrification process as well as organic matter degradation comprehensively could become a reason for lower reduction of nh4 n 9 the process of nh4 n transformation in cws implies nh4 n to no2 n conversion and then further to no3 n that is mostly influenced by do level in the reactor units 18 further the reactor units reduction mechanism was mainly influenced by the bc due to porous structure 46 and also the morphological advantage with cracks and holes on the surface that provide space microbial attachment 60 which was one of the factors for the reduction in sb reactor now comparing all three reactors it is suggested that bc incorporation and addition of plant in the cws could improve the reduction of nh4 n moreover srivastava et al 64 documented that presence of so4 2 provides an electron acceptor for the reduction of nh4 by the virtue of which enhanced efficacy could be obtained further some of the earlier studies have also acknowledged the significance of oxygen in the wetlands and researchers have tested various methods such as continuous aeration intermittent aeration tidal flow etc for nh4 n reduction 65 68 all this indicates that do concentration is vital for the nh4 n reduction cws 3 5 no3 n removal in tf cws in the present study tf cws showed a limited reduction no3 n this was mainly because of the do concentration as the nitrification occurs smoothly when do levels are higher than 1 50 mg l 1 and denitrification when the do levels are less than 0 50 mg l 1 56 as we can see through the do profile i e do was not the limiting factor during the study due to the tidal flow operational strategy as a result of which during the first cycle we could see a negative response of the no3 n in all the reactor units this increase in the concentration of no3 n values was the result of the nitrification process in which nh4 n was gradually transformed into no3 n 32 gradually after the first cycle the reduction started to appear in the reactors units by the end of the third cycle the spb reactor shows a significant amount of reduction i e 64 05 which was followed by the sb 48 94 and sp 45 03 the reason for the slight reduction during the second cycle and a promising reduction during the third cycle could be possible due to the presence of plant stand and the incorporation of the bc in the spb reactor unit could have helped the reduction of no3 n by the virtue of adsorption and uptake by plant simultaneously 69 this is also further documented in the previous literature the no3 n reduction is mainly influenced by plant uptake microbial denitrification microbe catabolism and adsorption 70 71 further a study conducted in horizontal flow constructed wetland by kasak et al 69 revealed promising no3 n reduction with bc incorporation in planted typha latifolia cw as the tf cws were not deficient in the do with and without bc hence the main path of reduction during the study would be adsorption and plant uptake mechanism simultaneously apart from that during the study domestic wastewater was used containing so4 2 as well as documented in previous literature so4 2 and no3 n when co existed the priority is given to the decrease of no3 n mainly related to the difference in energy released during the reduction mechanisms of these two wastewater nutrients 72 73 3 6 po4 3 removal in tf cws the results are illustrated in fig 6 revealing the po4 3 reduction in all three reactor units the spb was the most dominant reactor in terms of reduction of po4 3 with a maximum efficacy of 71 69 then after that sp reactor unit possessed efficacy of 63 43 and the least effective reactor unit was the sb reactor which showed an efficacy of 41 12 a significant difference in the reduction capabilities of the reactor units could be seen as all the units were operated under the tidal operational condition the variation in reduction capabilities could be due to the incorporation of bc and the presence absence of plants in the reactor unit 46 as the po4 3 reduction is mainly dominated by the precipitation adsorption or accumulation processes in mineral media 46 48 another factor could be microbial inhabitation of porous bc which could promote the bioconversion of liable p into microbial biomass apart from that bc mesopores are also capable to store dissolve organic matters as feedstock for such microbes involved in p biostabilization as well 74 ayaz et al 75 reported that the addition of zeolites in cws play a vital role in po4 3 reduction from wastewater and therefore substrate filling in cws directly affects the po4 3 reduction from such systems few previous reports also suggest p transformation mediated by microbes and plant uptake as well in cws 7 29 previous literature also suggested that p removal is mainly influenced by the media adsorption kinetics in tf cws 31 a media based investigation made by kizito et al 28 for po4 3 p reduction reported 0 9 0 2 mg g 1 adsorption capacity for gravels and 2 2 0 2 and 3 3 0 6 mg g 1 in corn cob bc packed system and wood bc packed system respectively which reflects the importance of amendment in cws media apart from the conventional ones other mechanisms could be the polyphosphates synthesis by the bacterial community which could be found under some conditions like aerobiosis but it is however reversible by nature phosphate release under an aerobiosis 8 71 in an investigation dhanya and jaya 76 reported the efficacy of 70 3 for po4 3 removal in wetlands with vetiver grass which is comparable with the present study similarly angassa et al 49 revealed the efficacy of 86 7 and 85 6 with plant stand vetiveria zizanioide and phragmites karka respectively in hssfcws the difference occurring in our study could be due to the plant species as different plant species have different nutrient treatment capabilities 71 and the presence of bc apart from that operational parameters such as flooding aeration intermittent tidal etc also influence the removal of the po4 3 in the cws 3 7 so4 2 removal in tf cws tf cws utilized for the reduction of the so4 2 with recurring cycles with effluent re circulation showed promising results which are illustrated in fig 6 the mean influent load of the so4 2 84 54 mg l 1 reduced to 18 2 to 80 37 mg l 1 in the effluent of tf cws the present observed the dominating nature of sbp in reduction of so4 2 during the monitoring period with the efficacy of 61 76 73 92 and 77 61 followed by sp 23 24 52 11 and 60 42 and sb 22 63 40 0 and 51 77 in 72 144 216 h respectively the reduction of so4 2 in wetlands is mainly influenced by various mechanisms i e uptake by the plant nitrate removal mechanisms precipitating with metal ions dissimilatory sulphate reduction oxidative chemical processes etc 7 71 77 factors responsible for the sulphate reducing bacterial activity are such as a support matrix for microbial attachment near neutral ph so4 2 source and c source 70 78 further in the sbp setup the addition of bc and plant stand could have enhanced the reduction of so4 2 as bc is a porous material that could provide an adsorptive surface 7 apart from the mechanism like plant uptake microbial oxidation might be a prominent process for so4 2 removal from wastewater in tf cws other mechanisms in sulphate reduction could be immobilization inside the wetlands that have been planted chemical as well as biological oxidation processes and rigorous dissimilatory sulphate etc 71 79 further the hypothesis is supported by the lower reduction of so4 2 in the sp setup than the sbp set up suggesting that tidal operation in combination with substrate incorporation of bc with plant stand could provide enhanced reduction results for so4 2 a study conducted by chen et al 77 documented that during aerobic treatments sulphate and nitrate removal is combined with sulphur oxidation in cws resulting in simultaneous sulphate and nitrate reduction in water it is presumed that nitrification during tidal operation mode could have played a vital role in the overall removal of so4 2 in sbp and sp set up further an investigation by 79 for the treatment of dairy wastewater reported removal of so4 2 47 hfcw and 41 4 vfcw which is less than our study 3 8 reduction of coliform in tf cws the reduction in tf cws is illustrated in fig 7 the influent load of coliform in wastewater was 3000 mpn 100 mg l 1 and which abridged to a significant number i e 872 mpn 100 mg l 1 sb 81 mpn 100 mg l 1 sbp and 415 mpn 100 mg l 1 sp in the treated water after a complete cycle the maximum reduction of the population of total coliforms appeared in sbp 97 27 followed by sp 86 16 and sb 70 93 the reduction pattern in tf cws for coliforms suggests a continuous decrease cycle after cycle until the process comes to an end the coliforms reduction in wetlands is the result of filtration through porous medium 80 the use of finer bedding material and a longer hydraulic retention period can help achieve optimum overall coliform elimination 48 the overall coliforms eradication results in this investigation are consistent with mbow et al 81 90 in hfcws and upper than results reported by nguyen et al 82 70 in bc packed combined vfcw and free flow cws total coliform removal is a complicated process that is controlled by several factors including retention duration ph do medium texture rhizome root structure and influent load the sbp exhibited better removal efficiency for the total coliforms population probably by the virtue of bc incorporation and supply of do load in the system de rozari et al 29 also reported significant removal of total coliforms in bc amended cw after system maturation the total coliform effluent load in tf cws also meets the desired standard as determined by the national agency for surface discharge of treated water 4 conclusion to enhance the oxygen levels in vssfcws a tidal flow operational strategy was developed with the incorporation of bc with conventional media and the integration of typha sp in the system the treatment using tf cws for nutrients and coliforms present in wastewater was greatly influenced by the tidal flow operation mode which ensures good do levels in the wetlands apart from that presence of plants with bc had a great impact on the reduction of pollutants the quality of water in the spb system was best with maximum efficacy for cod bod nh4 n no3 n po4 so4 2 and coliforms 94 77 96 07 85 65 64 05 71 69 77 61 and 97 27 respectively this finding suggests that tf cws with bc incorporation in the planted wetland that too with effluent re circulation can be handy for rural and domestic wastewater treatment but before getting to any conclusion researchers acknowledge that further investigation with a more rigorous methodology is desired since the study conducted is preliminary in general tidal flow operation for supplementary oxygen supply and bc in cws may provide an option for low energy input cost effective easy operational strategy for sustainable wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

13399,herein polypyrrole films are coated on polyester pet fabrics via environmentally friendly chemical oxidative polymerization method producing conducting fabrics of excellent electrical conductivity the electrical resistance of the developed conducting textile is 11 kω compared to 90 mω for the untreated textile fabrics the developed flexible conducting fabrics are used for efficient removal of copper ions through electrochemical reduction at constant applied potential to the fabrics the effect of different types of dopants namely 2 naphthalene sulfonic acid sodium salt nsa anthraquinone 2 sulfonic acid sodium salt aqsa benzene sulfonic acid sodium salt bsa and sodium dodecyl sulfate sds is studied on the polymerization efficiency of polypyrrole chains on polyester fabrics the efficiency of electro removal of copper ions from solutions is explained in terms of the structural differences between the different dopants used during the polymerization step additionally the influence of different dopants on the capability of developed flexible polypyrrole based electrode for electroremoval of copper ions was studied the developed flexible electrode realizes a removal uptake capacity of 61 5 mg g of coated fabrics using anthraquinone 2 sulfonic acid sodium salt as dopant with a removal efficiency of 69 the effect the initial copper ions concentrations on the removal efficiency is also evaluated the developed conducting fabrics are characterized using spectroscopic x ray diffraction xrd microscopic and surface electrical resistance measurements this study introduces new and cost effective approach for facile synthesis simple processing and safe handling of flexible conducting textile based electrode for the electrochemical removal and recovery of cu ii ions form aqueous solutions with superior merits compared to previously reported surfaces graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords conducting textiles copper ions electrochemical removal polyester polypyrrole 1 introduction heavy metal ions are considered to be one of the main industrial wastewater contaminants even at trace concentrations 1 10 among heavy metals family cu ii ions are essential element for various living systems and their excess and or deficiency may lead to several health issues and causes various diseases 11 17 on the other hand cu ii ions are released from various industrial sources such as metal finishing paper and paperboard mills wood pulp production fertilizer industry electroplating hydrometallurgy and electronics industry 11 18 19 there is rapid depletion of metals and their natural sources in conjunction with their growing needs in industry hence it is important to remove these essential metals from the wastewater before discharging for further recovery attempts several methods have been used to treat the heavy metals contaminated effluents such as chemical precipitation electrochemical deposition ion exchange adsorption filtration and solvent extraction 20 21 among the suggested tools is the electrochemical deposition the electrochemical approach is a simple and clean technology for addressing this issue this is due to its merits such as ambient operating conditions and can be easily stopped via switching off the power and profitable metals may be recovered 22 moreover the electrochemical recovery can be achieved by a redox reaction without the production of large volumes of chemical sludge compared to other physical and chemical methods 22 23 the electrochemical recovery by reduction process is unique since different metals can be recycled and recovered with reasonable purity from a mixture of pollutants via applying the specific reduction potential and tuning the alternating current 24 conducting polymers are considered among the smart polymer family due to their unique properties 23 25 among them is polypyrrole ppy a well known member of conducting polymers and received intensive attentions due to its good electrical conductivity easily synthesis procedures and high thermal and environmental stability 25 27 some studies were conducted using ppy in different forms for metal recovery from solution samples via electrochemical routes due to its good redox properties 28 29 also various metals ions such as silver cadmium mercury lead platinum and arsenic have been removed from aqueous solutions by ppy 30 36 however it has been reported that there are challenges in removal of some heavy metals such as iron and copper using conducting polymers due to the inferior reduction potential of these metals to overoxidize conducting polymers 19 therefore there are few attempts used to recover copper and silver ions using modified ppy based electrode under potentiostatic conditions 37 38 some ppy modified based electrodes were exploited for this purpose 39 44 ppy modified electrode showed superior electrocatalytic effect and enhanced removal of cu ii from the acidified cu ii solutions compared to other conventional stainless steel electrodes 40 the improvement in electroremoval of cu ii was attributed to the superior surface area of new ppy modified electrode 40 the modification of ppy based electrode offers new properties to the electrode surface to achieve selective separation of cu ii ions 40 this agrees with previous reports stating that tuning the physical properties structure surface area porosity and electrical conductivity of electrode play key roles for the electroremoval efficiency 42 44 to the best of our knowledge very few works are reported using ppy coated flexible composite as electrode materials for the electrochemical reduction and separation of copper ions interestingly ppy chains can be easily synthesized over the surface of different substrates such as textiles fibers glasses and papers 45 46 48 we were motivated to develop flexible conducting textile fabrics based on facile deposition of ppy chains on polyester fabrics and its exploitation for efficient electroremoval of cu ii ions from aqueous solutions in this study polypyrrole is chemically synthesized on polyester pet ppy fabrics and applied for the removal of copper ions from aqueous solutions under potentiostatic reduction we used different types of dopants namely 2 naphthalene sulfonic acid sodium salt nsa anthraquinone 2 sulfonic acid sodium salt aqsa benzene sulfonic acid sodium salt bsa and sodium dodecyl sulfate sds to compare the polymerization efficiency of polypyrrole chains over the polyester fabrics also the influence of the structures of different dopants on the capability of the developed flexible ppy electrode for the electroremoval of copper ions is studied other parameters are investigated to optimize the electrochemical reduction efficiency of copper using pet ppy such as the effect of dopant type aqsa nsa bsa and sds and initial heavy metal ions concentrations 2 experimental 2 1 materials polyester fabrics are supplied by el besheer fabrics egypt the fabric samples are scoured in a solution of 2 g l of sodium carbonate and 2 g l of a non ionic detergent at 80 c for 30 min to remove impurities and then dried pyrrole 98 hydrochloric acid 37 hcl sulfuric acid 98 h2so4 ferric chloride hexahydrate 97 fecl3 6h2o and cupric sulfate 98 cuso4 5h2o were obtained from sigma aldrich germany anthraquinone 2 sulfonic acid sodium salt monohydrate 98 aqsa 2 naphthalene sulfonic acid sodium salt 98 nsa benzene sulfonic acid sodium salt 99 bsa and sodium dodecyl sulfate 99 sds were purchased from across belgium 2 2 chemical synthesis of polypyrrole on pet pet ppy the synthesis of ppy chains on polyester textiles surface is achieved by chemical oxidative polymerization technique using fecl3 as oxidant based on a previous report 49 the molar ratios monomer oxidant dopant used in the chemical synthesis were 1 2 5 0 3 50 in brief in a glass beaker fecl3 solution is prepared in aqueous solution of 0 03 m of aqsa or nsa or bsa or sds then fabric samples 2 cm 2 cm were soaked in the oxidant solution for 1 h with the aid of an ultrasonic treatment for 20 min to improve the diffusion of the oxidant into the fabrics then 0 1 m pyrrole solution was added into the reaction mixture and left for 1 h at 5 c as the polymerization is completed the coated polyester fabrics are washed using distilled water and finally dried in an oven at 70 c for 1 h 2 3 electroremoval of cu ii ions from aqueous solutions electrodeposition of cu ii ions was conducted in a single compartment cell containing copper ions solution of 100 ppm 100 mg l prepared by dissolving 0 3929 g of cuso4 5h2o in 1 0 l of 0 1 m h2so4 at a potential of 0 5 v for 50 min the applied reduction potentials for cu ii ions are in accordance with literature 51 a platinum wire was used as the counter electrode potential measurements are referred to ag agcl 3 m kcl reference electrode a 2 cm 2 cm of pet ppy film is used as the working electrode the volume of the aqueous solution used for each experiment is 25 ml all solutions are prepared using deionized water the concentrations of metal ions are determined by using atomic absorption aas all experiments are carried out in triplicate at each condition and the mean values are calculated additionally metal ions samples are collected at time intervals within 50 min the concentration of cu ii is determined using an external standard calibration method the removal capacity the amount of cu ii electrodeposited on pet ppy electrode is calculated by subtracting the amount deposited before and after electrochemical reduction using the following equation 1 q c o c e v m where co and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of cu ii mg l m is the mass of the used ppy coated pet g and v is the volume of solution l the removal efficiency was calculated using the following equation 2 removal efficiency c initial c final c final 100 where c initial is the initial concentration of copper ions before removal and c final is the final concentration of copper ions after its partial removal at a given time interval 2 4 characterization the morphology of uncoated and coated textile fabrics is investigated using scanning electron microscopy sem under high field emission quanta feg 250 instrument fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir spectra of

multimeter samples after heavy metals ions removed are monitored by a thermo m series atomic absorption spectrometer electrochemical removal was accomplished by using a bas 100b electrochemical analyzer bioanalytical systems bas west lafayette usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural characterization of pet ppy composites the ppy films are polymerized on flexible polyester fabrics via chemical oxidative process using different dopants then utilized for electroremoval of cu ii ions from aqueous solution as depicted in fig 1 it is found the type of dopant has significant impact on the yield of polymerized ppy layer on pet surface the ppy film yields are 14 7 1 5 6 and 4 4 when using aqsa nsa bsa and sds dopants respectively the formed conducting textile fabrics are further characterized using spectroscopy microscopic tools and measuring their corresponding electrical resistances fig 2 represents the characteristic ft ir absorption peaks of uncoated pet the absorption peaks observed at 2970 1710 1243 and 725 cm 1 correspond to ch co co stretching vibrations and out of plane bending of p disubstituted benzene ring in polyester respectively 52 54 for pet ppy aqsa the absorption peaks observed at 3420 1539 1453 and 1292 cm 1 correspond to the stretching vibration of nh cc cc and cn fig 2 respectively the absorption peaks located at 1171 1121 1039 and 775 cm 1 are attributed to pyrrole ring which proves the completion of ppy polymerization 25 27 while the absorption peak noticed at 1186 cm 1 corresponds to the so stretching vibration of sulfonate anions so3 of the dopant the peaks located at 1671 cm 1 and 660 cm 1 are related to aqsa 53 54 fig 2c depicts the absorption peaks of pet ppy nsa in addition to the existence of all characteristic absorption peaks of ppy as discussed above absorption peak observed at 1292 cm 1 is shifted to 1260 cm 1 due to different degrees of doping 46 55 the characteristic absorption band of nsa is detected at 609 cm 1 56 for pet ppy bsa and pet ppy sds fig 2 the absorption peaks characteristic for ppy appear at 3438 1550 and 1121 cm 1 which are attributed to nh cc stretching and pyrrole bending respectively 27 46 the characteristic absorption peaks of bsa and sds overlap with the strong pet absorption peaks 57 we noticed the variation of dopants peaks intensities which revealed the different levels of polymer doping the surface morphologies of uncoated and coated pet fabrics are investigated using sem fig 3a shows the smooth morphology of uncoated pet fibers 58 59 for pet ppy aqsa a rough surface layer is observed in fig 3b indicating the dense ppy films formation similar dense and rough surface morphology is observed for pet ppy nsa reflecting the polymerized ppy layer as shown in fig 3c for pet ppy bsa sds less roughened surface is noticed compared to pet ppy aqsa nsa indicating less density of ppy layer polymerized on pet fibers as indicated in fig 3d e this reflects the impact of type of dopant on the polymerization efficacy and yield on pet fiber surfaces this supported the impact of dopant type on ppy layer yield polymerized on pet surface these results are in agreement with previous reports which state that the type of counter ion of dopant has effect on surface morphology of coated layer 56 60 61 hence the surface morphology attained with the counter ion of aqsa dopant has the ability to afford stability of the conducting polymer films which retard the oxygen diffusion 61 therefore this is consistent with a previous report stating that the dopants possess at least one sulphonic group to stabilize the conductivity of ppy 61 62 this was further affirmed from the electrical resistance data of the prepared conducting textile fabrics the electrical resistance of pet ppy aqsa pet ppy nsa pet ppy bsa and pet ppy sds were found to be 11 22 85 and 250 kω respectively compared to 90 mω for uncoated pet at this stage the formation of conducting textiles is confirmed this revealed the positive impact of dopant on improving the electrical conductivity in this study with different types of dopants in the following order aqsa nsa bsa sds the uncoated and coated pet are characterized using xrd fig 4a represents the xrd patterns of uncoated pet which shows three diffraction peaks positioned at 2θ values of 17 5 22 9 and 26 1 63 64 similar xrd diffraction peaks are observed in pet ppy aqsa at the same diffraction angles the characteristic ppy xrd peak which is mainly located at 2θ of 25 5 is due to the scattering of ppy chains at interplanar spacing 65 66 and overlaps with the high intensity pet peaks 3 2 electroremoval of cu ii from aqueous solutions using pet ppy the synthesized conducting textile fabrics using four different dopants are evaluated for the electroremoval of cu ii ions from aqueous solution the dimension of the fabric electrode used is 2 cm 2 cm the electrodeposition of cu ii is achieved in a single compartment cell containing copper solution of 100 ppm 100 mg l we then evaluate the effects of changing the type of dopant and the metal ions concentrations on the efficiency of copper ions removal the electroremoval of cu ii data using pet ppy doped with different dopants are tabulated in table 1 the results revealed that the electroremoval efficiency of cu ii is observed in higher value in case of pet ppy aqsa nsa achieving removal efficiency values of 56 and 40 respectively table 1 however poor electroremoval efficiency is observed for conducting textile fabrics doped with bsa and sds dopants recording removal efficiency of 8 and 5 respectively this inferior electroremoval efficiency of conducting textile fabrics doped with bsa and sds could be attributed to higher electrical resistance of pet ppy bsa sds compared to pet ppy aqsa nsa and this is confirmed with the lower conducting coating layer yield in their case 5 6 and 4 4 yield compared to higher ones in case of pet ppy aqsa nsa 14 and 7 1 this positive effect of aqsa and nsa could be due to their planar structure which affords suitable polymer structure stacking and leads to good electron hopping 67 69 furthermore the electrodeposition and recovery of cu ii ions from solution to conducting textile fabrics surface was elucidated using sem equipped with edx fig 5 represents the surface morphology of pet ppy aqsa after electrodeposition of cu from solution the deposited cu particles were visualized in the form of white particles and in the form sunflower like structure dispersed over the surface of pet ppy aqsa as indicated in high magnification images fig 5c d the existence of cu particles on the pet ppy aqsa was further confirmed by the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx equipped with sem fig 5e represents the edx spectra of pet ppy aqsa cu which indicates in addition to carbon sulphur oxygen nitrogen and chlorine elements the presence of copper element fig 5e it is important to note that the ph is adjusted at the beginning of the experiment at 5 0 which is the optimum ph value for cu ii ions to exist as free ions 70 the influence of cu ii ions concentrations on the electroremoval efficiency from aqueous solution is studied and data are given in table 2 and in fig 6 it is revealed from the data as cu ii ions concentration increases the electroremoval efficiency of cu ii ions increases achieving 69 as optimum efficiency this agrees with previously reported results stating that the initial cu ii ions concentration plays a key role in the removal efficiency of cu ii 43 this effect is attributed to the higher ions concentration which facilitates their transport through the formed pores on the electrode surface however after 60 ppm 60 mg l concentration of cu ii ions the efficiency starts to stabilize and tend to decrease over 100 ppm 100 mg l fig 6 we conclude from the data that the removal percent is at a given ratio compared to the initial concentration value regardless of the initial concentration this can be explained by an established equilibrium between the pet ppy aqsa electrode and the metal solution for the sake of confirmation the remaining solution of concentration 100 ppm 100 mg l 44 ppm 44 mg l is transported to another cell for a second run almost 60 of cu ii ions in this solution is removed exactly as expected this agrees with previous studies reporting higher removal efficiency achieved by higher processing time and operation cycles 71 it is important to mention that the cost effective synthesized flexible conducting fabrics achieve superior cu ii ions removal capacity compared to other reported adsorbents prepared using expensive materials and prolonged synthesis time 72 76 however the removal efficiency of cu ii ions still needs more efforts to be improved using flexible ppy based electrodes this is in addition to design an efficient way for copper metal recovery interestingly ppy pet achieved uptake capacity of cu ii ions 61 5 mg g superior than various reported systems 26 8 mg g 77 and 15 82 mg g 78 conducted using electroremoval process 4 conclusion innovative conducting textile fabrics based on polypyrrole doped with different dopants are developed the conducting polypyrrole layer are easily polymerized using oxidative polymerization process on polyester fiber surfaces the flexible conducting fabrics are used for electroremoval and recovery of cu ii ions from aqueous solution the type of dopant plays a significant influence on the yield of conducting polypyrrole layer conductivity and electroremoval efficiency the removal

electrochemical removal polyester polypyrrole 1 introduction heavy metal ions are considered to be one of the main industrial wastewater contaminants even at trace concentrations 1 10 among heavy metals family cu ii ions are essential element for various living systems and their excess and or deficiency may lead to several health issues and causes various diseases 11 17 on the other hand cu ii ions are released from various industrial sources such as metal finishing paper and paperboard mills wood pulp production fertilizer industry electroplating hydrometallurgy and electronics industry 11 18 19 there is rapid depletion of metals and their natural sources in conjunction with their growing needs in industry hence it is important to remove these essential metals from the wastewater before discharging for further recovery attempts several methods have been used to treat the heavy metals contaminated effluents such as chemical precipitation electrochemical deposition ion exchange adsorption filtration and solvent extraction 20 21 among the suggested tools is the electrochemical deposition the electrochemical approach is a simple and clean technology for addressing this issue this is due to its merits such as ambient operating conditions and can be easily stopped via switching off the power and profitable metals may be recovered 22 moreover the electrochemical recovery can be achieved by a redox reaction without the production of large volumes of chemical sludge compared to other physical and chemical methods 22 23 the electrochemical recovery by reduction process is unique since different metals can be recycled and recovered with reasonable purity from a mixture of pollutants via applying the specific reduction potential and tuning the alternating current 24 conducting polymers are considered among the smart polymer family due to their unique properties 23 25 among them is polypyrrole ppy a well known member of conducting polymers and received intensive attentions due to its good electrical conductivity easily synthesis procedures and high thermal and environmental stability 25 27 some studies were conducted using ppy in different forms for metal recovery from solution samples via electrochemical routes due to its good redox properties 28 29 also various metals ions such as silver cadmium mercury lead platinum and arsenic have been removed from aqueous solutions by ppy 30 36 however it has been reported that there are challenges in removal of some heavy metals such as iron and copper using conducting polymers due to the inferior reduction potential of these metals to overoxidize conducting polymers 19 therefore there are few attempts used to recover copper and silver ions using modified ppy based electrode under potentiostatic conditions 37 38 some ppy modified based electrodes were exploited for this purpose 39 44 ppy modified electrode showed superior electrocatalytic effect and enhanced removal of cu ii from the acidified cu ii solutions compared to other conventional stainless steel electrodes 40 the improvement in electroremoval of cu ii was attributed to the superior surface area of new ppy modified electrode 40 the modification of ppy based electrode offers new properties to the electrode surface to achieve selective separation of cu ii ions 40 this agrees with previous reports stating that tuning the physical properties structure surface area porosity and electrical conductivity of electrode play key roles for the electroremoval efficiency 42 44 to the best of our knowledge very few works are reported using ppy coated flexible composite as electrode materials for the electrochemical reduction and separation of copper ions interestingly ppy chains can be easily synthesized over the surface of different substrates such as textiles fibers glasses and papers 45 46 48 we were motivated to develop flexible conducting textile fabrics based on facile deposition of ppy chains on polyester fabrics and its exploitation for efficient electroremoval of cu ii ions from aqueous solutions in this study polypyrrole is chemically synthesized on polyester pet ppy fabrics and applied for the removal of copper ions from aqueous solutions under potentiostatic reduction we used different types of dopants namely 2 naphthalene sulfonic acid sodium salt nsa anthraquinone 2 sulfonic acid sodium salt aqsa benzene sulfonic acid sodium salt bsa and sodium dodecyl sulfate sds to compare the polymerization efficiency of polypyrrole chains over the polyester fabrics also the influence of the structures of different dopants on the capability of the developed flexible ppy electrode for the electroremoval of copper ions is studied other parameters are investigated to optimize the electrochemical reduction efficiency of copper using pet ppy such as the effect of dopant type aqsa nsa bsa and sds and initial heavy metal ions concentrations 2 experimental 2 1 materials polyester

and then dried pyrrole 98 hydrochloric acid 37 hcl sulfuric acid 98 h2so4 ferric chloride hexahydrate 97 fecl3 6h2o and cupric sulfate 98 cuso4 5h2o were obtained from sigma aldrich germany anthraquinone 2 sulfonic acid sodium salt monohydrate 98 aqsa 2 naphthalene sulfonic acid sodium salt 98 nsa benzene sulfonic acid sodium salt 99 bsa and sodium dodecyl sulfate 99 sds were purchased from across belgium 2 2 chemical synthesis of polypyrrole on pet pet ppy the synthesis of ppy chains on polyester textiles surface is achieved by chemical oxidative polymerization technique using fecl3 as oxidant based on a previous report 49 the molar ratios monomer oxidant dopant used in the chemical synthesis were 1 2 5 0 3 50 in brief in a glass beaker fecl3 solution is prepared in aqueous solution of 0 03 m of aqsa or nsa or bsa or sds then fabric samples 2 cm 2 cm were soaked in the oxidant solution for 1 h with the aid of an ultrasonic treatment for 20 min to improve the diffusion of the oxidant into the fabrics then 0 1 m pyrrole solution was added into the reaction mixture and left for 1 h at 5 c as the polymerization is completed the coated polyester fabrics are washed using distilled water and finally dried in an oven at 70 c for 1 h 2 3 electroremoval of cu ii ions from aqueous solutions electrodeposition of cu ii ions was conducted in a single compartment cell containing copper ions solution of 100 ppm 100 mg l prepared by dissolving 0 3929 g of cuso4 5h2o in 1 0 l of 0 1 m h2so4 at a potential of 0 5 v for 50 min the applied reduction potentials for cu ii ions are in accordance with literature 51 a platinum wire was used as the counter electrode potential measurements are referred to ag agcl 3 m kcl reference electrode a 2 cm 2 cm of pet ppy film is used as the working electrode the volume of the aqueous solution used for each experiment is 25 ml all solutions are prepared using deionized water the concentrations of metal ions are determined by using atomic absorption aas all experiments are carried out in triplicate at each condition and the mean values are calculated additionally metal ions samples are collected at time intervals within 50 min the concentration of cu ii is determined using an external standard calibration method the removal capacity the amount of cu ii electrodeposited on pet ppy electrode is calculated by subtracting the amount deposited before and after electrochemical reduction using the following equation 1 q c o c e v m where co and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of cu ii mg l m is the mass of the used ppy coated pet g and v is the volume of solution l the removal efficiency was calculated using the following equation 2 removal efficiency c initial c final c final 100 where c initial is the initial concentration of copper ions before removal and c final is the final concentration of copper ions after its partial removal at a given time interval 2 4 characterization the morphology of uncoated and coated textile fabrics is investigated using scanning electron microscopy sem under high field emission quanta feg 250 instrument fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir spectra of

analyzer bioanalytical systems bas west lafayette usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural characterization of pet ppy composites the ppy films are polymerized on flexible polyester fabrics via chemical oxidative process using different dopants then utilized for electroremoval of cu ii ions from aqueous solution as depicted in fig 1 it is found the type of dopant has significant impact on the yield of polymerized ppy layer on pet surface the ppy film yields are 14 7 1 5 6 and 4 4 when using aqsa nsa bsa and sds dopants respectively the formed conducting textile fabrics are further characterized using spectroscopy microscopic tools and measuring their corresponding electrical resistances fig 2 represents the characteristic ft ir absorption peaks of uncoated pet the absorption peaks observed at 2970 1710 1243 and 725 cm 1 correspond to ch co co stretching vibrations and out of plane bending of p disubstituted benzene ring in polyester respectively 52 54 for pet ppy aqsa the absorption peaks observed at 3420 1539 1453 and 1292 cm 1 correspond to the stretching vibration of nh cc cc and cn fig 2 respectively the absorption peaks located at 1171 1121 1039 and 775 cm 1 are attributed to pyrrole ring which proves the completion of ppy polymerization 25 27 while the absorption peak noticed at 1186 cm 1 corresponds to the so stretching vibration of sulfonate anions so3 of the dopant the peaks located at 1671 cm 1 and 660 cm 1 are related to aqsa 53 54 fig 2c depicts the absorption peaks of pet ppy nsa in addition to the existence of all characteristic absorption peaks of ppy as discussed above absorption peak observed at 1292 cm 1 is shifted to 1260 cm 1 due to different degrees of doping 46 55 the characteristic absorption band of nsa is detected at 609 cm 1 56 for pet ppy bsa and pet ppy sds fig 2 the absorption peaks characteristic for ppy appear at 3438 1550 and 1121 cm 1 which are attributed to nh cc stretching and pyrrole bending respectively 27 46 the characteristic absorption peaks of bsa and sds overlap with the strong pet absorption peaks 57 we noticed the variation of dopants peaks intensities which revealed the different levels of polymer doping the surface morphologies of uncoated and coated pet fabrics are investigated using sem fig 3a shows the smooth morphology of uncoated pet fibers 58 59 for pet ppy aqsa a rough surface layer is observed in fig 3b indicating the dense ppy films formation similar dense and rough surface morphology is observed for pet ppy nsa reflecting the polymerized ppy layer as shown in fig 3c for pet ppy bsa sds less roughened surface is noticed compared to pet ppy aqsa nsa indicating less density of ppy layer polymerized on pet fibers as indicated in fig 3d e this reflects the impact of type of dopant on the polymerization efficacy and yield on pet fiber surfaces this supported the impact of dopant type on ppy layer yield polymerized on pet surface these results are in agreement with previous reports which state that the type of counter ion of dopant has effect on surface morphology of coated layer 56 60 61 hence the surface morphology attained with the counter ion of aqsa dopant has the ability to afford stability of the conducting polymer films which retard the oxygen diffusion 61 therefore this is consistent with a previous report stating that the dopants possess at least one sulphonic group to stabilize the conductivity of ppy 61 62 this was further affirmed from the electrical resistance data of the prepared conducting textile fabrics the electrical resistance of pet ppy aqsa pet ppy nsa pet ppy bsa and pet ppy sds were found to be 11 22 85 and 250 kω respectively compared to 90 mω for uncoated pet at this stage the formation of conducting textiles is confirmed this revealed the positive impact of dopant on improving the electrical conductivity in this study with different types of dopants in the following order aqsa nsa bsa sds the uncoated and coated pet are characterized using xrd fig 4a represents the xrd patterns of uncoated pet which shows three diffraction peaks positioned at 2θ values of 17 5 22 9 and 26 1 63 64 similar xrd diffraction peaks are observed in pet ppy aqsa at the same diffraction angles the characteristic ppy xrd peak which is mainly located at 2θ of 25 5 is due to the scattering of ppy chains at interplanar spacing 65 66 and overlaps with the high intensity pet peaks 3 2 electroremoval of cu ii from aqueous solutions using pet ppy the synthesized conducting textile fabrics using four different dopants are evaluated for the electroremoval of cu ii ions from aqueous solution the dimension of the fabric electrode used is 2 cm 2 cm the electrodeposition of cu ii is achieved in a single compartment cell containing copper solution of 100 ppm 100 mg l we then evaluate the effects of changing the type of dopant and the metal ions concentrations on the efficiency of copper ions removal the electroremoval of cu ii data using pet ppy doped with different dopants are tabulated in table 1 the results revealed that the electroremoval efficiency of cu ii is observed in higher value in case of pet ppy aqsa nsa achieving removal efficiency values of 56 and 40 respectively table 1 however poor electroremoval efficiency is observed for conducting textile fabrics doped with bsa and sds dopants recording removal efficiency of 8 and 5 respectively this inferior electroremoval efficiency of conducting textile fabrics doped with bsa and sds could be attributed to higher electrical resistance of pet ppy bsa sds compared to pet ppy aqsa nsa and this is confirmed with the lower conducting coating layer yield in their case 5 6 and 4 4 yield compared to higher ones in case of pet ppy aqsa nsa 14 and 7 1 this positive effect of aqsa and nsa could be due to their planar structure which affords suitable polymer structure stacking and leads to good electron hopping 67 69 furthermore the electrodeposition and recovery of cu ii ions from solution to conducting textile fabrics surface was elucidated using sem equipped with edx fig 5 represents the surface morphology of pet ppy aqsa after electrodeposition of cu from solution the deposited cu particles were visualized in the form of white particles and in the form sunflower like structure dispersed over the surface of pet ppy aqsa as indicated in high magnification images fig 5c d the existence of cu particles on the pet ppy aqsa was further confirmed by the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx equipped with sem fig 5e represents the edx spectra of pet ppy aqsa cu which indicates in addition to carbon sulphur oxygen nitrogen and chlorine elements the presence of copper element fig 5e it is important to note that the ph is adjusted at the beginning of the experiment at 5 0 which is the optimum ph value for cu ii ions to exist as free ions 70 the influence of cu ii ions concentrations on the electroremoval efficiency from aqueous solution is studied and data are given in table 2 and in fig 6 it is revealed from the data as cu ii ions concentration increases the electroremoval efficiency of cu ii ions increases achieving 69 as optimum efficiency this agrees with previously reported results stating that the initial cu ii ions concentration plays a key role in the removal efficiency of cu ii 43 this effect is attributed to the higher ions concentration which facilitates their transport through the formed pores on the electrode surface however after 60 ppm 60 mg l concentration of cu ii ions the efficiency starts to stabilize and tend to decrease over 100 ppm 100 mg l fig 6 we conclude from the data that the removal percent is at a given ratio compared to the initial concentration value regardless of the initial concentration this can be explained by an established equilibrium between the pet ppy aqsa electrode and the metal solution for the sake of confirmation the remaining solution of concentration 100 ppm 100 mg l 44 ppm 44 mg l is transported to another cell for a second run almost 60 of cu ii ions in this solution is removed exactly as expected this agrees with previous studies reporting higher removal efficiency achieved by higher processing time and operation cycles 71 it is important to mention that the cost effective synthesized flexible conducting fabrics achieve superior cu ii ions removal capacity compared to other reported adsorbents prepared using expensive materials and prolonged synthesis time 72 76 however the removal efficiency of cu ii ions still needs more efforts to be improved using flexible ppy based electrodes this is in addition to design an efficient way for copper metal recovery interestingly ppy pet achieved uptake capacity of cu ii ions 61 5 mg g superior than various reported systems 26 8 mg g 77 and 15 82 mg g 78 conducted using electroremoval process 4 conclusion innovative conducting textile fabrics based on polypyrrole doped with different dopants are developed the conducting polypyrrole layer are easily polymerized using oxidative polymerization process on polyester fiber surfaces the flexible conducting fabrics are used for electroremoval and recovery of cu ii ions from aqueous solution the type of dopant plays a significant influence on the yield of conducting polypyrrole layer conductivity and electroremoval efficiency the removal efficiency depends on the nature of the dopant aqsa nsa bsa and sds higher removal efficiency of 69 in conjunction with maximum uptake of 61 5 mg g of coated fabrics is achieved on flexible conducting textile when using anthraquinone 2 sulfonic acid sodium salt aqsa this is attributed to its structure which has positive role in electrical conductivity and polymerization yield hence flexible conducting textile pet ppyaqsa can be considered as promising and cost effective electrode for the electrochemical removal and recovery of cu ii ions form aqueous solutions declaration of competing
