12650,fe2 activated peroxodisulfate fe2 pds system has been widely studied for its efficient degradation of pollutants however the slow circulation of fe3 fe2 greatly restricted the application of the system in the study aoii was significantly degraded by using fe3 coupled with cu0 activate pds system fe3 cu0 pds system compared with the traditional fe2 pds system the fe3 cu0 pds system greatly improved the degradation of aoii and the decolorization rate reached 80 6 within 30 min the quenching experiments and electron spin resonance epr showed that both hydroxyl radical oh and sulfate radical so4 were the mainly primary reactive oxygen species in the fe3 cu0 pds system with the contribution rates of so4 and oh being 60 54 and 25 06 respectively in the fe3 cu0 pds system cu0 formed cu through h corrosion and pds o2 oxidation then cu oxidized by o2 to produce h2o2 and fe3 was reduced by cu0 and cu to form fe2 finally cu and fe2 catalyzed pds to generate so4 and oh was yield by the process of cu and fe2 induced h2o2 and the reaction of oh h2o and so4 common water matrices such as no3 and so4 2 had no effect on the degradation while cl promoted the degradation and co3 2 and fulvic acid inhibited the degradation of aoii over 68 5 of aoii was degraded in the experimental water samples and the fe3 cu0 pds system had great degradation performances in practical water sample

drugs antibiotics and personal care products due to its good stability convenient storage easy transportation and low cost 1 2 some researchers have reported that pds could be activated in various ways such as uv heat thermal alkaline microwave and reducing agents via eq 1 3 11 but the high cost and relatively slow reaction rates of these methods limited their practical application in water treatment considering these problems the way that the transition metal ions activated pds to produce so4 eq 2 was attracting more and more attention of researchers owing to its high activation efficiency and low cost 12 14 1 s 2 o 8 2 uv heat thermal alkaline microwave others s o 4 2 fe 2 s 2 o 8 2 s o 4 fe 3 k 12 m 1 s 1 3 fe 0 2 h f e 2 h 2 among many transition metals ferrous ion fe2 is considered as one of the best catalysts to stimulate pds because of its significant effect and abundant properties unfortunately the process of fe2 activated pds also faces some problems such as the production of large concentrations of iron mud and the extremely slow reduction process of fe3 to fe2 15 these defects limited the application of the fe2 pds system in water treatment in recent decades it was reported that adding reducing agents in the fe2 pds system e g hydroxylamine thiosulfate ascorbic acid and l cysteine could promote the removal of organic pollutants via accelerating the recycle of fe3 fe2 4 16 17 although adding reducing agents could promote the recycle of fe3 fe2 the reactive oxidant in the reducing agent fe2 pds system could be captured by these reductants which reduced the degradation of the target contaminants and the utilization of pds 18 19 it was also reported that electrification could promote the recycle of fe3 fe2 20 but the application of this method in pds activation was limited due to its high cost and low power utilization based on the above facts some researchers proposed that zero valent iron fe0 catalyzed pds to generate reactive oxidants because of continuous generation of fe2 through hydrogen h corrosion via eq 3 however the release of fe2 on the surface of fe0 is inhibited due to the passivation and aggregation of fe0 which greatly reduced the activation efficiency 21 22 therefore it is necessary to adopt a new approach to promote the circulation of fe3 fe2 in the fe2 pds system considering the above situations cu0 might be a fine choice for promoting the recycle of fe3 fe2 because cu0 could avoid the passivation and coagulation phenomenon on the surface and both cu0 and cu promoted the circulation of fe3 fe2 23 24 moreover some recent studies indicated that cu0 could activate pds to produce reactive oxidants through h corroding cu0 to generate cu 14 25 however the study on the activation of pds by using fe3 coupled with cu0 has not been reported until now in the past years the environmental impact of synthetic dyes was a worrying problem and the pollution caused by dyes wastewater was attracting more and more public attention 26 28 as a representative azo dye acid orange ii aoii was chosen as the target compound to study the synergistic strengthening effect of the fe3 cu0 pds system the study related

0 05 m h2so4 were adopted to adjust solution ph aoii fe3 and pds were added into the beaker before the reaction and then cu0 was added to started the reaction the samples were filtered by the 0 45 μm filter membranes electron paramagnetic resonance epr was conduct by using dmpo as the trapping agent all the experiments were repeated twice and the results were averaged 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of propranolol and ibuprofen were measured by the high performance liquid chromatography agilent 1260 american the cu and fe2 concentrations were measured at 455 nm and 510 nm using neocuproine and 1 10 phenanthroline respectively 29 the removal rate of total dissolved organic carbon toc was monitor using toc analyzer shimadzu japan adopted iodometric method measured pds concentration 30 the removal rate of aoii methyl orange and orange g were measured by uv visible spectrophotometer shimadzu japan at 484 nm 460 nm and 473 nm the decolorization rate of aoii was calculated by eq 4 4 φ decolorization rate 1 c t c 0 100 2 4 experimental water samples to study the natural water bodies effect aoii was degraded in three practical water samples in the fe3 cu0 pds system the quality indices and sources of water samples were shown in table s1 and text s1 3 results and discussions 3 1 degradation of aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system fig 1 a demonstrated the aoii decolorization rate in the cu0 system cu0 fe3 system fe3 pds system cu0 pds system and fe3 cu0 pds system the cu0 system had a sizable removal within 30 min and almost 27 4 of aoii was degraded in the cu0 system and the relative pseudo first order kinetic constant k of cu0 system was 0 0101 r2 0 912 the phenomenon fitted the truth that cu0 could generate cu by corrosion of h and oxidation of o2 and then cu could react with o2 to produce h2o2 and meanwhile h2o2 react with cu to generate reactive oxidants via eqs 5 9 31 32 it could be seen that the fe3 pds system could not lead to the degradation of aoii within 30 min and the relative k of fe3 pds system was 0 0006 r2 0 988 there is no degradation effect of aoii because of the pretty slow conversion of fe3 to fe2 in the fe3 pds system however in the cu0 pds system the decolorization rate of aoii was 47 4 within 30 min and the k of cu0 pds system was 0 0208 r2 0 980 this phenomenon was attributed to the generation of cu from cu0 by h corrosion and pds o2 oxidation via eqs 5 7 then cu reacted with pds to so4 via eq 10 compared with the systems of fe3 pds and cu0 pds the decolorization rate of aoii was 80 6 within 30 min and the relative k was 0 0518 r2 0 971 in the fe3 cu0 pds system which was higher than other systems this result showed that cu0 coupling with fe3 as the activator of pds greatly accelerated the degradation of aoii since both cu0 and cu produced fe2 by reducing fe3 via eqs 11 12 21 33 the cycle of fe3 fe2 might be the important cause of the higher removal rate of aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system 5 2 c u 0

process of inducing pds 34 36 to have a better understand of the active oxidants in the fe3 cu0 pds system some relevant quenching experiments were conducted in this study the reaction of tert butyl alcohol tba and oh has a higher second order reaction rate constant k 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 but the reaction of tba and so4 has a lower second order reaction rate constant k 8 0 105 m 1 s 1 so tba was adopted to distinguish oh and so4 37 38 as illustrated in fig 2 b the addition of tba significantly reduced the decolorization rate of aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system when 0 10 mm tba was added to the fe3 cu0 pds system the aoii decolorization rate was significantly reduced from 80 6 to 60 4 and the decolorization degradation rate of aoii tended to being stable tba could capture oh and tba restricted the aoii degradation in the fe3 cu0 pds system which suggested that oh was generated in the fe3 cu0 pds system moreover methanol meoh is commonly used as the quenchers of reactive oxidants such as oh k 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 and so4 k 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 39 fig 2 b showed that the decolorization rate of aoii was 20 9 when 0 4 m meoh was added into the solution as the meoh concentration increased to 1 m the decolorization rate of aoii was almost 11 6 notably the inhibition effect of meoh was remarkably overtop the prohibition effect of tba suggesting that so4 was formed in the fe3 cu0 pds system in addition the epr measurement was also conducted by using a trapping agent of dmpo for fig 2 c a typical spectrum of dmpo oh with a 1 2 2 1 quartet was observed and six weak signal peaks of dmpo so4 were detected in the fe3 cu0 pds system the results further illustrated that both oh and so4 were yielded in this system based on the above discussions both so4 and oh were generated in the fe3 cu0 pds system as the main reactive oxidants moreover the inhibition effect of 10 mm tba represented the contribution of oh and the inhibition effects of adding 1 m methanol and 10 mm tba meant the concentration rate of so4 as well as so4 and oh contribution rates were 60 54 and 25 06 respectively in the fe3 cu0 pds system the generation of so4 should be ascribed to the reaction of fe2 and cu with pds and oh was formed in the processes of fe2 and cu induced h2o2 and the reaction of h2o oh with so4 3 3 possible activation mechanism fig 1 a showed that the decolorization rates of aoii was 52 6 in the fe3 cu0 system and 27 4 in the cu0 system the results fitted with the truth that cu reacted with o2 to produce h2o2 then cu and fe2 induced h2o2 to yield reactive oxygen species 40 41 furthermore the fe3 cu0 pds system had great degradation performance on the degradation of aoii the experiment results illustrated that fe3 and cu0 had a good synergistic effect in activating pds according to previous literatures cu and cu0 could react with fe3 to promote the production of fe2 via eqs 11 12 42 therefore it could be deduced that the recycle of fe2 fe3 might be involved in the fe3 cu0 pds system po4 3 could be used as chelating agent of fe3 by forming the precipitation with fe3 resulting in the decline of activity of fe3 43 fig s1 showed that the addition of po4 3 0 5 2 0 mm limited the decolorization rate of aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system which verified that the circulation of fe3 fe2 exist in the fe3 cu0 pds system to further comprehend the role of fe3 in the fe3 cu0 pds system the changes of fe2 pds cu and the released of total soluble copper tc were detected in the cu0 pds fe3 pds and fe3 cu0 pds systems fig 3 a showed that the concentration of fe2 in the fe3 cu0 pds system tended to being higher than fe3 pds system indicating that fe3 continuously reduced to fe2 in the fe3 cu0 pds system according to fig 3 a the concentration of cu in the fe3 cu0 pds system was lower than that in the cu0 pds system the result verified that cu could react with the fe3 in the fe3 cu0 pds system which was same with previous studies 4 11 in addition as shown in fig 3 b with the concentration of fe3 increased from 0 um to 50 um the released of tc increased from 21 8 mg l to 32 7 mg l based on the above discussions we knew that the fe3 cu0 pds system could generate cu and cu2 therefore the release of tc depended on the multiple reasons such as the oxidation of pds and o2 the h corrosion to cu0 and the reaction of fe3 and cu0 table s2 showed that the solution ph and the dissolved o2 was hardly changed during the experiment in the fe3 cu0 pds system and cu0 pds system this result meant that the corrosion of h to cu0 and the dissolved o2 were not the main cause to increase tc of fe3 cu0 pds system in various of fe3 dosage fig 3 c showed that pds was decomposed more in the fe3 cu0 pds system than the cu0 pds system suggesting that the pds oxidation to cu0 was weaker and weaker with the increasing of fe3 dosage the result demonstrated that the increment of tc with increasing of concentration of fe3 should be ascribed to the reaction of fe3 and cu0 in the fe3 cu0 pds system therefore cu0 should promote the reduction from fe3 to fe2 via eq 11 the fact that more pds was consumed in the fe3 cu0 pds system than the cu0 pds system was ascribed to the two aspects i cu0 promoted the shift of fe3 to fe2 which enhanced the reaction of fe2 and pds ii more cu released from high dosage of cu0 reacted with fe3 generating fe2 and meanwhile both cu and fe2 accelerated the consumption of pds in the fe3 cu0 pds system to further understand the aoii decomposition process uv vis spectrophotometer from 200 nm to 650 nm was adopted to measure the solution samples of the fe3 cu0 pds system according to previous study we knew that the benzene ring naphthyl and azo bond of aoii were located at 210 nm 310 nm and 484 nm 4 fig 3 d exhibit that the absorption at 210 nm 310 nm and 484 nm quickly descended illustrating that the benzene ring naphthyl structure and azo bond structure were toilless to be destroyed by so4 and oh in the fe3 cu0 pds system 44 moreover fig 3 d also demonstrated the removal rate of toc in the fe3 cu0 pds cu0 pds fe3 cu0 cu0 systems the toc removal rate was 25 5 within 30 min in the fe3 cu0 pds system while the cu0 pds system fe3 cu0 system and single cu0 system were only 7 0 8 3 and 4 1 from the results of fig 3 d we could know the removal rates of toc in other systems were much lower than fe3 cu0 pds system which suggested that fe3 coupling with cu0 induce pds process had significant mineralization effect for the degradation of aoii all in all according to the analysis above the mechanism of the fe3 coupling with cu0 enhanced pds for the removal of aoii at ph 3 0 could be inferred and the possible activation mechanism was demonstrated in the fig 4 firstly cu0 produced cu by the corrosion of h and pds o2 oxidation and cu could be oxidized by o2 producing h2o2 meanwhile fe3 reacted with cu and cu0 generating fe2 the formation of so4 should be ascribed to the reaction of fe2 and cu with pds and oh was formed in the processes of fe2 and cu inducing h2o2 and the reaction of h2o oh with so4 3 4 effects of reaction factors 3 4 1 effect of fe3 as above mentioned fe3 coupled with cu0 greatly enhanced the pollutant degradation so it was essential to further study the fe3 concentration influence on aoii decolorization rate in the fe3 cu0 pds system we could see from fig 5 a with the concentration of fe3 enhanced from 0 μm to 50 μm the decolorization rate of aoii increased from 47 4 to 80 6 the addition of fe3 could significantly promote the circulation of fe3 fe2 in the system this was because that fe3 could be reduced to fe2 by the reactions of fe3 and cu0 or cu promoting the activation of pds to yield more reactive oxidants therefore 50 μm fe3 was adopted to degrade aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system 3 4 2 effect of cu0 as a crucial influencing factor the concentration of cu0 has significant impact of the advanced oxidation process fig 5 b showed that the enhancement effect of cu0 dosage on the degradation of aoii was evaluated as the cu0 dosage increased from 0 g l to 0 5 g l the decolorization rate of aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system enhanced from 0 02 to 91 8 the main reasons for the situation could be attributed to two aspects i cu0 could produce more cu through the corrosion of h and the oxidation of pds and o2 which accelerated the catalysis of pds producing more the reactive oxygen species in the solution ii the addition of cu0 was a vital component for the recycle process of fe3 fe2 and adding more cu0 meant that the reduction from fe3 to fe2 was strengthened and further promoted the yield of reactive oxidants 32 on the other hand it is worth noting that copper is thought as heavy metal ion and the tc is strictly controlled into water environment though the high addition of cu0 helped to degrade rapidly aoii it could also release excessive amounts of tc therefore based on the removal rate of aoii and environmental risk cu0 of 0 2 g l was selected to degrade aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system 3 4 3 effect of pds as the source of so4 the concentration of pds is the most important electron donor for the generation of so4 and pds could affect the removal of aoii it was essential to further study pds concentration influence on aoii decolorization rate in the fe3 cu0 pds system when the concentration of pds in the solution enhanced from 0 mm to 2 mm the decolorization rate of aoii increased from 52 6 to 94 6 gradually there were two reasons for this phenomenon i with the increase of pds concentration it could promote the production of cu from cu0 surface by pds oxidation to cu0 accelerating the formation of reactive oxidants fig s2 ii using much dosage of pds accelerated the yield of reactive oxidants by the reaction of fe2 or cu with pds hence with the increased of pds dosage the decomposition effect of aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system became more significant considering the balance of degradation efficiency and the release of sulfate ion in the fe3 cu0 pds system we selected 0 5 mm pds as an appropriate concentration for the degradation of aoii 3 4 4 effect of ph the reaction ph is an important influencing factor of the advanced oxidation process so this study further explored the influence on the degradation of aoii under different ph fig 5 d showed the decomposition effect at the ph 3 2 4 2 5 3 6 1 and 7 2 it illustrated that with the increase of ph the fe3 cu0 pds system continued to decline in the degradation efficiency of aoii the degradation efficiency of aoii was 80 6 at ph 3 0 but when the experimental ph raised to 7 2 the decolorization rate of aoii was only 22 6 according to above mentioned analysis the release of cu and cycle redox of fe3 fe2 were the key process restricting the generation of reactive oxidants fig s3 showed that with the solution ph raised from 3 0 to 7 0 the tc maintained a dramatic decline owing to lack of h the release of cu was reduced with the increased of ph thus limiting the degradation of aoii additionally with increasing of ph the species of fe3 shifted from fe3 to feoh2 fe oh 2 and fe oh 3 fig s4 the reactivity of fe3 species was less and less owing to formation of iron sludge which slowed down the cycle of fe3 fe2 and reduced the generation of reactive oxidants moreover although cu would shift to different species such as cuoh and cu oh 2 with the solution ph increased from acid to alkali previous study had reported that cu was rapider for inducing pds with the solution ph increasing of 3 0 7 0 21 which meant that the species of cu did not affect the degradation of aoii as a result the release of cu and redox cycle of fe3 fe2 were suppressed with the increasing of solution ph resulting in declining degradation of aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system 3 5 implication evaluation usually there are many water matrices and chemical pollutants in the actual water and their existence may affect the decolorization rate of aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system hence the experiment further explored the influence effect of common anions e g no3 so4 2 cl co3 2 and common natural organic matter nom like fulvic acid fa in the fe3 cu0 pds system it was easy to see from fig 6 a when 1 mm so4 2 and 1 mm no3 were added to the fe3 cu0 pds system the decolorization rate of aoii was not affected the results indicated that no3 and so4 2 have no interference on the fe3 cu0 pds system however when 1 mm cl was added in the fe3 cu0 pds system the degradation rate of aoii improved from 80 6 to 85 3 to further explore the influence of cl in the fe3 cu0 pds system 5 10 mm cl was further added it was found in fig 6 b when the concentrations of cl were 5 mm and 10 mm the decolorization rate of aoii reached 89 4 and 93 1 respectively cu was active and prone to occur disproportionate reaction however when cl was added into the fe3 cu0 pds system cu would react with cl to generate cucl complexes such as cucl cucl2 and cucl3 2 45 46 it had reported that these cucl complexes were more stable compared to cu which might be conducive to the activation of pds with cu 47 additionally fig 6 b showed that adding 1 mm co3 2 and 1 mm c fa exhibited the inhibition impact on the degradation of aoii to better explore the influence of co3 2 in the fe3 cu0 pds system the different concentrations of co3 2 0 mm 1 mm 5 mm and 10 mm were added to fe3 cu0 pds system from fig 6 c we can see that when the co3 2 concentration enhanced from 0 mm to 10 mm the degradation of aoii was inhibited and the removal rate decreased from 80 6 to 69 6 this phenomenon should be attribute to the consume of so4 and oh via eqs 17 18 in the fe3 cu0 pds system 48 thus reducing the degradation efficiency of aoii the influence of different concentrations of fa on the fe3 cu0 pds system was further studied fig 6 d showed that when using 0 2 mm c fa the decolorization rate of aoii changed from 80 6 to 24 7 it was because that fa could trap so4 and oh vie eqs 19 20 49 leading to the lower decolorization rate of aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system 14 c u c l cucl 15 c u 2 c l cuc l 2 16 c u 3 c l cuc l 3 2 17 co 3 2 so 4 s o 4 2 co 3 k 4 6 10 6 m 1 s 1 18 co 3 oh oh co 3 k 8 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 19 nom so 4 intermediates 20 nom oh intermediates furthermore in order to further evaluate the degradation of aoii in the natural environmental conditions with the fe3 cu0 pds three practical water samples were used in our study fig 7 a showed the decolorization rate of aoii in lake water was 68 5 which was less than the degradation rate of aoii in ultrapure water this because the capture of natural organic matter nom for reactive oxidants while the decolorization rates of aoii in tap water and well water and respectively 79 7 and 81 2 which was almost same with that in ultrapure water the high decolorization rates of aoii in tap water and well water was ascribed to the high concentration of fe3 in well water and high concentration of cl in tap water reaching the balance between the inhibition of actual organic matter and enhancement of fe3 or cl table s1 fig 7 b showed that 78 2 of propranolol and 90 1 of ibuprofen were removed in the fe3 cu0 pds system furthermore the removal rates of orange g and methyl orange reached 75 0 82 2 the phenomena indicated that the proposed fe3 cu0 pds system might be a promising aops for wastewater treatment in addition as shown in fig s5 the tc was 32 7 mg l in the fe3 cu0 pds system before treatment according to the ii level environmental quality standards e g 1 mg l 50 the final tc concentration needed to reduce in this experiment the alkali precipitation was adopted to remove the residual tc after the oxidation of aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system as depicted in fig s5 with solution ph adjusted to 8 5 and filtered the final discharge of tc was 0 78 mg l this result was lower than china s surface water grade ii environmental quality standard these results indicated that the fe3 cu0 pds system was a high efficacy and safety of water treatment and owned great development potential in water purification 4 conclusion in the study the addition of fe3 coupled with cu0 significantly induced pds for the aoii degradation in the fe3 cu0 pds system cu0 formed cu through h corrosion and pds o2 oxidation then cu was oxidized by o2 to produce h2o2 meanwhile fe3 was reduced by cu0 and cu to form fe2 both cu and fe2 catalyzed pds to generate so4 and induced h2o2 to produce oh in the end for coexisting ions no3 and so4 2 had no effect but fa and co3 2 had significant inhibitory effect while cl promoted the degradation of aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system the degradation performance of the fe3 cu0 pds system in natural water samples were over 68 5 moreover when the final ph of the solution was adjusted to 8 5 the final discharge of tc was below the china s surface water grade ii environmental quality standard after filtering 1 mg l these results illustrated that fe3 cu0 pds system might be a promising wastewater treatment technology meanwhile fe3 is widely distributed in industrial wastewater which provides a better foundation for the use of the fe3 cu0 pds system for wastewater purification overall the results

12650,fe2 activated peroxodisulfate fe2 pds system has been widely studied for its efficient degradation of pollutants however the slow circulation of fe3 fe2 greatly restricted the application of the system in the study aoii was significantly degraded by using fe3 coupled with cu0 activate pds system fe3 cu0 pds system compared with the traditional fe2 pds system the fe3 cu0 pds system greatly improved the degradation of aoii and the decolorization rate reached 80 6 within 30 min the quenching experiments and electron spin resonance epr showed that both hydroxyl radical oh and sulfate radical so4 were the mainly primary reactive oxygen species in the fe3 cu0 pds system with the contribution rates of so4 and oh being 60 54 and 25 06 respectively in the fe3 cu0 pds system cu0 formed cu through h corrosion and pds o2 oxidation then cu oxidized by o2 to produce h2o2 and fe3 was reduced by cu0 and cu to form fe2 finally cu and fe2 catalyzed pds to generate so4 and oh was yield by the process of cu and fe2 induced h2o2 and the reaction of oh h2o and so4 common water matrices such as no3 and so4 2 had no effect on the degradation while cl promoted the degradation and co3 2 and fulvic acid inhibited the degradation of aoii over 68 5 of aoii was degraded in the experimental water samples and the fe3 cu0 pds system had great degradation performances in practical water sample

drugs antibiotics and personal care products due to its good stability convenient storage easy transportation and low cost 1 2 some researchers have reported that pds could be activated in various ways such as uv heat thermal alkaline microwave and reducing agents via eq 1 3 11 but the high cost and relatively slow reaction rates of these methods limited their practical application in water treatment considering these problems the way that the transition metal ions activated pds to produce so4 eq 2 was attracting more and more attention of researchers owing to its high activation

considered as one of the best catalysts to stimulate pds because of its significant effect and abundant properties unfortunately the process of fe2 activated pds also faces some problems such as the production of large concentrations of iron mud and the extremely slow reduction process of fe3 to fe2 15 these defects limited the application of the fe2 pds system in water treatment in recent decades it was reported that adding reducing agents in the fe2 pds system e g hydroxylamine thiosulfate ascorbic acid and l cysteine could promote the removal of organic pollutants via accelerating the recycle of fe3 fe2 4 16 17 although adding reducing agents could promote the recycle of fe3 fe2 the reactive oxidant in the reducing agent fe2 pds system could be captured by these reductants which reduced the degradation of the target contaminants and the utilization of pds 18 19 it was also reported that electrification could promote the recycle of fe3 fe2 20 but the application of this method in pds activation was limited due to its high cost and low power utilization based on the above facts some researchers proposed that zero valent iron fe0 catalyzed pds to generate reactive oxidants because of continuous generation of fe2 through hydrogen h corrosion via eq 3 however the release of fe2 on the surface of fe0 is inhibited due to the passivation and aggregation of fe0 which greatly reduced the activation efficiency 21 22 therefore it is necessary to adopt a new approach to promote the circulation of fe3 fe2 in the fe2 pds system considering the above situations cu0 might be a fine choice for promoting the recycle of fe3 fe2 because cu0 could avoid the passivation and coagulation phenomenon on the surface and both cu0 and cu promoted the circulation of fe3 fe2 23 24 moreover some recent studies indicated that cu0 could activate pds to produce reactive oxidants through h corroding cu0 to generate cu 14 25 however the study on the activation of pds by using fe3 coupled with cu0 has not been reported until now in the past years the environmental impact of synthetic dyes was a worrying problem and the pollution caused by dyes wastewater was attracting more and more public attention 26 28 as a representative azo dye acid orange ii aoii was chosen as the target compound to study the synergistic strengthening effect of the fe3 cu0 pds system the study related

0 05 m h2so4 were adopted to adjust solution ph aoii fe3 and pds were added into the beaker before the reaction and then cu0 was added to started the reaction the samples were filtered by the 0 45 μm filter membranes electron paramagnetic resonance epr was conduct by using dmpo as the trapping agent all the experiments were repeated twice and the results were averaged 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of propranolol and ibuprofen were measured by the high performance liquid chromatography agilent 1260 american the cu and fe2 concentrations were measured at 455 nm and 510 nm using neocuproine and 1 10 phenanthroline respectively 29 the removal rate of total dissolved organic carbon toc was monitor using toc analyzer shimadzu japan adopted iodometric method measured pds concentration 30 the removal rate of aoii methyl orange and orange g were measured by uv visible spectrophotometer shimadzu japan at 484 nm 460 nm and 473 nm the decolorization rate of aoii was calculated by eq 4 4 φ decolorization rate 1 c t c 0 100 2 4 experimental water samples to study the natural water bodies effect aoii was degraded in three practical water samples in the fe3 cu0 pds system the quality indices and sources of water samples were shown in table s1 and text s1 3 results and discussions 3 1 degradation of aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system fig 1 a demonstrated the aoii decolorization rate in the cu0 system cu0 fe3 system fe3 pds system cu0 pds system and fe3 cu0 pds system the cu0 system had a sizable removal within 30 min and almost 27 4 of aoii was degraded in the cu0 system and the relative pseudo first order kinetic constant k of cu0 system was 0 0101 r2 0 912 the phenomenon fitted the truth that cu0 could generate cu by corrosion of h and oxidation of o2 and then cu could react with o2 to produce h2o2 and meanwhile h2o2 react with cu to generate reactive oxidants via eqs 5 9 31 32 it could be seen that the fe3 pds system could not lead to the degradation of aoii within 30 min and the relative k of fe3 pds system was 0 0006 r2 0 988 there is no degradation effect of aoii because of the pretty slow conversion of fe3 to fe2 in the fe3 pds system however in the cu0 pds system the decolorization rate of aoii was 47 4 within 30 min and the k of cu0 pds system was 0 0208 r2 0 980 this phenomenon was attributed to the generation of cu from cu0 by h corrosion and pds o2 oxidation via eqs 5 7 then cu reacted with pds to so4 via eq 10 compared with the systems of fe3 pds and cu0 pds the decolorization rate of aoii was 80 6 within 30 min and the relative k was 0 0518 r2 0 971 in the fe3 cu0 pds system which was higher than other systems this result showed that cu0 coupling with fe3 as the activator of pds greatly accelerated the degradation of aoii since both cu0 and cu produced fe2 by reducing fe3 via eqs 11 12 21 33 the cycle of fe3 fe2 might be the important cause of the higher removal rate of aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system 5 2 c u 0

process of inducing pds 34 36 to have a better understand of the active oxidants in the fe3 cu0 pds system some relevant quenching experiments were conducted in this study the reaction of tert butyl alcohol tba and oh has a higher second order reaction rate constant k 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 but the reaction of tba and so4 has a lower second order reaction rate constant k 8 0 105 m 1 s 1 so tba was adopted to distinguish oh and so4 37 38 as illustrated in fig 2 b the addition of tba significantly reduced the decolorization rate of aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system when 0 10 mm tba was added to the fe3 cu0 pds system the aoii decolorization rate was significantly reduced from 80 6 to 60 4 and the decolorization degradation rate of aoii tended to being stable tba could capture oh and tba restricted the aoii degradation in the fe3 cu0 pds system which suggested that oh was generated in the fe3 cu0 pds system moreover methanol meoh is commonly used as the quenchers of reactive oxidants such as oh k 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 and so4 k 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 39 fig 2 b showed that the decolorization rate of aoii was 20 9 when 0 4 m meoh was added into the solution as the meoh concentration increased to 1 m the decolorization rate of aoii was almost 11 6 notably the inhibition effect of meoh was remarkably overtop the prohibition effect of tba suggesting that so4 was formed in the fe3 cu0 pds system in addition the epr measurement was also conducted by using a trapping agent of dmpo for fig 2 c a typical spectrum of dmpo oh with a 1 2 2 1 quartet was observed and six weak signal peaks of dmpo so4 were detected in the fe3 cu0 pds system the results further illustrated that both oh and so4 were yielded in this system based on the above discussions both so4 and oh were generated in the fe3 cu0 pds system as the main reactive oxidants moreover the inhibition effect of 10 mm tba represented the contribution of oh and the inhibition effects of adding 1 m methanol and 10 mm tba meant the concentration rate of so4 as well as so4 and oh contribution rates were 60 54 and 25 06 respectively in the fe3 cu0 pds system the generation of so4 should be ascribed to the reaction of fe2 and cu with pds and oh was formed in the processes of fe2 and cu induced h2o2 and the reaction of h2o oh with so4 3 3 possible activation mechanism fig 1 a showed that the decolorization rates of aoii was 52 6 in the fe3 cu0 system and 27 4 in the cu0 system the results fitted with the truth that cu reacted with o2 to produce h2o2 then cu and fe2 induced h2o2 to yield reactive oxygen species 40 41 furthermore the fe3 cu0 pds system had great degradation performance on the degradation of aoii the experiment results illustrated that fe3 and cu0 had a good synergistic effect in activating pds according to previous literatures cu and cu0 could react with fe3 to promote the production of fe2 via eqs 11 12 42 therefore it could be deduced that the recycle of fe2 fe3 might be involved in the fe3 cu0 pds system po4 3 could be used as chelating agent of fe3 by forming the precipitation with fe3 resulting in the decline of activity of fe3 43 fig s1 showed that the addition of po4 3 0 5 2 0 mm limited the decolorization rate of aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system which verified that the circulation of fe3 fe2 exist in the fe3 cu0 pds system to further comprehend the role of fe3 in the fe3 cu0 pds system the changes of fe2 pds cu and the released of total soluble copper tc were detected in the cu0 pds fe3 pds and fe3 cu0 pds systems fig 3 a showed that the concentration of fe2 in the fe3 cu0 pds system tended to being higher than fe3 pds system indicating that fe3 continuously reduced to fe2 in the fe3 cu0 pds system according to fig 3 a the concentration of cu in the fe3 cu0 pds system was lower than that in the cu0 pds system the result verified that cu could react with the fe3 in the fe3 cu0 pds system which was same with previous studies 4 11 in addition as shown in fig 3 b with the concentration of fe3 increased from 0 um to 50 um the released of tc increased from 21 8 mg l to 32 7 mg l based on the above discussions we knew that the fe3 cu0 pds system could generate cu and cu2 therefore the release of tc depended on the multiple reasons such as the oxidation of pds and o2 the h corrosion to cu0 and the reaction of fe3 and cu0 table s2 showed that the solution ph and the dissolved o2 was hardly changed during the experiment in the fe3 cu0 pds system and cu0 pds system this result meant that the corrosion of h to cu0 and the dissolved o2 were not the main cause to increase tc of fe3 cu0 pds system in various of fe3 dosage fig 3 c showed that pds was decomposed more in the fe3 cu0 pds system than the cu0 pds system suggesting that the pds oxidation to cu0 was weaker and weaker with the increasing of fe3 dosage the result demonstrated that the increment of tc with increasing of concentration of fe3 should be ascribed to the reaction of fe3 and cu0 in the fe3 cu0 pds system therefore cu0 should promote the reduction from fe3 to fe2 via eq 11 the fact that more pds was consumed in the fe3 cu0 pds system than the cu0 pds system was ascribed to the two aspects i cu0 promoted the shift of fe3 to fe2 which enhanced the reaction of fe2 and pds ii more cu released from high dosage of cu0 reacted with fe3 generating fe2 and meanwhile both cu and fe2 accelerated the consumption of pds in the fe3 cu0 pds system to further understand the aoii decomposition process uv vis spectrophotometer from 200 nm to 650 nm was adopted to measure the solution samples of the fe3 cu0 pds system according to previous study we knew that the benzene ring naphthyl and azo bond of aoii were located at 210 nm 310 nm and 484 nm 4 fig 3 d exhibit that the absorption at 210 nm 310 nm and 484 nm quickly descended illustrating that the benzene ring naphthyl structure and azo bond structure were toilless to be destroyed by so4 and oh in the fe3 cu0 pds system 44 moreover fig 3 d also demonstrated the removal rate of toc in the fe3 cu0 pds cu0 pds fe3 cu0 cu0 systems the toc removal rate was 25 5 within 30 min in the fe3 cu0 pds system while the cu0 pds system fe3 cu0 system and single cu0 system were only 7 0 8 3 and 4 1 from the results of fig 3 d we could know the removal rates of toc in other systems were much lower than fe3 cu0 pds system which suggested that fe3 coupling with cu0 induce pds process had significant mineralization effect for the degradation of aoii all in all according to the analysis above the mechanism of the fe3 coupling with cu0 enhanced pds for the removal of aoii at ph 3 0 could be inferred and the possible activation mechanism was demonstrated in the fig 4 firstly cu0 produced cu by the corrosion of h and pds o2 oxidation and cu could be oxidized by o2 producing h2o2 meanwhile fe3 reacted with cu and cu0 generating fe2 the formation of so4 should be ascribed to the reaction of fe2 and cu with pds and oh was formed in the processes of fe2 and cu inducing h2o2 and the reaction of h2o oh with so4 3 4 effects of reaction factors 3 4 1 effect of fe3 as above mentioned fe3 coupled with cu0 greatly enhanced the pollutant degradation so it was essential to further study the fe3 concentration influence on aoii decolorization rate in the fe3 cu0 pds system we could see from fig 5 a with the concentration of fe3 enhanced from 0 μm to 50 μm the decolorization rate of aoii increased from 47 4 to 80 6 the addition of fe3 could significantly promote the circulation of fe3 fe2 in the system this was because that fe3 could be reduced to fe2 by the reactions of fe3 and cu0 or cu promoting the activation of pds to yield more reactive oxidants therefore 50 μm fe3 was adopted to degrade aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system 3 4 2 effect of cu0 as a crucial influencing factor the concentration of cu0 has significant impact of the advanced oxidation process fig 5 b showed that the enhancement effect of cu0 dosage on the degradation of aoii was evaluated as the cu0 dosage increased from 0 g l to 0 5 g l the decolorization rate of aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system enhanced from 0 02 to 91 8 the main reasons for the situation could be attributed to two aspects i cu0 could produce more cu through the corrosion of h and the oxidation of pds and o2 which accelerated the catalysis of pds producing more the reactive oxygen species in the solution ii the addition of cu0 was a vital component for the recycle process of fe3 fe2 and adding more cu0 meant that the reduction from fe3 to fe2 was strengthened and further promoted the yield of reactive oxidants 32 on the other hand it is worth noting that copper is thought as heavy metal ion and the tc is strictly controlled into water environment though the high addition of cu0 helped to degrade rapidly aoii it could also release excessive amounts of tc therefore based on the removal rate of aoii and environmental risk cu0 of 0 2 g l was selected to degrade aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system 3 4 3 effect of pds as the source of so4 the concentration of pds is the most important electron donor for the generation of so4 and pds could affect the removal of aoii it was essential to further study pds concentration influence on aoii decolorization rate in the fe3 cu0 pds system when the concentration of pds in the solution enhanced from 0 mm to 2 mm the decolorization rate of aoii increased from 52 6 to 94 6 gradually there were two reasons for this phenomenon i with the increase of pds concentration it could promote the production of cu from cu0 surface by pds oxidation to cu0 accelerating the formation of reactive oxidants fig s2 ii using much dosage of pds accelerated the yield of reactive oxidants by the reaction of fe2 or cu with pds hence with the increased of pds dosage the decomposition effect of aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system became more significant considering the balance of degradation efficiency and the release of sulfate ion in the fe3 cu0 pds system we selected 0 5 mm pds as an appropriate concentration for the degradation of aoii 3 4 4 effect of ph the reaction ph is an important influencing factor of the advanced oxidation process so this study further explored the influence on the degradation of aoii under different ph fig 5 d showed the decomposition effect at the ph 3 2 4 2 5 3 6 1 and 7 2 it illustrated that with the increase of ph the fe3 cu0 pds system continued to decline in the degradation efficiency of aoii the degradation efficiency of aoii was 80 6 at ph 3 0 but when the experimental ph raised to 7 2 the decolorization rate of aoii was only 22 6 according to above mentioned analysis the release of cu and cycle redox of fe3 fe2 were the key process restricting the generation of reactive oxidants fig s3 showed that with the solution ph raised from 3 0 to 7 0 the tc maintained a dramatic decline owing to lack of h the release of cu was reduced with the increased of ph thus limiting the degradation of aoii additionally with increasing of ph the species of fe3 shifted from fe3 to feoh2 fe oh 2 and fe oh 3 fig s4 the reactivity of fe3 species was less and less owing to formation of iron sludge which slowed down the cycle of fe3 fe2 and reduced the generation of reactive oxidants moreover although cu would shift to different species such as cuoh and cu oh 2 with the solution ph increased from acid to alkali previous study had reported that cu was rapider for inducing pds with the solution ph increasing of 3 0 7 0 21 which meant that the species of cu did not affect the degradation of aoii as a result the release of cu and redox cycle of fe3 fe2 were suppressed with the increasing of solution ph resulting in declining degradation of aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system 3 5 implication evaluation usually there are many water matrices and chemical pollutants in the actual water and their existence may affect the decolorization rate of aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system hence the experiment further explored the influence effect of common anions e g no3 so4 2 cl co3 2 and common natural organic matter nom like fulvic acid fa in the fe3 cu0 pds system it was easy to see from fig 6 a when 1 mm so4 2 and 1 mm no3 were added to the fe3 cu0 pds system the decolorization rate of aoii was not affected the results indicated that no3 and so4 2 have no interference on the fe3 cu0 pds system however when 1 mm cl was added in the fe3 cu0 pds system the degradation rate of aoii improved from 80 6 to 85 3 to further explore the influence of cl in the fe3 cu0 pds system 5 10 mm cl was further added it was found in fig 6 b when the concentrations of cl were 5 mm and 10 mm the decolorization rate of aoii reached 89 4 and 93 1 respectively cu was active and prone to occur disproportionate reaction however when cl was added into the fe3 cu0 pds system cu would react with cl to generate cucl complexes such as cucl cucl2 and cucl3 2 45 46 it had reported that these cucl complexes were more stable compared to cu which might be conducive to the activation of pds with cu 47 additionally fig 6 b showed that adding 1 mm co3 2 and 1 mm c fa exhibited the inhibition impact on the degradation of aoii to better explore the influence of co3 2 in the fe3 cu0 pds system the different concentrations of co3 2 0 mm 1 mm 5 mm and 10 mm were added to fe3 cu0 pds system from fig 6 c we can see that when the co3 2 concentration enhanced from 0 mm to 10 mm the degradation of aoii was inhibited and the removal rate decreased from 80 6 to 69 6 this phenomenon should be attribute to the consume of so4 and oh via eqs 17 18 in the fe3 cu0 pds system 48 thus reducing the degradation efficiency of aoii the influence of different concentrations of fa on the fe3 cu0 pds system was further studied fig 6 d showed that when using 0 2 mm c fa the decolorization rate of aoii changed from 80 6 to 24 7 it was because that fa could trap so4 and oh vie eqs 19 20 49 leading to the lower decolorization rate of aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system 14 c u c l cucl 15 c u 2 c l cuc l 2 16 c u 3 c l cuc l 3 2 17 co 3 2 so 4 s o 4 2 co 3 k 4 6 10 6 m 1 s 1 18 co 3 oh oh co 3 k 8 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 19 nom so 4 intermediates 20 nom oh intermediates furthermore in order to further evaluate the degradation of aoii in the natural environmental conditions with the fe3 cu0 pds three practical water samples were used in our study fig 7 a showed the decolorization rate of aoii in lake water was 68 5 which was less than the degradation rate of aoii in ultrapure water this because the capture of natural organic matter nom for reactive oxidants while the decolorization rates of aoii in tap water and well water and respectively 79 7 and 81 2 which was almost same with that in ultrapure water the high decolorization rates of aoii in tap water and well water was ascribed to the high concentration of fe3 in well water and high concentration of cl in tap water reaching the balance between the inhibition of actual organic matter and enhancement of fe3 or cl table s1 fig 7 b showed that 78 2 of propranolol and 90 1 of ibuprofen were removed in the fe3 cu0 pds system furthermore the removal rates of orange g and methyl orange reached 75 0 82 2 the phenomena indicated that the proposed fe3 cu0 pds system might be a promising aops for wastewater treatment in addition as shown in fig s5 the tc was 32 7 mg l in the fe3 cu0 pds system before treatment according to the ii level environmental quality standards e g 1 mg l 50 the final tc concentration needed to reduce in this experiment the alkali precipitation was adopted to remove the residual tc after the oxidation of aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system as depicted in fig s5 with solution ph adjusted to 8 5 and filtered the final discharge of tc was 0 78 mg l this result was lower than china s surface water grade ii environmental quality standard these results indicated that the fe3 cu0 pds system was a high efficacy and safety of water treatment and owned great development potential in water purification 4 conclusion in the study the addition of fe3 coupled with cu0 significantly induced pds for the aoii degradation in the fe3 cu0 pds system cu0 formed cu through h corrosion and pds o2 oxidation then cu was oxidized by o2 to produce h2o2 meanwhile fe3 was reduced by cu0 and cu to form fe2 both cu and fe2 catalyzed pds to generate so4 and induced h2o2 to produce oh in the end for coexisting ions no3 and so4 2 had no effect but fa and co3 2 had significant inhibitory effect while cl promoted the degradation of aoii in the fe3 cu0 pds system the degradation performance of the fe3 cu0 pds system in natural water samples were over 68 5 moreover when the final ph of the solution was adjusted to 8 5 the final discharge of tc was below the china s surface water grade ii environmental quality standard after filtering 1 mg l these results illustrated that fe3 cu0 pds system might be a promising wastewater treatment technology meanwhile fe3 is widely distributed in industrial wastewater which provides a better foundation for the use of the fe3 cu0 pds system for wastewater purification overall the results

12651,this study investigated the application of aerobic granular sludge ags augmentation strategy to continuous flow activated sludge as process mainstream for the treatment of low strength municipal wastewater using a pilot scale demonstration plant a sidestream sequencing batch reactor sbr was adopted for ags production and the ags produced was supplied to a mainstream reactor in the sidestream a simultaneous feeding and drawing sbr was operated ags rapidly formed in terms of sludge volume index svi and ags fraction and stabilized svi30 62 5 ml g 1 ags fraction 40 60 the installation of a novel sbr cycle with alternately repeated steps of short and long aeration times further improved the settleability svi30 47 6 ml g 1 and contributed to an increase in ags production by 50 ags augmentation increased the ags fraction 20 30 in mainstream and svi30 improved to 100 ml g 1 as the organic loading rate olr to the mainstream increased the ags fraction increased to 50 suggesting the growth of ags in mainstream despite the olr variations the stable settleability 100 ml g 1 of svi30 and relatively high retention of the mlss enabled stable removal of tbod and ammonium 94 4 and 98 1 respectively this is the first study that demonstrated the potential use of ags augmentation strategy in a continuous flow process at the pilot scale for the treatment of low strength municipal wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aerobic granular sludge augmentation pilot scale plant continuous flow sidestream sequencing batch reactor data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction activated sludge as processes have been widely applied worldwide in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps however as processes have disadvantages with respect to treatment performance environmental burden and economic efficiency 1 among them the instability related to as settling properties affects the stability of wastewater treatment and increases the footprint of the treatment equipment for instance in the treatment of low strength wastewater sludge settleability is often unstable due to the overgrowth of filamentous bacteria i e bulking 2 therefore to maintain a low concentration of suspended solids ss in the final effluent discharged from the as process the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss should be maintained at low levels i e 1000 1500 mg l 1 aerobic granular sludge ags technology has attracted increasing attention as an approach to improve sludge settleability and enhance overall treatment performance ags has high density and a large diameter of 200 μm which leads to excellent solid liquid separation 3 the use of ags increases the amount of biomass in the bioreactor reducing the footprint and operating costs and improving the nutrient removal performance 1 4 5 ags technology has been developed mostly for sequencing batch reactors sbrs over the past two decades 1 6 7 the practical operation of several full scale sbrs using ags for the treatment of industrial and municipal wastewater has been reported 8 9 however there are large differences between the reactor and process configurations of conventional as and ags processes in sbr which hinders the direct conversion of existing as treatment facilities into sbrs 10 11 another prerequisite for the use of sbrs in existing municipal wwtps is the need for a large wastewater equalizing tank that is used prior to the sbr wastewater treatment 12 therefore it is necessary to develop continuous flow ags processes that are applicable to existing as facilities upon renovation and upgradation although several continuous flow processes utilizing ags for the upgrade of as processes have been proposed 12 they have significant practical problems such as complicated configuration need for specific chemical supplementation and unstable wastewater treatment performance for example specific selective pressure strategies which enable the active discharge of slow settling biomass with small particle size and retain fast settling biomass with large particle size to enrich ags were usually adopted increased surface overflow rate sor conditions in the secondary clarifier e g 10 m h 1 13 16 and hydrocyclones 17 18 were applied for the former and latter selective pressure strategies respectively in the continuous flow ags technology however the former needed a post treatment to remove ss and organic components from effluent 13 and the latter remained concerns regarding overload of the sludge treatment process owing to decrease in withdrawn sludge concentration discharged from the wastewater treatment process ags augmentation has recently been proposed as a strategy to improve wastewater treatment performance of mainstream as processes in this strategy ags cultured in the sidestream sbr is augmented to the mainstream as process 19 21 giesen et al 19 applied an ags augmentation strategy to the full scale as process for the first time and confirmed the improvement of as settleability and nutrient removal performance figdore et al 20 21 also reported an enhanced nitrification ability upon ags augmentation during lab scale treatment of artificial sewage under the condition of low sludge retention time srt and temperature therefore these current studies indicate that ags augmentation is a promising practical strategy to enhance wastewater treatment performance of existing as processes without the need for extensive reconstruction however current knowledge on the application of the ags augmentation strategy to continuous flow as processes remains limited and further investigation is needed in previous studies ags cultivation was conducted using only high strength wastewater containing considerably high concentrations of organic compounds and nutrients 19 21 to the best of our knowledge no study has reported the feasibility of applying ags augmentation to improve as settleability and enhance mainstream mlss for low strength municipal wastewater this study investigated the application of ags augmentation produced in a sidestream sbr to continuous flow as process mainstream for the treatment of low strength municipal wastewater the main aim of this study was to assess the potential applicability of ags augmentation strategy in a previous study efficient and stable ags production from low strength municipal wastewater was achieved at lab scale using a simultaneous feeding and drawing sbr sfd sbr under a high organic loading rate olr by increasing the volumetric exchange ratio ver to 100 in the ags augmentation strategy 22 here a pilot study was conducted to demonstrate 1 the efficiency and stability of ags production on low strength municipal wastewater using sfd sbr and 2 the efficiency of wastewater treatment in a mainstream continuous flow as process under short hydraulic retention time hrt conditions upon augmenting ags produced in sidestream sfd sbr to increase mlss concentration 2 methodology 2 1 pilot scale plant 2 1 1 test field a pilot scale plant was installed in a wwtp located in tokyo japan in which a conventional as process was used for organic removal approximately 100 of the wastewater flowing into this wwtp was municipal wastewater in addition the quality and concentration of the wastewater were largely affected by rainfall because a combined sewer system was used in the treatment area 2 1 2 configuration the pilot scale plant was comprised of a sidestream sfd sbr to produce ags used for augmentation and a mainstream as process fig 1 the influent flowed continuously into the storage tank and this stored influent was pumped into the sidestream sfd sbr and mainstream reactor through pumps p1 and p2 respectively the effluent and mixed liquor sludge discharged from sfd sbr entered the mainstream reactor and the final effluent was obtained from the mainstream secondary clarifier 2 1 3 sidestream sfd sbr a square reactor with a working volume of 1 4 m3 0 7 m 0 7 m 3 m was used as the sfd sbr this reactor was equipped with a blower b1 for aeration and a motor operated valve mv for effluent discharge the operations of p1 b1 and mv were controlled through a programmable logistic controller the sfd sbr operating cycle was composed of sfd feeding aeration and settling periods during the feeding period the influent was pumped into the settled sludge at the bottom of the sbr at a fixed flow rate of 16 l min 1 as plug flow this enabled the simultaneous discharge of effluent through the mv opened at the effluent port fig s1a to produce a large amount of ags under high olr conditions the ver was set to 100 of the sfd sbr working volume sfd operation under a high ver condition can deteriorate effluent quality from the sfd sbr owing to the partial discharge of influent into the effluent however in the ags augmentation strategy the untreated components discharged from sidestream sbr are removed in the mainstream process to prevent compromising the performance of overall wastewater treatment fig 1 although the selective pressure for fast settling biomass is crucial for sludge granulation 23 24 and requires a high wastewater up flow linear velocity lv a recent study demonstrated that stable granulation can be achieved even under a moderate up flow lv 2 m h 1 during the practical application of sfd sbr fed with low strength municipal wastewater 22 therefore an up flow lv of 2 m h 1 16 l min 1 was applied in this study during the aeration period pump p1 was stopped and mv was closed fig s1b simultaneously blower b1 was switched on to start aeration at a certain flow rate range 2 3 nm3 h 1 the concentration of dissolved oxygen do in sfd sbr was 0 mg l 1 at the beginning of each aeration period and it was increased to saturation level 7 2 8 9 mg l 1 later during the settling period blower b1 was switched off to stop aeration and allow the sludge to settle fig s1c the sludge from sfd sbr was withdrawn and augmented to the mainstream reactor in a completely mixed state during aeration period by introducing the wastewater into sfd sbr and opening the effluent port fig s1d table 2 the ph and temperature in sfd sbr were not controlled and fluctuated between 6 5 7 8 and 12 32 c respectively 2 1 4 mainstream reactor an anaerobic aerobic process was adopted for the mainstream reactor of the pilot scale plant anaerobic tank of 3 m3 aerobic tank of 11 m3 and working water depth of 2 m fig 1 the mixed liquor was agitated with a vertical mixer in the anaerobic tank and aerated with a blower b2 through membrane type diffusers in the aerobic tank a do concentration sensor ldo hach co loveland co usa was installed at the end of the aerobic tank and blower b2 was feedback controlled such that the do concentration sensor indicated a set value 1 0 1 5 mg l 1 however owing to the fixed minimum aeration rate of b2 5 nm3 h 1 the actual do value was often higher than the set value maximum of 5 7 mg l 1 when the influent substrate concentration decreased notably a circular secondary clarifier with water surface area of 2 4 m2 ϕ 1 75 m equipped with a slow agitator was installed after the mainstream reactor the concentrated sludge in this clarifier was recirculated to the anaerobic tank with a pump p3 the sludge recirculation rate was set at 30 of the influent flow rate excess sludge was withdrawn from the bottom of the aerobic tank with a pump p4 in a completely mixed state the ph and temperature in the mainstream reactor were not controlled the ph in the anaerobic and aerobic tanks fluctuated between 6 6 7 2 and 6 4 7 9 respectively the temperature in the aerobic tank varied between 15 32 c depending on seasonal changes 2 2 operating conditions 2 2 1 sidestream sfd sbr operation prior to the demonstration of ags augmentation the sfd sbr operation was started and optimized for efficient ags production this was referred to as the granulation period until day 250 the seed sludge for ags formation was collected from the full scale wwtp and inoculated into sbr at an initial mlss concentration of 2800 mg l 1 during the granulation period effluent from a pilot scale primary clarifier water surface area of 2 4 m2 and water depth of 2 m was introduced into the storage tank and used as the influent for sfd sbr the granulation period comprised of two phases phases g i and g ii during phase g i days 1 150 the operating cycle included feeding 90 min aeration 240 min and settling 8 min periods table 1 the mean inflow rate and olr calculated as total biochemical oxygen demand tbod into sfd sbr during phase g i were 6 5 1 1 m3 d 1 and 0 51 0 19 kg tbod m 3 d 1 respectively settleability of the formed ags was stable from days 40 150 however after day 151 the sbr operation was changed phase g ii and it alternately repeated step 1 with a long aeration time of 240 min and step 2 with a short aeration time of 40 min to improve characteristics of the ags table 1 previous studies reported that slow growing anaerobic bacteria such as phosphorus accumulating organisms pao and glycogen accumulating organisms gao are crucial for the formation of stable ags 25 26 however maintenance of anaerobic conditions to support the growth of pao and gao during the feeding period is not easy with the supply of low strength municipal wastewater therefore step 2 with a short aeration time was applied to suppress nitrification and production of nitrogen oxyanions additionally the aeration period of step 2 was reduced to 20 min on day 185 table 1 these changes in operating conditions led to an increase in the inflow rate and olr during phase g ii to 9 2 0 6 m3 d 1 and 0 84 0 30 kg tbod m 3 d 1 respectively table 2 after day 251 the sfd sbr continued operating under the same conditions as those in the latter half of phase g ii however on day 394 because of a failure in the pump supplying raw sewage to the pilot scale primary clarifier the influent flow into the sfd sbr changed to the primary effluent pumped from the primary effluent drain in the full scale wwtp in addition sfd sbr operation was ceased temporarily during days 529 541 within phase a ii during the augmentation period because of a technical problem with blower b1 2 2 2 mainstream reactor operation the mainstream reactor was operated from day 483 671 180 days which referred to the augmentation period table 2 seed sludge flocculant as was collected from the full scale wwtp and inoculated into the mainstream reactor at an initial mlss concentration of 1200 mg l 1 as the primary effluent obtained from the wwtp was directly used during the augmentation period the influent ss tbod and total organic carbon toc concentrations were substantially lower than those during the granulation period table 2 the mainstream reactor was operated without ags augmentation for 9 days as the pre augmentation period phase a i as complete nitrification was required at the wwtp where the pilot scale plant was installed the inflow rate during phase a i was set to 28 0 6 m3 d 1 to achieve the hrt of 14 18 h as per the wwtp design standard in japan 27 therefore the mainstream reactor was operated with an olr of 0 16 0 01 kg tbod m 3 d 1 table 2 during the augmentation period in addition to the influent the effluent and sludge discharged from sfd sbr were introduced into the mainstream reactor the augmentation period comprised of three phases phase a ii which started with lower olrs phase a iii with a stepwise increase in inflow rate and phase a iv which was constantly operated with higher inflow rates table 2 during phase a ii 62 d a total inflow of 37 1 5 m3 d 1 including the effluent from sfd sbr was introduced into the mainstream reactor with a mean olr of 0 15 0 04 kg tbod m 3 d 1 during phase a iii the inflow rate to the mainstream reactor was increased stepwise reaching 55 m3 d 1 on day 91 table 2 fig s2a however because of the notable low influent concentrations due to the rainy season the olr remained at a low level fig s2b during phase a iv the mainstream reactor was operated for 90 days with an inflow rate of 53 3 6 m3 d 1 the hrt during phase a iv 7 0 0 5 h was 40 shorter than that during phase a i 12 0 3 h decrease in rainfall led to a rapid increase in the influent concentration and olr reached 0 41 kg tbod m 3 d 1 on day 99 fig s2b consequently the overall olr during phase a iv was 0 29 0 06 kg tbod m 3 d 1 approximately twice the values in phases a i a iii the bypassed flow rate to sfd sbr during the augmentation period was mostly fixed at 8 4 9 1 m3 d 1 the exceptions were days 529 541 during which the sfd sbr operation was ceased because of a technical problem in blower b1 and all influent flow was introduced to the mainstream reactor due to which ags augmentation was also stopped 2 3 analysis concentrations of the toc dissolved organic carbon doc bod allylthiourea bod atu bod total nitrogen tn ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 nitrate no3 total phosphorus tp ss and mlss along with the sludge volume index svi were determined according to standard methods 28 svi5 and svi30 were determined by dividing the sludge bed volume measured after settling for 5 and 30 min respectively using a 1 l cylinder the ratio of svi30 to svi5 svi30 svi5 was used as an index of sludge granulation because it approaches 1 as the sludge granulation progressed 24 the toc tn and doc concentrations were measured using a toc tn analyzer toc l tnm l shimadzu kyoto japan soluble samples were obtained through filtration using a quantitative filter paper no 5c toyo roshi co tokyo japan the particle size distribution of sludge was measured using a laser diffraction particle size distribution analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern panalytical worcestershire uk that could measure particles from 0 01 to 3500 μm the cumulative frequency volume fraction with particle size 211 μm was evaluated as the ags fraction 22 microscopic sludge observation was conducted using a digital microscope vhx 1000 keyence osaka japan 2 4 calculations 2 4 1 mass of sludge withdrawal and srt the mass of withdrawn sludge and mean srt d were determined using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 29 1 x w mlss q w ss eff q eff 2 srt mlss v r x w where xw sseff qeff qw and vr were the mass of

abundance of ags in mainstream reactor the theoretical amount of ags that remained in the mainstream reactor was calculated using eq 3 based on the assumption that no definitive amount of ags was present in the final effluent discharged from the mainstream secondary clarifier 3 sa n sa n 1 sag n f ags sbr 1 q wn v r main where san and san 1 were the amounts of ags remaining in the mainstream

significance of differences in the sludge characteristics or treatment performances was analyzed by applying the mann whitney u test between two groups and kruskal wallis test between three groups using the r package rstatix version 0 7 0 with a significance level of p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 granulation in sidestream sfd sbr during the initial part of phase g i svi30 decreased gradually falling below 80 ml g 1 on day 18 and reaching 55 ml g 1 on day 40 fig 2a thereafter svi30 remained at 62 5 ml g 1 until day 150 the svi30 svi5 increased from 0 43 to 0 58 on day 40 and then remained stable at 0 59 0 05 until day 150 the ags fraction which was 17 in the initial inoculum sludge increased to 61 on day 36 when svi30 was below 80 ml g 1 and then remained at 40 60 fig 2b the svi30 and svi30 svi5 remained stable during the latter part of phase g i the microscopic observations revealed that the ags produced during phase g i was mainly composed of sludge with aggregated and irregular surface structures fig 3b the period required for ags formation i e 40 days was similar to that of the previous lab scale study working volume of 4 l 22 although the feeding periods in the two studies were different owing to the use of the same up flow lv 2 m h 1 but with different working water depths in the sbrs the results indicated that operating with a high ver 100 enabled rapid ags formation on low strength municipal wastewater in the sfd sbr irrespective of the reactor scale contrastingly the formed ags had irregular surface structure and relatively smaller particle size 500 μm compared with the ags produced using sbr on volatile fatty acids vfas rich synthetic wastewater as observed in the previous study 26 this issue was considered a challenge for ags production on low strength municipal wastewater during phase g ii from day 151 the cycle operation was switched to alternately repetitions of step 1 and step 2 which presented aeration times of 240 and 40 min respectively to further improve the ags characteristics on day 172 svi30 decreased to below 40 ml g 1 and svi30 svi5 increased to 0 79 on day 176 svi30 increased and svi30 svi5 decreased however upon reducing the aeration time in step 2 to 20 min svi30 decreased to 40 ml g 1 or less and svi30 svi5 increased to a maximum of 0 84 the particle size distribution during phase g ii was similar to that on day 36 of phase g i and the ags fraction remained stable at 51 3 however the microscopic observations revealed an ags appearance with smooth surfaces and particle size of approximately 500 μm during phase g ii regardless of the aeration time in step 2 fig 3c d the sludge settleability based on svi30 and svi30 svi5 improved significantly p 0 05 from phase g i days 40 150 to phase g ii days 151 184 and phase g ii days 185 250 in addition the alternately repeating cycles of step 1 and step 2 with long and short aeration time respectively were likely effective for the production of ags with excellent settleability and morphology in a previous study high olr condition as total chemical oxygen demand tcod with continuous short cycle time 1 3 kg m 3 d 1 was proposed as the key factor for ags formation on low strength municipal wastewater in sbrs 30 however excessively high olr conditions 1 8 kg tcod m 3 d 1 can deteriorate ags properties owing to the presence of filamentous bacteria 22 the olr as tcod during phase g ii was estimated to be 1 8 kg tcod m 3 d 1 based on the olr 0 84 0 3 kg tbod m 3 d 1 and ratio of cod to bod 2 1 g g 1 in general municipal wastewater after primary sedimentation 29 therefore olr level was high enough to cause occurrence of filamentous bacteria nevertheless ags with superior properties was successfully produced by increasing the olr by alternately repeating long and short aeration times previous studies reported that slow growing pao and or gao were important for ags production and stabilization they anaerobically convert readily biodegradable organic substrates such as vfas to storage polymers 25 26 the novel sbr cycle during phase g ii could enrich anaerobic bacteria in this study which allowed the production of ags with excellent morphology and settleability previous studies on ags production from wastewater containing insoluble organic matter and low vfa concentrations in sbr reported that insoluble organic matter was adsorbed on the ags surface without sufficient hydrolysis and pao and gao did not grow sufficiently which resulted in the formation of fluffy floc like ags 26 31 32 in contrast the variations in substrate concentrations on day 204 phase g ii revealed that the produced ags presented good phosphorus removal activity fig s3 suggesting the enrichment of pao in the produced ags in sfd sbr therefore in the pilot scale sfd sbr of this study insoluble organic matter in the influent was likely hydrolyzed into readily biodegradable organic matter under short aeration time which enriched slow growing pao and gao during the following anaerobic feeding period since day 185 when the aeration time in step 2 was reduced the svi30 svi5 ratio improved fig 2a however significant improvement in sludge settleability was not observed between the former and latter halves in phase g ii svi 30 p 0 60 svi 30 svi 5 p 0 13 although large particles of approximately 500 μm were maintained during the latter half period of phase g ii the svi30 svi5 fluctuated this was possibly due to the large variations in influent concentration during the latter half period 19 92 mg toc l 1 than the former 45 96 mg toc l 1 in phase g ii therefore the instability of svi30 svi5 ratio was not because of the fragmentation of ags but due to the increase in flocculated sludge caused by the fluctuations of influent concentration further investigation is required to determine the optimum aeration time in step 2 for maintaining ags settleability the volume of withdrawn sludge increased from 0 09 0 06 to 0 11 0 04 m3 d 1 according to the olr increase from phase g i to g ii furthermore the mlss concentration increased from 3130 480 to 3720 470 mg l 1 table 2 consequently the amount of withdrawn sludge increased by approximately 50 from 0 45 0 22 kg ss d 1 to 0 67 0 14 kg ss d 1 these findings indicate that the novel sbr cycle operation used in this study was a promising strategy that enables the production of a large amount of ags with superior properties and hence can be used for augmentation 3 2 ags augmentation 3 2 1 sludge characteristics in sidestream sfd sbr during augmentation period during the augmentation period phase a i to a iv sfd sbr continued operating under the conditions applied during the latter part of phase g ii from day 483 phase a i to 529 phase a ii svi30 and svi30 svi5 varied although there was no significant change in the sludge particle size fig 4a it was likely due to the increase in floccular sludge since the larger ags was maintained fig 5a wang et al 33 reported that ags settleability deteriorated due to the decrease in srt caused by a large amount of sludge washout similarly the srt in phase a i and a ii was extremely short 4 8 0 4 d compared to that in phase g ii 8 2 2 1 d owing to the higher sludge discharge table 2 overall it is likely that an excessive amount of sludge washout leading to extremely short srt should be avoided to stabilize ags characteristics moreover the settling performance of ags produced in the sfd sbr temporarily deteriorated slightly particularly when there was a problem with blower b1 fig 1 between the days 529 541 when the blower accidentally stopped svi30 increased from 55 ml g 1 on day 528 to 86 ml g 1 on day 543 however once the blower was restored the sludge settleability rapidly improved and on day 563 svi30 and svi30 svi5 reached 41 ml g 1 and 0 78 respectively during phase a iv svi30 svi5 slightly decreased 0 58 0 07 whereas svi30 remained almost stable 54 7 ml g 1 the food to microorganisms f m ratio in phase a iii was 0 20 0 06 kg tbod kg ss 1 d 1 however it increased to 0 26 0 06 kg tbod kg ss 1 d 1 in phase a iv because of rapid increase in the tbod concentration of the influent therefore it was assumed that the accumulation of insoluble organic matters without sufficient hydrolysis in the sludge resulted in the increase of flocculant ss this suggested that the controlling the duration of aeration period to maintain a constant f m ratio is necessary to stabilize ags settleability regardless of fluctuations in organic concentration of the influent the ags fraction 211 μm was stable at 52 62 throughout the augmentation period however the proportion of ags with diameter 516 μm was higher during phase a iv 24 25 than during phase a ii 7 12 fig 4d moreover microscopic observations showed that the overall ags diameter equalized from phase a ii to a iii and showed a consequent notable increase in ags 500 μm during phase a iv fig 5a c previous studies reported that high concentrations of readily degradable organics promoted substrate penetration into the core of ags and consequently increased ags diameter 25 during phase a iv of this study the soluble bod sbod concentration increased to approximately twice that in phase a iii as sbod is mainly composed of readily biodegradable substrates the increase in sbod concentration in the influent was suggested to have caused the enlargement of ags that had been formed in the sfd sbr 3 2 2 sludge characteristics and fate of ags in mainstream reactor during the pre augmentation period phase a i svi30 and mlss concentration in the mainstream reactor were 125 155 ml g 1 and 1100 1680 mg l 1 respectively after ags augmentation started phase a ii svi30 decreased to 71 ml g 1 on day 525 fig 4b and rn increased to 27 on day 520 fig 4c due to low olr the mlss concentration remained at 1380 150 mg l 1 without notable changes until day 528 ags fraction in the mainstream reactor increased to 24 on day 506 phase a ii and remained stable until day 553 fig 4d this suggested the retention of augmented ags in the mainstream reactor on day 522 microscopic observations revealed the presence of not only flocculant sludge derived from the seeded as but also ags with particle size of 200 μm that was likely derived from the augmented ags fig 5d and e however ags with diameter 500 μm supplied from sfd sbr fig 5a was not microscopically observed in the mainstream reactor fig 5e and the detection amount was also low during measurement of particle size distribution fig 4d verawaty et al 34 suggested that the ags diameter was determined by the balance between the particle reduction attributed to fragmentation and attrition and ags growth in the reactor in addition de kreuk and van loosdrecht 25 reported that the increase in concentration of readily biodegradable organics in the bulk liquid under anaerobic conditions can promote substrate penetration into the ags core leading to the formation of ags the mainstream reactor in this study was operated in a mixed state hence the concentration of organics in the mainstream anaerobic tank was likely lower than that in the bulk liquid of the sfd sbr into which influent was introduced onto settled ags as plug flow therefore results indicated that the ags growth rate was lower than its fragmentation and attrition rates in the mainstream reactor under low olr conditions which led to the reduction of ags with large particle size 500 μm on days 529 541 when blower b1 presented a problem and ags augmentation ceased rn decreased to 10 day 541 and the mlss concentration increased owing to the increased olr and continuous sludge withdrawal in the mainstream in addition svi30 increased slightly but remained at 94 3 ml g 1 during phase a iii in which the operation of sidestream sfd sbr resumed and the flow rate to the mainstream increased stepwise rn remained constant until day 569 thereafter rn increased with the decrease in mlss concentration and reached 20 on day 580 while svi30 decreased to 80 ml g 1 on day 582 when rn increased to 20 the ags fraction reached 33 fig 4d and ags with 200 μm including smaller particles with 100 μm were observed along with the flocculant sludge fig 5f during phase a iv olr increased rapidly owing to the variation in the influent concentrations simultaneously the mlss concentration increased reaching 2500 mg l 1 on day 601 and stabilized at 2200 240 mg l 1 fig 4b the svi30 also increased slightly but remained at 90 7 ml g 1 rn decreased with increasing olr and mlss concentration and remained at 9 2 0 4 fig 4c the ags fraction increased notably reaching 59 on day 602 after that the ags fraction remained at above 50 despite the decrease in rn fig 4c in addition while the ags fraction with diameter 516 μm was 3 during phase a ii it increased to 11 on day 665 most of the sludge observed in phase a iv were granule like particles with diameter smaller than the ags produced in sidestream sfd sbr and with higher density than the seeded flocculant as fig 5g these results suggested that the ags grew in the mainstream reactor owing to the decrease in the rate of ags fragmentation and or the increase in the growth rate of fragmented ags in previous studies the following three factors were identified as key promoters of ags growth 1 selective pressure to favorably retain fast settling biomass e g excessively high sor in secondary clarifier or sludge withdrawal with hydrocyclone 2 aeration shear stress to form a biofilm with smooth and compact morphology and 3 high anaerobic f m ratio to promote the penetration of readily biodegradable organic matter into ags core 20 in this study the sludge withdrawal from mainstream reactor was conducted in a mixed state from the aerobic tank and the sor in the secondary clarifier was 1 m h 1 table 2 which was within the range indicated in the design guides for secondary clarifiers in japan 27 consequently the ss concentrations in effluents were maintained at low levels therefore selective pressure for fast settling biomass was not effective in addition based on the gas sparging rate to mainstream aerobic tank the mean gas velocity was estimated as maximum of 0 1 cm sec 1 this value was substantially lower than 1 cm sec 1 which has been suggested as effective shear stress for ags formation by previous studies 1 35 in contrast the f m ratio based on sbod in the anaerobic tank during phase a iv 0 31 0 09 kg sbod kg ss 1 d 1 was substantially higher than that during phase a iii 0 18 0 06 kg sbod kg ss 1 d 1 therefore these results suggested that increase in the concentration of readily biodegradable organic matter in the anaerobic tank accelerated the increase in particle size owing to substrate permeation into the ags this led to the growth of fragmented ags in the mainstream reactor consequently the fraction of granule like sludge increased and the high ags fraction was retained 3 2 3 wastewater treatment performance in mainstream table 3 summarizes the wastewater treatment performance in the mainstream reactor during the augmentation period during the phases a i to a iii the mean tbod in the effluent was 5 mg l 1 and an excellent tbod removal of 93 was maintained during phase a iv tbod concentration in the effluent increased slightly 4 8 2 6 mg l 1 this was likely caused by the increase in ss concentration of the effluents owing to higher inflow into the mainstream however the overall treatment performance did not notably deteriorate 94 4 of tbod removal throughout the augmentation period nh4 removal was maintained at 97 with an nh4 effluent concentration of 1 mg n l 1 almost complete nitrification was achieved even during phase a iv 98 1 of nh4 removal when the water temperature was the lowest 15 22 c owing to the sufficient srt of 13 3 d in the mainstream reactor although the tn concentrations in the effluent increased slightly during phase a iv 11 8 2 5 mg n l 1 compared to phase a ii 9 1 1 7 mg n l 1 tn removal did not vary significantly p 0 30 regardless of olrs the tp removal performance improved slightly but not significantly during phase a iv compared to phase a ii table 3 tp concentration in effluents p 0 14 tp removal ratio p 0 17 the improvement in the treatment performance of the mainstream by ags augmentation primarily depended on the retention of supplied ags and the consequent maintenance of high mlss concentrations by the improved settleability of the overall sludge including suspended as and ags in this study the relative abundance of the theoretical remaining ags rn and svi30 during ags augmentation were linked fig 4b c during phase a iv which included 40 shorter hrt and twice higher olr compared to the designed operating conditions phase a i table 3 the ags fraction in mainstream increased and svi30 stabilized at 100 ml g 1 regardless of the olr variation therefore the augmentation of ags from sfd sbr contributed to the stabilization of sludge settleability in the mainstream reactor consequently the mlss concentration in the mainstream reactor increased to 2500 mg l 1 therefore results of this study indicated that the ags augmentation strategy presented a superior treatment performance even under high olr conditions and short hrts in the continuous flow municipal wastewater treatment process 4 conclusions this study reported a pilot scale demonstration of the ags augmentation strategy applied to a continuous flow as process for the treatment of low strength municipal wastewater in the sidestream sfd sbr for ags production the novel operating cycle of alternately repeated steps with short and long aeration times contributed to ags production with superior characteristics and 50 increase in the production rate in the mainstream continuous flow as operation where ags was augmented the sludge settleability improved with increasing ags retention in addition ags growth was confirmed under high olr conditions the improvement of settleability and retention of relatively high mlss concentrations by the increasing ags fraction in the mainstream led to sustained superior wastewater treatment performance despite notable olr variations these findings demonstrated the practical usefulness of ags augmentation strategy in wwtps that received low strength municipal wastewater in the future full

12651,this study investigated the application of aerobic granular sludge ags augmentation strategy to continuous flow activated sludge as process mainstream for the treatment of low strength municipal wastewater using a pilot scale demonstration plant a sidestream sequencing batch reactor sbr was adopted for ags production and the ags produced was supplied to a mainstream reactor in the sidestream a simultaneous feeding and drawing sbr was operated ags rapidly formed in terms of sludge volume index svi and ags fraction and stabilized svi30 62 5 ml g 1 ags fraction 40 60 the installation of a novel sbr cycle with alternately repeated steps of short and long aeration times further improved the settleability svi30 47 6 ml g 1 and contributed to an increase in ags production by 50 ags augmentation increased the ags fraction 20 30 in mainstream and svi30 improved to 100 ml g 1 as the organic loading rate olr to the mainstream increased the ags fraction increased to 50 suggesting the growth of ags in mainstream despite the olr variations the stable settleability 100 ml g 1 of svi30 and relatively high retention of the mlss enabled stable removal of tbod and ammonium 94 4 and 98 1 respectively this is the first study that demonstrated the potential use of ags augmentation strategy in a continuous flow process at the pilot scale for the treatment of low strength municipal wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aerobic granular sludge augmentation pilot scale plant continuous flow sidestream sequencing batch reactor data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction activated sludge as processes have been widely applied worldwide in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps however as processes have disadvantages with respect to treatment performance environmental burden and economic efficiency 1 among them the instability related to as settling properties affects the stability of wastewater treatment and increases the footprint of the treatment equipment for instance in the treatment of low strength wastewater sludge settleability is often unstable due to the overgrowth of filamentous bacteria i e bulking 2 therefore to maintain a low concentration of suspended solids ss in the final effluent discharged from the as process the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss should be maintained at low levels i e 1000 1500 mg l 1 aerobic granular sludge ags technology has attracted increasing attention as an approach to improve sludge settleability and enhance overall treatment performance ags has high density and a large diameter of 200 μm which leads to excellent solid liquid separation 3 the use of ags increases the amount of biomass in the bioreactor reducing the footprint and operating costs and improving the nutrient removal performance 1 4 5 ags technology has been developed mostly for sequencing batch reactors sbrs over the past two decades 1 6 7 the practical operation of several full scale sbrs using ags for the treatment of industrial and municipal wastewater has been reported 8 9 however there are large differences between the reactor and process configurations of conventional as and ags processes in sbr which hinders the direct conversion of existing as treatment facilities into sbrs 10 11 another prerequisite for the use of sbrs in existing municipal wwtps is the need for a large wastewater equalizing tank that is used prior to the sbr wastewater treatment 12 therefore it is necessary to develop continuous flow ags processes that are applicable to existing as facilities upon renovation and upgradation although several continuous flow processes utilizing ags for the upgrade of as processes have been proposed 12 they have significant practical problems such as complicated configuration need for specific chemical supplementation and unstable wastewater treatment performance for example specific selective pressure strategies which enable the active discharge of slow settling biomass with small particle size and retain fast settling biomass with large particle size to enrich ags were usually adopted increased surface overflow rate sor conditions in the secondary clarifier e g 10 m h 1 13 16 and hydrocyclones 17 18 were applied for the former and latter selective pressure strategies respectively in the continuous flow ags technology however the former needed a post treatment to remove ss and organic components from effluent 13 and the latter remained concerns regarding overload of the sludge treatment process owing to decrease in withdrawn sludge concentration discharged from the wastewater treatment process ags augmentation has recently been proposed as a strategy to improve wastewater treatment performance of mainstream as processes in this strategy ags cultured in the sidestream sbr is augmented to the mainstream as process 19 21 giesen et al 19 applied an ags augmentation strategy to the full scale as process for the first time and confirmed the improvement of as settleability and nutrient removal performance figdore et al 20 21 also reported an enhanced nitrification ability upon ags augmentation during lab scale treatment of artificial sewage under the condition of low sludge retention time srt and temperature therefore these current studies indicate that ags augmentation is a promising practical strategy to enhance wastewater treatment performance of existing as processes without the need for extensive reconstruction however current knowledge on the application of the ags augmentation strategy to continuous flow as processes remains limited and further investigation is needed in previous studies ags cultivation was conducted using only high strength wastewater containing considerably high concentrations of organic compounds and nutrients 19 21 to the best of our knowledge no study has reported the feasibility of applying ags augmentation to improve as settleability and enhance mainstream mlss for low strength municipal wastewater this study investigated the application of ags augmentation produced in a sidestream sbr to continuous flow as process mainstream for the treatment of low strength municipal wastewater the main aim of this study was to assess the potential applicability of ags augmentation strategy in a previous study efficient and stable ags production from low strength municipal wastewater was achieved at lab scale using a simultaneous feeding and drawing sbr sfd sbr under a high organic loading rate olr by increasing the volumetric exchange ratio ver to 100 in the ags augmentation strategy 22 here a pilot study was conducted to demonstrate 1 the efficiency and stability of ags production on low strength municipal wastewater using sfd sbr and 2 the efficiency of wastewater treatment in a mainstream continuous flow as process under short hydraulic retention time hrt conditions upon augmenting ags produced in sidestream sfd sbr to increase mlss concentration 2 methodology 2 1 pilot scale plant 2 1 1 test field a pilot scale plant was installed in a wwtp located in tokyo japan in which a conventional as process was used for organic removal approximately 100 of the wastewater flowing into this wwtp was municipal wastewater in addition the quality and concentration of the wastewater were largely affected by rainfall because a combined sewer system was used in the treatment area 2 1 2 configuration the pilot scale plant was comprised of a sidestream sfd sbr to produce ags used for augmentation and a mainstream as process fig 1 the influent flowed continuously into the storage tank and this stored influent was pumped into the sidestream sfd sbr and mainstream reactor through pumps p1 and p2 respectively the effluent and mixed liquor sludge discharged from sfd sbr entered the mainstream reactor and the final effluent was obtained from the mainstream secondary clarifier 2 1 3 sidestream sfd sbr a square reactor with a working volume of 1 4 m3 0 7 m 0 7 m 3 m was used as the sfd sbr this reactor was equipped with a blower b1 for aeration and a motor operated valve mv for effluent discharge the operations of p1 b1 and mv were controlled through a programmable logistic controller the sfd sbr operating cycle was composed of sfd feeding aeration and settling periods during the feeding period the influent was pumped into the settled sludge at the bottom of the sbr at a fixed flow rate of 16 l min 1 as plug flow this enabled the simultaneous discharge of effluent through the mv opened at the effluent port fig s1a to produce a large amount of ags under high olr conditions the ver was set to 100 of the sfd sbr working volume sfd operation under a high ver condition can deteriorate effluent quality from the sfd sbr owing to the partial discharge of influent into the effluent however in the ags augmentation strategy the untreated components discharged from sidestream sbr are removed in the mainstream process to prevent compromising the performance of overall wastewater treatment fig 1 although the selective pressure for fast settling biomass is crucial for sludge granulation 23 24 and requires a high wastewater up flow linear velocity lv a recent study demonstrated that stable granulation can be achieved even under a moderate up flow lv 2 m h 1 during the practical application of sfd sbr fed with low strength municipal wastewater 22 therefore an up flow lv of 2 m h 1 16 l min 1 was applied in this study during the aeration period pump p1 was stopped and mv was closed fig s1b simultaneously blower b1 was switched on to start aeration at a certain flow rate range 2 3 nm3 h 1 the concentration of dissolved oxygen do in sfd sbr was 0 mg l 1 at the beginning of each aeration period and it was increased to saturation level 7 2 8 9 mg l 1 later during the settling period blower b1 was switched off to stop aeration and allow the sludge to settle fig s1c the sludge from sfd sbr was withdrawn and augmented to the mainstream reactor in a completely mixed state during aeration period by introducing the wastewater into sfd sbr and opening the effluent port fig s1d table 2 the ph and temperature in sfd sbr were not controlled and fluctuated between 6 5 7 8 and 12 32 c respectively 2 1 4 mainstream reactor an anaerobic aerobic process was adopted for the mainstream reactor of the pilot scale plant anaerobic tank of 3 m3 aerobic tank of 11 m3 and working water depth of 2 m fig 1 the mixed liquor was agitated with a vertical mixer in the anaerobic tank and aerated with a blower b2 through membrane type diffusers in the aerobic tank a do concentration sensor ldo hach co loveland co usa was installed at the end of the aerobic tank and blower b2 was feedback controlled such that the do concentration sensor indicated a set value 1 0 1 5 mg l 1 however owing to the fixed minimum aeration rate of b2 5 nm3 h 1 the actual do value was often higher than the set value maximum of 5 7 mg l 1 when the influent substrate concentration decreased notably a circular secondary clarifier with water surface area of 2 4 m2 ϕ 1 75 m equipped with a slow agitator was installed after the mainstream reactor the concentrated sludge in this clarifier was recirculated to the anaerobic tank with a pump p3 the sludge recirculation rate was set at 30 of the influent flow rate excess sludge was withdrawn from the bottom of the aerobic tank with a pump p4 in a completely mixed state the ph and temperature in the mainstream reactor were not controlled the ph in the anaerobic and aerobic tanks fluctuated between 6 6 7 2 and 6 4 7 9 respectively the temperature in the aerobic tank varied between 15 32 c depending on seasonal changes 2 2 operating conditions 2 2 1 sidestream sfd sbr operation prior to the demonstration of ags augmentation the sfd sbr operation was started and optimized for efficient ags production this was referred to as the granulation period until day 250 the seed sludge for ags formation was collected from the full scale wwtp and inoculated into sbr at an initial mlss concentration of 2800 mg l 1 during the granulation period effluent from a pilot scale primary clarifier water surface area of 2 4 m2 and water depth of 2 m was introduced into the storage tank and used as the influent for sfd sbr the granulation period comprised of two phases phases g i and g ii during phase g i days 1 150 the operating cycle included feeding 90 min aeration 240 min and settling 8 min periods table 1 the mean inflow rate and olr calculated as total biochemical oxygen demand tbod into sfd sbr during phase g i were 6 5 1 1 m3 d 1 and 0 51 0 19 kg tbod m 3 d 1 respectively settleability of the formed ags was stable from days 40 150 however after day 151 the sbr operation was changed phase g ii and it alternately repeated step 1 with a long aeration time of 240 min and step 2 with a short aeration time of 40 min to improve characteristics of the ags table 1 previous studies reported that slow growing anaerobic bacteria such as phosphorus accumulating organisms pao and glycogen accumulating organisms gao are crucial for the formation of stable ags 25 26 however maintenance of anaerobic conditions to support the growth of pao and gao during the feeding period is not easy with the supply of low strength municipal wastewater therefore step 2 with a short aeration time was applied to suppress nitrification and production of nitrogen oxyanions additionally the aeration period of step 2 was reduced to 20 min on day 185 table 1 these changes in operating conditions led to an increase in the inflow rate and olr during phase g ii to 9 2 0 6 m3 d 1 and 0 84 0 30 kg tbod m 3 d 1 respectively table 2 after day 251 the sfd sbr continued operating under the same conditions as those in the latter half of phase g ii however on day 394 because of a failure in the pump supplying raw sewage to the pilot scale primary clarifier the influent flow into the sfd sbr changed to the primary effluent pumped from the primary effluent drain in the full scale wwtp in addition sfd sbr operation was ceased temporarily during days 529 541 within phase a ii during the augmentation period because of a technical problem with blower b1 2 2 2 mainstream reactor operation the mainstream reactor was operated from day 483 671 180 days which referred to the augmentation period table 2 seed sludge flocculant as was collected from the full scale wwtp and inoculated into the mainstream reactor at an initial mlss concentration of 1200 mg l 1 as the primary effluent obtained from the wwtp was directly used during the augmentation period the influent ss tbod and total organic carbon toc concentrations were substantially lower than those during the granulation period table 2 the mainstream reactor was operated without ags augmentation for 9 days as the pre augmentation period phase a i as complete nitrification was required at the wwtp where the pilot scale plant was installed the inflow rate during phase a i was set to 28 0 6 m3 d 1 to achieve the hrt of 14 18 h as per the wwtp design standard in japan 27 therefore the mainstream reactor was operated with an olr of 0 16 0 01 kg tbod m 3 d 1 table 2 during the augmentation period in addition to the influent the effluent and sludge discharged from sfd sbr were introduced into the mainstream reactor the augmentation period comprised of three phases phase a ii which started with lower olrs phase a iii with a stepwise increase in inflow rate and phase a iv which was constantly operated with higher inflow rates table 2 during phase a ii 62 d a total inflow of 37 1 5 m3 d 1 including the effluent from sfd sbr was introduced into the mainstream reactor with a mean olr of 0 15 0 04 kg tbod m 3 d 1 during phase a iii the inflow rate to the mainstream reactor was increased stepwise reaching 55 m3 d 1 on day 91 table 2 fig s2a however because of the notable low influent concentrations due to the rainy season the olr remained at a low level fig s2b during phase a iv the mainstream reactor was operated for 90 days with an inflow rate of 53 3 6 m3 d 1 the hrt during phase a iv 7 0 0 5 h was 40 shorter than that during phase a i 12 0 3 h decrease in rainfall led to a rapid increase in the influent concentration and olr reached 0 41 kg tbod m 3 d 1 on day 99 fig s2b consequently the overall olr during phase a iv was 0 29 0 06 kg tbod m 3 d 1 approximately twice the values in phases a i a iii the bypassed flow rate to sfd sbr during the augmentation period was mostly fixed at 8 4 9 1 m3 d 1 the exceptions were days 529 541 during which the sfd sbr operation was ceased because of a technical problem in blower b1 and all influent flow was introduced to the mainstream reactor due to which ags augmentation was also stopped 2 3 analysis concentrations of the toc dissolved organic carbon doc bod allylthiourea bod atu bod total nitrogen tn ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 nitrate no3 total phosphorus tp ss and mlss along with the sludge volume index svi were determined according to standard methods 28 svi5 and svi30 were determined by dividing the sludge bed volume measured after settling for 5 and 30 min respectively using a 1 l cylinder the ratio of svi30 to svi5 svi30 svi5 was used as an index of sludge granulation because it approaches 1 as the sludge granulation progressed 24 the toc tn and doc concentrations were measured using a toc tn analyzer toc l tnm l shimadzu kyoto japan soluble samples were obtained through filtration using a quantitative filter paper no 5c toyo roshi co tokyo japan the particle size distribution of sludge was measured using a laser diffraction particle size distribution analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern panalytical worcestershire uk that could measure particles from 0 01 to 3500 μm the cumulative frequency volume fraction with particle size 211 μm was evaluated as the ags fraction 22 microscopic sludge observation was conducted using a digital microscope vhx 1000 keyence osaka japan 2 4 calculations 2 4 1 mass of sludge withdrawal and srt the mass of withdrawn sludge and mean srt d were determined using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 29 1 x w mlss q w ss eff q eff 2 srt mlss v r x w where xw sseff qeff qw and vr were the mass of withdrawn sludge per day kg ss d 1 ss concentration in the effluent kg ss m 3 effluent flow rate m3 d 1 daily sludge withdrawal volume m3 d 1 and reactor volume m3 respectively 2 4 2 relative abundance of ags in mainstream reactor the theoretical amount of ags that remained in the mainstream reactor was calculated using eq 3 based on the assumption that no definitive amount of ags was present in the final effluent discharged from the mainstream secondary clarifier 3 sa n sa n 1 sag n f ags sbr 1 q wn v r main where san and san 1 were the amounts of ags remaining in the mainstream on days n and n 1 respectively kg ss sagn was the amount of augmented sludge on day n kg ss fags sbr was the mean ags fraction augmented qwn was the withdrawal volume from the mainstream reactor on day n m3 and vr main was the working volume of the mainstream reactor m3 in addition the theoretical relative abundance of ags remaining in the mainstream reactor on day n rn was calculated using eq 4 4 r n sa n mlss main 10 d average v r main 100 where mlssmain 10d average was the 10 d average mlss concentration in the mainstream reactor kg ss m 3 2 5 statistical analysis the statistical significance of differences in the sludge characteristics or treatment performances was analyzed by applying the mann whitney u test between two groups and kruskal wallis test between three groups using the r package rstatix version 0 7 0 with a significance level of p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 granulation in sidestream sfd sbr during the initial part of phase g i svi30 decreased gradually falling below 80 ml g 1 on day 18 and reaching 55 ml g 1 on day 40 fig 2a thereafter svi30 remained at 62 5 ml g 1 until day 150 the svi30 svi5 increased from 0 43 to 0 58 on day 40 and then remained stable at 0 59 0 05 until day 150 the ags fraction which was 17 in the initial inoculum sludge increased to 61 on day 36 when svi30 was below 80 ml g 1 and then remained at 40 60 fig 2b the svi30 and svi30 svi5 remained stable during the latter part of phase g i the microscopic observations revealed that the ags produced during phase g i was mainly composed of sludge with aggregated and irregular surface structures fig 3b the period required for ags formation i e 40 days was similar to that of the previous lab scale study working volume of 4 l 22 although the feeding periods in the two studies were different owing to the use of the same up flow lv 2 m h 1 but with different working water depths in the sbrs the results indicated that operating with a high ver 100 enabled rapid ags formation on low strength municipal wastewater in the sfd sbr irrespective of the reactor scale contrastingly the formed ags had irregular surface structure and relatively smaller particle size 500 μm compared with the ags produced using sbr on volatile fatty acids vfas rich synthetic wastewater as observed in the previous study 26 this issue was considered a challenge for ags production on low strength municipal wastewater during phase g ii from day 151 the cycle operation was switched to alternately repetitions of step 1 and step 2 which presented aeration times of 240 and 40 min respectively to further improve the ags characteristics on day 172 svi30 decreased to below 40 ml g 1 and svi30 svi5 increased to 0 79 on day 176 svi30 increased and svi30 svi5 decreased however upon reducing the aeration time in step 2 to 20 min svi30 decreased to 40 ml g 1 or less and svi30 svi5 increased to a maximum of 0 84 the particle size distribution during phase g ii was similar to that on day 36 of phase g i and the ags fraction remained stable at 51 3 however the microscopic observations revealed an ags appearance with smooth surfaces and particle size of approximately 500 μm during phase g ii regardless of the aeration time in step 2 fig 3c d the sludge settleability based on svi30 and svi30 svi5 improved significantly p 0 05 from phase g i days 40 150 to phase g ii days 151 184 and phase g ii days 185 250 in addition the alternately repeating cycles of step 1 and step 2 with long and short aeration time respectively were likely effective for the production of ags with excellent settleability and morphology in a previous study high olr condition as total chemical oxygen demand tcod with continuous short cycle time 1 3 kg m 3 d 1 was proposed as the key factor for ags formation on low strength municipal wastewater in sbrs 30 however excessively high olr conditions 1 8 kg tcod m 3 d 1 can deteriorate ags properties owing to the presence of filamentous bacteria 22 the olr as tcod during phase g ii was estimated to be 1 8 kg tcod m 3 d 1 based on the olr 0 84 0 3 kg tbod m 3 d 1 and ratio of cod to bod 2 1 g g 1 in general municipal wastewater after primary sedimentation 29 therefore olr level was high enough to cause occurrence of filamentous bacteria nevertheless ags with superior properties was successfully produced by increasing the olr by alternately repeating long and short aeration times previous studies reported that slow growing pao and or gao were important for ags production and stabilization they anaerobically convert readily biodegradable organic substrates such as vfas to storage polymers 25 26 the novel sbr cycle during phase g ii could enrich anaerobic bacteria in this study which allowed the production of ags with excellent morphology and settleability previous studies on ags production from wastewater containing insoluble organic matter and low vfa concentrations in sbr reported that insoluble organic matter was adsorbed on the ags surface without sufficient hydrolysis and pao and gao did not grow sufficiently which resulted in the formation of fluffy floc like ags 26 31 32 in contrast the variations in substrate concentrations on day 204 phase g ii revealed that the produced ags presented good phosphorus removal activity fig s3 suggesting the enrichment of pao in the produced ags in sfd sbr therefore in the pilot scale sfd sbr of this study insoluble organic matter in the influent was likely hydrolyzed into readily biodegradable organic matter under short aeration time which enriched slow growing pao and gao during the following anaerobic feeding period since day 185 when the aeration time in step 2 was reduced the svi30 svi5 ratio improved fig 2a however significant improvement in sludge settleability was not observed between the former and latter halves in phase g ii svi 30 p 0 60 svi 30 svi 5 p 0 13 although large particles of approximately 500 μm were maintained during the latter half period of phase g ii the svi30 svi5 fluctuated this was possibly due to the large variations in influent concentration during the latter half period 19 92 mg toc l 1 than the former 45 96 mg toc l 1 in phase g ii therefore the instability of svi30 svi5 ratio was not because of the fragmentation of ags but due to the increase in flocculated sludge caused by the fluctuations of influent concentration further investigation is required to determine the optimum aeration time in step 2 for maintaining ags settleability the volume of withdrawn sludge increased from 0 09 0 06 to 0 11 0 04 m3 d 1 according to the olr increase from phase g i to g ii furthermore the mlss concentration increased from 3130 480 to 3720 470 mg l 1 table 2 consequently the amount of withdrawn sludge increased by approximately 50 from 0 45 0 22 kg ss d 1 to 0 67 0 14 kg ss d 1 these findings indicate that the novel sbr cycle operation used in this study was a promising strategy that enables the production of a large amount of ags with superior properties and hence can be used for augmentation 3 2 ags augmentation 3 2 1 sludge characteristics in sidestream sfd sbr during augmentation period during the augmentation period phase a i to a iv sfd sbr continued operating under the conditions applied during the latter part of phase g ii from day 483 phase a i to 529 phase a ii svi30 and svi30 svi5 varied although there was no significant change in the sludge particle size fig 4a it was likely due to the increase in floccular sludge since the larger ags was maintained fig 5a wang et al 33 reported that ags settleability deteriorated due to the decrease in srt caused by a large amount of sludge washout similarly the srt in phase a i and a ii was extremely short 4 8 0 4 d compared to that in phase g ii 8 2 2 1 d owing to the higher sludge discharge table 2 overall it is likely that an excessive amount of sludge washout leading to extremely short srt should be avoided to stabilize ags characteristics moreover the settling performance of ags produced in the sfd sbr temporarily deteriorated slightly particularly when there was a problem with blower b1 fig 1 between the days 529 541 when the blower accidentally stopped svi30 increased from 55 ml g 1 on day 528 to 86 ml g 1 on day 543 however once the blower was restored the sludge settleability rapidly improved and on day 563 svi30 and svi30 svi5 reached 41 ml g 1 and 0 78 respectively during phase a iv svi30 svi5 slightly decreased 0 58 0 07 whereas svi30 remained almost stable 54 7 ml g 1 the food to microorganisms f m ratio in phase a iii was 0 20 0 06 kg tbod kg ss 1 d 1 however it increased to 0 26 0 06 kg tbod kg ss 1 d 1 in phase a iv because of rapid increase in the tbod concentration of the influent therefore it was assumed that the accumulation of insoluble organic matters without sufficient hydrolysis in the sludge resulted in the increase of flocculant ss this suggested that the controlling the duration of aeration period to maintain a constant f m ratio is necessary to stabilize ags settleability regardless of fluctuations in organic concentration of the influent the ags fraction 211 μm was stable at 52 62 throughout the augmentation period however the proportion of ags with diameter 516 μm was higher during phase a iv 24 25 than during phase a ii 7 12 fig 4d moreover microscopic observations showed that the overall ags diameter equalized from phase a ii to a iii and showed a consequent notable increase in ags 500 μm during phase a iv fig 5a c previous studies reported that high concentrations of readily degradable organics promoted substrate penetration into the core of ags and consequently increased ags diameter 25 during phase a iv of this study the soluble bod sbod concentration increased to approximately twice that in phase a iii as sbod is mainly composed of readily biodegradable substrates the increase in sbod concentration in the influent was suggested to have caused the enlargement of ags that had been formed in the sfd sbr 3 2 2 sludge characteristics and fate of ags in mainstream reactor during the pre augmentation period phase a i svi30 and mlss concentration in the mainstream reactor were 125 155 ml g 1 and 1100 1680 mg l 1 respectively after ags augmentation started phase a ii svi30 decreased to 71 ml g 1 on day 525 fig 4b and rn increased to 27 on day 520 fig 4c due to low olr the mlss concentration remained at 1380 150 mg l 1 without notable changes until day 528 ags fraction in the mainstream reactor increased to 24 on day 506 phase a ii and remained stable until day 553 fig 4d this suggested the retention of augmented ags in the mainstream reactor on day 522 microscopic observations revealed the presence of not only flocculant sludge derived from the seeded as but also ags with particle size of 200 μm that was likely derived from the augmented ags fig 5d and e however ags with diameter 500 μm supplied from sfd sbr fig 5a was not microscopically observed in the mainstream reactor fig 5e and the detection amount was also low during measurement of particle size distribution fig 4d verawaty et al 34 suggested that the ags diameter was determined by the balance between the particle reduction attributed to fragmentation and attrition and ags growth in the reactor in addition de kreuk and van loosdrecht 25 reported that the increase in concentration of readily biodegradable organics in the bulk liquid under anaerobic conditions can promote substrate penetration into the ags core leading to the formation of ags the mainstream reactor in this study was operated in a mixed state hence the concentration of organics in the mainstream anaerobic tank was likely lower than that in the bulk liquid of the sfd sbr into which influent was introduced onto settled ags as plug flow therefore results indicated that the ags growth rate was lower than its fragmentation and attrition rates in the mainstream reactor under low olr conditions which led to the reduction of ags with large particle size 500 μm on days 529 541 when blower b1 presented a problem and ags augmentation ceased rn decreased to 10 day 541 and the mlss concentration increased owing to the increased olr and continuous sludge withdrawal in the mainstream in addition svi30 increased slightly but remained at 94 3 ml g 1 during phase a iii in which the operation of sidestream sfd sbr resumed and the flow rate to the mainstream increased stepwise rn remained constant until day 569 thereafter rn increased with the decrease in mlss concentration and reached 20 on day 580 while svi30 decreased to 80 ml g 1 on day 582 when rn increased to 20 the ags fraction reached 33 fig 4d and ags with 200 μm including smaller particles with 100 μm were observed along with the flocculant sludge fig 5f during phase a iv olr increased rapidly owing to the variation in the influent concentrations simultaneously the mlss concentration increased reaching 2500 mg l 1 on day 601 and stabilized at 2200 240 mg l 1 fig 4b the svi30 also increased slightly but remained at 90 7 ml g 1 rn decreased with increasing olr and mlss concentration and remained at 9 2 0 4 fig 4c the ags fraction increased notably reaching 59 on day 602 after that the ags fraction remained at above 50 despite the decrease in rn fig 4c in addition while the ags fraction with diameter 516 μm was 3 during phase a ii it increased to 11 on day 665 most of the sludge observed in phase a iv were granule like particles with diameter smaller than the ags produced in sidestream sfd sbr and with higher density than the seeded flocculant as fig 5g these results suggested that the ags grew in the mainstream reactor owing to the decrease in the rate of ags fragmentation and or the increase in the growth rate of fragmented ags in previous studies the following three factors were identified as key promoters of ags growth 1 selective pressure to favorably retain fast settling biomass e g excessively high sor in secondary clarifier or sludge withdrawal with hydrocyclone 2 aeration shear stress to form a biofilm with smooth and compact morphology and 3 high anaerobic f m ratio to promote the penetration of readily biodegradable organic matter into ags core 20 in this study the sludge withdrawal from mainstream reactor was conducted in a mixed state from the aerobic tank and the sor in the secondary clarifier was 1 m h 1 table 2 which was within the range indicated in the design guides for secondary clarifiers in japan 27 consequently the ss concentrations in effluents were maintained at low levels therefore selective pressure for fast settling biomass was not effective in addition based on the gas sparging rate to mainstream aerobic tank the mean gas velocity was estimated as maximum of 0 1 cm sec 1 this value was substantially lower than 1 cm sec 1 which has been suggested as effective shear stress for ags formation by previous studies 1 35 in contrast the f m ratio based on sbod in the anaerobic tank during phase a iv 0 31 0 09 kg sbod kg ss 1 d 1 was substantially higher than that during phase a iii 0 18 0 06 kg sbod kg ss 1 d 1 therefore these results suggested that increase in the concentration of readily biodegradable organic matter in the anaerobic tank accelerated the increase in particle size owing to substrate permeation into the ags this led to the growth of fragmented ags in the mainstream reactor consequently the fraction of granule like sludge increased and the high ags fraction was retained 3 2 3 wastewater treatment performance in mainstream table 3 summarizes the wastewater treatment performance in the mainstream reactor during the augmentation period during the phases a i to a iii the mean tbod in the effluent was 5 mg l 1 and an excellent tbod removal of 93 was maintained during phase a iv tbod concentration in the effluent increased slightly 4 8 2 6 mg l 1 this was likely caused by the increase in ss concentration of the effluents owing to higher inflow into the mainstream however the overall treatment performance did not notably deteriorate 94 4 of tbod removal throughout the augmentation period nh4 removal was maintained at 97 with an nh4 effluent concentration of 1 mg n l 1 almost complete nitrification was achieved even during phase a iv 98 1 of nh4 removal when the water temperature was the lowest 15 22 c owing to the sufficient srt of 13 3 d in the mainstream reactor although the tn concentrations in the effluent increased slightly during phase a iv 11 8 2 5 mg n l 1 compared to phase a ii 9 1 1 7 mg n l 1 tn removal did not vary significantly p 0 30 regardless of olrs the tp removal performance improved slightly but not significantly during phase a iv compared to phase a ii table 3 tp concentration in effluents p 0 14 tp removal ratio p 0 17 the improvement in the treatment performance of the mainstream by ags augmentation primarily depended on the retention of supplied ags and the consequent maintenance of high mlss concentrations by the improved settleability of the overall sludge including suspended as and ags in this study the relative abundance of the theoretical remaining ags rn and svi30 during ags augmentation were linked fig 4b c during phase a iv which included 40 shorter hrt and twice higher olr compared to the designed operating conditions phase a i table 3 the ags fraction in mainstream increased and svi30 stabilized at 100 ml g 1 regardless of the olr variation therefore the augmentation of ags from sfd sbr contributed to the stabilization of sludge settleability in the mainstream reactor consequently the mlss concentration in the mainstream reactor increased to 2500 mg l 1 therefore results of this study indicated that the ags augmentation strategy presented a superior treatment performance even under high olr conditions and short hrts in the continuous flow municipal wastewater treatment process 4 conclusions this study reported a pilot scale demonstration of the ags augmentation strategy applied to a continuous flow as process for the treatment of low strength municipal wastewater in the sidestream sfd sbr for ags production the novel operating cycle of alternately repeated steps with short and long aeration times contributed to ags production with superior characteristics and 50 increase in the production rate in the mainstream continuous flow as operation where ags was augmented the sludge settleability improved with increasing ags retention in addition ags growth was confirmed under high olr conditions the improvement of settleability and retention of relatively high mlss concentrations by the increasing ags fraction in the mainstream led to sustained superior wastewater treatment performance despite notable olr variations these findings demonstrated the practical usefulness of ags augmentation strategy in wwtps that received low strength municipal wastewater in the future full

impact of sgv on granulation under micro carriers enhancement was comparatively evaluated by keeping sgv at 0 6 cm s r1 and 1 2 cm s r2 respectively results showed that sludge granulation and nutrient removal performance was greatly enhanced by micro carriers under low sgv however microorganisms were suppressed inside micro carriers under high sgv although the extracellular polymeric substances eps contents in r2 were higher the gas holdup in r2 was 1 32 times higher than traditional ags system resulting in excessive collision and velocity field difference overall addition of micro carriers could compensate the hsf under low sgv which is of great significant in reducing the energy consumption of ags system graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aerobic granular sludge micro carrier

become a promising wastewater treatment technology due to its excellent settling ability high pollutants removal capacity and low carbon footprint 1 as a special biofilm which is not limited by the specific surface area of carriers ags system could reduce up to 75 space and 50 energy consumption compared with conventional activated sludge cas process and integrated fixed film activated sludge

including adjusting selection pressures 5 optimizing reactor configuration 6 dosing micro carriers 7 and regulating microbial quorum sensing 8 etc among selection pressures hydraulic shear force hsf was considered as an essential factor for sludge granulation 9 high hsf can increase the collision chance of flocs stimulate the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps and thus promote

complexity of hsf calculation in gas liquid solid system hsf in ags system was usually represented by superficial gas velocity sgv evidence showed that ags could be successfully cultivated when sgv was higher than 1 2 cm s but only when sgv was higher than 1 6 cm s long term stability of granules could be achieved which is the main energy consumption of ags system 12 dosing micro carriers is another way to enhance aerobic sludge granulation it has been reported that the ags systems enhanced by micro carriers could be started up quickly and run stably in widely adverse environment such as low strength sewage refractory wastewater and low temperature 13 15 evidences have shown that the micro carriers including magnet powder granular activated carbon biochar etc played as crystal nucleus at the early stage of granulation and as inert core in mature ags which could accelerate the start up process and strengthen the granular structure at the same time 13 16 17 besides zhou et al 18 reported that micro carriers had an effect on the velocity field of ags system when the velocity field of micro carriers was close to that of flocs sludge granulation process could be promoted however most of the relevant studies were conducted under constant sgv the effect of micro carriers on ags system under different sgv is still unclear as far as we know which needs further research in this study two ags sbr reactors with high density polyurethane sponges pus as micro carriers were operated under low 0 6 cm s r1 and high 1 2 cm s r2 sgv respectively the dynamics of sludge morphology and pollutants removal efficiencies in the two reactors were characterized and compared throughout the experiments the production and distribution of eps and the characteristics of microbial community structure were also detected and compared by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm and high throughput sequencing technique respectively to explore the effect of micro carriers on sludge granulation under different sgv 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of micro carriers pus was applied as micro carriers in this study which was purchased from yong sheng trade co nanjing china with an open porosity of over 99 an average pore size of 150 μm a specific surface area of 9 0 m2 g and a specific gravity of 30 kg m3 before dosing into reactors pus was firstly cut into 2 0 0 5 mm micro cubes to fitting the optimal granule size and then washed three times with acetone ethanol and deionized water under ultrasound after drying in an oven at 60 c pus was fully mixed with seed sludge under sub atmospheric pressure environment for 2 h to overcome the hydrophobic effect which may lead to the inability of pus to fluidize and precipitate due to excessive bubbles trapped inside 2 2 reactors operation two cylindrical sbr reactors with 3 l working volume and 7 cm internal diameter as described in xu et al 19 were applied in this experiment the operation temperature was kept at 20 c by a water jacket compressed air was introduced from the bottom of reactors and the gas fluxes were controlled at 90 l h and 180 l h by glass rotor gas flowmeters keeping the sgv at 0 6 cm s and 1 2 cm s respectively the operation cycle was controlled by real time control system and the wastewater inlet aeration settling and effluent discharge periods were kept at 60 min 112 min 3 min and 5 min the drainage ratio was 50 resulting in a hydraulic residence time hrt of 6 h since phosphorus removal efficiency was not considered sludge residence time srt was not actively controlled seeding sludge was collected from the back flow of the secondary sedimentation tank of wenchang wastewater treatment plant in harbin china after mixing with the pus mentioned above 0 6 l mixtures were added to the reactors resulting in 20 of filling ratio and 4000 mg l of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss synthetic wastewater contained 400 mg l of chemical oxygen demand cod and 50 mg l of ammonium nitrogen nh4 n was prepared to simulate domestic wastewater according to beun 20 sodium acetate naac and ammonium chloride nh4cl were applied as the only carbon source and nitrogen source other compositions were 0

ph of synthetic wastewater at 7 2 0 2 2 3 analysis methods parameters including cod nh4 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and mlss were measured regularly according to the standard

measured by sieving method according to laguna et al 23 loosely bounded eps lb eps and tightly bounded eps tb eps were extracted using thermal method 24 and the total amount of eps was obtained by the sum of lb eps and tb eps the contents of polysaccharide ps and protein pn were measured using phenol sulphuric acid method 25 and modified lowry method 26 respectively the macro morphology of ags was obtained by stereomicroscope tm 2m45 b2 the microbial community structure was obtained by high throughput technology which was conducted on the illumina miseq platform by majorbio company shanghai china analyzing steps of the obtained sequence were referred to xu et al 15 2 4 gas holdup the gas holdup was introduced to identify the effect of micro carriers on flow regime 27 experiments were conducted in two reactors one was seeded with activated sludge to simulate the start up state of traditional ags systems for comparison the other one was filled with activated sludge and micro carriers 20 filling ratio the sgv was varied from 0 2 to 1 5 cm s and the gas holdup ε g could be calculated by the following formula ε g h a h o h a where h a is the aerated liquid level h o is the original liquid level 2 5 confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm confocal laser scanning of mature ags was conducted to investigate the distribution of microbial cells and eps by florescence labeling technology the staining and scanning steps were referred to chen et al 28 the details of dyes are syto 63 cells ex em of 633 650 700 fluoresceinisothiocyanate fitc proteins ex em of 488 500 550 calcofluor white β d glucopyranose polysaccharides ex em of 400 410 480 all of the dyes were purchased from thermo fisher scientific usa the scanning was carried out on clsm lsm710 carl zeiss germany 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation of aerobic granules in the previous study aerobic sludge granulation enhanced by micro carriers under 0 8 cm s sgv has been investigated 29 it can be found that granules could be successfully cultivated in 60 d with a tn removal efficiency of 83 for comparison in this study the morphologies of pus and sludge and the concentration of mlss in r1 and r2 were detected regularly the results showed that pus enhanced granulation process could be divided into three phases the first phase was from day 0 10 in which seeding sludge was rather intercepted in pus or screening out with effluent due to the short settling time the difference of sgv made the amount of sludge intercepted in reactors obviously different as shown in fig s1 in r1 the sludge concentration in pus gradually increased from outside to inside while in r2 the sludge distribution in pus was relatively uniform and the compactness was higher this might be caused by the resistance of pus skeletons and the different hydraulic scour under low sgv the hydraulic scour was insufficient to offset the resistance of sludge flocs in pus so that external flocs could not be squeezed inward a large amount free flocs was washed out with the effluent in r1 and the concentration of mlss decreased to 2 15 g l at the end of this phase after that free flocs were basically washed out from the reactors and the operation entered the second phase day 10 30 during this period microorganisms gradually proliferated and filled to the full of pus there was no obvious change in the shape of pus but it should be noticed that the compactness of pus in r2 was significantly higher than that in r1 besides the time taken for microorganisms in r2 to completely fill pus was also about 5 days shorter probably due to the higher trapped biomass the third phase was from day 30 45 in which pus in both reactors gradually turned into spherical granules with obviously different morphology as shown in fig 1 granules in r1 were formed by taking pus as inert cores microbials could successfully colonize outside the pus the times taken for granules formation in r1 was over 10 d shorter than the system operated under 0 8 cm s sgv 29 however there was no external amplification occurred in r2 the habitat of microorganisms was strictly limited inside the pus besides the average diameter of granules in r2 decreased to 1 2 mm 0 9 mm smaller than that in r1 indicating that the spherical appearance of granules in r2 might be caused by collision wear under high sgv which may lead to microplastics leakage threatening environmental security after that both reactors entered maturation phase no obvious changes occurred and the concentration of mlss in r1 and r2 stabilized at 6 5 0 3 g l and 6 2 0 5 g l respectively to further identify the effect of micro carriers on granulation process gas holdup ε g under different sgv was investigated the obtained data were fitted linearly and the results are shown in fig 2 it can be seen that ε g is proportional to sgv in both reactors but the proportional coefficient was different when there were no micro carriers dosed ε g 4 516 sgv r2 0 998 when there were micro carriers dosed ε g 5 967 sgv r2 0 999 in other words the micro carriers dosing could induce 1 32 times higher ε g it has been reported that the ε g is a global fluid dynamic factor which determines the mean residence time of gas and in combination with the size distribution of gas the interfacial area for the rate of interfacial heat and mass transfer 27 besides the addition of microparticles may change the density and viscosity of the mixture and influence the coalescence of bubbles 30 in this study the increasing of ε g suggests that the addition of micro carriers might lead to the breakage of bubbles and increase the residence time of gas which has an impact on flow regime the velocity field difference might be another reason for this result as described by zhou et al 18 velocity field difference between micro carriers and flocs was the main factor that determining the ability of micro carriers to promote sludge granulation when sgv was constant the velocity field difference increased with the size of micro carriers which is unfavorable for granulation enhancing fan et al 31 also reported that when granule size was 0 2 mm the flow regime in reactors was only associated with sgv when granule size was 0 5 mm the relative velocity of granules and liquid was proportional to sgv and granule size which is directly related to hydraulic shear force hsf in this study the size of pus was 2 mm 0 5 mm therefore hsf of pus was much greater than that of flocs similarly hsf of pus in r2 was also much greater than that of r1 as a result when sgv was insufficient the addition of micro carriers compensated for the lack of hsf however when sgv was sufficient the addition of micro carriers led to excessive hsf and velocity field difference which inhibited the colonization of microorganisms on the surface of pus 3 2 characteristics of eps eps is an important indicator for biofilm formation and sludge granulation which could not only protect microorganisms from adverse environments but also keep microorganisms tightly connected 32 in order to identify the effect of sgv on eps secretion in micro carriers enhanced ags the pn and ps contents and pn ps ratio were investigated as shown in fig 3 the contents of pn and ps in seed sludge were 46 3 and 18 4 mg gmlss respectively during the first 10 d in r1 ps content was closely to that of seed sludge and pn content slightly increased to 49 2 mg gmlss probably due to that the protection of pus prevented microorganisms from direct contact with hydraulic shear after that the increasing rate of pn and ps contents in r1 began to speed up reaching 94 1 and 34 3 mg gmlss at the end of operation in r2 the increasing rate of pn and ps contents was higher than r1 especially pn which increased to 138 9 mg gmlss at day 60 this phenomenon was consistent with the study of adav et al 33 in which the secretion of protein like eps was greatly improved while the aeration intensity increased from 1 0 to 3 0 l min the increased pn ps ratio was considered as an important granulation indicator in many studies 34 35 however in present study although the increasing rate of pn ps ratio in r2 was higher than r1 the granulation process showed contrast performance indicating that ps might play a more important role in micro carriers enhanced ags fig 4 exhibits the distribution of microbial cells pn and β ps in granules at day 60 it can be seen that the microbial cells distribution in r1 was relatively uniform excepted for the cavity structure in the center of granules which might be caused by long term nutritional deficiency under high mass transfer limitation 36 this phenomenon was consistent with the spatial distributions of pn and β ps which were mainly concentrated in the outer layer of granules indicating that the inner part of pn and β ps might have been degraded by microbials for metabolism as described by chen et al 37 pn was the filler in eps matrix while β ps played as skeletons when the degradation rate of eps inside ags exceeds the secretion rate cavity structure will be formed and granules will soon disintegrate under hsf however in this study granules in r1 maintained stable until the end of experiment indicating that the addition of micro carriers could improve the structure stability of ags it should be noticed that the fluorescence intensity of pn in r2 was much higher than that in r1 which was consistent with pn content as mentioned above besides the distribution of microbial cells pn and β ps in r2 did not show consistency suggesting that the high pn contents not only increased the compactness of granules but also occupied the living space of microbials which might be adverse for substrate transfer and pollutants removal 3 3 nutrient removal performance the nutrient removal efficiencies under different sgv were detected regularly throughout the experiments cod removal efficiency in both reactors reached over 90 within 5 d and kept stable until the end of experiment data not shown in terms of nitrogen removal as shown in fig 5 it can be seen that effluent nh4 n concentration in r1 increased during the first 5 d as a result of the loss of inoculation sludge after that the activity of ammonium oxidation bacteria aob restored rapidly and the nh4 n removal efficiency reached 99 1 at 17th day and then kept stable in the following time accumulation of no2 n occurred alongside with the increase of ammonium oxidation rate aor which increased to 13 8 mgn l at day 14 with an accumulation rate of 28 9 soon after that nitrite oxidation rate nor increased gradually with the accumulation of no3 n from day 41 the nitrogen removal process entered a stable state with a tn removal efficiency of 89 5 6 5 higher than the system operated under 0 8 cm s sgv 29 different from r1 effluent nh4 n concentration in r2 decreased rapidly at the beginning of operation which reached below 5 mg l within 9 d 5 d earlier than r1 the higher concentration of trapped seeding sludge and higher do concentration caused by sgv might be the main reasons for this result it should also be noticed that when no2 n accumulation disappeared in r2 the effluent no3 n concentration increased rapidly which reached 13 15 mg l within 5 d resulting in 12 reduction of tn removal efficiency to further identify the effect of sgv on nitrogen removal the nutrients conversion progresses and the dynamics of do during typical cycle at phase iv were detected as shown in fig 5c d do concentration in r1 decreased rapidly in feeding time which reached below 0 5 mg l within 10 min in r2 the time for do concentration reaching 0 5 mg l was 5 min longer revealing a lower do consumption rate in r2 the high mass transfer limitation caused by high structural compactness in agb r2 might be the main reason for this phenomenon cod concentration in both reactors reduced rapidly at this stage indicating that the carbon source could be mostly consumed by anaerobic or facultative anaerobic microorganisms during aeration stage the trend of do concentration in reactors showed obviously difference in r1 do concentration increased from 0 4 to 6 3 mg l within 30 min after that do concentration entered a gentle phase and slowly increased to 6 6 mg l until the end of aeration by comparison the rising rate of do concentration in r2 was much higher which increased to 6 1 mg l within 20 min then the rising rate decreased to about 0 07 mgo2 min until do concentration reached 8 2 mg l thereafter the do concentration entered stable phase and the final value was 8 5 mg l different do performance had little effect on aor for nh4 n in both reactors could be fully removed within 100 min of aeration however the high do concentration led to a high nor which caused the no3 n accumulation rate of r2 2 6 times higher than that of r1 it is noteworthy that the proportions of traditional anaerobic denitrification in tn removal process at feeding stage were only 4 4 and 11 4 respectively suggesting that the denitrifying phosphate accumulating organisms dpao or denitrifying glycogen accumulating organisms dgao might play as the main force for tn removal in both reactors this might be due to the upward pushing flow feeding mode when influent carbon source was absorbed by microbials the retained no3 n was pushed upward by feeding flow therefore preventing from being reduced however at the beginning of aeration granules were soon mixed with no3 n before do concentration rising which provided a favorable environment for the enrichment of dpao and dgao 38 3 4 characteristics of microbial community high throughput sequencing was conducted to identify the differences in microbial community succession between r1 and r2 it can be seen that the values of chao1 shannon and simpson indexes in r1 and r2 at day 60 were close to that of seed table s2 in the previous study the chao1 index and shannon index at day 70 in the system operated under the same conditions but without micro carriers enhancement were only 523 and 4 14 indicating that pus addition during granulation could improve the microbial richness and diversity in ags systems under different sgv 39 fig 6a shows the relative abundance of main phyla top 10 in different samples compared to seed most phyla in r1 and r2 showed similar succession trends besides of nitrospirae and planctomycetes which decreased from 2 45 and 1 03 in seed to 0 24 and 0 94 in r1 but increased to 3 44 and 1 65 in r2 proteobacteria was the most abundant bacteria in all samples which increased from 42 08 seed to 56 02 r1 and 51 64 r2 respectively another microorganism with an increased proportion was bacteroidetes which increased from 21 32 seed to 26 80 r1 and 26 95 r2 in addition to these the relative abundance of 6 phyla including chloroflexi acidobacteria patescibacteria actinobacteria firmicutes and verrucomicrobia showed a downward trend especially actinobacteria which decreased from 5 34 seed to 0 42 r1 and 0 31 r2 indicating that filamentous bacteria might play a less role in micro carriers enhanced ags this consequence was contrary to traditional sludge granulation process in which filamentous bacteria was considered as structural skeleton for granules 40 in present study pus could play as colonies and inert skeletons weakened the status of filamentous bacteria at genus level the microbial community structure top 15 genera in r1 and r2 exhibited significant differences as shown in the fisher s exact test bar plot fig 6b p value 0 001 candidatus competibacter was the most abundant genus in both reactors which increased from 0 01 seed to 10 11 r1 and 8 78 r2 as a typical dgao candidatus competibacter has the ability of converting carbon sources into glycogen under anaerobic condition and denitrifying by decomposing glycogen under anoxic condition 38 besides candidatus competibacter was also identified as an important role in granulation by affecting the secretion of extracellular ps and favoring the establishment of complex microbial community 41 due to the lower do rising rate other dpao and dgao including dechloromonas 42 candidatus accumulibacter 43 and flavobacterium 44 were also got more enriched in r1 this result also provided an explanation for the high aerobic denitrifying rate in r1 nitrospira 0 24 in r1 and 3 44 in r2 might be another reason for the different nitrogen removal performance which induced different nor and denitrifying restriction in the two reactors enrichment of genus dokdonella showed a positive correlation with sgv which increased from 1 83 seed to 4 69 r1 and 7 41 r2 respectively it has been reported that dokdonella is a kind of aerobic denitrifiers but its preferred nitrogen removal pathway has not been identified 45 the higher relative abundance of dokdonella in r2 suggests its tightly relationship with no3 n which is contrary to the results obtained by wang et al 46 it should be noticed that genus norank f saprospiraceae which belonged to family saprospiraceae also occupied a dominant position in both reactors 4 82 in r1 and 5 41 in r2 as described by guo et al 47 this family could degrade pn by secreting extracellular enzymes which might favor the enrichment of dokdonella by providing necessary organic carbon for its metabolism during aeration phase 4 conclusion the effect of sgv on the performance of micro carriers pus enhanced ags system was investigated in this study the results demonstrated that pus could accelerate aerobic granulation process under low sgv 0 6 cm s although high sgv 1 2 cm s favored the interception of seed sludge and stimulated the secretion of eps excessive collision and velocity field difference under high sgv were considered as the main reasons for this phenomenon in r1 β ps was more concentrated in the outer layer of granules maintaining structural stability together with pus even when cavity structure occurred nob and aerobic denitrifiers were more enriched in r2 but dgao and dpao were more enriched in r1 resulting in 13 higher tn removal efficiency these findings suggest that micro carriers could enhance the granulation process by hsf compensation therefore reducing the energy consumption of ags system declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this research was supported

shorter probably due to the higher trapped biomass the third phase was from day 30 45 in which pus in both reactors gradually turned into spherical granules with obviously different morphology as shown in fig 1 granules in r1 were formed by taking pus as inert cores microbials could successfully colonize outside the pus the times taken for granules formation in r1 was over 10 d shorter than the system operated under 0 8 cm s sgv 29 however there was no external amplification occurred in r2 the habitat of microorganisms was strictly limited inside the pus besides the average diameter of granules in r2 decreased to 1 2 mm 0 9 mm smaller than that in r1 indicating that the spherical appearance of granules in r2 might be caused by collision wear under high sgv which may lead to microplastics leakage threatening environmental security after that both reactors entered maturation phase no obvious changes occurred and the concentration of mlss in r1 and r2 stabilized at 6 5 0 3 g l and 6 2 0 5 g l respectively to further identify the effect of micro carriers on granulation process gas holdup ε g under different sgv was investigated the obtained data were fitted linearly and the results are shown in fig 2 it can be seen that ε g is proportional to sgv in both reactors but the proportional coefficient was different when there were no micro carriers dosed ε g 4 516 sgv r2 0 998 when there were micro carriers dosed ε g 5 967 sgv r2 0 999 in other words the micro carriers dosing could induce 1 32 times higher ε g it has been reported that the ε g is a global fluid dynamic factor which determines the mean residence time of gas and in combination with the size distribution of gas the interfacial area for the rate of interfacial heat and mass transfer 27 besides the addition of microparticles may change the density and viscosity of the mixture and influence the coalescence of bubbles 30 in this study the increasing of ε g suggests that the addition of micro carriers might lead to the breakage of bubbles and increase the residence time of gas which has an impact on flow regime the velocity field difference might be another reason for this result as described by zhou et al 18 velocity field difference between micro carriers and flocs was the main factor that determining the ability of micro carriers to promote sludge granulation when sgv was constant the velocity field difference increased with the size of micro carriers which is unfavorable for granulation enhancing fan et al 31 also reported that when granule size was 0 2 mm the flow regime in reactors was only associated with sgv when granule size was 0 5 mm the relative velocity of granules and liquid was proportional to sgv and granule size which is directly related to hydraulic shear force hsf in this study the size of pus was 2 mm 0 5 mm therefore hsf of pus was much greater than that of flocs similarly hsf of pus in r2 was also much greater than that of r1 as a result when sgv was insufficient the addition of micro carriers compensated for the lack of hsf however when sgv was sufficient the addition of micro carriers led to excessive hsf and velocity field difference which inhibited the colonization of microorganisms on the surface of pus 3 2 characteristics of eps eps is an important indicator for biofilm formation and sludge granulation which could not only protect microorganisms from adverse environments but also keep microorganisms tightly connected 32 in order to identify the effect of sgv on eps secretion in micro carriers enhanced ags the pn and ps contents and pn ps ratio were investigated as shown in fig 3 the contents of pn and ps in seed sludge were 46 3 and 18 4 mg gmlss respectively during the first 10 d in r1 ps content was closely to that of seed sludge and pn content slightly increased to 49 2 mg gmlss probably due to that the protection of pus prevented microorganisms from direct contact with hydraulic shear after that the increasing rate of pn and ps contents in r1 began to speed up reaching 94 1 and 34 3 mg gmlss at the end of operation in r2 the increasing rate of pn and ps contents was higher than r1 especially pn which increased to 138 9 mg gmlss at day 60 this phenomenon was consistent with the study of adav et al 33 in which the secretion of protein like eps was greatly improved while the aeration intensity increased from 1 0 to 3 0 l min the increased pn ps ratio was considered as an important granulation indicator in many studies 34 35 however in present study although the increasing rate of pn ps ratio in r2 was higher than r1 the granulation process showed contrast performance indicating that ps might play a more important role in micro carriers enhanced ags fig 4 exhibits the distribution of microbial cells pn and β ps in granules at day 60 it can be seen that the microbial cells distribution in r1 was relatively uniform excepted for the cavity structure in the center of granules which might be caused by long term nutritional deficiency under high mass transfer limitation 36 this phenomenon was consistent with the spatial distributions of pn and β ps which were mainly concentrated in the outer layer of granules indicating that the inner part of pn and β ps might have been degraded by microbials for metabolism as described by chen et al 37 pn was the filler in eps matrix while β ps played as skeletons when the degradation rate of eps inside ags exceeds the secretion rate cavity structure will be formed and granules will soon disintegrate under hsf however in this study granules in r1 maintained stable until the end of experiment indicating that the addition of micro carriers could improve the structure stability of ags it should be noticed that the fluorescence intensity of pn in r2 was much higher than that in r1 which was consistent with pn content as mentioned above besides the distribution of microbial cells pn and β ps in r2 did not show consistency suggesting that the high pn contents not only increased the compactness of granules but also occupied the living space of microbials which might be adverse for substrate transfer and pollutants removal 3 3 nutrient removal performance the nutrient removal efficiencies under different sgv were detected regularly throughout the experiments cod removal efficiency in both reactors reached over 90 within 5 d and kept stable until the end of experiment data not shown in terms of nitrogen removal as shown in fig 5 it can be seen that effluent nh4 n concentration in r1 increased during the first 5 d as a result of the loss of inoculation sludge after that the activity of ammonium oxidation bacteria aob restored rapidly and the nh4 n removal efficiency reached 99 1 at 17th day and then kept stable in the following time accumulation of no2 n occurred alongside with the increase of ammonium oxidation rate aor which increased to 13 8 mgn l at day 14 with an accumulation rate of 28 9 soon after that nitrite oxidation rate nor increased gradually with the accumulation of no3 n from day 41 the nitrogen removal process entered a stable state with a tn removal efficiency of 89 5 6 5 higher than the system operated under 0 8 cm s sgv 29 different from r1 effluent nh4 n concentration in r2 decreased rapidly at the beginning of operation which reached below 5 mg l within 9 d 5 d earlier than r1 the higher concentration of trapped seeding sludge and higher do concentration caused by sgv might be the main reasons for this result it should also be noticed that when no2 n accumulation disappeared in r2 the effluent no3 n concentration increased rapidly which reached 13 15 mg l within 5 d resulting in 12 reduction of tn removal efficiency to further identify the effect of sgv on nitrogen removal the nutrients conversion progresses and the dynamics of do during typical cycle at phase iv were detected as shown in fig 5c d do concentration in r1 decreased rapidly in feeding time which reached below 0 5 mg l within 10 min in r2 the time for do concentration reaching 0 5 mg l was 5 min longer revealing a lower do consumption rate in r2 the high mass transfer limitation caused by high structural compactness in agb r2 might be the main reason for this phenomenon cod concentration in both reactors reduced rapidly at this stage indicating that the carbon source could be mostly consumed by anaerobic or facultative anaerobic microorganisms during aeration stage the trend of do concentration in reactors showed obviously difference in r1 do concentration increased from 0 4 to 6 3 mg l within 30 min after that do concentration entered a gentle phase and slowly increased to 6 6 mg l until the end of aeration by comparison the rising rate of do concentration in r2 was much higher which increased to 6 1 mg l within 20 min then the rising rate decreased to about 0 07 mgo2 min until do concentration reached 8 2 mg l thereafter the do concentration entered stable phase and the final value was 8 5 mg l different do performance had little effect on aor for nh4 n in both reactors could be fully removed within 100 min of aeration however the high do concentration led to a high nor which caused the no3 n accumulation rate of r2 2 6 times higher than that of r1 it is noteworthy that the proportions of traditional anaerobic denitrification in tn removal process at feeding stage were only 4 4 and 11 4 respectively suggesting that the denitrifying phosphate accumulating organisms dpao or denitrifying glycogen accumulating organisms dgao might play as the main force for tn removal in both reactors this might be due to the upward pushing flow feeding mode when influent carbon source was absorbed by microbials the retained no3 n was pushed upward by feeding flow therefore preventing from being reduced however at the beginning of aeration granules were soon mixed with no3 n before do concentration rising which provided a favorable environment for the enrichment of dpao and dgao 38 3 4 characteristics of microbial community high throughput sequencing was conducted to identify the differences in microbial community succession between r1 and r2 it can be seen that the values of chao1 shannon and simpson indexes in r1 and r2 at day 60 were close to that of seed table s2 in the previous study the chao1 index and shannon index at day 70 in the system operated under the same conditions but without micro carriers enhancement were only 523 and 4 14 indicating that pus addition during granulation could improve the microbial richness and diversity in ags systems under different sgv 39 fig 6a shows the relative abundance of main phyla top 10 in different samples compared to seed most phyla in r1 and r2 showed similar succession trends besides of nitrospirae and planctomycetes which decreased from 2 45 and 1 03 in seed to 0 24 and 0 94 in r1 but increased to 3 44 and 1 65 in r2 proteobacteria was the most abundant bacteria in all samples which increased from 42 08 seed to 56 02 r1 and 51 64 r2 respectively another microorganism with an increased proportion was bacteroidetes which increased from 21 32 seed to 26 80 r1 and 26 95 r2 in addition to these the relative abundance of 6 phyla including chloroflexi acidobacteria patescibacteria actinobacteria firmicutes and verrucomicrobia showed a downward trend especially actinobacteria which decreased from 5 34 seed to 0 42 r1 and 0 31 r2 indicating that filamentous bacteria might play a less role in micro carriers enhanced ags this consequence was contrary to traditional sludge granulation process in which filamentous bacteria was considered as structural skeleton for granules 40 in present study pus could play as colonies and inert skeletons weakened the status of filamentous bacteria at genus level the microbial community structure top 15 genera in r1 and r2 exhibited significant differences as shown in the fisher s exact test bar plot fig 6b p value 0 001 candidatus competibacter was the most abundant genus in both reactors which increased from 0 01 seed to 10 11 r1 and 8 78 r2 as a typical dgao candidatus competibacter has the ability of converting carbon sources into glycogen under anaerobic condition and denitrifying by decomposing glycogen under anoxic condition 38 besides candidatus competibacter was also identified as an important role in granulation by affecting the secretion of extracellular ps and favoring the establishment of complex microbial community 41 due to the lower do rising rate other dpao and dgao including dechloromonas 42 candidatus accumulibacter 43 and flavobacterium 44 were also got more enriched in r1 this result also provided an explanation for the high aerobic denitrifying rate in r1 nitrospira 0 24 in r1 and 3 44 in r2 might be another reason for the different nitrogen removal performance which induced different nor and denitrifying restriction in the two reactors enrichment of genus dokdonella showed a positive correlation with sgv which increased from 1 83 seed to 4 69 r1 and 7 41 r2 respectively it has been reported that dokdonella is a kind of aerobic denitrifiers but its preferred nitrogen removal pathway has not been identified 45 the higher relative abundance of dokdonella in r2 suggests its tightly relationship with no3 n which is contrary to the results obtained by wang et al 46 it should be noticed that genus norank f saprospiraceae which belonged to family saprospiraceae also occupied a dominant position in both reactors 4 82 in r1 and 5 41 in r2 as described by guo et al 47 this family could degrade pn by secreting extracellular enzymes which might favor the enrichment of dokdonella by providing necessary organic carbon for its metabolism during aeration phase 4 conclusion the effect of sgv on the performance of micro carriers pus enhanced ags system was investigated in this study the results demonstrated that pus could accelerate aerobic granulation process under low sgv 0 6 cm s although high sgv 1 2 cm s favored the interception of seed sludge and stimulated the secretion of eps excessive collision and velocity field difference under high sgv were considered as the main reasons for this phenomenon in r1 β ps was more concentrated in the outer layer of granules maintaining structural stability together with pus even when cavity structure occurred nob and aerobic denitrifiers were more enriched in r2 but dgao and dpao were more enriched in r1 resulting in 13 higher tn removal efficiency these findings suggest that micro carriers could enhance the granulation process by hsf compensation therefore reducing the energy consumption of ags system declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this research was supported

12653,three dimensional porous benzimidazole and benzoxazole linked polymers were successfully prepared through a one pot method using benzol 1 2 4 5 tetramintetrahydrochlorid btd and 2 5 diamino 1 4 benzediol dihydrochloride dbd to react with 4 tris 4 formyl phenyl methyl benzaldehyde tfpm respectively according to nitrogen sorption analysis tfpm btd and tfpm dbd possessed specific surface areas of 612 60 and 524 90 m2 g and the total pore volumes vtot of 1 44 and 1 15 cm3 g respectively batch adsorption experiments demonstrated that gd iii adsorption processes by tfpm btd and tfpm dbd fit well with the langmuir isotherm and the pseudo second order kinetic model at 25 c and ph level of 6 tfpm btd showed a much higher adsorption capacity for gd iii detected at 173 mg g as opposed to tfpm dbd at 82 mg g associated spectra of n 1s via high resolution x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps revealed the generation of coordination bonds between gd iii and nh of tfpm btd polymer during gd iii adsorption while energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds analysis proved the uniform adsorption of gd iii on tfpm btd tfpm btd showed high selectivity toward the adsorption of heavy rare earth ions in a high to low order of gd3 ce3 er3 la3 ni2 mg2 zn2 furthermore tfpm btd exhibited excellent cycling stability and regeneration performance gd iii adsorption capacity of tfpm btd after five adsorption elution cycles was retained at 63 9 the elution efficiency was extremely high when using 0 1 mol l hydrochloric acid as the eluent showing an average five cycle desorption efficiency over 95 the outcomes will provide theoretical and practical guidance to develop high performance and selective adsorbents for efficient removal of heavy rare earth ions from water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords benzimidazole linked polymer benzoxazole linked polymer rare earth element gd recovery gd iii selective adsorption covalent organic framework data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rare earth elements have been extensively applied to the fields of cutting edge technologies such as biomedicine 1 electronics and information technology 2 as well as clean energy 3 as a rare earth element with high strategic value gadolinium gd possesses distinctive characteristics including great electrical conductivity and a large magnetic moment 4 gd3 in the form of gd no3 3 is used as a soluble neutron poison in pressurized water reactors 5 compared with other lanthanide ions such as neodymium nd3 europium eu3 and lanthanum la3 the appealing features of higher kinetic stability higher relaxation degree and better bio distribution of gd3 render its application as an mri contrast agent 6 however an aqueous solution containing 100 μm gd3 enables to cause cell apoptosis 7 therefore it is vital to remove and recycle gd3 in industrial wastewater during the production and consumption of gadolinium containing products the amount of gd released to the environment increases rapidly with the development of analysis technologies pereao et al 8 found that wastewater discharged by the mining industry could contain high concentration heavy metal and rare earth elements the bioaccumulation of these non degradable elements in the environment poses a significant threat to the healthy function of the ecosystem additionally protano et al 9 proposed the toxicity of high concentration heavy metal and rare earth elements to flora and fauna generally gd in wastewater is difficult to recycle due to its ultralow concentration hence it is anticipated to bridge the dual targets of resource recycling and environmental protection to effectively recycle gd from trace level rare earth wastewater and secondary resources currently recycling methods for rare earth ions mainly include chemical precipitation 10 liquid liquid extraction 11 ion exchange 12 and adsorption separation 13 14 the adsorptive separation method is promising in recycling low concentration rare earth ion 15 16 because of its applicability to low concentration and large volume operation convenience and negligible secondary pollution studies have elucidated a leading role of the category and contents of functional groups and specific surface area ssa of adsorbent materials in the adsorption performance of rare earth ion benzimidazole and benzoxazole based porous organic polymers are featured by excellent physical and chemical stability large ssa high porosity low skeletal density and good electrical conductivity which attract extensive attention to their applications in energy storage gas adsorption gas storage drug delivery and sensing the increases in ssa and electron rich surface functionality can synergistically enhance rare earth ion adsorption performance of porous materials to obtain high performance porous adsorption materials for rare earth ion material design and synthesis in this study focused on ssa porosity and surface n o functional groups to this end 3d benzimidazolyl tfpm btd and benzoxazolyl tfpm dbd porous polymers were successfully prepared with large ssa and abundant n o based functional groups 2 experimental section 2 1 synthesis of tfpm btd benzol 1 2 4 5 tetramintetrahydrochlorid btd 844 mg 3 0 mmol and 4 tris 4 formylphenyl methyl benzaldehyde tfpm 864 mg 2 0 mmol were added to a solution of 30 0 ml mesitylene mt 30 0 ml dioxane diox and 5 0 ml 6 m acetic acid hac which was followed by ultrasonic treatment for 30 min subsequently the mixture was transferred to a 150 ml reactor and aerated with high purity nitrogen for 10 min to remove oxygen once the aeration finished the reactor was capped and sealed immediately the reactor was placed in a vacuum drying oven to carry out a 72 hour reaction at 120 c the mixture was filtered as the reaction system was cooled to the ambient temperature and the residues were collected the collected solids were washed with n n dimethylacetamide acetone and ultrapure water alternatively three times each and vacuum dried for 12 h at 60 c so that tfpm btd powders were obtained with a yield of approximately 83 3 the relevant synthesis route is shown in fig 1 in detail 2 2 synthesis of tfpm dbd 2 5 diamino 1 4 benzediol dihydrochloride dbd 852 mg 4 0 mmol tfpm 864 mg 2 0 mmol and benzimidazole bzd 1416 mg 12 0 mmol were added to a solution of 30 0 ml mesitylene mt and 20 0 ml n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp prior to ultrasonication treatment for 10 min subsequently the mixture was transferred to a 150 0 ml reactor and aerated with high purity nitrogen for 10 min in order to remove oxygen once the aeration was ended the reactor was capped and sealed immediately the reactor was placed in a vacuum drying oven to conduct a 72 h reaction at 185 c after the reaction system was cooled to the ambient temperature the mixture was filtered and the dark precipitates were collected the collected precipitates were washed with acetone tetrahydrofuran and ultrapure water three times each and vacuum dried for 12 h at 60 c to obtain tfpm dbd powders with a yield of 81 7 the synthesis route is shown in fig 1 as well 3 results and discussion 3 1 specific surface area and pore structures of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd fig 2 shows 77 k n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd corresponding parameters of pore structures and ssa are listed in table 1 fpm btd and tfpm dbd exhibited a similar adsorption isotherm pattern the adsorption increased dramatically at the low p p0 while an obvious hysteresis loop appeared when p p0 0 5 adsorption desorption isotherms of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd can be attributed to type i and type h4 isotherms 17 both of which have abundant micro porous and meso porous structures as supported by the pore size distribution in table 1 the ssas of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd were determined to be 612 60 and 524 90 m2 g and the total pore volumes vtot were detected to be1 44 and 1 15 cm3 g respectively the ratio of mesopore volume to total pore volume of the two polymers were 80 0 and 79 0 respectively further the average pore diameter of benzimidazolyl tfpm btd was 9 41 nm which was far larger than that of benzoxazolyl tfpm dbd at 8 79 nm such results are indicative of abundant mesopores in benzimidazolyl tfpm btd and benzoxazolyl tfpm dbd directly benefit the adsorption performances 3 2 ft ir spectra of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd fourier transform infrared spectrum ft ir analysis is adopted to probe the difference of functional groups between the starting molecules and the products for determining the successful implementation of the reaction ft ir spectra of tfpm btd dbd tfpm btd and tfpm dbd are shown in fig 3 tfpm exhibited a sharp absorption peak taking place at 1698 cm 1 which is assigned to co in aldehyde groups on tfpm 18 btd showed the absorption peaks of amino groups nh2 and imino groups nh in the wavelength range from 3300 to 3500 cm 1 19 the co absorption peak was absent in tfpm btd but a cn stretching vibration peak appeared at 1654 cm 1 20 such results prove the generation of benzimidazole groups after the aldimine condensation reaction among aldehyde groups on tfpm monomers and amino groups of btd similarly dbd absorption occurred from 2800 to 3300 cm 1 which could be attributed to amino groups nh2 and hydroxyl groups oh 21 the characteristic peaks of co were not recorded for tfpm dbd while a cn stretching vibration peak was detected at 1659 cm 1 20 additionally no obvious oh peak was observed at approximately 3000 cm 1 for tfpm dbd these phenomena proved that aldehyde groups on tfpm reacted with both amino groups and hydroxyl groups on dbd resulting in benzoxazole groups after aldimine condensation and hydroxyl condensation reactions hence it is quite convincing that desired products were successfully prepared according to this synthesis route 3 3 tga analysis the thermal stability of the materials was studied by tga from fig 4 it has been found that the thermal stability of tfpm dbd and tfpm btd is better than that of tfpm btd and dbd indicating that starting monomers have been successfully subjected to the polymerization at temperatures below 180 c dbd and btd displayed the weight loss 3 76 and 24 83 respectively which is related to the evaporation of water and ligand water 22 in temperature ranging from 180 to 600 c both dbd and btd underwent a large weight loss dbd 76 55 btd 52 78 indicating the commencement of monomer decomposition 23 finally at 800 c dbd and btd residues remained at 14 7 and 14 8 respectively the weight loss process of tfpm can be divided into three stages tfpm tga curve displays a similar water evaporation pattern a significant weight loss of 47 74 was observed from 180 to 600 c due to tfpm decomposition about 34 6 weight of tfpm was retained at 800 c on the contrary tfpm dbd and tfpm btd have a gradual weight loss process and better thermal stability the main weight loss was occurred between 180 and 600 c tfpm dbd 17 96 tfpm btd 33 17 at 800 c the remaining weights of tfpm dbd and tfpm btd were 45 74 and 38 16 higher than the starting materials therefore it can be concluded that both tfpm dbd and tfpm btd have improved thermal stability 3 4 xrd and sem analyses powder xrd patterns of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd are shown in fig 5 tfpm btd exhibited several strong and sharp diffraction peaks while tfpm dbd only showed one broad peak at 18 the comparison of the diffraction peak intensity and numbers of the two polymers indicated that the crystallinity and the degree of molecular arrangement order of tfpm btd are higher than those of tfpm dbd it is worth affirming that the crystal structure integrity before and after adsorption of gd iii is well maintained fig 5 it can be found that after tfpm btd adsorption of gd iii a new characteristic peak is observed at 10 6 while the peak at 20 4 disappears which may be caused by the formation of tfpm btd gd complex 24 adsorption of gd iii on tfpm dbd led to an increased peak intensity and a reduced half height peak width fig 6 illustrates the surface morphologies of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd before and after gd iii adsorption abundant porous structures can be observed in the sem images of both tfpm btd and tfpm dbd while tfpm btd exhibited more ordered microstructures as shown in fig 6c and d a lot of powders were attached on the surfaces of both tfpm btd and tfpm dbd and the characteristic peaks of gd iii were also found in edx these results prove that gd iii has been effectively adsorbed by tfpm btd and tfpm dbd see fig 14 3 5 thermodynamic analysis on gd iii adsorption performance to explore the influence of temperature on tfpm btd and tfpm dbd adsorption performance of gd iii adsorption experiments were carried out at 298 308 and 318 k respectively the corresponding thermodynamic parameters were calculated based on the following equations 1 k 0 q e c e 2 δg rtlnk 0 3 ln k 0 δs r δh rt where δg kj mol δh kj mol and δs j mol k represent gibbs free energy change enthalpy change and entropy change respectively k0 is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant r 8 314 j mol k is the molar gas constant and t k is the kelvin temperature it can be seen from fig 7 that both tfpm btd and tfpm dbd have a linear relationship between lnk0 and 1 t the adsorption thermodynamic data of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd at different temperatures are listed in tables 2 and 3 a negative value of δh indicates that the adsorption of gd iii onto tfpm btd and tfpm dbd is an exothermic process the value of δs is negative which indicates that the degree of disorder of gd iii in water is greatly reduced it also reflects that there is a strong interaction between adsorbents and gd iii 25 at temperature 298 308 and 318 k the values of δg for tfpm btd are negative 3 962 3 790 and 2 062 kj mol a negative δg proves that the adsorption process is spontaneous and that chemical adsorption occurs however at 318 k the value of δg in tfpm dbd is positive 0 635 kj mol the positive δg means that the adsorption process is limited at high temperatures 26 therefore low temperatures are more suitable for the adsorption process 3 6 isothermal gd iii adsorption model adsorption isotherms were plotted by the adsorption capacities of tfpm dbd and tfpm btd with different gd iii concentrations fig 8 the adsorption capacities of tfpm dbd and tfpm btd both increased rapidly with increasing gd iii concentration the increase rate of gd iii adsorption capacity of tfpm btd was significantly higher than that of tfpm dbd further at an extremely low gd iii concentration 10 mg l tfpm btd exhibited a high adsorption capacity of 74 2 mg l as the concentration exceeded 100 mg l the increase in adsorption capacity slowed down before approaching the plateau maximum adsorption capacities of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd achieved 173 and 82 mg g respectively when gd iii concentration was 330 mg l clearly the adsorption performance of 3d tfpm btd was significantly better than that of 3d tfpm dbd the adsorption capacities of gd iii on tfpm dbd and tfpm btd have been compared with 24 of currently reported adsorbents in table 4 tfpm btd exhibits a distinctly high capacity which is ranked lower than s pg and go hydrosol only langmuir isothermal adsorption model and freundlich isothermal adsorption model were adopted to further unravel the isothermal adsorption patterns of gd iii on the surfaces of 3d polymers tfpm btd and tfpm dbd langmuir isothermal adsorption model 4 c e q e 1 k l q m c e q m and freundlich isothermal adsorption model 5 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where ce mg l is the experimentally measured gd iii concentration after adsorption equilibrium qe mg g is the experimentally measured gd iii adsorption capacity of adsorbents upon adsorption equilibrium qm mg g is the maximum gd iii adsorption capacity of adsorbents by fitting calculation kl and kf stand for adsorption coefficients in langmuir isothermal adsorption eq l mg and freundlich isothermal adsorption equation mg 1 1 n g 1 l1 n respectively and n is a constant in relation to adsorption strength the fitting results of gd iii adsorption equilibrium are shown in fig 9 statistics from line fitting are listed in table 5 for the adsorption on tfpm btd and tfpm dbd the correlation coefficients r2 fitted by langmuir isothermal adsorption model at 0 9997 and 0 9999 are much higher than 0 8911 and 0 8185 when fitted by freundlich isothermal adsorption model the superior correlation coefficients r2 indicate that langmuir isothermal adsorption model in better accordance with actual adsorption of gd iii on the surfaces of 3d polymers of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd when compared with freundlich isothermal adsorption model accordingly gd iii can be adsorbed on the carbon surfaces of adsorbents in a monomolecular layer form in aqueous solutions the fitting parameters of langmuir and freundlich isothermal adsorption models in table 5 present maximum theoretical adsorption capacities of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd being at 175 75 and 83 40 mg g respectively which are equivalent to the experimental values of 173 0 and 82 0 mg g of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd with good validity the values of freundlich isotherm fitting parameters of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd were found to be 0 1738 and 0 1764 respectively both of which were within the range of 0 1 with a clear sign of the stable coordination of gd iii with amino groups 3 7 kinetic models of gd iii adsorption according to the adsorption curves in fig 10 the adsorbed amounts of gd iii on both polymers rapidly increased with contacting time at the beginning of the reaction reaching 90 of maximum gd iii adsorption capacity within 30 min afterward the adsorption capacity paced down and reached the adsorption equilibrium within 60 min the experimental equilibrium gd iii adsorption capacities of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd were 125 3 and 66 8 mg g respectively such a result suggests that gd iii adsorption capacity and adsorption efficiency of 3d tfpm btd were higher than those of 3d tfpm dbd to investigate the adsorption kinetic model of gd iii on the surfaces of 3d polymers pseudo first order kinetic model eq 6 and the pseudo second order kinetic model eq 7 were employed to fit the experimental data of gd iii adsorption on tfpm btd and tfpm dbd in fig 10 in which the transient adsorption capacity qt was calculated using eq 8 the fitting results and the associated parameters are displayed in fig 11 and table 6 according to the fitting degree and the fitting parameters correlation coefficients r2 of the pseudo second order equation fitting on the adsorption kinetics of the two 3d polymers were 0 9995 and 0 9996 respectively which were both higher than the correlation coefficients of 0 4474 and 0 2059 fitted by the pseudo first order equation besides maximum gd iii adsorption capacities on tfpm btd and tfpm dbd fitted by the pseudo second order equation were 127 6 and 67 6 mg g respectively which were closer to actual equilibrium adsorption capacities of 125 3 and 66 8 mg g as opposed to 13 5 and 6 8 mg g fitted by the pseudo first order equation apparently the pseudo second order model is in better agreement with the actual adsorption kinetics of gd iii on the surface of tfpm btd and tfpm

accordingly v is the total volume of the adsorbate solution ml and m is the mass of the adsorbent g 3 8 the influence of initial ph values on gd iii adsorption performance the structural form of gd iii in solutions varies significantly at different ph values at ph over 7 gd iii will precipitate as insoluble gd oh 3 49 50 to study the influence of ph values on gd iii adsorption performance the initial ph values were set between 1 and 7 0 fig 12a and b exhibits gd iii removal rates and adsorption performances of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd at different ph with the decrease of initial solution ph removal rates and adsorption performance were significantly reduced the reason lies in the protonation of the electron rich functional groups e g nh on the surface of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd under acidic conditions causing the surface to carry positive charges and thereby lower adsorption efficiency gd iii adsorption performance of the two materials under acidic conditions was similar at a ph range from 1 to 6 gd iii adsorption on the two porous polymers increased rapidly with the increased ph two polymers exhibited the maximum of their adsorption capacity and efficiency ph 6 0 1 the adsorption capacity of tfpm btd was 125 mg g and adsorption efficiency was almost 100 overall gd iii adsorption performance of tfpm btd was better than that of tfpm dbd under acidic or neutral conditions which can be attributed to the active sites provided by the abundant imino groups nh in the molecular structure of tfpm btd fig 13 shows zeta potential values of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd at various ph values the positive charges on the surface of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd decrease with the increased ph level the reason is the dissociation of h from the surface of the tfpm btd and tfpm dbd in the process of ph rising more gd iii ions thus are electrostatically attracted to the deprotonated functional groups 3 9 eds analysis of tfpm btd after gd iii adsorption eds analysis of tfpm btd and

adsorption tfpm btd exhibited distinctive characteristic peaks of gd 4d5 2 and 3d5 2 at 145 and 1189 ev to further investigate the adsorption mechanism of gd iii on the surfaces of adsorbents high resolution n 1s spectra were recorded to detect the peak shifts before and after gd iii adsorption as illustrated in fig 16 after gd iii adsorption the energy level of nh peak shifted from 402 27 to 402 87 ev along with a gap of 0 60 ev which proves that tertiary amine groups have participated in the complexation of gd iii the peak position of nc is basically unchanged before and after the adsorption of gd iii indicating that nitrogen in nc bonds does not involve the adsorption process these results indicate the coordination effect between surface imino groups nh and gd iii during the adsorption reaction of tfpm btd gd iii is electrostatically attracted to deprotonated amine groups and gd iii coordinates with amine groups through surface complexation fig 17 shows the gd iii

12653,three dimensional porous benzimidazole and benzoxazole linked polymers were successfully prepared through a one pot method using benzol 1 2 4 5 tetramintetrahydrochlorid btd and 2 5 diamino 1 4 benzediol dihydrochloride dbd to react with 4 tris 4 formyl phenyl methyl benzaldehyde tfpm respectively according to nitrogen sorption analysis tfpm btd and tfpm dbd possessed specific surface areas of 612 60 and 524 90 m2 g and the total pore volumes vtot of 1 44 and 1 15 cm3 g respectively batch adsorption experiments demonstrated that gd iii adsorption processes by tfpm btd and tfpm dbd fit well with the langmuir isotherm and the pseudo second order kinetic model at 25 c and ph level of 6 tfpm btd showed a much higher adsorption capacity for gd iii detected at 173 mg g as opposed to tfpm

made available on request 1 introduction rare earth elements have been extensively applied to the fields of cutting edge technologies such as biomedicine 1 electronics and information technology 2 as well as clean energy 3 as a rare earth element with high strategic value gadolinium gd possesses distinctive characteristics including great electrical conductivity and a large magnetic moment 4 gd3 in the form of gd no3 3 is used as a soluble neutron poison in pressurized water reactors 5 compared with other lanthanide ions such as neodymium nd3 europium eu3 and lanthanum la3 the appealing features of higher kinetic stability higher relaxation degree and better bio distribution of gd3 render its application as an mri contrast agent 6 however an aqueous solution containing 100 μm gd3 enables to cause cell apoptosis 7 therefore it is vital to remove and recycle gd3 in industrial wastewater during the production and consumption of gadolinium containing products the amount of gd released to the environment increases rapidly with the development of analysis technologies pereao et al 8 found that wastewater discharged by the mining industry could contain high concentration heavy metal and rare earth elements the bioaccumulation of these non degradable elements in the environment poses a significant threat to the healthy function of the ecosystem additionally protano et al 9 proposed the toxicity of high concentration heavy metal and rare earth elements to flora and fauna generally gd in wastewater is difficult to recycle due to its ultralow concentration hence it is anticipated to bridge the dual targets of resource recycling and environmental protection to effectively recycle gd from trace level rare earth wastewater and secondary resources currently recycling methods for rare earth ions mainly include chemical precipitation 10 liquid liquid extraction 11 ion exchange 12 and adsorption separation 13 14 the adsorptive separation method is promising in recycling low concentration rare earth ion 15 16 because of its applicability to low concentration and large volume operation convenience and negligible secondary pollution studies have elucidated a leading role of the category and contents of functional groups and specific surface area ssa of adsorbent materials in the adsorption performance of rare earth ion benzimidazole and benzoxazole based porous organic polymers are featured by excellent physical and chemical stability large ssa high porosity low skeletal density and good electrical conductivity which attract extensive attention to

adsorption performance of porous materials to obtain high performance porous adsorption materials for rare earth ion material design and synthesis in this study focused on ssa porosity and surface n o functional groups to this end 3d benzimidazolyl tfpm btd and benzoxazolyl tfpm dbd porous polymers were successfully prepared with large ssa and abundant n o based functional groups 2 experimental section 2 1 synthesis of tfpm btd benzol 1 2 4 5 tetramintetrahydrochlorid btd 844 mg 3 0 mmol and 4 tris 4 formylphenyl methyl benzaldehyde tfpm 864 mg 2 0 mmol were added to a solution of 30 0 ml mesitylene mt 30 0 ml dioxane diox and 5 0 ml 6 m acetic acid hac which was followed by ultrasonic treatment for 30 min subsequently the mixture was transferred to a 150 ml reactor and aerated with high purity nitrogen for 10 min to remove oxygen once the aeration finished the reactor was capped and sealed immediately the reactor was placed in a vacuum drying oven to carry out a 72 hour reaction at 120 c the mixture was filtered as the reaction system was cooled to the ambient temperature and the residues were collected the collected solids were washed with n n dimethylacetamide acetone and ultrapure water alternatively three times each and vacuum dried for 12 h at 60 c so that tfpm btd powders were obtained with a yield of approximately 83 3 the relevant synthesis route is shown in fig 1 in detail 2 2 synthesis of tfpm dbd 2 5 diamino 1 4 benzediol dihydrochloride dbd 852 mg 4 0 mmol tfpm 864 mg 2 0 mmol and benzimidazole bzd 1416 mg 12 0 mmol were added to a solution of 30 0 ml mesitylene mt and 20 0 ml n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp prior to ultrasonication treatment for 10 min subsequently the mixture was transferred to a 150 0 ml reactor and aerated with high purity nitrogen for 10 min in order to remove oxygen once the aeration was ended the reactor was capped and sealed immediately the reactor was placed in a vacuum drying oven to conduct a 72 h reaction at 185 c after the reaction system was cooled to the ambient temperature the mixture was filtered and the dark precipitates were collected the collected precipitates were washed with acetone tetrahydrofuran and ultrapure water three times each and vacuum dried for 12 h at 60 c to obtain tfpm dbd powders with a yield of 81 7 the synthesis route is shown in fig 1 as well 3 results and discussion 3 1 specific surface area and pore structures of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd fig 2 shows 77 k n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd corresponding parameters of pore structures and ssa are listed in table 1 fpm btd and tfpm dbd exhibited a similar adsorption isotherm pattern the adsorption increased dramatically at the low p p0 while an obvious hysteresis loop appeared when p p0 0 5 adsorption desorption isotherms of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd can be attributed to type i and type h4 isotherms 17 both of which have abundant micro porous and meso porous structures as supported by the pore size distribution in table 1 the ssas of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd were determined to be 612 60 and 524 90 m2 g and the total pore volumes vtot were detected to be1 44 and 1 15 cm3 g respectively the ratio of mesopore volume to total pore volume of the two polymers were 80 0 and 79 0 respectively further the average pore diameter of benzimidazolyl tfpm btd was 9 41 nm which was far larger than that of benzoxazolyl tfpm dbd at 8 79 nm such results are indicative of abundant mesopores in benzimidazolyl tfpm btd and benzoxazolyl tfpm dbd directly benefit the adsorption performances 3 2 ft ir spectra of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd fourier transform infrared spectrum ft ir analysis is adopted to probe the difference of functional groups between the starting molecules and the products for determining the successful implementation of the reaction ft ir spectra of tfpm btd dbd tfpm btd and tfpm dbd are shown in fig 3 tfpm exhibited a sharp absorption peak taking place at 1698 cm 1 which is assigned to co in aldehyde groups on tfpm 18 btd showed the absorption peaks of amino groups nh2 and imino groups nh in the wavelength range from 3300 to 3500 cm 1 19 the co absorption peak was absent in tfpm btd but a cn stretching vibration peak appeared at 1654 cm 1 20 such results prove the generation of benzimidazole groups after the aldimine condensation reaction among aldehyde groups on tfpm monomers and amino groups of btd similarly dbd absorption occurred from 2800 to 3300 cm 1 which could be attributed to amino groups nh2 and hydroxyl groups oh 21 the characteristic peaks of co were not recorded for tfpm dbd while a cn stretching vibration peak was detected at 1659 cm 1 20 additionally no obvious oh peak was observed at approximately 3000 cm 1 for tfpm dbd these phenomena proved that aldehyde groups on tfpm reacted with both amino groups and hydroxyl groups on dbd resulting in benzoxazole groups after aldimine condensation and hydroxyl condensation reactions hence it is quite convincing that desired products were successfully prepared according to this synthesis route 3 3 tga analysis the thermal stability of the materials was studied by tga from fig 4 it has been found that the thermal stability of tfpm dbd and tfpm btd is better than that of tfpm btd and dbd indicating that starting monomers have been successfully subjected to the polymerization at temperatures below 180 c dbd and btd displayed the weight loss 3 76 and 24 83 respectively which is related to the evaporation of water and ligand water 22 in temperature ranging from 180 to 600 c both dbd and btd underwent a large weight loss dbd 76 55 btd 52 78 indicating the commencement of monomer decomposition 23 finally at 800 c dbd and btd residues remained at 14 7 and 14 8 respectively the weight loss process of tfpm can be divided into three stages tfpm tga curve displays a similar water evaporation pattern a significant weight loss of 47 74 was observed from 180 to 600 c due to tfpm decomposition about 34 6 weight of tfpm was retained at 800 c on the contrary tfpm dbd and tfpm btd have a gradual weight loss process and better thermal stability the main weight loss was occurred between 180 and 600 c tfpm dbd 17 96 tfpm btd 33 17 at 800 c the remaining weights of tfpm dbd and tfpm btd were 45 74 and 38 16 higher than the starting materials therefore it can be concluded that both tfpm dbd and tfpm btd have improved thermal stability 3 4 xrd and sem analyses powder xrd patterns of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd are shown in fig 5 tfpm btd exhibited several strong and sharp diffraction peaks while tfpm dbd only showed one broad peak at 18 the comparison of the diffraction peak intensity and numbers of the two polymers indicated that the crystallinity and the degree of molecular arrangement order of tfpm btd are higher than those of tfpm dbd it is worth affirming that the crystal structure integrity before and after adsorption of gd iii is well maintained fig 5 it can be found that after tfpm btd adsorption of gd iii a new characteristic peak is observed at 10 6 while the peak at 20 4 disappears which may be caused by the formation of tfpm btd gd complex 24 adsorption of gd iii on tfpm dbd led to an increased peak intensity and a reduced half height peak width fig 6 illustrates the surface morphologies of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd before and after gd iii adsorption abundant porous structures can be observed in the sem images of both tfpm btd and tfpm dbd while tfpm btd exhibited more ordered microstructures as shown in fig 6c and d a lot of powders were attached on the surfaces of both tfpm btd and tfpm dbd and the characteristic peaks of gd iii were also found in edx these results prove that gd iii has been effectively adsorbed by tfpm btd and tfpm dbd see fig 14 3 5 thermodynamic analysis on gd iii adsorption performance to explore the influence of temperature on tfpm btd and tfpm dbd adsorption performance of gd iii adsorption experiments were carried out at 298 308 and 318 k respectively the corresponding thermodynamic parameters were calculated based on the following equations 1 k 0 q e c e 2 δg rtlnk 0 3 ln k 0 δs r δh rt where δg kj mol δh kj mol and δs j mol k represent gibbs free energy change enthalpy change and entropy change respectively k0 is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant r 8 314 j mol k is the molar gas constant and t k is the kelvin temperature it can be seen from fig 7 that both tfpm btd and tfpm dbd have a linear relationship between lnk0 and 1 t the adsorption thermodynamic data of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd at different temperatures are listed in tables 2 and 3 a negative value of δh indicates that the adsorption of gd iii onto tfpm btd and tfpm dbd is an exothermic process the value of δs is negative which indicates that the degree of disorder of gd iii in water is greatly reduced it also reflects that there is a strong interaction between adsorbents and gd iii 25 at temperature 298 308 and 318 k the values of δg for tfpm btd are negative 3 962 3 790 and 2 062 kj mol a negative δg proves that the adsorption process is spontaneous and that chemical adsorption occurs however at 318 k the value of δg in tfpm dbd is positive 0 635 kj mol the positive δg means that the adsorption process is limited at high temperatures 26 therefore low temperatures are more suitable for the adsorption process 3 6 isothermal gd iii adsorption model adsorption isotherms were plotted by the adsorption capacities of tfpm dbd and tfpm btd with different gd iii concentrations fig 8 the adsorption capacities of tfpm dbd and tfpm btd both increased rapidly with increasing gd iii concentration the increase rate of gd iii adsorption capacity of tfpm btd was significantly higher than that of tfpm dbd further at an extremely low gd iii concentration 10 mg l tfpm btd exhibited a high adsorption capacity of 74 2 mg l as the concentration exceeded 100 mg l the increase in adsorption capacity slowed down before approaching the plateau maximum adsorption capacities of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd achieved 173 and 82 mg g respectively when gd iii concentration was 330 mg l clearly the adsorption performance of 3d tfpm btd was significantly better than that of 3d tfpm dbd the adsorption capacities of gd iii on tfpm dbd and tfpm btd have been compared with 24 of currently reported adsorbents in table 4 tfpm btd exhibits a distinctly high capacity which is ranked lower than s pg and go hydrosol only langmuir isothermal adsorption model and freundlich isothermal adsorption model were adopted to further unravel the isothermal adsorption patterns of gd iii on the surfaces of 3d polymers tfpm btd and tfpm dbd langmuir isothermal adsorption model 4 c e

for adsorption coefficients in langmuir isothermal adsorption eq l mg and freundlich isothermal adsorption equation mg 1 1 n g 1 l1 n respectively and n is a constant in relation to adsorption strength the fitting results of gd iii adsorption equilibrium are shown in fig 9 statistics from line fitting are listed in table 5 for the adsorption on tfpm btd and tfpm dbd the correlation coefficients r2 fitted by langmuir isothermal adsorption model at 0 9997 and 0 9999 are much higher than 0 8911 and 0 8185 when fitted by freundlich isothermal adsorption model the superior correlation coefficients r2 indicate that langmuir isothermal adsorption model in better accordance with actual adsorption of gd iii on the surfaces of 3d polymers of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd when compared with freundlich isothermal adsorption model accordingly gd iii can be adsorbed on the carbon surfaces of adsorbents in a monomolecular layer form in aqueous solutions the fitting parameters of langmuir and freundlich isothermal adsorption models in table 5 present maximum theoretical adsorption capacities of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd being at 175 75 and 83 40 mg g respectively which are equivalent to the experimental values of 173 0 and 82 0 mg g of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd with good validity the values of freundlich isotherm fitting parameters of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd were found to be 0 1738 and 0 1764 respectively both of which were within the range of 0 1 with a clear sign of the stable coordination of gd iii with amino groups 3 7 kinetic models of gd iii adsorption according to the adsorption curves in fig 10 the adsorbed amounts of gd iii on both polymers rapidly increased with contacting time at the beginning of the reaction reaching 90 of maximum gd iii adsorption capacity within 30 min afterward the adsorption capacity paced down and reached the adsorption equilibrium within 60 min the experimental equilibrium gd iii adsorption capacities of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd were 125 3 and 66 8 mg g respectively such a result suggests that gd iii adsorption capacity and adsorption efficiency of 3d tfpm btd were higher than those of 3d tfpm dbd to investigate the adsorption kinetic model of gd iii on the surfaces of 3d polymers pseudo first order kinetic model eq 6 and the pseudo second order kinetic model eq 7 were employed to fit the experimental data of gd iii adsorption on tfpm btd and tfpm dbd in fig 10 in which the transient adsorption capacity qt was calculated using eq 8 the fitting results and the associated parameters are displayed in fig 11 and table 6 according to the fitting degree and the fitting parameters correlation coefficients r2 of the pseudo second order equation fitting on the adsorption kinetics of the two 3d polymers were 0 9995 and 0 9996 respectively which were both higher than the correlation coefficients of 0 4474 and 0 2059 fitted by the pseudo first order equation besides maximum gd iii adsorption capacities on tfpm btd and tfpm dbd fitted by the pseudo second order equation were 127 6 and 67 6 mg g respectively which were closer to actual equilibrium adsorption capacities of 125 3 and 66 8 mg g as opposed to 13 5 and 6 8 mg g fitted by the pseudo first order equation apparently the pseudo second order model is in better agreement with the actual adsorption kinetics of gd iii on the surface of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd therefore chemical adsorption primarily controls the adsorption rate of gd iii on the surfaces of tfpm btd and tfpm dbd the corresponding formulas are given by 6 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 7 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where qe and qt denote gd iii adsorption amount at the adsorption equilibrium and at t respectively t is contacting time min k1 in unit of min 1 and k2 in unit of g mg 1 min 1 are

nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp reached 53 87 89 36 85 75 and 93 61 respectively interestingly the maximal cod removal efficiency could increase to 82 82 by adding 40 mg l chitosan to flocculate the cultures under a ph level of 9 where the aggregation rate on algal cells reached 100 besides the increments in biomass and lipid productivity of s obliquus cultured in ppw were 1 25 and 1 53 times higher than that of bg11 and intracellular protein content and productivity separately increased by 29 79 and 1 92 fold these results demonstrate s obliquus could efficiently decrease various nutrients in ppw which was markedly further improved by combining with chitosan simultaneously achieving the rapid harvest of microalgal biomass graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pyropia processing wastewater scenedesmus sp nutrient removal flocculation efficiency microalgal biomass data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction with the rapid development of scientific technology and the growing world population the requirements of human beings for sustainable and renewable resources also increased quickly due to the massive advantages such as a short growth period high photosynthetic efficiency and effective synthesis rates of active compounds microalgae have been regarded as a new generation bio resource 1 3 however the substantial amounts of water and mineral elements required by microalgae growth remarkably increase the cultivation charge in addition the downstream processing is also costly higher production cost of microalgae based products hampers algae industrial utilization severely fortunately it has been confirmed that the combination of microalgae large scale culture and wastewater bioremediation is a promising way to reduce expenses 4 5 pyropia processing wastewater ppw is rich in organic nutrients and mineral elements which generated from the primary processing of pyropia and could stimulate the accumulation of biomass and active compounds of some microalgae 6 pyropia is a high value economic alga and extensively cultivated in the global world 7 8 to obtain various pyropia derived products massive wastewater is being produced each year eco friendly purifying ppw is a burning issue to reduce carbon emissions and protect the environment the strategy of microalgae based wastewater treatment exhibits a great prospect and has attracted wide concern 5 9 besides many studies confirmed that cultivating microalgae in wastewater could attain higher algal biomass and high value added active substances which could be applied to prepare animal feeds food additives pharmaceuticals biofertilizers biostimulants etc 10 12 it is worth noting that the reports associated with ppw treatment from biological remediation aspects are very restricted a previous study found that chlorella strains could remove most total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and phycobiliprotein pp in ppw the removal efficiencies of which reached 90 6 but the chemical oxygen demand cod removal rate of chlorella cells on ppw was only 50 suggesting the effective purification of ppw is still an urgent problem the strain of scenedesmus sp represented great potentials in nutrient removal of various wastewaters together with the accumulation of algal biomass for instance ansari et al 13 reported that s obliquus could eliminate 71 2 of cod 81 9 of ammonium nh4 100 of nitrate no3 and 94 1 of phosphate po4 3 in municipal wastewater respectively meanwhile the maximum biomass reached 0 88 g l and the yields of lipid protein and carbohydrate were individually 26 5 28 5 and 27 5 jebali et al 14 found that a strain of scenedesmus sp isolated from northeast tunisia performed higher removal efficiencies of cod nh4 n and tp on a wastewater treatment plant at a continuous mode of 0 6 1 day dilution rate which separately reached 92 94 61 99 and 93 99 simultaneously obtaining 0 9 g l d biomass productivity and 14 8 lipid content ansari et al 15 pointed out that the removal rates of cod nh4 no3 and po4 3 by culturing s obliquus in aquaculture wastewater could separately reach 42 0 88 7 77 7 and 100 with attaining 1 25 g l biomass chitosan is a natural macromolecular compound which is non poisonous and can be biodegraded more importantly chitosan performs strong capacities for nutrient removal and algal cell flocculation and has no negative effects on the downstream processing of microalgal biomass 16 18 xu et al 19 found that the flocculation efficiency of low concentration chitosan could reach 99 under ph 7 and reduce 20 50 times algae solution volume it suggested chitosan would be an efficient flocculant for harvesting algal cells numerous studies reported that chitosan and its derivatives have been extensively employed for degrading organic and new occurring pollutants removing heavy metals purifying dye and oily wastewater etc 20 23 however it is important to note that there is limited literature synchronously researching the combined efficiencies of chitosan on wastewater nutrient removal and microalgal cell agglomeration to probe the impacts of the independent and combination action of s obliquus and chitosan on nutrient removal of ppw the pollutant parameters of cod pp tn and tp were monitored under the conditions of different culture substrates chitosan concentrations and solution ph values besides the growth performance of algal cells cultivated in ppw was evaluated by analyzing biomass lipids fatty acid profile and other biochemical components the aggregation efficiency of chitosan on the cultures was also explored this study aims to reveal the potential of s obliquus in purifying ppw and construct an efficient strategy for ppw treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 pyropia processing wastewater algal strain and cultivation conditions pyropia processing wastewater ppw was gathered from the pyropia processing plant located at lianyun district lianyungang city of jiangsu province in china and stored at 20 c before use the compositions of ppw have been analyzed in previous study 6 and represented in table 1 the wastewater was primarily centrifuged at 4000g for 10 min to eliminate impurities and then used for culturing microalgae a strain of scenedemus obliquus fachb 417 was employed in this research which was provided by institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences microalgal cells were cultivated in blue green medium bg11 24 with a working volume of 200 ml in 250 ml flasks the constituents of bg11 were displayed in table 1 the cultures were incubated in illumination incubators under 25 3 c 45 μmol m2 s light intensity and 14 10 h photoperiod all flasks were manually shaken more than three times every day 2 2 experimental design to evaluate the nutrient removal efficiency of s obliquus on ppw and the growth performance of microalgae in ppw algal cells were cultivated in three different culture substrates which were bg11 ppw and the co substrate of ppw supplemented with bg11 nutrients ppw bg11 respectively the cultures in bg11 were considered as the control the initial inoculum was 0 10 g l of biomass each set of treatment was conducted for three biological replicates to improve nutrient removal rate and efficiently harvest the cultures after culturing s obliquus for 7 days in ppw the different concentrations of chitosan 10 20 40 60 80 and 100 mg l were used for flocculating microalgal cells under various ph levels 6 7 8 9 and 10 the ph values of culture solutions were adjusted with 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh before flocculating the cultures were rapidly mixed with altered concentrations of chitosan for about 10 s slowly shaken for 15 min in a shaker and then let stand for 30 min 19 finally algal cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000g for 5 min and the supernatants were stored at 20 c till use three biological replicates were set up for each treatment 2 3 measurement of nutrients in culture solution the culture supernatants of different substrates after cultivating s obliquus were garnered by centrifugation at 6800g for 10 min the contents of chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp in all culture supernatants were measured with the methods described by the chinese state environmental protection agency standard methods 25 the phycobiliprotein pp content of the supernatants was analyzed and calculated according to the absorbance at 562 nm 615 nm and 652 nm 26 2 4 assessment of flocculation efficiency of chitosan on microalgae the flocculation efficiency of chitosan on algal cells was evaluated by measuring the optical density of the aggregated solution at 680 nm and calculated according to the following equation flocculation efficiency od i od f od i 100 where od i and od f represented the optical densities of the solution before and after flocculating respectively 2 5 analysis of microalgae growth the growth changes of s obliquus in various culture media were exhibited as dry cell weight dcw which was determined using a gravimetric method algal cells were gathered into 2 ml centrifuge tubes by centrifugation at 6800g for 10 min and then placed into an oven to dry at 65 c until constant weight the dcw was calculated based on the difference before and after drying besides the specific growth rate μ was also calculated according to the depicted equation by zheng et al 6 the chlorophyll contents in tested cells were analyzed using a modified methanol method 27 one ml centrifuged cultures was mixed with 1 ml methanol 100 and then extracted at 4 c for 24 h in a fridge the methanol extracts absorbance at 653 and 666 nm was measured with a microplate reader thermo multiskan go america 2 6 determination of lipid content and fatty acid compositions in microalgae neutral lipid contents in cultures were analyzed with an improved nile red staining method 28 the processes were conducted as depicted by zheng et al 29 fluorescence intensities of treated algal cells at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 480 and 575 nm were determined with a microplate reader tecan infinite m1000 pro switzerland the stationary phase cultures were collected by centrifugation at 6800 g for 10 min and then dried using a vacuum lyophilizer labconco freezone plus america till constant weight the total lipid contents in dried cells were analyzed using an improved chloroform methanol method 6 30 the contents of total lipid in cultures were displayed as dcw percentages dcw the fatty acid compositions in all treated cultures were measured by a gas chromatography gc method before analyzing the fatty acids were primarily transformed into the fatty acid methyl esters fames using a solution of 2 v v h2so4 ch3oh 31 an aliquot of 25 mg dried cells was placed into a 15 ml glass centrifuge tube and mixed with 2 ml h2so4 ch3oh the mixture was incubated at 80 c for 1 h in a water bath for methyl esterification then the fames of all samples were isolated by adding each 1 ml of ultrapure water and chromatographic n hexane the n hexane extracts were moved to 2 ml gc sampling vials after centrifuging at 1700 g for 5 min to analyze fatty acid profiles the procedures of gc were carried out as described by zheng et al 6 the chromatograph peaks were distinguished according to the retention time of a supelco 37 component fame mix sigma aldrich america each fatty acid level was assessed based on each peak area proportion accounting for the total fames peak areas all samplings were conducted in triplicate 2 7 measurement of intracellular soluble sugars and proteins in microalgae each sample of 5 ml microalgal cells grown at stationary phase were harvested by centrifugation at 4 c 6800 g for 10 min removing the culture medium and then supplemented the same volume ultrapure water all samples were freeze thawed for three times and sonicated for 20 min in an ice bath before analyzing intracellular sugar and protein contents the supernatants were gathered with centrifugation at 4 c 6800 g for 10 min and then stored at 20 c before use the intracellular sugar in treated cells was determined by a modified phenol sulfuric acid method 32 a sample of 1 ml collected supernatant was added into a 15 ml glass test tube and mixed with 0 5 ml of 6 0 v v phenol solution and 2 5 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid then the mixture was placed into a water bath at 45 c for 30 min the mixture absorbance at 490 nm was recorded with microplate reader the soluble protein content was measured using an improved coomassie brilliant blue method 33 one ml of gathered supernatant was placed into a 15 ml glass test tube where 5 ml of 0 10 g l coomassie brilliant blue g 250 solution was added then the mixture was let sit for 5 min at 25 c after shaking well and the absorbance at 595 nm was analyzed using microplate reader 3 results and discussion 3 1 growth changes of s obliquus cultivated in ppw the growth performance of s obliquus incubated in varied culture substrates was shown in fig 1 the biomass obviously increased with the augmentation of culture time fig 1a supplementing basic medium nutrients bg11 medium in ppw slightly enhanced the biomass after culturing for 7 days the maximal biomass 489 74 mg l was attained in treatment of ppw bg11 which was 1 36 fold and 4 95 higher than those of bg11 and ppw treatments conversely biomass productivity and specific growth rate markedly reduced with the increasing cultivation time fig b and c but the biomass yield and specific growth rate of s obliquus grown in ppw included substrates were significantly higher than those of bg11 treatment during the culture time the optimum biomass productivity and specific growth rate were also recorded at treatment of ppw bg11 followed by ppw substrate the maximal values were separately 54 88 mg l d and 0 22 d on the 7th day of incubation which increased by 2 76 and 1 27 fold compared with bg11 treatment and 6 39 and 3 25 in comparison with ppw the dynamic changes of chlorophylls were similar to the biomass and increased with the increment of culture time fig 1d higher chlorophyll a b was obtained in treatment of ppw which was 10 75 mg l and improved by 1 35 times and 9 06 in comparison with bg11 and ppw bg11 treatments respectively the above results reveal that s obliquus could grow well in undiluted ppw and accumulate higher biomass the biomass of treated cells by ppw was remarkably greater than that of bg11 substrate however the addition of exogenous mineral nutrients slightly enhanced the growth of s obliquus which would be ascribed to the fact that ppw is rich in various organic and inorganic nutrients as shown in table 1 the contained polysaccharides amino acids and mineral elements in ppw performed great impacts on stimulating algal growth 6 10 the increment in biomass is bigger than that of cultivating in pure municipal wastewater 0 20 g l reported by liu et al 34 this should be owing to the nutrient discrepancies of various wastewaters 35 it reveals that ppw might be an alternatively low cost substrate for the commercial scale culture of s obliquus 3 2 nutrient removal efficiency of s obliquus combined with chitosan on ppw 3 2 1 nutrient removal efficiency of s obliquus on ppw generally untreated ppw shows red color owing to containing massive phycobiliprotein pp especially phycoerythrin which is one of important reasons causing environmental pollution the organic constituent elimination rates of ppw by s obliquus were represented in fig 2 the cod and pp concentrations remarkably decreased with the increase of culture time interestingly the descent speeds of both cod and pp within 2 days of incubation were obviously higher than those of cultivating for 3 7 days fig 2 a and c the enhanced removal efficiencies of cod and pp were observed by adding bg11 nutrients in ppw after culturing 2 days the levels of cod and pp in ppw could reduce to 266 95 mg l and 1 82 mg l in ppw bg11 and the removal rates were 48 41 and 91 68 respectively fig 2 b and d under treatment of ppw their removal efficiencies could reach 43 64 and 84 46 when the cultivation time increased to 7 days the cod removal rates of ppw and ppw bg11 treatments were 53 87 and 59 43 and the pp eliminated rates were 89 36 and 93 30 respectively this result illustrates that s obliquus could efficiently reduce the levels of cod and pp in ppw considering the dynamic changes of biomass fig 1 it can be concluded that s obliquus could absorb the polysaccharide and phycobiliprotein in pyropia for the growth of algal cells besides the elimination rates within 2 days of cultivation were dramatically faster than those of culturing for 3 7 days which elucidates most organic substances were utilized by s obliquus in the early growth stage exogenously replenishing basic medium bg11 components in ppw slightly enhanced cod and pp removal efficiencies indicating some nutrients of ppw cannot be directly assimilated by s obliquus similar findings were also observed in chlorella strains 6 the tn and tp removal efficiencies of ppw by culturing s obliquus were indicated in fig 3 the concentrations of tn and tp in various substrates remarkably decreased with the increasing cultivation time as shown in fig 3a and c the tn and tp levels of bg11 and ppw bg11 treatments were obviously higher than those of ppw treatment which should be resulted from the abundant nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients in bg11 medium surprisingly the tn and tp concentrations in treatment of ppw also sharply declined within 2 days of incubation it was similar with the changes of cod and pp fig 2a and c the tn and tp removal rates of ppw treatment reached 71 30 and 96 74 on the second day of culture and 85 75 and 93 61 on the 7th day of cultivation respectively fig 3b and d actually the concentrations of tn and tp in ppw could reduce to 11 98 and 0 14 mg l after culturing for 2 days and 5 95 and 0 28 mg l when the cultivation time increased to 7 days this result illustrates that s obliquus could eliminate almost all nitrogen and phosphorus constituents in ppw quickly integrating the dynamic changes of cod and pp it was found that only cultivating s obliquus cannot completely remove all nutrients of ppw especially organic substances adding whole bg11 nutrients in ppw cannot markedly promote the nutrient removal efficiencies of s obliquus on ppw thus it was further confirmed that some nutritional components in ppw cannot be absorbed by s obliquus previous studies also found a similar issue in other wastewaters 10 it might be resulted from the selected uptake nutrients of microalgae on culture substrates 36 based on the growth changes of s obliquus fig 1 it was speculated that the nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients in ppw should be efficiently removed by the assimilation manner due to the rapid growth of algal cells 5 3 2 2 nutrient removal efficiency of s obliquus combined with chitosan on ppw it can be seen from figs 2 and 3 that the tn and tp contents in ppw after cultivating s obliquus alone could meet the limited levels required by the discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant gb 18918 2002 and the water quality standard for scenic environment use gb t 18921 2019 in china but cod cannot in addition studies pointed out that the flocculation effect of chitosan on microalgal cells is closely related to its concentration and solution ph 16 21 to effectively solve the above mentioned problem the nutrients removal efficiencies of s obliquus combined with chitosan on ppw were further investigated under altered chitosan and ph levels the marked reduction in cod concentration was observed in all treatments of s obliquus coupled with various levels of chitosan under varied ph values it first decreased and then increased with the augmenting chitosan dosages and cod removal rates rose and then declined fig 4a and b interestingly the cod contents in the treated supernatant by 40 60 mg l chitosan all were 120 mg l the minimum requirement of gb 18918 2002 standard under different ph levels the lowest cod concentration 90 27 mg l was achieved at the treatment of 40 mg l chitosan under a ph value of 9 where the cod removal rate could reach 82 82 significantly higher than 53 87 of only culturing s obliquus treatment fig 4c besides the obvious decrease in tn level was also found in the combination treatments of s obliquus and chitosan fig 4c the maximal tn removal efficiency could be remarkably promoted from 85 75 to 94 59 meanwhile the flocculation efficiency of chitosan on algal cells was explored under diverse ph levels it can be seen from fig 4d that there were marked discrepancies under treatments of 10 80 and 100 mg l chitosan but the differences were non significant when the chitosan concentration was in the range of 20 60 mg l the optimal flocculation efficiency on cells could reach 99 89 around 100 and also recorded at treatment of 40 mg l chitosan under ph value of 9 surprisingly the flocculation rates of 20 60 mg l chitosan under diverse ph levels could reach 97 the above result indicates that adding moderate chitosan after culturing algal cells is greatly conducive to improve the cod elimination effect of s obliquus on ppw solution ph level displays a tiny impact on cod removal efficiency under the conditions of 10 60 mg l chitosan more importantly reasonably using chitosan could efficiently flocculate the cultures conveniently quickly harvesting microalgae this should be attributed to the strong bioflocculation capacity of chitosan the mechanism of which includes charge neutralization adsorption bridging electrostatic patching and sweeping 16 18 the specific aggregation mechanism is altered with the flocculation conditions generally chitosan based coagulation involves the combination of insoluble particles and dissolved organic substances into larger polymers which can be easily eliminated by the way of filtration or centrifugation 18 37 and sweeping is the primary manner for chitosan to harvest the cultures when the solution ph is bigger than 7 16 besides it was found that excessive chitosan exhibits negative influences on removing cod in ppw and flocculating algal cells lichtfouse et al 18 pointed out that a higher chitosan concentration solution will have excessive cationic charge which will induce polymers re stabilization reducing pollutant removal yunos et al 38 reported that higher concentration of chitosan cannot improve the flocculating efficiency since microalgal cells might be restabilized the dosage of chitosan for efficiently aggregating algal cells is greatly associated with microalgae characteristics algal biomass growth phase and aggregation conditions 16 the overriding mechanism and purification efficiency of chitosan on wastewater mainly depends on the process conditions such as dosage ph temperature etc 18 22 37 3 3 lipid production and fatty acid compositions of s obliquus cultured in ppw the changes of lipid production in s obliquus cultivated in various culture substrates were indicated in fig 5 the total lipid content in treated cultures with ppw bg11 was lower than those of the independent treatments of ppw and bg11 which was 14 90 and reduced by 7 21 and 27 22 compared with ppw and bg11 treatments higher lipid productivity was observed in treatment of ppw followed by the treatment of ppw bg11 they separately reached 10 29 mg l d and 10 21 mg l which promoted by 1 53 and 1 51 fold in comparison with bg11 substrate interestingly the per volume content of neutral lipids in the treatment of ppw contained substrates were higher than that of bg11 medium during the cultivation period fig 5b after incubating for 7 days the maximum neutral lipid content was attained at treatment of ppw bg11 which improved by 17 14 and 1 03 times by contrast with ppw and bg11 treatments respectively above result reveals that culturing s obliquus in ppw could obtain higher lipid yield and neutral lipid per volume content but cannot achieve the enhancement of total lipids supplementing bg11 medium nutrients in ppw exhibited a negative impact on total lipid accumulation of s obliquus but the improvement of neutral lipid per volume content was observed based on the changes of biomass fig 1 and biochemical components section 3 4 it was speculated that the decrements in total lipids of s obliquus cultivated in ppw involved medium might be associated with the rapid accumulation of biomass or other active compounds such as carbohydrate and protein the changes of fatty acid profiles of s obliquus grown in various culture media were shown in table 2 the dominant fatty acids in treated cells were composed of c16 0 c18 0 c18 1 c18 2 and c18 3 the c16 0 ratios of different treatments were non significant and in the range of 20 46 21 28 the proportions of c18 0 in treated cultures by ppw included substrates were markedly higher than that of bg11 medium higher c18 1 ratio was recorded in ppw substrate and the optimal c18 2 level was attained under ppw bg11 treatment however c18 3 ratios in treatments of ppw and ppw bg11 were significantly smaller than bg11 treatment the minimal c18 3 proportion 26 55 was observed under co substrate treatment of ppw bg11 followed by ppw treatment 27 71 they decreased by 19 09 and 15 56 compared with bg11 treatments respectively similarly the levels of saturated fatty acid sfa and monounsaturated fatty acid mufa in treated cells with ppw contained media were bigger than those of bg11 substrate and the polyunsaturated fatty acid pufa ratio was lower than in bg11 treatment this result illustrates that cultivating s obliquus in ppw could obviously decrease the pufa proportion improving the biodiesel property of algal cells 39 the reduced pufa facilitated triggering the enhancements of sfa and mufa which might be ascribed to the fact that the carbon to nitrogen ratio of ppw was higher than bg11 6 higher carbon nitrogen proportion is more beneficial to the biosynthesis of sfa and mufa for some microalgae 29 40 3 4 intracellular sugar and protein contents of s obliquus grown in ppw microalgae based sugars and proteins are also considerable value added active molecules and extensively applied to many industrial areas such as biofuels health foods and animal feeds 41 43 to further assess the commercial value of s obliquus cultured in ppw the contents of intracellular soluble sugar and protein in cells after culturing for 7 days were analyzed in this research the reductions in soluble sugar contents were observed in ppw included treatments but the soluble sugar productivities were markedly enhanced fig 6a the soluble sugar contents in ppw and ppw bg11 treatments were 26 46 and 12 42 lower than that of bg11 substrate the maximum sugar yield was accomplished at treatment of ppw bg11 which increased by 18 05 and 1 10 fold compared with ppw and bg11 treatments as shown in fig 6b the remarkable enhancements of the intracellular soluble protein content and productivity were recorded in ppw contained substrates higher protein content was achieved in treatment of ppw and reached 125 21 mg g slightly bigger than ppw bg11 treatment it was increased by 29 79 in comparison with bg11 culture there were also non significant differences between ppw and ppw bg11 treatment on protein productivity which was around 8 40 mg l d and promoted by 1 90 times in contrast with bg11 substrate the above result reveals that ppw could obviously improve the intracellular soluble sugar productivity and protein content in s obliquus but cannot stimulate the accumulation of intracellular soluble sugar taking the variations of lipid production fig 5 together it was further confirmed that the absorbed nutrients by s obliquus from ppw were primarily used for the rapid growth of algal cells 4 conclusions it was found in the present study that s obliquus grew well in untreated ppw without the addition of any nutrients and the obvious improvements in biomass lipid and protein productivities were observed the removal efficiencies of pp tn and tp all reached 85 by culturing s obliquus alone but the cod elimination rate was only 53 87 it is worth noting that the cod removal rate could be further enhanced by adding 40 60 mg l chitosan to agglomerate the cultures at the stationary phase the maximal value of which could increase to 82 82 meanwhile the optimum aggregation efficiency of algal cells was 100 the above mentioned results reveal that cultivating s obliquus coupled with chitosan flocculation could efficiently purify ppw and rapidly harvest algal biomass remarkably mitigating the environmental pollution resulted from wastewater discharge this study will make an important contribution to ppw reuse and large scale

12654,the discharge of massive nutrient rich pyropia processing wastewater ppw will result in severe environmental pollution to explore an efficient strategy to purify ppw the nutrient removal efficiency and growth performance of scenedemus obliquus on ppw were investigated under the conditions of different culture substrates and the impacts of chitosan based flocculation on the nutrient elimination rates were analyzed under various ph values results showed that after cultivating s obliquus in ppw for 7 days the removal rates of chemical oxygen demand cod phycobiliprotein pp total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp reached 53 87 89 36 85 75 and 93 61 respectively interestingly the maximal cod removal efficiency could increase to 82 82 by adding 40 mg l chitosan to flocculate the cultures under a ph level of 9 where the aggregation rate on algal cells reached 100 besides the increments in biomass and lipid productivity of s obliquus cultured in ppw were 1 25 and 1 53 times higher than that of bg11 and intracellular protein content and productivity separately increased by 29 79 and 1 92 fold these results demonstrate s obliquus could efficiently decrease various nutrients in ppw which was markedly further improved by combining with chitosan simultaneously achieving the rapid harvest of microalgal biomass graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pyropia

remediation aspects are very restricted a previous study found that chlorella strains could remove most total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and phycobiliprotein pp in ppw the removal efficiencies of which reached 90 6 but the chemical oxygen demand cod removal rate of chlorella cells on ppw was only 50 suggesting the effective purification of ppw is still an urgent problem the strain of scenedesmus sp represented great potentials in nutrient removal of various wastewaters together with the accumulation of algal biomass for instance ansari et al 13 reported that s obliquus could eliminate 71 2 of cod 81 9 of ammonium nh4 100 of nitrate no3 and 94 1 of phosphate po4 3 in municipal wastewater respectively meanwhile the maximum biomass reached 0 88 g l and the yields of lipid protein and carbohydrate were individually 26 5 28 5 and 27 5 jebali et al 14 found that a strain of scenedesmus sp isolated from northeast tunisia performed higher removal efficiencies of cod nh4 n and tp on a wastewater treatment plant at a continuous mode of 0 6 1 day dilution rate which separately reached 92 94 61 99 and 93 99 simultaneously obtaining 0 9 g l d biomass productivity and 14 8 lipid content ansari et al 15 pointed out that the removal rates of cod nh4 no3 and po4 3 by culturing s obliquus in aquaculture wastewater could separately reach 42 0 88 7 77 7 and 100 with attaining

flocculation and has no negative effects on the downstream processing of microalgal biomass 16 18 xu et al 19 found that the flocculation efficiency of low concentration chitosan could reach 99 under

lianyungang city of jiangsu province in china and stored at 20 c before use the compositions of ppw have been analyzed in previous study 6 and represented in table 1 the wastewater was primarily centrifuged at 4000g for 10 min to eliminate impurities and then used for culturing microalgae a strain of scenedemus obliquus fachb 417 was employed in this research which was provided by institute

experimental design to evaluate the nutrient removal efficiency of s obliquus on ppw and the growth performance of microalgae in ppw algal cells were cultivated in three different culture substrates which were bg11 ppw and the co substrate of ppw supplemented with bg11 nutrients ppw bg11 respectively the cultures in bg11 were considered as the control the initial inoculum was 0 10 g l of biomass each set of treatment was conducted for three biological replicates to improve nutrient removal rate and efficiently harvest the cultures after culturing s obliquus for 7 days in ppw the different concentrations of chitosan 10 20 40 60 80 and 100 mg l were used for flocculating microalgal cells under various ph levels 6 7 8 9 and 10 the ph values of culture solutions were adjusted with 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh before flocculating the cultures were rapidly mixed with altered concentrations of chitosan for about 10 s slowly shaken for 15 min in a shaker and then let stand for 30 min 19 finally algal cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000g for 5 min and the supernatants were stored at 20 c till use three biological replicates were set up for each treatment 2 3 measurement of

changes of s obliquus in various culture media were exhibited as dry cell weight dcw which was determined using a gravimetric method algal cells were gathered into 2 ml centrifuge tubes by centrifugation at 6800g for 10 min and then placed into an oven to dry at 65 c until constant weight the dcw was calculated based on the difference before and after drying besides the specific growth rate μ was also calculated according to the depicted equation by zheng et al 6 the chlorophyll contents in tested cells were analyzed using a modified methanol method 27 one ml centrifuged cultures was mixed with 1 ml methanol 100 and then extracted at 4 c for 24 h in a fridge the methanol extracts absorbance at 653 and 666 nm was measured with a microplate reader thermo multiskan go america 2 6

cultivated in ppw the growth performance of s obliquus incubated in varied culture substrates was shown in fig 1 the biomass obviously increased with the augmentation of culture time fig 1a supplementing basic medium nutrients bg11 medium in ppw slightly enhanced the biomass after culturing for 7 days the maximal biomass 489 74 mg l was attained in treatment of ppw bg11 which was 1 36 fold and 4 95 higher than those of bg11 and ppw treatments conversely biomass productivity and specific growth rate markedly reduced with the increasing cultivation time fig b and c but the biomass yield and specific growth rate of s obliquus grown in ppw included substrates were significantly higher than those of bg11 treatment during the culture time the optimum biomass productivity and specific growth rate were also recorded at treatment of ppw bg11 followed by ppw substrate the maximal values were separately 54 88 mg l d and 0 22 d on the 7th day of incubation which increased by 2 76 and 1 27 fold compared with bg11 treatment and 6 39 and 3 25 in comparison with ppw the dynamic changes of chlorophylls were similar to the biomass and increased with the increment of culture time fig 1d higher chlorophyll a b was obtained in treatment of ppw which was 10 75 mg l and improved by 1 35 times and 9 06 in comparison with bg11 and ppw bg11 treatments respectively the above results reveal that s obliquus could grow well in undiluted ppw and accumulate higher biomass the biomass of treated cells by ppw was remarkably greater than that of bg11 substrate however the addition of exogenous mineral nutrients slightly enhanced the growth of s obliquus which would be ascribed to the fact that ppw is rich in various organic and inorganic nutrients as shown in table 1 the contained polysaccharides amino acids and mineral elements in ppw performed great impacts on stimulating algal growth 6 10 the increment in biomass is bigger than that of cultivating in pure municipal wastewater 0 20 g l reported by liu et al 34 this should be owing to the nutrient discrepancies of various wastewaters 35 it reveals that ppw might be an alternatively low cost substrate for the commercial scale culture of s obliquus 3 2 nutrient removal efficiency of s obliquus combined with chitosan on ppw 3 2 1 nutrient removal efficiency of s obliquus on ppw generally untreated ppw shows red color owing to containing massive phycobiliprotein pp especially phycoerythrin which is one of important reasons causing environmental pollution the organic constituent elimination rates of ppw by s obliquus were represented in fig 2 the cod and pp concentrations remarkably decreased with the increase of culture time interestingly the descent speeds of both cod and pp within 2 days of incubation were obviously higher than those of cultivating for 3 7 days fig 2 a and c the enhanced removal efficiencies of cod and pp were observed by adding bg11 nutrients in ppw after culturing 2 days the levels of cod and pp in ppw could reduce to 266 95 mg l and 1 82 mg l in ppw bg11 and the removal rates were 48 41 and 91 68 respectively fig 2 b and d under treatment of ppw their removal efficiencies could reach 43 64 and 84 46 when the cultivation time increased to 7 days the cod removal rates of ppw and ppw bg11 treatments were 53 87 and 59 43 and the pp eliminated rates were 89 36 and 93 30 respectively this result illustrates that s obliquus could efficiently reduce the levels of cod and pp in ppw considering the dynamic changes of biomass fig 1 it can be concluded that s obliquus could absorb the polysaccharide and phycobiliprotein in pyropia for the growth of algal cells besides the elimination rates within 2 days of cultivation were dramatically faster than those of culturing for 3 7 days which elucidates most organic substances were utilized by s obliquus in the early growth stage exogenously replenishing basic medium bg11 components in ppw slightly enhanced cod and pp removal efficiencies indicating some nutrients of ppw cannot be directly assimilated by s obliquus similar findings were also observed in chlorella strains 6 the tn and tp removal efficiencies of ppw by culturing s obliquus were indicated in fig 3 the concentrations of tn and tp in various substrates remarkably decreased with the increasing cultivation time as shown in fig 3a and c the tn and tp levels of bg11 and ppw bg11 treatments were obviously higher than those of ppw treatment which should be resulted from the abundant nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients in bg11 medium surprisingly the tn and tp concentrations in treatment of ppw also sharply declined within 2 days of incubation it was similar with the changes of cod and pp fig 2a and c the tn and tp removal rates of ppw treatment reached 71 30 and 96 74 on the second day of culture and 85 75 and 93 61 on the 7th day of cultivation respectively fig 3b and d actually the concentrations of tn and tp in ppw could reduce to 11 98 and 0 14 mg l after culturing for 2 days and 5 95 and 0 28 mg l when the cultivation time increased to 7 days this result illustrates that s obliquus could eliminate almost all nitrogen and phosphorus constituents in ppw quickly integrating the dynamic changes of cod and pp it was found that only cultivating s obliquus cannot completely remove all nutrients of ppw especially organic substances adding whole bg11 nutrients in ppw cannot markedly promote the nutrient removal efficiencies of s obliquus on ppw thus it was further confirmed that some nutritional components in ppw cannot be absorbed by s obliquus previous studies also found a similar issue in other wastewaters 10 it might be resulted from the selected uptake nutrients of microalgae on culture substrates 36 based on the growth changes of s obliquus fig 1 it was speculated that the nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients in ppw should be efficiently removed by the assimilation manner due to the rapid growth of algal cells 5 3 2 2 nutrient removal efficiency of s obliquus combined with chitosan on ppw it can be seen from figs 2 and 3 that the tn and tp contents in ppw after cultivating s obliquus alone could meet the limited levels required by the discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant gb 18918 2002 and the water quality standard for scenic environment use gb t 18921 2019 in china but cod cannot in addition studies pointed out that the flocculation effect of chitosan on microalgal cells is closely related to its concentration and solution ph 16 21 to effectively solve the above mentioned problem the nutrients removal efficiencies of s obliquus combined with chitosan on ppw were further investigated under altered chitosan and ph levels the marked reduction in cod concentration was observed in all treatments of s obliquus coupled with various levels of chitosan under varied ph values it first decreased and then increased with the augmenting chitosan dosages and cod removal rates rose and then declined fig 4a and b interestingly the cod contents in the treated supernatant by 40 60 mg l chitosan all were 120 mg l the minimum requirement of gb 18918 2002 standard under different ph levels the lowest cod concentration 90 27 mg l was achieved at the treatment of 40 mg l chitosan under a ph value of 9 where the cod removal rate could reach 82 82 significantly higher than 53 87 of only culturing s obliquus treatment fig 4c besides the obvious decrease in tn level was also found in the combination treatments of s obliquus and chitosan fig 4c the maximal tn removal efficiency could be remarkably promoted from 85 75 to 94 59 meanwhile the flocculation efficiency of chitosan on algal cells was explored under diverse ph levels it can be seen from fig 4d that there were marked discrepancies under treatments of 10 80 and 100 mg l chitosan but the differences were non significant when the chitosan concentration was in the range of 20 60 mg l the optimal flocculation efficiency on cells could reach 99 89 around 100 and also recorded at treatment of 40 mg l chitosan under ph value of 9 surprisingly the flocculation rates of 20 60 mg l chitosan under diverse ph levels could reach 97 the above result indicates that adding moderate chitosan after culturing algal cells is greatly conducive to improve the cod elimination effect of s obliquus on ppw solution ph level displays a tiny impact on cod removal efficiency under the conditions of 10 60 mg l chitosan more importantly reasonably using chitosan could efficiently flocculate the cultures conveniently quickly harvesting microalgae this should be attributed to the strong bioflocculation capacity of chitosan the mechanism of which includes charge neutralization adsorption bridging electrostatic patching and sweeping 16 18 the specific aggregation mechanism is altered with the flocculation conditions generally chitosan based coagulation involves the combination of insoluble particles and dissolved organic substances into larger polymers which can be easily eliminated by the way of filtration or centrifugation 18 37 and sweeping is the primary manner for chitosan to harvest the cultures when the solution ph is bigger than 7 16 besides it was found that excessive chitosan exhibits negative influences on removing cod in ppw and flocculating algal cells lichtfouse et al 18 pointed out that a higher chitosan concentration solution will have excessive cationic charge which will induce polymers re stabilization reducing pollutant removal yunos et al 38 reported that higher concentration of chitosan cannot improve the flocculating efficiency since microalgal cells might be restabilized the dosage of chitosan for efficiently aggregating algal cells is greatly associated with microalgae characteristics algal biomass growth phase and aggregation conditions 16 the overriding mechanism and purification efficiency of chitosan on wastewater mainly depends on the process conditions such as dosage ph temperature etc 18 22 37 3 3 lipid production and fatty acid compositions of s obliquus cultured in ppw the changes of lipid production in s obliquus cultivated in various culture substrates were indicated in fig 5 the total lipid content in treated cultures with ppw bg11 was lower than those of the independent treatments of ppw and bg11 which was 14 90 and reduced by 7 21 and 27 22 compared with ppw and bg11 treatments higher lipid productivity was observed in treatment of ppw followed by the treatment of ppw bg11 they separately reached 10 29 mg l d and 10 21 mg l which promoted by 1 53 and 1 51 fold in comparison with bg11 substrate interestingly the per volume content of neutral lipids in the treatment of ppw contained substrates were higher than that of bg11 medium during the cultivation period fig 5b after incubating for 7 days the maximum neutral lipid content was attained at treatment of ppw bg11 which improved by 17 14 and 1 03 times by contrast with ppw and bg11 treatments respectively above result reveals that culturing s obliquus in ppw could obtain higher lipid yield and neutral lipid per volume content but cannot achieve the enhancement of total lipids supplementing bg11 medium nutrients in ppw exhibited a negative impact on total lipid accumulation of s obliquus but the improvement of neutral lipid per volume content was observed based on the changes of biomass fig 1 and biochemical components section 3 4 it was speculated that the decrements in total lipids of s obliquus cultivated in ppw involved medium might be associated with the rapid accumulation of biomass or other active compounds such as carbohydrate and protein the changes of fatty acid profiles of s obliquus grown in various culture media were shown in table 2 the dominant fatty acids in treated cells were composed of c16 0 c18 0 c18 1 c18 2 and c18 3 the c16 0 ratios of different treatments were non significant and in the range of 20 46 21 28 the proportions of c18 0 in treated cultures by ppw included substrates were markedly higher than that of bg11 medium higher c18 1 ratio was recorded in ppw substrate and the optimal c18 2 level was attained under ppw bg11 treatment however c18 3 ratios in treatments of ppw and ppw bg11 were significantly smaller than bg11 treatment the minimal c18 3 proportion 26 55 was observed under co substrate treatment of ppw bg11 followed by ppw treatment 27 71 they decreased by 19 09 and 15 56 compared with bg11 treatments respectively similarly the levels of saturated fatty acid sfa and monounsaturated fatty acid mufa in treated cells with ppw contained media were bigger than those of bg11 substrate and the polyunsaturated fatty acid pufa ratio was lower than in bg11 treatment this result illustrates that cultivating s obliquus in ppw could obviously decrease the pufa proportion improving the biodiesel property of algal cells 39 the reduced pufa facilitated triggering the enhancements of sfa and mufa which might be ascribed to the fact that the carbon to nitrogen ratio of ppw was higher than bg11 6 higher carbon nitrogen proportion is more beneficial to the biosynthesis of sfa and mufa for some microalgae 29 40 3 4 intracellular sugar and protein contents of s obliquus grown in ppw microalgae based sugars and proteins are also considerable value added active molecules and extensively applied to many industrial areas such as biofuels health foods and animal feeds 41 43 to further assess the commercial value of s obliquus cultured in ppw the contents of intracellular soluble sugar and protein in cells after culturing for 7 days were analyzed in this research the reductions in soluble sugar contents were observed in ppw included treatments but the soluble sugar productivities were markedly enhanced fig 6a the soluble sugar contents in ppw and ppw bg11 treatments were 26 46 and 12 42 lower than that of bg11 substrate the maximum sugar yield was accomplished at treatment of ppw bg11 which increased by 18 05 and 1 10 fold compared with ppw and bg11 treatments as shown in fig 6b the remarkable enhancements of the intracellular soluble protein content and productivity were recorded in ppw contained substrates higher protein content was achieved in treatment of ppw and reached 125 21 mg g slightly bigger than ppw bg11 treatment it was increased by 29 79 in comparison with bg11 culture there were also non significant differences between ppw and ppw bg11 treatment on protein productivity which was around 8 40 mg l d and promoted by 1 90 times in contrast with bg11 substrate the above result reveals that ppw could obviously improve the intracellular soluble sugar productivity and protein content in s obliquus but cannot stimulate the accumulation of intracellular soluble sugar taking the variations of lipid production fig 5 together it was further confirmed that the absorbed nutrients by s obliquus from ppw were primarily used for the rapid growth of algal cells 4 conclusions it was found in the present study that s obliquus grew well in untreated ppw without the addition of any nutrients and the obvious improvements in biomass lipid and protein productivities were observed the removal efficiencies of pp tn and tp all reached 85 by culturing s obliquus alone but the cod elimination rate was only 53 87 it is worth noting that the cod removal rate could be further enhanced by adding 40 60 mg l chitosan to agglomerate the cultures at the stationary phase the maximal value of which could increase to 82 82 meanwhile the optimum aggregation efficiency of algal cells was 100 the above mentioned results reveal that cultivating s obliquus coupled with chitosan flocculation could efficiently purify ppw and rapidly harvest algal biomass remarkably mitigating the environmental pollution resulted from wastewater discharge this study will make an important contribution to ppw reuse and large scale
