5790,rainwater harvesting rwh is becoming one of the most promising alternative sources of fresh water which can be potentially captured and utilized particularly in arid and semi arid regions asars however identification of potential sites for rwh on a large scale has always been a great challenge and therefore requires further studies most recent studies on this topic select rwh zones employing geographic information systems gis combined with multi criteria analysis and hydrological models nevertheless there are a few studies mostly in small catchments that locate potential zones considering socio economic factors in this paper a gis based multi criteria decision analysis mcda is presented to identify potential rwh areas incorporating socio economic factors including distance from drainage networks roads urban areas faults farms and wells the proposed methodology was implemented at a large catchment scale in mashhad plain basin with an area of 9762 km2 located in the northeast of iran results show that 48 of the study area is not suitable for rwh the rest of the study area is divided into three potential zones that are poor moderate and good for rwh covering 31 43 and 26 of the potential areas respectively ponds and pans check dams and terracing were considered as the best practices for the good rwh potential areas preliminary estimates suggest that up to 158 135 and 110 m m3 of precipitation could be received respectively by each system keywords rainwater harvesting decision support system geospatial techniques water conservation 1 introduction the impact of freshwater scarcity in the next decades could dramatically increase due to accelerated climate change population growth intensive farming increasing industrialization and continuous pollution of water resources cai and rosegrant 2002 gleick 2003 jha et al 2014b ward et al 2010 the majority of countries in north africa and the near east as well as countries such as pakistan mexico south africa and large parts of india and china deal with water scarcity and its implications fao 2012 magrath 2007 watkins 2006 this trend resulted in a reduced capacity to supply the agricultural sector while meeting water needs for industrial and domestic demands therefore more resources and research should focus on water allocation strategies and the efficient use of possible sources of water pandey et al 2003 terêncio et al 2018 un 2007 wwap 2015 many of the available water resources management strategies may prove costly including placing long pipeline aqueducts pumping water from deep aquifers as well as drilling a well and trenching in rocky conditions moreover those approaches have long term environmental consequences such as groundwater depletion and local ecosystem disruption on the other hand rwh as well as water reuse approaches can be considered as more cost effective and potentially environmental friendly solutions rwh has become the conventional alternative water supply due to little maintenance required cost effectiveness and communities preference over reclaimed water sources akter and ahmed 2015 inamdar et al 2013 jasrotia et al 2009a musayev et al 2018 petit boix et al 2018 the application of rwh systems traces back to the neolithic age or around 10 000 bce to 4500 bce pandey et al 2003 varma and tiwari 1995 archeologists found waterproof receptacles lime cisterns from this period in the floor of houses in a small former village in southwest asia other examples can be found in jerusalem and greece dating back to roughly 2500 and 1700 bce respectively pandey et al 2003 generally rwh is defined as the methods for collecting and storing rainwater which can provide secure accessible and affordable water supply for various purposes such as agriculture industry and domestic use al adamat 2012 chowdhury et al 2010 hassani et al 2016 nikvar hassani et al 2018 petit boix et al 2018 samson and elangovan 2015 terêncio et al 2018 in developing countries mostly in asia and africa where household water consumption is low rwh can cover a large portion of water demand de winnaar et al 2007 handia et al 2003 kahinda et al 2008 mati et al 2006 senay and verdin 2004 also it plays a significant role in many asian countries where the government has supported rwh because of its low implementation costs campisano et al 2017 musayev et al 2018 petit boix et al 2018 for instance it is reported that to supply irrigation water and supplemental drinking water in china 5 5 million water tanks have been constructed since 2001 gould et al 2014 the hybrid application of gis and mcda has been frequently used for water resources management chowdhury et al 2010 jha et al 2014b krois and schulte 2014 melville shreeve et al 2016 jozaghi et al 2018 khorrami et al 2019 khorrami 2019 gis and remote sensing rs as geospatial technologies play a central role in water resources planning and management esri 2011 this is due to their spatial analysis capability dealing with multiple datasets representing biophysical and anthropogenic criteria as well as suitability for application in a wide range of geographic areas al adamat et al 2010 al shabeeb 2016 chowdhury et al 2010 jasrotia et al 2009b ammar et al 2016 categorized compared and identified three sets of guidelines i e fao 2003 imsd 1995 oweis et al 1998 to select suitable rwh locations and respective characteristics for the application of a common rwh technique in asars jha et al 2014b proposed a methodology for evaluating rwh potential and identifying sites for different rwh structures using geospatial and mcda techniques demonstrated in a case study in saudi arabia mahmoud and alazba 2015 identified suitable areas for sustainable rwh and storage in egypt using rs and a decision support system in general during the 1990s studies focused primarily on biophysical criteria however after 2000 socio economic parameters and other criteria were integrated as well de winnaar et al 2007 gupta et al 1997 padmavathy et al 1993 prinz 1998 senay and verdin 2004 terêncio et al 2018 yusof et al 2000 most of the related studies showed that the selection of appropriate criteria and the adoption of practical approaches are critical factors in the successful application of geospatial and mcda techniques in mapping potential sites for rwh structures jha et al 2014b jha and peiffer 2006 there are various key criteria which must be considered including hydrology topography agronomy and soil parameters besides essential impacts of socio economic factors should be considered to obtain more reliable results and to ensure the success of rwh techniques fao 2003 jha et al 2014a the socio economic considerations such as the availability of storage spaces suitable distance from drainage networks roads urban area faults farms and wells were previously addressed by earlier studies conducted in asars al adamat 2008 al adamat et al 2010 al shabeeb 2016 ammar et al 2016 de winnaar et al 2007 jha et al 2014b lani et al 2018 madrucci et al 2008 mbilinyi et al 2007a yalcin 2008 besides there are common rwh systems in asars proposed by previous studies including ponds and pans check dams terracing percolation tanks nala bunds and gully plugs al adamat et al 2012 al adamat et al 2010 durbude and venkatesh 2004 isioye 2012 kadam et al 2012 krois and schulte 2014 moges 2009b ramakrishnan et al 2009 tumbo et al 2013 weerasinghe et al 2011 locating rwh potential areas and selection of appropriate rwh systems is highly site specific and proposed rwh system for one place cannot necessarily be used for other areas jasrotia et al 2009a this paper aims to propose a practical methodology to identify potential zones to implement rwh and examine suitable rwh techniques in asars using gis and mcda systems since there is no comprehensive investigation about rwh in iran at basin scale the present study is a contribution to the research field in terms of the scale of the case study the incorporation of both biophysical and socio economic factors as well as assessment of the implication of rwh systems on alleviation of the current water shortages obtained results are deemed to be useful for decision makers and local officials in the future planning and water resources management by providing an initial overview of rwh potential assessment of the study area to guide further studies to obtain actual harvestable amount of water and devising executable management planning also the utilized literatures can be considered a reasonably broad set of available resources in arid and semi arid areas for future studies 2 material and methods in the present study biophysical factors of rainfall land use slope soil type soil depth and drainage density were selected to evaluate potential rwh zones in addition six socio economic factors were used to delineate unsuitable sites including the distances to farmlands roads urban areas wells faults and drainage networks afterwards the most common rwh systems that were used and shown to be successful in asars were considered the selected socio economic factors and common rwh systems were conducted based on similar studies conducted in asars al adamat et al 2012 al adamat et al 2010 al shabeeb 2016 ammar et al 2016 bakir and xingnan 2008 de winnaar et al 2007 durbude and venkatesh 2004 isioye 2012 jha et al 2014b kadam et al 2012 krois and schulte 2014 lani et al 2018 mati et al 2006 mbilinyi et al 2007a moges 2009b ramakrishnan et al 2009 tumbo et al 2013 weerasinghe et al 2011 then optimum sites for each type of rwh system were proposed based on specific requirements of each system the considered systems are check dams pond and pans nala bunds gully plug percolation tank and terracing the methodology used in this study is shown in fig 1 2 1 study area the present case study the mashad plain basin mpb is located in the northeast of iran between 35 59 n to 37 03 n latitude and 60 06 to 58 22 e longitude with an area of 9762 km2 fig 2 the area is surrounded to the south by binaloud mountain range to the north by hezar masjid heights southeast by jamroud river basin and to the northwest by atrak river basin khashei siuki and sarbazi 2015 it has a semi arid to arid climate with an average monthly temperature varying from 11 6 c to 26 7 c shadmehri toosi et al 2019 the average land slope is around 16 2 and the elevation ranges from 856 to 3247 with a mean of 1487 m a review of 28 rain gauge stations over 24 years 1991 2015 shows annual average precipitation of 262 mm ranging from 178 to 381 mm irimo 2016 generally a v shaped mean monthly precipitation pattern is observed january february and march are the rainiest months while the precipitation trend decreases until july which is the driest month of the year and rises again until december the impacts of global change on temperature indicates an increasing trend whereas no significant changes have been observed in precipitation pattern rahimi et al 2019 the average annual evapotranspiration is reported to be 236 to 310 mm khrw 2017 granitic ultramafic and metamorphic rocks are the main geological constituents of the case study moreover hilly parts of mpb consists of discontinuous loess deposits and northern parts of the case study are sedimentary mainly comprised of dolomite limestone gypsiferous marls and conglomerate karimi et al 2017 according to natural resource conservation service classification a significant portion of the study area is covered by silt loam or loam group b which is distributed in the central and western parts of the area encompassing an area of 4810 km2 approximately 50 of study area the next major soil groups are sandy clay loam group c and clay loam group d which respectively cover 2481 km2 and 2470 km2 a significant portion of the central and outer edges of the case study according to the us department of soil conservation this classification shows that the region has a moderate relatively high and high runoff potential respectively different classes of land use and the associated percentage are presented in table 1 and the land use map is shown in fig 4 2 2 data collection and pre processing this study was conducted through distinctive efforts of data gathering and processing sources of the main factors used to identify suitable locations for rwh are shown in table 2 the raw data was acquired from several governmental agencies a field survey and satellite images all the available and generated data gis layers were geo referenced to mpb geographical coordinate system wgs 1984 utm zone 40n monthly rainfall data of 28 rain gauge stations for the 24 years 1991 to 2015 were collected from the iran meteorological organization irimo the annual average precipitation for each station was calculated and then interpolated using the kriging method in arcgis the slope map was generated using an aster dem surface and 3d analyst tool in arcgis environment the sub basin delineation and specification of the watershed outlet were performed using the hec geohms v 5 0 extension subsequently the drainage density map was obtained using the basin processing tool wherein the total length of the drainage networks at each sub basin was divided by the corresponding sub basin area according to the soil infiltration characteristic and texture the soil map of the study area was reclassified into three groups the original version of existing land use data was merely descriptive and not suitable to be inserted in the model directly therefore satellite images land survey data and traditional geological field mapping were used to determine the final land use map for the study area furthermore other thematic layers such as residential areas roads faults and stream buffer maps were also prepared using arcgis software 2 3 multi criteria decision analysis in order to generate the potential rwh map an analytic hierarchy process ahp based multi criteria decision analysis was used ahp is a mcda used for analyzing and organizing complex decisions based on professional knowledge and practice as well as mathematics saaty 1980 having selected proper biophysical layers these criteria were subjected to a review by the local experts with a background in civil engineering water resources environmental engineering hydrogeology and gis the selection of experts was based on their acquaintance with case study and their knowledge of water issues in general in order to compute the weights for each criteria a pairwise comparison matrix was created a m m real matrix where m is the number of evaluation criteria considered the relative importance of each criterion was determined with an analytic questionnaire survey to explore the opinions of the experts in the relative importance of the criteria selected for water harvesting using a scale of 1 to 9 table s1 in table 3 the criteria of the rwhpi are graded in terms of their relative significance and a pairwise comparison matrix is proposed to allow the relative importance of criteria to be compared across columns the normalized pairwise comparison matrix table 4 was then derived by making equal to 1 the sum of the entries on each column in table 3 i e each entry a jk of the normalized matrix computed as a jk a jk l 1 m a lk finally the criteria weight vector w that is an m dimensional column vector is built by averaging the relative importance of each parameter compared to all others i e the entries on each row of normalized matrix w j l 1 m a jl m the final result of normalized values and eventually corresponding weight w i of each criterion is shown in table 4 the normalized weights table 4 show that rainfall and drainage density are the most and least important criteria in rwh potential consistency across parameters was examined by computing a consistency ratio cr using the following formulas saaty 1980 1 cr ci ri where cr is the consistency ratio ci is the consistency index ri is a random consistency index which is 1 24 for 6 criteria consistency index ci is obtained by first computing the scalar x as the average of the elements of the vector whose jth element is the ratio of the jth element of the vector pairwise comparison matrix w to the corresponding element of the vector w then 2 ci x m m 1 ahp theory recommends that the cr must be equal or smaller than 0 1 to obtain acceptable results and in case of consistency ratio 0 1 the subjective judgment need to be revised by revisiting the pairwise comparisons weights the resulted cr in this study was 0 06 thus consistency is considered acceptable 2 4 layer selection the selection of criteria was based on an extensive literature review and expert opinion in the calculation of rainwater harvesting potential index rwhpi the highest possibility of runoff generation along with the highest rwh possibility were considered most of the biophysical criteria selected in this study have been largely used in the previous studies in asars an extensive review by ammar et al 2016 showed that in 48 studies regarding the rwh potential assessment using gis the criteria of the slope land use cover soil type and rainfall were used in 83 75 75 and 56 of studies respectively in this study in addition to these criteria two other criteria of soil depth and drainage density were used al adamat et al 2010 ammar et al 2016 de winnaar et al 2007 jha et al 2014b kadam et al 2012 mbilinyi et al 2007a mbilinyi et al 2007b the criteria are further described and justified below 2 4 1 rainfall the most influential factor towards high rwh potential is rainfall ammar et al 2016 jha et al 2014b the average annual rainfall data is one of the prerequisites for large scale rwh structures more precipitation on an area results in a higher potential for rwh al adamat 2008 in asars a minimum rainfall of 200 mm year has been recommended for the practical efficiency of rwh systems ammar et al 2016 when rainfall occurs over a catchment a percentage of the rain that falls on a basin is captured by vegetation and soil and the remainder is routed through waterways as flow higher values of rainfall indicate higher volume of water and higher potential runoff and consequently higher potential of local runoff capturing using rwh structures 2 4 2 slope runoff and infiltration will be heavily influenced by the topography of the basin slope has a direct impact on runoff generation and transformation from rainfall to runoff as the slope grows the rwh opportunity time decreases due to increased flow rates de winnaar et al 2007 jha et al 2014b moreover constructing rwh structures in areas with high slope percentage is barely considered economical owing to the large amount of earthwork required al adamat et al 2010 critchley et al 1991 ideally the slope of a catchment should be as gentle as possible for a high rwh potential mostly areas with the slopes higher than 5 are subjected to more erosion therefore it is necessary to consider erosion control measures in the areas where the catchment has a steeper slope hatibu et al 2001 2 4 3 soil type one of the main criteria for rwh planning is the soil since the soil texture governs infiltration characteristics of a soil naturally poorly drained clayey soils generate a higher amount of runoff while sandy soils generate less runoff jha et al 2014b 2 4 4 soil depth the soil depth is considered as representative of water storage capacity i e deeper soils have more water storage capacity moges 2004 according to fao 1990 soil depth can be categorized as deep 100 150 cm moderately deep 50 100 cm shallow 30 50 cm and very shallow 30 cm areas with shallow soils are potentially more appropriate for rwh technologies than deep as they have lower infiltration higher runoff coefficient and generate more water steenhuis et al 1995 2 4 5 land use different land use and vegetation cover have a distinct impact on the amount and velocity of runoff that flows downhill alaghmand et al 2014 jha et al 2014b shadmehri toosi et al 2019 dense vegetation forests and covered areas increase the amount of water infiltration and abstractions while urban and pasture covered areas increase the amount of surface flow a lower weight was assigned to land use since the infiltration effect was already accounted for by soil type in this case study there was no accurate evapotranspiration data with a proper temporal and spatial distribution over the study area to be utilized as another thematic layer this layer and its effect were not considered directly meanwhile the effect of evapotranspiration was implicitly captured by land use pattern which influences the runoff and evapotranspiration nevertheless beside the land use and vegetation cover evapotranspiration is highly dependent on assessing other factors including temperature and wind which is not within the scope of the present study 2 4 6 drainage density dense drainage networks can play a crucial role in the harvesting of stormwater time of concentration is significantly related to drainage density such that areas with higher drainage density are more suitable for rwh as it provides a system through which the runoff can flow and be harvested immediately meanwhile the transformation and generation of runoff is captured by other layers e g soil type and slope therefore drainage density is considered the least important factor in the present study 2 5 rainwater harvesting potential map in the present study a combination of the mcda and gis techniques was used which is known as a robust method for rwh zone identification al adamat et al 2010 ammar et al 2016 isioye 2012 moges 2009 according to the results of a comprehensive review by ammar et al 2016 integrated use of mcda and gis techniques for rwh identification in asars has been implemented for 37 of 48 reviewed studies which was the highest percentage amongst the implemented methods the main advantage of this method is its acceptability and simplicity of application to provide an overall assessment of rwh potential areas to delineate rwh suitable sites all the biophysical layers with their corresponding normalized weights were integrated using arcgis software therefore rwhpi was defined by comprising six criteria rainfall r slope s soil type st soil depth sd land use lu and drainage density dd moreover since each of the mentioned criterion has different feature classes based on the conducted literature review and experts opinion the proper weight corresponding to each feature class of layers was determined and then normalized as can be seen in table 5 al adamat et al 2012 al adamat et al 2010 ammar et al 2016 de winnaar et al 2007 durbude and venkatesh 2004 isioye 2012 jha et al 2014b kadam et al 2012 mbilinyi et al 2007a mbilinyi et al 2007b moges 2009b ramakrishnan et al 2009 using weighted linear combination wlc in the arcgis environment and corresponding normalized weights of these feature classes the six criteria layers were overlaid the process of implementing wlc technique includes standardizing each criteria map assigning weights of relative importance to them and generating a final map by combining the standardized maps according to their associated weights accordingly rwh map was computed in arcgis environment as follows 3 rwhpi r c r f s c s f st c st f sd c sd f lu c lu f dd c dd f where rwhpi is rainwater harvesting potential index the subscript c represents the normalized weight of each criterion and the subscript f represents the normalized weight of a feature class of each criterion rwhpi is a dimensionless indicator that is useful to find locations with a high potential of rwh within the study area finally the resultant map was classified into three potential zones using the jenks natural breaks method jenks 1967 fig 5 i e poor moderate good it is a data clustering method that determines the optimum arrangement of values into classes by minimizing the average deviation from the class mean while maximizing the deviation from the means of the other groups for each class jenks 1967 2 6 socio economic criteria studies have showed that consideration of only biophysical criteria as a primary factor does not guarantee success although there is less consensus about the socio economic factors as a secondary criterion studies revealed that insufficient insight into the socio economic aspects was one of the major reasons that rwh sites failed to function appropriately in asars moreover based on the proposed guidelines of the fao 2003 as the most comprehensive instruction set for the efficient planning and implementation of rwh systems consideration of both biophysical and socio economic criteria is necessary to ensure the success of rwh techniques and to facilitate the adoption of new rwh technology by local farmers selecting the appropriate socio economic parameters is critical to achieving the desired results since it considers the indirect economic effects to ensure the success of rwh area selection most of the selected socio economic criteria of the current study including distance to settlement road and rivers have been widely used in many earlier studies the rwh structures cannot be implemented within the drainage networks for environmental technical and financial reasons drainage networks are considered natural habitat and construction on adjacent lands is deemed both economically and environmentally costly acceptable distance from the roads should be considered to prevent any likelihood of future conflicts between road development and constructed structures al adamat 2008 for safety reasons e g flooding and conflicting with land uses it is crucial to exclude urban areas from being selected as rwh sites baban and wan yusof 2003 critchley et al 1991 also agricultural lands under cultivation are valuable resources for both economic and environmental aspects and must be excluded simply because they cannot be disturbed by water harvesting systems although the vicinity to rainwater harvesting systems can be an advantage if proper safety measures maintained al adamat et al 2010 baban and wan yusof 2003 kelly et al 2018 furthermore eliminating fault areas from the potential rwh zones is important since faults are considered as the major obstacles when deciding to construct a structure particularly for the important structures similar to rwh systems that have a significant role in water supply shatnawi 2006 these considerations prevent possible damages and lower the maintenance cost of the constructed structure as a result of probable incidents e g earthquakes and land slides building rwh structures in higher security places by allowing sufficient buffer zones is a reasonable strategy especially for the current study area where damaging earthquakes are possible finally a proper distance should be considered from a well s area of influence since they have significant socio economic importance for the local communities al adamat 2008 shatnawi 2006 this is to ensure there is adequate removal of pollutants before the infiltrating water reaches the water well since pollutant or contaminant may drain into the soil in this research the boolean method was used to eliminate unsuitable sites the boolean technique has been widely used in several similar studies to identify the optimum sites for rwh structures al adamat 2008 al adamat et al 2010 al shabeeb 2016 madrucci et al 2008 yalcin 2008 afterwards utilizing buffers of the criteria listed in table 6 the layers were overlaid in arcgis having as a result 0 and 1 values finally the generated rwhpi map from biophysical layers fig 5 was integrated with the socio economic criteria map which is illustrated in fig 3 these results were integrated into the rwh potential map output fig 5 to produce a final rwh suitability map of the study area 2 7 identification of suitable sites for different rwh structures having identified rwh potential zones in the study area and discarding the sites that are not suitable for rwh selection of the suitable areas for building different rwh structures was considered to achieve this goal the most conventional techniques that have been used and developed in asars were considered ponds and pans check dams terracing percolation tanks nala bunds and gully plug ammar et al 2016 based on the critical review of previous studies in this particular field as well as common local practices a suitability map for each type of structure was generated fig 6 table 7 lists the most common parameters that have been applied in developing planning and implementing such structures ammar et al 2016 2 7 1 ponds and pans ponds and pans are water storage structures that are either naturally occurring or excavated without a constructed wall this type of rwh system is usually situated in impermeable soil and lower points in a basin to capture surface runoff driven by gravity harvested water by these structures can be used for domestic water supply livestock and small scale irrigation australia 2008 martinson and thomas 2007 high evaporation losses are one of the major drawbacks of these systems especially when the contained water becomes shallower due to sediment deposition overall ponds and pans are low cost and can be implemented using local labour 2 7 2 check dams check dams are useful rwh systems for water supply where the potential of groundwater and perennial surface water sources e g rivers is low check dams are constructed over small streams having a gentle slope with embankments or walls on the downhill side the walls can be constructed from different available local materials the selected site should have sufficient thickness of permeable bed to enable groundwater recharge through the infiltration of stored water within a short period of time stored water can also be used directly for irrigation and domestic purposes these structures require limited land area and due to reducing stream flow and sediment downstream control soil erosion guyassa et al 2017 reddy et al 2017 reddy and syme 2014 vema et al 2018 similar to ponds and pans sedimentation control is necessary to maintain the system s functionality mekdaschi and liniger 2013 sawicki 1987 2 7 3 percolation tanks percolation tanks are typically built on second or third order streams to collect and store ephemeral watercourses for irrigation purposes and groundwater recharge enhancement this system is an artificially created surface water body with its reservoir lying on highly permeable land locating on highly fractured and weathered bed rocks enables percolation of surface water into lower strata thus the size of this system is governed by the percolation capacity of the layers underneath the tank bed presence of impermeable and semipermeable layers namely clay lenses is one of the main limitations for implementing this rwh system ammar et al 2016 2 7 4 nala bunds nala bunds are embankments constructed across nalas streams to impound running surface water from upstream sub basins with the purpose of controlling runoff velocity raising water percolation increasing recharge rate and holding silt flow to mitigate storage capacity reduction of downstream reservoirs it can be inferred that nala bund and percolation tank are almost similar in terms of functionality yet are named differently at different locations bakir and xingnan 2008 moges 2009b tumbo et al 2013 besides larger structures are mostly called percolation tank rather than nala bund 2 7 5 terracing terracing systems are constructed on a sloped plane by excavating soil from lower levels and depositing in upper elevations to form bunds along contours bunds are usually used for crop growing and the vegetation promotes the system s efficiency in soil and rainwater conservation within the bunds el atta et al 2010 most of the terrace technologies are usually practiced on sloping areas with unstable soils hudson 1981 bund surfaces allow for higher infiltration alleviate impacts of intense rainfall decrease soil bulk density and reduce sedimentation downhill el atta 2006 el atta et al 2010 hammad et al 2006 overall a terracing system is deemed costly in terms of construction time and labour besides regular maintenance of the embankments is required but if well maintained are highly effective in soil erosion control mekdaschi and liniger 2013 sawicki 1987 2 7 6 gully plugs gully plugs are constructed across streams and gullies that drain small sub basins during rainy seasons they hold the water allow for infiltration prevent erosion and plug gully formation during extreme events there are several methods to construct gully plugs depending on amount of precipitation topography and available material meanwhile they are usually constructed using local building materials e g stones clay and bushes the main objective of this system is soil conservation and recharge rate enhancement however as they can silt up the level of infiltration can be slow therefore they will need maintenance geyik 1986 mekdaschi and liniger 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainwater harvesting potential map in this study six biophysical layers fig 4 were integrated using corresponding weights of each layer and feature classes of each layer to calculate rwhpi and generate the rwh potential map that is shown in fig 5 according to the rainfall map shown in fig 4 the amount of precipitation ranges from 186 to 357 mm year the spatial distribution of rainfall map does not follow a particular pattern and the majority of the study area has annual precipitation ranging from 250 to 300 mm the 24 year data records indicated that over 60 of rainfall in this study area occurs during december february march april and may according to the slope map fig 4 on average about 36 9 of the study area has the slope ranges around 0 1 and 9 1 of the study area has a slope between 1 and 3 there are almost identical portions of the study area around 16 with the slopes ranges from 3 to 5 5 10 and 10 15 in the end only 4 1 of the study area is located on slopes 15 the study area is surrounded by mountain ranges at the north and south of the basin containing steep slopes while the central part has a more gentle slope making it suitable for rwh the soil map of the study area is shown in fig 4 nswri 2016 regarding soil type distribution about 49 28 of the study area is composed of a silt loam or loam which implies a moderate infiltration rate with moderately fine to moderately coarse textures 25 41 of the soil in the area is composed of sandy clay loam with low infiltration rates when thoroughly wetted and consist predominantly of soils with fine structure and a layer that impedes the downward movement of water 25 31 of soils are clay loam or clay representing the higher runoff potential areas with low infiltration rates and high swelling potential the soil depth map of the study area is shown in fig 4 classified into three classes 46 shallow 27 58 relatively deep and 20 9 deep the land use map shown in fig 4 reveals that 25 of the area consists of dry farming 24 of semi dense pasture 23 of low density pasture and about 19 of irrigated agriculture and gardens the drainage density map is presented in fig 4 in this research 1 of the study area has drainage density 0 01 20 between 0 01 and 0 05 31 around 0 05 0 10 33 ranges in 0 1 0 5 and about 15 has drainage densities higher than 0 50 km km2 79 of the study area has drainage densities higher than 0 05 implying that drainage density is fairly good in the study area the rwh potential map is presented in fig 5 the rwhpi ranges around 0 11 0 33 and based on these results the study area is categorized into three potential zones representing a poor rwhpi 0 111 0 209 b moderate rwhpi 0 209 0 243 and c good rwhpi 0 243 0 330 rwh potential the good rwh potential sites are spread almost over the entire study area specifically in the northwestern southeastern and centre portions of the plain covering an area of 2 543 km2 26 moreover moderate rwh potential zones are mainly spread near the centre of the study area covering an area of 4 456 km2 46 lastly the rwh potential in a major portion of the eastern and western part of the study area and also in the small central districts is categorized as poor the poor rwh potential zone covers an area of almost 2 762 km2 28 of the study area 3 2 potential sites for rwh technologies the main objective of the present study is to define a general framework for identifying potential zones for rwh as well as screening for suitable locations for rwh structures considering the effects of influential socio economic factors the most common techniques including ponds and pans check dams percolation tank nala bund terracing and gully plug that have been developed and used in asars as rwh structures were considered the rwh unsuitable sites fig 3 map were subtracted from rwh potential zone map in arcgis environment and the resulted output map was classified based on the specific condition prerequisite for building each rwh structures table 8 to obtain the suitability maps for each structure maps showing potential sites for different types of rwh technologies within the study area are shown in fig 6 the sites shown in the maps were identified by mcda with their associated suitability levels the areas with moderate and good suitability levels were considered suitable zones for constructing rwh structures based on that criteria pond and pans comprise most of the rwh suitable locations with 1100 km2 21 6 of the total study area with consideration of social economic factors along with check dams with 970 km2 19 1 followed by percolation tanks with 860 km2 16 9 terracing with 795 km2 15 6 nala bunds with 667 km2 13 1 and gully plugs with 147 km2 2 9 all six techniques are suitable in the study area in terms of rainfalls since it ranges from 200 to 1000 mm y slopes lower than 15 are considered suitable for most techniques while for slopes above 20 only terracing is considered suitable ponds and pans are only suitable for flat areas with slopes lower than 5 percolation tanks and nala bunds are suitable on moderate slopes of 5 10 and check dams are suitable for slopes 15 gully plugs are suitable for the middle range of slopes 15 to 20 different soil textures were given for different rwh structures among different soil types some soils are considered suitable for different structures e g silt loam for pond and pans percolation tank and nala bund while some of them may be suitable for one or few structures e g clay for gully plug a wide range of land use is considered suitable for rwh structures meanwhile including the socio economic buffering zone helped to preventing intervention with cultivation while also being close to the cultivated area 3 3 discussion of proposed methodology in the present study different aspects were considered to identify rank and validate the rwh potential areas such that not only biophysical factors were taken into account but also the socio economic factors and field knowledge were utilized moreover rwh structures criteria were considered upon a practical guideline based on the literature and practitioner s experiences it is worth mentioning that the main goal of the present study is to present a transferable practical framework for identifying potential areas for rwh based on the most relevant criteria combination of all presented criteria layers must be used to identify potential sites for rwh technologies however in order to transfer this framework to other case studies a review of layer weights and distance thresholds may need to be done by local experts also if any of these parameters were to be deleted the weight of remaining parameters would need to be justified in light of the fact that the layer is excluded the mashhad plain basin has faced many issues in terms of water shortage since decades ago currently 22 of water demand in khorasan razavi is supplied by surface water and the rest by underground resources according to khorasan razavi local official reports most dams of the region are operating at only 34 of their total capacity and the remainder is empty throughout the year the total capacity of the large dams in the province is 1549 m m3 of which 1211 m m3 is the iranian portion of water stored in the friendship dam shared by iran and turkmenistan according to local official reports in 2017 40 of the water consumption in the city of mashhad 26 46 m m3 was supplied from the friendship dam khorasan razavi regional water authority khrw 2017 the total annual utilized water from underground resources is about 6404 m m3 from which 5475 m m3 is extracted from wells 579 m m3 from aqueducts and 350 m m3 from springs however groundwater recharge potential is only 5300 m m3 which indicates that the total groundwater shortage is approximately 1 1 b m3 on average per year from a 33 year record as a result of groundwater over extraction wells have started to deplete resulting in a water crisis in the province mashhad is one of the cities faced water resources shortage and has the highest over exploitation of renewable water in the province with 70 m m3 of deficiency per year it is relevant to mention that this city is mainly surrounded by zones with good and moderate potential for rwh the result maps fig 5 show that a significant portion of the study area 72 has good to moderate rwh potential considering 24 year annual average rainfall calculation results depict that the whole study area annually receives a total of 2578 m m3 of rain of which 695 m m3 fall on areas with poor rwh potential while areas with moderate and good rwh potential receive a total of 1151 and 732 m m3 precipitation each year this indicates the high rwh potential of the study area in water supply and existing water crisis alleviation though further studies would be needed to investigate the extent to which that rainwater is already captured the practical feasibility of local use of the harvested water and implications for water allocation within the catchment in order to examine the rwh potential results the layer of existing dams of the study area was obtained from the regional water company of khorasan razavi khrw 2017 there are 6 main dams fig 5 in the study area and all of them except kardeh and chalidareh are located in the moderate rwh potential zones kardeh dam is located in the poor rwh zones rwhpi 0 20 and chalidareh dam is located in the good rwh potential areas rwhpi 0 25 according to the obtained data the average recorded operating level for the kardeh dam and chalidareh dam over the years of 2017 and 2018 was 27 8 and 84 2 of the designed capacity respectively which implies the significance of proper site selection in the future functionality of such structures that is firmly tied to the reliable estimation of the parameters of a surrounding environment based on the results fig 6 each rwh structure has its distribution over the study area and it is possible that in a single selected suitable site more than one structure is recommended to be constructed mpb has relatively more area suitable for percolation tank 23 and ponds and pan 23 compared to other structures with the exception of gully plug mpb nearly appears to offer the same degree of potential sites for different rwh structures suitable sites for pond and pans are located in areas with a low slope 5 and sandy clay soil which are aligned with previous studies like al adamat 2008 according to the earlier studies one of the leading factors in selecting suitable sites for check dams was the agriculture land cover since check dams can provide supplementary water for irrigation of crops jha et al 2014b the results also determined that suitable areas for check dams are located mostly in the central and northwestern portions of the study area with mild slopes and sandy clay loam soil texture that are typically suitable for agricultural purposes jha et al 2014b however suitable sites for percolation tanks are scattered around the entire study area except the central portion from southeast to the northwest consisting of moderately steep slope areas with soil texture of both silt loam and clay loam the majority of the suitable areas for implementing terraces have mainly steep slopes 10 15 with clay loam or clay soil moreover based on the results in table 8 it can be inferred that most of the good rwh potential areas can be considered for building pond and pans check dams and terracing since these systems have the highest area located in the good rwh potential zones in case of using these structures in areas with good rwh potential almost 158 135 and 110 m m3 of precipitation is received respectively providing an approximate upper bound on the potential for each system to be examined in future work to put this in context according to the local official reports the total water demand of mashhad as the biggest city of the study area for 2021 is predicted to be 286 7 m m3 a combination of technologies that yield higher amounts of harvested water with accurate localized configuration and design proper operation and maintenance are key factors to minimize losses and to maximize the actual quantity of water harvested generally it can be stated that there may be sufficient potential for implementing rwh technologies to supply a reasonable amount of water and ensure long term water security in the face of looming climate change though rainfall predictions under climate change would need to be evaluated to confirm this devising effective water management strategies at a basin or sub basin scale is the immediate need of the mbp unless efforts are made to utilize potential rain water efficiently and sustainably water scarcity will continue to be a major problem in the study area the rwh potential zone maps fig 3 and the map showing suitable areas for rwh structures fig 6 were derived based on a practical methodology that can be used for effective management micro level planning and implementation of rwh projects in the study area nevertheless there are uncertainties associated with the results uncertainties can be addressed either directly in the analysis e g sensitivity analysis or through discussing the role of uncertainty and its effect on how results from the method can be used guillaume et al 2017 the potential of rwh was evaluated based on historical rainfall data and effect of climate change was not considered moreover land use changes in the future regardless of lower weight in the analyses compared to rainfall can also be important these variations might alter the results in the future due to data limitations and scope of study some analysis e g evapotranspiration and infiltration quantification was not conducted these analyses are necessary to obtained realistic harvestable amount of water on the other hand selected criteria are well documented and have a rich theoretical foundation and application history the corresponding weight factors range with literature socio economic criteria were considered along with biophysical factors to incorporate a broader range of influential parameters thus obtained results are deemed to be useful for decision makers and local officials by providing an initial overall assessment of rwh potentials and different technologies which can be used further studies including detailed evapotranspiration evaluation based on the selected rwh systems are required for the next stage of studies to obtain actual harvestable amount of water and devising executable management planning the harvested rainwater can be directed and used for many purposes including irrigation soil moisture improvement domestic and livestock uses and enhancing groundwater resources agarwal et al 2001 kelly et al 2018 kumar et al 2005 lani et al 2018 lee et al 2010 mekdaschi and liniger 2013 rwh specifically has a significant impact on agricultural sector several factors considered important for agriculture can be provided by rwh including availability of accumulated surface water especially in non rainy seasons and proximity of water supply to crop cultivations to minimize pumping costs kourgialas et al 2015 thus rwh structures increase crop productivity expand crop areas and prolong the cropping period supporting prosperity of the agricultural sector calder et al 2008 datta 2015 guyassa et al 2017 vema et al 2018 4 conclusion rwh is a practical and favorable technique to partially address water scarcity by conserving freshwater supplies in asars however the assessment of rwh potential and the identification of appropriate areas for diverse rwh structures is challenging for water resources managers and planners particularly on large scales in this study potentially suitable areas for rwh in mpb have been identified using gis based mcda this study aimed to develop a generally applicable and simple water harvesting framework model for identification of potential zones for rwh structures incorporating socio economic and biophysical criteria based on the developed methods over the last three decades indeed incorporating the socio economic suitability factors increased the model s reliability in terms of considering a broader range of effective criteria and further generalizing the methodology from the output maps of the present study it can be mentioned that 48 of mpb is not suitable for rwh and the remainder classified into three rwh potential areas a good covering 26 of the total area b moderate 43 and c poor 31 the spatial distribution of the rwhpi of the study areas showed that the areas with good potential for rwh were fairly evenly distributed around the entire study area the suitable zones for building ponds and pan and check dams encompass an area of 1100 km2 21 6 and 970 km2 19 1 respectively followed by percolation tanks with 860 km2 16 9 terracing with 795 km2 15 6 nala bunds with 667 km2 13 1 and gully plugs with 147 km2 2 9 the comparison between the results of potential rwh areas with field observations where most of the dams were situated on moderate rwh potential zones lends support to the utility of the integrated use of mcda and gis nevertheless indicators of social and economic conditions along with local settings must be considered by decision making agencies consideration of socio economic and biophysical factors in rwh analysis will guarantee that water harvesting projects are considered as a part of the integrated economic social and cultural system the methodology and the analyses demonstrated in this study may also be considered efficient and suitable for other parts of the world particularly for developing countries independently of hydrological and agro climatic variations as it has generic applicability the recommended next stage studies include more detailed analysis of evapotranspiration in order to evaluate actual harvestable water at identified sites and assessment of global change implications on rwh potential and model refinement by coupling hydrological models with mcda and gis this could be beneficial towards identifying the best method for rwh potential assessment at large scales credit

5790,rainwater harvesting rwh is becoming one of the most promising alternative sources of fresh water which can be potentially captured and utilized particularly in arid and semi arid regions asars however identification of potential sites for rwh on a large scale has always been a great challenge and therefore requires further studies most recent studies on this topic select rwh zones employing geographic information systems gis combined with multi criteria analysis and hydrological models nevertheless there are a few studies mostly in small catchments that locate potential zones considering socio economic factors in this paper a gis based multi criteria decision analysis mcda is presented to identify potential rwh areas incorporating socio economic factors including distance from drainage networks roads urban areas faults farms and wells the proposed methodology was implemented at a large catchment scale in mashhad plain basin with an area of 9762 km2 located in the northeast of iran results show that 48 of the study area is not suitable for rwh the rest of the study area is divided into three potential zones that are poor moderate and good for rwh covering 31 43 and 26 of the potential areas respectively ponds and pans check dams and terracing were considered as the best practices for the good rwh potential areas preliminary estimates suggest that up to 158 135 and 110 m m3 of precipitation could be received respectively by each system keywords rainwater harvesting decision support system geospatial techniques water conservation 1 introduction the impact of freshwater scarcity in the next decades could dramatically increase due to accelerated climate change population growth intensive farming increasing industrialization and continuous pollution of water resources cai and rosegrant 2002 gleick 2003 jha et al 2014b ward et al 2010 the majority of countries in north africa and the near east as well as countries such as pakistan mexico south africa and large parts of india and china deal with water scarcity and its implications fao 2012 magrath 2007 watkins 2006 this trend resulted in a reduced capacity to supply the agricultural sector while meeting water needs for industrial and domestic demands therefore more resources and research should focus on water allocation strategies and the efficient use of possible sources of water pandey et al 2003 terêncio et al 2018 un 2007 wwap 2015 many of the available water resources management strategies may prove costly including placing long pipeline aqueducts pumping water from deep aquifers as well as drilling a well and trenching in rocky conditions moreover those approaches have long term environmental consequences such as groundwater depletion and local ecosystem disruption on the other hand rwh as well as water reuse approaches can be considered as more cost effective and potentially environmental friendly solutions rwh has become the conventional alternative water supply due to little maintenance required cost effectiveness and communities preference over reclaimed water sources akter and ahmed 2015 inamdar et al 2013 jasrotia et al 2009a musayev et al 2018 petit boix et al 2018 the application of rwh systems traces back to the neolithic age or around 10 000 bce to 4500 bce pandey et al 2003 varma and tiwari 1995 archeologists found waterproof receptacles lime cisterns from this period in the floor of houses in a small former village in southwest asia other examples can be found in jerusalem and greece dating back to roughly 2500 and 1700 bce respectively pandey et al 2003 generally rwh is defined as the methods for collecting and storing rainwater which can provide secure accessible and affordable water supply for various purposes such as agriculture industry and domestic use al adamat 2012 chowdhury et al 2010 hassani et al 2016 nikvar hassani et al 2018 petit boix et al 2018 samson and elangovan 2015 terêncio et al 2018 in developing countries mostly in asia and africa where household water consumption is low rwh can cover a large portion of water demand de winnaar et al 2007 handia et al 2003 kahinda et al 2008 mati et al 2006 senay and verdin 2004 also it plays a significant role in many asian countries where the government has supported rwh because of its low implementation costs campisano et al 2017 musayev et al 2018 petit boix et al 2018 for instance it is reported that to supply irrigation water and supplemental drinking water in china 5 5 million water tanks have been constructed since 2001 gould et al 2014 the hybrid application of gis and mcda has been frequently used for water resources management chowdhury et al 2010 jha et al 2014b krois and schulte 2014 melville shreeve et al 2016 jozaghi et al 2018 khorrami et al 2019 khorrami 2019 gis and remote sensing rs as geospatial technologies play a central role in water resources planning and management esri 2011 this is due to their spatial analysis capability dealing with multiple datasets representing biophysical and anthropogenic criteria as well as suitability for application in a wide range of geographic areas al adamat et al 2010 al shabeeb 2016 chowdhury et al 2010 jasrotia et al 2009b ammar et al 2016 categorized compared and identified three sets of guidelines i e fao 2003 imsd 1995 oweis et al 1998 to select suitable rwh locations and respective characteristics for the application of a common rwh technique in asars jha et al 2014b proposed a methodology for evaluating rwh potential and identifying sites for different rwh structures using geospatial and mcda techniques demonstrated in a case study in saudi arabia mahmoud and alazba 2015 identified suitable areas for sustainable rwh and storage in egypt using rs and a decision support system in general during the 1990s studies focused primarily on biophysical criteria however after 2000 socio economic parameters and other criteria were integrated as well de winnaar et al 2007 gupta et al 1997 padmavathy et al 1993 prinz 1998 senay and verdin 2004 terêncio et al 2018 yusof et al 2000 most of the related studies showed that the selection of appropriate criteria and the adoption of practical approaches are critical factors in the successful application of geospatial and mcda techniques in mapping potential sites for rwh structures jha et al 2014b jha and peiffer 2006 there are various key criteria which must be considered including hydrology topography agronomy and soil parameters besides essential impacts of socio economic factors should be considered to obtain more reliable results and to ensure the success of rwh techniques fao 2003 jha et al 2014a the socio economic considerations such as the availability of storage spaces suitable distance from drainage networks roads urban area faults farms and wells were previously addressed by earlier studies conducted in asars al adamat 2008 al adamat et al 2010 al shabeeb 2016 ammar et al 2016 de winnaar et al 2007 jha et al 2014b lani et al 2018 madrucci et al 2008 mbilinyi et al 2007a yalcin 2008 besides there are common rwh systems in asars proposed by previous studies including ponds and pans check dams terracing percolation tanks nala bunds and gully plugs al adamat et al 2012 al adamat et al 2010 durbude and venkatesh 2004 isioye 2012 kadam et al 2012 krois and schulte 2014 moges 2009b ramakrishnan et al 2009 tumbo et al 2013 weerasinghe et al 2011 locating rwh potential areas and selection of appropriate rwh systems is highly site specific and proposed rwh system for one place cannot necessarily be used for other areas jasrotia et al 2009a this paper aims to propose a practical methodology to identify potential zones to implement rwh and examine suitable rwh techniques in asars using gis and mcda systems since there is no comprehensive investigation about rwh in iran at basin scale the present study is a contribution to the research field in terms of the scale of the case study the incorporation of both biophysical and socio economic factors as well as assessment of the implication of rwh systems on alleviation of the current water shortages obtained results are deemed to be useful for decision makers and local officials in the future planning and water resources management by providing an initial overview of rwh potential assessment of the study area to guide further studies to obtain actual harvestable amount of water and devising executable management planning also the utilized literatures can be considered a reasonably broad set of available resources in arid and semi arid areas for future studies 2 material and methods in the present study biophysical factors of rainfall land use slope soil type soil depth and drainage density were selected to evaluate potential rwh zones in addition six socio economic factors were used to delineate unsuitable sites including the distances to farmlands roads urban areas wells faults and drainage networks afterwards the most common rwh systems that were used and shown to be successful in asars were considered the selected socio economic factors and common rwh systems were conducted based on similar studies conducted in asars al adamat et al 2012 al adamat et al 2010 al shabeeb 2016 ammar et al 2016 bakir and xingnan 2008 de winnaar et al 2007 durbude and venkatesh 2004 isioye 2012 jha et al

each type of rwh system were proposed based on specific requirements of each system the considered systems are check dams pond and pans nala bunds gully plug percolation tank and terracing the methodology used in this study is shown in fig 1 2 1 study area the present case study the mashad plain basin mpb is located in the northeast of iran between 35 59 n to 37 03 n latitude and 60 06 to 58 22 e longitude with an area of 9762 km2 fig 2 the area is surrounded to the south by binaloud mountain range to the north by hezar masjid heights southeast by jamroud river basin and to the northwest by atrak river basin khashei siuki and sarbazi 2015 it has a semi arid to arid climate with an average monthly temperature varying from 11 6 c to 26 7 c shadmehri toosi et al 2019 the average land slope is around 16 2 and the elevation ranges from 856 to 3247 with a mean of 1487 m a review of 28 rain gauge stations over 24 years 1991 2015 shows annual average precipitation of 262 mm ranging from 178 to 381 mm irimo 2016 generally a v shaped mean monthly precipitation pattern is observed january february and march are the rainiest months while the precipitation trend decreases until july which is the driest month of the year and rises again until december the impacts of global change on temperature indicates an increasing trend whereas no significant changes have been observed in precipitation pattern rahimi et al 2019 the average annual evapotranspiration is reported to be 236 to 310 mm khrw 2017 granitic ultramafic and metamorphic rocks are the main geological constituents of the case study moreover hilly parts of mpb consists of discontinuous loess deposits and northern parts of the case study are sedimentary mainly comprised of dolomite limestone gypsiferous marls and conglomerate karimi et al 2017 according to natural resource conservation service classification a significant portion of the study area is covered by silt loam or loam group b which is distributed in the central and western parts of the area encompassing an area of 4810 km2 approximately 50 of study area the next major soil groups are sandy clay loam group c and clay loam group d which respectively cover 2481 km2 and 2470 km2 a significant portion of the central and outer edges of the case study according to the us department of soil conservation this classification shows that the region has a moderate relatively high and high runoff potential respectively different classes of land use and the associated percentage are presented in table 1 and the land use map is shown in fig 4 2 2 data collection and pre processing this study was conducted through distinctive efforts of data gathering and processing sources of the main factors used to identify suitable locations for rwh are shown in table 2 the raw data was acquired from several governmental agencies a field survey and satellite images all the available and generated data gis layers were geo referenced to mpb geographical coordinate system wgs 1984 utm zone 40n monthly rainfall data of 28 rain gauge stations for the 24 years 1991 to 2015 were collected from the iran meteorological organization irimo the annual average precipitation for each station was calculated and then interpolated using the kriging method in arcgis the slope map was generated using an aster dem surface and 3d analyst tool in arcgis environment the sub basin delineation and specification of the watershed outlet were performed using the hec geohms v 5 0 extension subsequently the drainage density map was obtained using the basin processing tool wherein the total length of the drainage networks at each sub basin was divided by the corresponding sub basin area according to the soil infiltration characteristic and texture the soil map of the study area was reclassified into three groups the original version of existing land use data was merely descriptive and not suitable to be inserted in the model directly therefore satellite images land survey data and traditional geological field mapping were used to determine the final land use map for the study area furthermore other thematic layers such as residential areas roads faults and stream buffer maps were also prepared using arcgis software 2 3 multi criteria decision analysis in order to generate the potential rwh map an analytic hierarchy process ahp based multi criteria decision analysis was used ahp is a mcda used for analyzing and organizing complex decisions based on professional knowledge and practice as well as mathematics saaty 1980 having selected proper biophysical layers these criteria were subjected to a review by the local experts with a background in civil engineering water resources environmental engineering hydrogeology and gis the selection of experts was based on their acquaintance with case study and their knowledge of water issues in general in order to compute the weights for each criteria a pairwise comparison matrix was created a m m real matrix where m is the number of evaluation criteria considered the relative importance of each criterion was determined with an analytic questionnaire survey to explore the opinions of the experts in the relative importance of the criteria selected for water harvesting using a scale of 1 to 9 table s1 in table 3 the criteria of the rwhpi are graded in terms of their relative significance and a pairwise comparison matrix is proposed to allow the relative importance of criteria to be compared across columns the normalized pairwise comparison matrix table 4 was then derived by making equal to 1 the sum of the entries on each column in table 3 i e each entry a jk of the normalized matrix computed as a jk a jk l 1 m a lk finally the criteria weight vector w that is an m dimensional column vector is built by averaging the relative importance of each parameter compared to all others i e the entries on each row of normalized matrix w j l 1 m a jl m the final result of normalized values and eventually corresponding weight w i of each criterion is shown in table 4 the normalized weights table 4 show that rainfall and drainage density are the most and least important criteria in rwh potential consistency across parameters was examined by computing a consistency ratio cr using the following formulas saaty 1980 1 cr ci ri where cr is the consistency ratio ci is the consistency index ri is a random consistency index which is 1 24 for 6 criteria consistency index ci is obtained by first computing the scalar x as the average of the elements of the vector whose jth element is the ratio of the jth element of the vector pairwise comparison matrix w to the corresponding element of the vector w then 2 ci x m m 1 ahp theory recommends that the cr must be equal or smaller than 0 1 to obtain acceptable results and in case of consistency ratio 0 1 the subjective judgment need to be revised by revisiting the pairwise comparisons weights the resulted cr in this study was 0 06 thus consistency is considered acceptable 2 4 layer selection the selection of criteria was based on an extensive literature review and expert opinion in the calculation of rainwater harvesting potential index rwhpi the highest possibility of runoff generation along with the highest rwh possibility were considered most of the biophysical criteria selected in this study have been largely used in the previous studies in asars an extensive review by ammar et al 2016 showed that in 48 studies regarding the rwh potential assessment using gis the criteria of the slope land use cover soil type and rainfall were used in 83 75 75 and 56 of studies respectively in this study in addition to these criteria two other criteria of soil depth and drainage density were used al adamat et al 2010 ammar et al 2016 de winnaar et al 2007 jha et al 2014b kadam et al 2012 mbilinyi et al 2007a mbilinyi et al 2007b the criteria are further described and justified below 2 4 1 rainfall the most influential factor towards high rwh potential is rainfall ammar et al 2016 jha et al 2014b the average annual rainfall data is one of the prerequisites for large scale rwh structures more precipitation on an area results in a higher potential for rwh al adamat 2008 in asars a minimum rainfall of 200 mm year has been recommended for the practical efficiency of rwh systems ammar et al 2016 when rainfall occurs over a catchment a percentage of the rain that falls on a basin is captured by vegetation and soil and the remainder is routed through waterways as flow higher values of rainfall indicate higher volume of water and higher potential runoff and consequently higher potential of local runoff capturing using rwh structures 2 4 2 slope runoff and infiltration will be heavily influenced by the topography of the basin slope has a direct impact on runoff generation and transformation from rainfall to runoff as the slope grows the rwh opportunity time decreases due to increased flow rates de winnaar et al 2007 jha et al 2014b moreover constructing rwh structures in areas with high slope percentage is barely considered economical owing to the large amount of earthwork required al adamat et al 2010 critchley et al 1991 ideally the slope of a catchment should be as gentle as possible for a high rwh potential mostly areas with the slopes higher than 5 are subjected to more erosion therefore it is necessary to consider erosion control measures in the areas where the catchment has a steeper slope hatibu et al 2001 2 4 3 soil type one of the main criteria for rwh planning is the soil since the soil texture governs infiltration characteristics of a soil naturally poorly drained clayey soils generate a higher amount of runoff while sandy soils generate less runoff jha et al 2014b 2 4 4 soil depth the soil depth is considered as representative of water storage capacity i e deeper soils have more water storage capacity moges 2004 according to fao 1990 soil depth can be categorized as deep 100 150 cm moderately deep 50 100 cm shallow 30 50 cm and very shallow 30 cm areas with shallow soils are potentially more appropriate for rwh technologies than deep as they have lower infiltration higher runoff coefficient and generate more water steenhuis et al 1995 2 4 5 land use different land use and vegetation cover have a distinct impact on the amount and velocity of runoff that flows downhill alaghmand et al 2014 jha et al 2014b shadmehri toosi et al 2019 dense vegetation forests and covered areas increase the amount of water infiltration and abstractions while urban and pasture covered areas increase the amount of surface flow a lower weight was assigned to land use since the infiltration effect was already accounted for by soil type in this case study there was no accurate evapotranspiration data with a proper temporal and spatial distribution over the study area to be utilized as another thematic layer this layer and its effect were not considered directly meanwhile the effect of evapotranspiration was implicitly captured by land use pattern which influences the runoff and evapotranspiration nevertheless beside the land use and vegetation cover evapotranspiration is highly dependent on assessing other factors including temperature and wind which is not within the scope of the present study 2 4 6 drainage density dense drainage networks can play a crucial role in the harvesting of stormwater time of concentration is significantly related to drainage density such that areas with higher drainage density are more suitable for rwh as it provides a system through which the runoff can flow and be harvested immediately meanwhile the transformation and generation of runoff is captured by other layers e g soil type and slope therefore drainage density is considered the least important factor in the present study 2 5 rainwater harvesting potential map in the present study a combination of the mcda and gis techniques was used which is known as a robust method for rwh zone identification al adamat et al 2010 ammar et al 2016 isioye 2012 moges 2009 according to the results of a comprehensive review by ammar et al 2016 integrated use of mcda and gis techniques for rwh identification in asars has been implemented for 37 of 48 reviewed studies which was the highest percentage amongst the implemented methods the main advantage of this method is its acceptability and simplicity of application to provide an overall assessment of rwh potential areas to delineate rwh suitable sites all the biophysical layers with their corresponding normalized weights were integrated using arcgis software therefore rwhpi was defined by comprising six criteria rainfall r slope s soil type st soil depth sd land use lu and drainage density dd moreover since each of the mentioned criterion has different feature classes based on the conducted literature review and experts opinion the proper weight corresponding to each feature class of layers was determined and then normalized as can be seen in table 5 al adamat et al 2012 al adamat et al 2010 ammar et al 2016 de winnaar et al 2007 durbude and venkatesh 2004 isioye 2012 jha et al 2014b kadam et al 2012 mbilinyi et al 2007a mbilinyi et al 2007b moges 2009b ramakrishnan et al 2009 using weighted linear combination wlc in the arcgis environment and corresponding normalized weights of these feature classes the six criteria layers were overlaid the process of implementing wlc technique includes standardizing each criteria map assigning weights of relative importance to them and generating a final map by combining the standardized maps according to their associated weights accordingly rwh map was computed in arcgis environment as follows 3 rwhpi r c r f s c s f st c st f sd c sd f lu c lu f dd c dd f where rwhpi is rainwater harvesting potential index the subscript c represents the normalized weight of each criterion and the subscript f represents the normalized weight of a feature class of each criterion rwhpi is a dimensionless indicator that is useful to find locations with a high potential of rwh within the study area finally the resultant map was classified into three potential zones using the jenks natural breaks method jenks 1967 fig 5 i e poor moderate good it is a data clustering method that determines the optimum arrangement of values into classes by minimizing the average deviation from the class mean while maximizing the deviation from the means of the other groups for each class jenks 1967 2 6 socio economic criteria studies have showed that consideration of only biophysical criteria as a primary factor does not guarantee success although there is less consensus about the socio economic factors as a secondary criterion studies revealed that insufficient insight into the socio economic aspects was one of the major reasons that rwh sites failed to function appropriately in asars moreover based on the proposed guidelines of the fao 2003 as the most comprehensive instruction set for the efficient planning and implementation of rwh systems consideration of both biophysical and socio economic criteria is necessary to ensure the success of rwh techniques and to facilitate the adoption of new rwh technology by local farmers selecting the appropriate socio economic parameters is critical to achieving the desired results since it considers the indirect economic effects to ensure the success of rwh area selection most of the selected socio economic criteria of the current study including distance to settlement road and rivers have been widely used in many earlier studies the rwh structures cannot be implemented within the drainage networks for environmental technical and financial reasons drainage networks are considered natural habitat and construction on adjacent lands is deemed both economically and environmentally costly acceptable distance from the roads should be considered to prevent any likelihood of future conflicts between road development and constructed structures al adamat 2008 for safety reasons e g flooding and conflicting with land uses it is crucial to exclude urban areas from being selected as rwh sites baban and wan yusof 2003 critchley et al 1991 also agricultural lands under cultivation are valuable resources for both economic and environmental aspects and must be excluded simply because they cannot be disturbed by water harvesting systems although the vicinity to rainwater harvesting systems can be an advantage if proper safety measures maintained al adamat et al 2010 baban and wan yusof 2003 kelly et al 2018 furthermore eliminating fault areas from the potential rwh zones is important since faults are considered as the major obstacles when deciding to construct a structure particularly for the important structures similar to rwh systems that have a significant role in water supply shatnawi 2006 these considerations prevent possible damages and lower the maintenance cost of the constructed structure as a result of probable incidents e g earthquakes and land slides building rwh structures in higher security places by allowing sufficient buffer zones is a reasonable strategy especially for the current study area where damaging earthquakes are possible finally a proper distance should be considered from a well s area of influence since they have significant socio economic importance for the local communities al adamat 2008 shatnawi 2006 this is to ensure there is adequate removal of pollutants before the infiltrating water reaches the water well since pollutant or contaminant may drain into the soil in this research the boolean method was used to eliminate unsuitable sites the boolean technique has been widely used in several similar studies to identify the optimum sites for rwh structures al adamat 2008 al adamat et al 2010 al shabeeb 2016 madrucci et al 2008 yalcin 2008 afterwards utilizing buffers of the criteria listed in table 6 the layers were overlaid in arcgis having as a result 0 and 1 values finally the generated rwhpi map from biophysical layers fig 5 was integrated with the socio economic criteria map which is illustrated in fig 3 these results were integrated into the rwh potential map output fig 5 to produce a final rwh suitability map of the study area 2 7 identification of suitable sites for different rwh structures having identified rwh potential zones in the study area and discarding the sites that are not suitable for rwh selection of the suitable areas for building different rwh structures was considered to achieve this goal the most conventional techniques that have been used and developed in asars were considered ponds and pans check dams terracing percolation tanks nala bunds and gully plug ammar et al 2016 based on the critical review of previous studies in this particular field as well as common local practices a suitability map for each type of structure was generated fig 6 table 7 lists the most common parameters that have been applied in developing planning and implementing such structures ammar et al 2016 2 7 1 ponds and pans ponds and pans are water storage structures that are either naturally occurring or excavated without a constructed wall this type of rwh system is usually situated in impermeable soil and lower points in a basin to capture surface runoff driven by gravity harvested water by these structures can be used for domestic water supply livestock and small scale irrigation australia 2008 martinson and thomas 2007 high evaporation losses are one of the major drawbacks of these systems especially when the contained water becomes shallower due to sediment deposition overall ponds and pans are low cost and can be implemented using local labour 2 7 2 check dams check dams are useful rwh systems for water supply where the potential of groundwater and perennial surface water sources e g rivers is low check dams are constructed over small streams having a gentle slope with embankments or walls on the downhill side the walls can be constructed from different available local materials the selected site should have sufficient thickness of permeable bed to enable groundwater recharge through the infiltration of stored water within a short period of time stored water can also be used directly for irrigation and domestic purposes these structures require limited land area and due to reducing stream flow and sediment downstream control soil erosion guyassa et al 2017 reddy et al 2017 reddy and syme 2014 vema et al 2018 similar to ponds and pans sedimentation control is necessary to maintain the system s functionality mekdaschi and liniger 2013 sawicki 1987 2 7 3 percolation tanks percolation tanks are typically built on second or third order streams to collect and store ephemeral watercourses for irrigation purposes and groundwater recharge enhancement this system is an artificially created surface water body with its reservoir lying on highly permeable land locating on highly fractured and weathered bed rocks enables percolation of surface water into lower strata thus the size of this system is governed by the percolation capacity of the layers underneath the tank bed presence of impermeable and semipermeable layers namely clay lenses is one of the main limitations for implementing this rwh system ammar et al 2016 2 7 4 nala bunds nala bunds are embankments constructed across nalas streams to impound running surface water from upstream sub basins with the purpose of controlling runoff velocity raising water percolation increasing recharge rate and holding silt flow to mitigate storage capacity reduction of downstream reservoirs it can be inferred that nala bund and percolation tank are almost similar in terms of functionality yet are named differently at different locations bakir and xingnan 2008 moges 2009b tumbo et al 2013 besides larger structures are mostly called percolation tank rather than nala bund 2 7 5 terracing terracing systems are constructed on a sloped plane by excavating soil from lower levels and depositing in upper elevations to form bunds along contours bunds are usually used for crop growing and the vegetation promotes the system s efficiency in soil and rainwater conservation within the bunds el atta et al 2010 most of the terrace technologies are usually practiced on sloping areas with unstable soils hudson 1981 bund surfaces allow for higher infiltration alleviate impacts of intense rainfall decrease soil bulk density and reduce sedimentation downhill el atta 2006 el atta et al 2010 hammad et al 2006 overall a terracing system is deemed costly in terms of construction time and labour besides regular maintenance of the embankments is required but if well maintained are highly effective in soil erosion control mekdaschi and liniger 2013 sawicki 1987 2 7 6 gully plugs gully plugs are constructed across streams and gullies that drain small sub basins during rainy seasons they hold the water allow for infiltration prevent erosion and plug gully formation during extreme events there are several methods to construct gully plugs depending on amount of precipitation topography and available material meanwhile they are usually constructed using local building materials e g stones clay and bushes the main objective of this system is soil conservation and recharge rate enhancement however as they can silt up the level of infiltration can be slow therefore they will need maintenance geyik 1986 mekdaschi and liniger 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainwater harvesting potential map in this study six biophysical layers fig 4 were integrated using corresponding weights of each layer and feature classes of each layer to calculate rwhpi and generate the rwh potential map that is shown in fig 5 according to the rainfall map shown in fig 4 the amount of precipitation ranges from 186 to 357 mm year the spatial distribution of rainfall map does not follow a particular pattern and the majority of the study area has annual precipitation ranging from 250 to 300 mm the 24 year data records indicated that over 60 of rainfall in this study area occurs during december february march april and may according to the slope map fig 4 on average about 36 9 of the study area has the slope ranges around 0 1 and 9 1 of the study area has a slope between 1 and 3 there are almost identical portions of the study area around 16 with the slopes ranges from 3 to 5 5 10 and 10 15 in the end only 4 1 of the study area is located on slopes 15 the study area is surrounded by mountain ranges at the north and south of the basin containing steep slopes while the central part has a more gentle slope making it suitable for rwh the soil map of the study area is shown in fig 4 nswri 2016 regarding soil type distribution about 49 28 of the study area is composed of a silt loam or loam which implies a moderate infiltration rate with moderately fine to moderately coarse textures 25 41 of the soil in the area is composed of sandy clay loam with low infiltration rates when thoroughly wetted and consist predominantly of soils with fine structure and a layer that impedes the downward movement of water 25 31 of soils are clay loam or clay representing the higher runoff potential areas with low infiltration rates and high swelling potential the soil depth map of the study area is shown in fig 4 classified into three classes 46 shallow 27 58 relatively deep and 20 9 deep the land use map shown in fig 4 reveals that 25 of the area consists of dry farming 24 of semi dense pasture 23 of low density pasture and about 19 of irrigated agriculture and gardens the drainage density map is presented in fig 4 in this research 1 of the study area has drainage density 0 01 20 between 0 01 and 0 05 31 around 0 05 0 10 33 ranges in 0 1 0 5 and about 15 has drainage densities higher than 0 50 km km2 79 of the study area has drainage densities higher than 0 05 implying that drainage density is fairly good in the study area the rwh potential map is presented in fig 5 the rwhpi ranges around 0 11 0 33 and based on these results the study area is categorized into three potential zones representing a poor rwhpi 0 111 0 209 b moderate rwhpi 0 209 0 243 and c good rwhpi 0 243 0 330 rwh potential the good rwh potential sites are spread almost over the entire study area specifically in the northwestern southeastern and centre portions of the plain covering an area of 2 543 km2 26 moreover moderate rwh potential zones are mainly spread near the centre of the study area covering an area of 4 456 km2 46 lastly the rwh potential in a major portion of the eastern and western part of the study area and also in the small central districts is categorized as poor the poor rwh potential zone covers an area of almost 2 762 km2 28 of the study area 3 2 potential sites for rwh technologies the main objective of the present study is to define a general framework for identifying potential zones for rwh as well as screening for suitable locations for rwh structures considering the effects of influential socio economic factors the most common techniques including ponds and pans check dams percolation tank nala bund terracing and gully plug that have been developed and used in asars as rwh structures were considered the rwh unsuitable sites fig 3 map were subtracted from rwh potential zone map in arcgis environment and the resulted output map was classified based on the specific condition prerequisite for building each rwh structures table 8 to obtain the suitability maps for each structure maps showing potential sites for different types of rwh technologies within the study area are shown in fig 6 the sites shown in the maps were identified by mcda with their associated suitability levels the areas with moderate and good suitability levels were considered suitable zones for constructing rwh structures based on that criteria pond and pans comprise most of the rwh suitable locations with 1100 km2 21 6 of the total study area with consideration of social economic factors along with check dams with 970 km2 19 1 followed by percolation tanks with 860 km2 16 9 terracing with 795 km2 15 6 nala bunds with 667 km2 13 1 and gully plugs with 147 km2 2 9 all six techniques are suitable in the study area in terms of rainfalls since it ranges from 200 to 1000 mm y slopes lower than 15 are considered suitable for most techniques while for slopes above 20 only terracing is considered suitable ponds and pans are only suitable for flat areas with slopes lower than 5 percolation tanks and nala bunds are suitable on moderate slopes of 5 10 and check dams are suitable for slopes 15 gully plugs are suitable for the middle range of slopes 15 to 20 different soil textures were given for different rwh structures among different soil types some soils are considered suitable for different structures e g silt loam for pond and pans percolation tank and nala bund while some of them may be suitable for one or few structures e g clay for gully plug a wide range of land use is considered suitable for rwh structures meanwhile including the socio economic buffering zone helped to preventing intervention with cultivation while also being close to the cultivated area 3 3 discussion of proposed methodology in the present study different aspects were considered to identify rank and validate the rwh potential areas such that not only biophysical factors were taken into account but also the socio economic factors and field knowledge were utilized moreover rwh structures criteria were considered upon a practical guideline based on the literature and practitioner s experiences it is worth mentioning that the main goal of the present study is to present a transferable practical framework for identifying potential areas for rwh based on the most relevant criteria combination of all presented criteria layers must be used to identify potential sites for rwh technologies however in order to transfer this framework to other case studies a review of layer weights and distance thresholds may need to be done by local experts also if any of these parameters were to be deleted the weight of remaining parameters would need to be justified in light of the fact that the layer is excluded the mashhad plain basin has faced many issues in terms of water shortage since decades ago currently 22 of water demand in khorasan razavi is supplied by surface water and the rest by underground resources according to khorasan razavi local official reports most dams of the region are operating at only 34 of their total capacity and the remainder is empty throughout the year the total capacity of the large dams in the province is 1549 m m3 of which 1211 m m3 is the iranian portion of water stored in the friendship dam shared by iran and turkmenistan according to local official reports in 2017 40 of the water consumption in the city of mashhad 26 46 m m3 was supplied from the friendship dam khorasan razavi regional water authority khrw 2017 the total annual utilized water from underground resources is about 6404 m m3 from which 5475 m m3 is extracted from wells 579 m m3 from aqueducts and 350 m m3 from springs however groundwater recharge potential is only 5300 m m3 which indicates that the total groundwater shortage is approximately 1 1 b m3 on average per year from a 33 year record as a result of groundwater over extraction wells have started to deplete resulting in a water crisis in the province mashhad is one of the cities faced water resources shortage and has the highest over exploitation of renewable water in the province with 70 m m3 of deficiency per year it is relevant to mention that this city is mainly surrounded by zones with good and moderate potential for rwh the result maps fig 5 show that a significant portion of the study area 72 has good to moderate rwh potential considering 24 year annual average rainfall calculation results depict that the whole study area annually receives a total of 2578 m m3 of rain of which 695 m m3 fall on areas with poor rwh potential while areas with moderate and good rwh potential receive a total of 1151 and 732 m m3 precipitation each year this indicates the high rwh potential of the study area in water supply and existing water crisis alleviation though further studies would be needed to investigate the extent to which that rainwater is already captured the practical feasibility of local use of the harvested water and implications for water allocation within the catchment in order to examine the rwh potential results the layer of existing dams of the study area was obtained from the regional water company of khorasan razavi khrw 2017 there are 6 main dams fig 5 in the study area and all of them except kardeh and chalidareh are located in the moderate rwh potential zones kardeh dam is located in the poor rwh zones rwhpi 0 20 and chalidareh dam is located in the good rwh potential areas rwhpi 0 25 according to the obtained data the average recorded operating level for the kardeh dam and chalidareh dam over the years of 2017 and 2018 was 27 8 and 84 2 of the designed capacity respectively which implies the significance of proper site selection in the future functionality of such structures that is firmly tied to the reliable estimation of the parameters of a surrounding environment based on the results fig 6 each rwh structure has its distribution over the study area and it is possible that in a single selected suitable site more than one structure is recommended to be constructed mpb has relatively more area suitable for percolation tank 23 and ponds and pan 23 compared to other structures with the exception of gully plug mpb nearly appears to offer the same degree of potential sites for different rwh structures suitable sites for pond and pans are located in areas with a low slope 5 and sandy clay soil which are aligned with previous studies like al adamat 2008 according to the earlier studies one of the leading factors in selecting suitable sites for check dams was the agriculture land cover since check dams can provide supplementary water for irrigation of crops jha et al 2014b the results also determined that suitable areas for check dams are located mostly in the central and northwestern portions of the study area with mild slopes and sandy clay loam soil texture that are typically suitable for agricultural purposes jha et al 2014b however suitable sites for percolation tanks are scattered around the entire study area except the central portion from southeast to the northwest consisting of moderately steep slope areas with soil texture of both silt loam and clay loam the majority of the suitable areas for implementing terraces have mainly steep slopes 10 15 with clay loam or clay soil moreover based on the results in table 8 it can be inferred that most of the good rwh potential areas can be considered for building pond and pans check dams and terracing since these systems have the highest area located in the good rwh potential zones in case of using these structures in areas with good rwh potential almost 158 135 and 110 m m3 of precipitation is received respectively providing an approximate upper bound on the potential for each system to be examined in future work to put this in context according to the local official reports the total water demand of mashhad as the biggest city of the study area for 2021 is predicted to be 286 7 m m3 a combination of technologies that yield higher amounts of harvested water with accurate localized configuration and design proper operation and maintenance are key factors to minimize losses and to maximize the actual quantity of water harvested generally it can be stated that there may be sufficient potential for implementing rwh technologies to supply a reasonable amount of water and ensure long term water security in the face of looming climate change though rainfall predictions under climate change would need to be evaluated to confirm this devising effective water management strategies at a basin or sub basin scale is the immediate need of the mbp unless efforts are made to utilize potential rain water efficiently and sustainably water scarcity will continue to be a major problem in the study area the rwh potential zone maps fig 3 and the map showing suitable areas for rwh structures fig 6 were derived based on a practical methodology that can be used for effective management micro level planning and implementation of rwh projects in the study area nevertheless there are uncertainties associated with the results uncertainties can be addressed either directly in the analysis e g sensitivity analysis or through discussing the role of uncertainty and its effect on how results from the method can be used guillaume et al 2017 the potential of rwh was evaluated based on historical rainfall data and effect of climate change was not considered moreover land use changes in the future regardless of lower weight in the analyses compared to rainfall can also be important these variations might alter the results in the future due to data limitations and scope of study some analysis e g evapotranspiration and infiltration quantification was not conducted these analyses are necessary to obtained realistic harvestable amount of water on the other hand selected criteria are well documented and have a rich theoretical foundation and application history the corresponding weight factors range with literature socio economic criteria were considered along with biophysical factors to incorporate a broader range of influential parameters thus obtained results are deemed to be useful for decision makers and local officials by providing an initial overall assessment of rwh potentials and different technologies which can be used further studies including detailed evapotranspiration evaluation based on the selected rwh systems are required for the next stage of studies to obtain actual harvestable amount of water and devising executable management planning the harvested rainwater can be directed and used for many purposes including irrigation soil moisture improvement domestic and livestock uses and enhancing groundwater resources agarwal et al 2001 kelly et al 2018 kumar et al 2005 lani et al 2018 lee et al 2010 mekdaschi and liniger 2013 rwh specifically has a significant impact on agricultural sector several factors considered important for agriculture can be provided by rwh including availability of accumulated surface water especially in non rainy seasons and proximity of water supply to crop cultivations to minimize pumping costs kourgialas et al 2015 thus rwh structures increase crop productivity expand crop areas and prolong the cropping period supporting prosperity of the agricultural sector calder et al 2008 datta 2015 guyassa et al 2017 vema et al 2018 4 conclusion rwh is a practical and favorable technique to partially address water scarcity by conserving freshwater supplies in asars however the assessment of rwh potential and the identification of appropriate areas for diverse rwh structures is challenging for water resources managers and planners particularly on large scales in this study potentially suitable areas for rwh in mpb have been identified using gis based mcda this study aimed to develop a generally applicable and simple water harvesting framework model for identification of potential zones for rwh structures incorporating socio economic and biophysical criteria based on the developed methods over the last three decades indeed incorporating the socio economic suitability factors increased the model s reliability in terms of considering a broader range of effective criteria and further generalizing the methodology from the output maps of the present study it can be mentioned that 48 of mpb is not suitable for rwh and the remainder classified into three rwh potential areas a good covering 26 of the total area b moderate 43 and c poor 31 the spatial distribution of the rwhpi of the study areas showed that the areas with good potential for rwh were fairly evenly distributed around the entire study area the suitable zones for building ponds and pan and check dams encompass an area of 1100 km2 21 6 and 970 km2 19 1 respectively followed by percolation tanks with 860 km2 16 9 terracing with 795 km2 15 6 nala bunds with 667 km2 13 1 and gully plugs with 147 km2 2 9 the comparison between the results of potential rwh areas with field observations where most of the dams were situated on moderate rwh potential zones lends support to the utility of the integrated use of mcda and gis nevertheless indicators of social and economic conditions along with local settings must be considered by decision making agencies consideration of socio economic and biophysical factors in rwh analysis will guarantee that water harvesting projects are considered as a part of the integrated economic social and cultural system the methodology and the analyses demonstrated in this study may also be considered efficient and suitable for other parts of the world particularly for developing countries independently of hydrological and agro climatic variations as it has generic applicability the recommended next stage studies include more detailed analysis of evapotranspiration in order to evaluate actual harvestable water at identified sites and assessment of global change implications on rwh potential and model refinement by coupling hydrological models with mcda and gis this could be beneficial towards identifying the best method for rwh potential assessment at large scales credit

information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr with the spatial resolution of 0 25 were evaluated using rain gauge data at the daily monthly and annual scales over the tibetan plateau and its surrounding areas tp r2 bias rmse and mae were adopted to assess precipitation amount indices including the probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far critical success index csi and frequency bias index fbi were used to evaluate gridded products ability to detect precipitation occurrences we found that 1 aphrodite outperformed chirps and persiann cdr against observations at the annual scale with the highest r2 0 93 the lowest mae 67 mm year and rmse 116 mm year and aphrodite also showed better performance in distinguishing rain no rain events with the highest pod 0 9 and csi 0 6 the lowest far 0 35 followed by persainn cdr and chirps 2 chirps performed nearly to aphrodite in precipitation amount with r2 around 0 8 while the lowest pod 0 4 implied the shortage for chirps in detecting rain no rain conditions 3 in spite of the lowest agreement with gauge measurements with the largest bias 25 persiann cdr had a relatively higher mean pod 0 5 indicating that persiann cdr had better potential of detecting rainfall occurrences than chirps but tended to overestimate precipitation 4 generally persiann cdr overestimated the precipitation greater than chirps and aphrodite data at monthly scale and 5 the three products correlated well with each other in the interior southern and eastern regions of tp but there were still some significant differences along the borders and surroundings of the tp by inter comparisons finally we recommended aphrodite for climate change study for its high accuracy and long time series chirps and persiann cdr could also be considered after correction keywords precipitation evaluation long term aphrodite chirps persiann cdr tibetan plateau 1 introduction precipitation is a critical variable in the climate system and plays an important role in coupled land surface atmosphere interactions sorooshian et al 2005 ma et al 2017b ma et al 2018a in the application high quality precipitation data is considered as one of the most important inputs of hydrological models to simulate land surface hydrologic processes to understand the hydrological balance and investigate how climate changes influence the hydrological cycle ma et al 2018c yang et al 2011 furthermore knowledge of the long term spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation acts as a pivotal part in improving climate diagnostics as well as perfecting weather and climate forecast models adler et al 2003 obtaining accurate precipitation has always been a challenge for scientists traditionally rain gauges are used to measure precipitation accurately in a high temporal frequency but sparsely located rain gauges cannot represent the spatial distribution of precipitation in large areas and mountainous regions yang and luo 2014 gauge based products were established in the last few decades such as global precipitation climatology centre gpcc rudolf et al 2010 and asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation of water resources aphrodite yatagai et al 2012 aphrodite was always taken as ground truth in previous studies due to its high accuracy which resulted from sufficient rain gauges in asia and an improved angular distance weighting adw method duncan and biggs 2012 table 1 with the rapid development of satellite instruments and techniques a variety of precipitation products have been established and come into service they can be divided into two main categories 1 those derived from geosynchronous orbiting infrared ir measurements and 2 those based on polar orbiting microwave mw observations sapiano and arkin 2009 ir imagery benefits from a high sampling frequency but producing accurate estimations is difficult on account of the indirect relationship between precipitation rates and cloud top temperature mw observations are based on a more physical contact with rain occurrence thus they tend to be better compared with ir data in accurately estimating the precipitation but they are hampered by inadequate temporal sampling meanwhile precipitation products by merging ir and mw data have been developed and used in climate studies and hydrological analysis for instance the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann sorooshian et al 2000 and its improved version persiann ccs hong et al 2004 the climate precipitation center cpc morphing algorithm cmorph joyce et al 2004 the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa products huffman et al 2007 and so on previous studies showed great potential for these products in various applications for example hong et al 2007 compared persiann ccs estimates with rain gauge observations in the north american monsoon region of northwestern mexico and found that persiann ccs tended to generate underestimates in the occurrence of light precipitation at high elevations and overestimates in the occurrence of precipitation at low elevations indicating the elevation dependent trends nevertheless all retrieval methods or algorithms have pros and cons so it is necessary to validate the accuracy of precipitation products especially in large mountainous areas han and zhou 2012 there have been many studies evaluating the performances of high resolution precipitation products and revealing that these products showed considerable differences and biases comparing with in situ measurements hong et al 2007 tang et al 2016 yang et al 2018 ma et al 2018b ma et al 2018d while most evaluations have been conducted focused on a short period as for studying climatic events at least a 30 year record is preferred burroughs 2003 for time series measurements of sufficient length consistency and continuity to determine the variability and climate change national research council 2004 thus three long term gridded precipitation products were considered in this study they were aphrodite chirps 2 0 and persiann cdr in iran alijanian et al 2017 evaluated cmorph persiann cdr persiann trmm and multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep beck et al 2017 against gauge data in different rainfall regimes reporting that mswep persiann cdr and trmm performed better in distinguishing rain from no rain condition while persiann cdr outperformed for the other products in capturing larger rainfall rates additionally miao et al 2015 found that persiann cdr slightly underestimated the values of extreme heavy precipitation in the station rich regions in eastern china katsanos et al 2015 validated chirps over cyprus for a 30 year period and results showed that chirps had a good correlation with in situ measurements but overestimated rainfall during 2001 2010 bai et al 2018 reported that chirps had better performances for large precipitation than it did for the arid and semi arid regime the superiority of persiann cdr and chirps to assess the applicability for agricultural drought over chile was also validated by zambrano et al 2017 this paper aimed to evaluate three long term precipitation products in amounts and occurrences at daily monthly and annual scales aphrodite chirps and persiann cdr were compared against in situ measurements and inter compared over the tp the goal of this study was to assess the accuracies and applicabilities of these products to characterize precipitation patterns and events across the tp and finally determined recommendations on these products for related applications in tp 2 study area and materials 2 1 study area in this study we focused on the tibetan plateau tp and its surrounding areas 25 43 n and 72 105 e located in central asia and mainly within the territory of china apart from the southwest edge belonging to india pakistan nepal sikkim bhutan and myanmar the tp is the highest plateau in the world with an area of 2 5 million km2 and an average altitude of more than 4000 m above sea level m a s l surrounded by asia s highest mountains the himalayas in the south kela kunlun ranges in the west and the steep hengduan ranges in the east whose average peak heights are more than 6000 m while there is a relatively low undulate area in the interior of the plateau fig 1 topographical characteristics lead a profound impact on the regional climate and create unique microclimates within this region the annual rainfall in the tp decreases gradually from the brahmaputra basin to the northwest as the southern warm moist air is blocked by many high mountains in the downstream of the brahmaputra basin the average annual precipitation is almost more than 600 mm while it is only 17 6 mm in the northwest of the qaidam basin wei et al 2003 lakes are also essential components of the hydrosphere over the tp which have important implications for estimations of water balance and water resource management around 96 of all lakes in the tp are small with an area 1 km2 while the 1204 large lakes 1 km2 account for 96 of the total lake area zhang et al 2014 wan et al 2016 many previous studies showed strong evidence that the tp exerted far reaching thermal and dynamical impacts on the regional climate along with atmospheric circulation in the world especially in the northern hemisphere manabe and terpstra 1974 yeh and gao 1979 kutzbach et al 1993 additionally the tp is also known as one of the asian water towers feeding five major southeast asian basins which provide fresh water to more than 1 4 billion people over 20 of the global population however the asian water towers were threatened by climate change especially in the brahmaputra basin immerzeel et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 found that the hydrologic cycle in the tp has intensified remarkably during recent decades according to previous studies the tp is the most sensitive area to respond to global climate change liu and chen 2000 generally speaking the tp is a typical region with complex rainfall conditions that deserves long term climate study 2 2 rain gauge data the rain gauge data set was collected from the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration cma we used annual monthly and daily precipitation records at 195 rain gauges whenever they have valid data from 1951 to 2015 cma executed a strict quality control qc step to avoid errors ren et al 2010 fig 1 displays the locations of stations used in this study and it could be seen that the distribution of the 195 stations was uneven over the whole region sparse in the western tp where the elevation was very high and relatively intense in the eastern tp the rain gauges were located at altitudes between 351 and 5382 m and 84 6 of them located below 4000 m fig 2 in addition annual average precipitation decreased as the elevation became higher from 2500 m to 5000 m these rain gauge observations were used as a benchmark when evaluating the gridded precipitation products 2 3 gridded rain gauge data aphrodite constructed by aphrodite s water resources project in cooperation with the research institute for humanity and nature rihn is a gridded daily rain gauge product with long term 1951 2015 high resolution 0 25 and 0 5 for asia as aphrodite has a spatial extent for asia daily data used for interpolating precipitation over the tp extended beyond those gauge stations purely located within the region s boundary duncan and biggs 2012 for this study we used aphrodite v1101 for monsoon asia aphro v1101 ma with a spatial resolution of 0 25 which has more extensive qc before carrying out the interpolation algorithm compared with the previous version to eliminate erroneous station data this product was generated by an improved angular distance weighting adw method considering the local topography between each rain gauge and interpolation point which represented the orographic precipitation pattern better yatagai et al 2012 previous studies yatagai et al 2012 han and zhou 2012 indicated that aphrodite showed high correlations 0 9 with rain gauge data along with smaller precipitation intensity and higher precipitation frequency the datasets and more details are accessible on

chirps 2 0 global daily we chose 0 25 daily chirps estimates from 1981 to 2015 and accumulated them into annual data 2 5 persiann cdr an artificial neural network ann algorithm was used to estimate rainfall rate with ir brightness temperature data from global geostationary satellites provided by climate prediction center cpc and national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa to produce persiann sorooshian et al 2000 persiann cdr was constructed by the national climatic data center climate data record cdr programme of noaa for long term studies ashouri et al 2014 persiann cdr is a retrospective multi satellite high resolution precipitation product that provides daily precipitation estimates at 0 25 spatial resolution from 1983 to present the retrieval algorithm uses ir satellite data from global geosynchronous satellites as the primary source of precipitation information the model is pre trained using the national centers for environmental prediction stage iv hourly precipitation data to calibrate persiann then the parameters of the model are kept fixed and the model is run for the full historical record of gridsat b1 ir knapp 2008 data to reduce the biases in the estimated precipitation the estimates were adjusted using the gpcp monthly 2 5 gauge precipitation analysis products ashouri et al 2014 the data sets are accessible in the website http www ncdc noaa gov cdr operationalcdrs html 3 methods 3 1 evaluation statistics four popularly used diagnostic statistics coefficient of determination r2 bias root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae were adopted in this study to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of the three products with rain gauge measurements r2 was also used to compare gridded products in pairs without rain gauge data four contingency table statistics were also used to analyze the gridded products abilities to detect rain no rain events probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far critical success index csi and frequency bias index fbi the pod and far measured the ratio of rain occurrences correctly detected and false alarmed to the total number of observed events respectively the csi could be viewed as a proportion correct for the quantity being forecast after removing correct no forecasts from consideration wilks 1995 the fbi indicated that whether there was a tendency to underestimate fbi 1 or to overestimate fbi 1 precipitation occurrences the best possible values were pod 1 far 0 csi 1 and fbi 1 su et al 2011 and the equations of the aforementioned statistics are shown below table 2 where o i means gauge measured precipitation o means the average gauge measured precipitation p i and p are gridded precipitation estimates and their average respectively and n means the number of precipitation pairs in the analysis and h means observed rain correctly detected m means observed rain not detected and f means rain detected but not observed in this study a threshold of 1 mm day 1 was used to discriminate whether rain occurs ebert et al 2010 all the statistics were derived when both rain gauge data and gridded precipitation products have valid data table 3 3 2 evaluation methods in this study we focused on data from 1951 to 2015 to evaluate gridded precipitation data in the long term on the three datasets aphrodite chirps and persiann cdr all gridded precipitation datasets were evaluated with cma rain gauge data in their own valid periods fundamental difficulties such as retrieval errors of satellite algorithms and systematic gauge errors related to instruments made it impossible to reach perfect spatial matching between point measurements from rain gauges and spatially averaged estimates from satellite products hong et al 2007 sapiano and arkin 2009 additionally rain gauges over the tp are sparse and uneven interpolating them to the regular grids is of great difficult and may cause errors so we chose to extract grid into point using the nearest neighbor method which built the matched precipitation series for each gauge by extracting value of the nearest grid point from the satellite products to compare in a common aspect statistics in the spatial and temporal scale were then calculated we compared the gridded precipitation datasets in pairs on the basis of a pixel from 1983 to 2015 since the resolutions of gridded precipitation were all 0 25 they were well matched without resampling to build precipitation series for each grid and inter comparisons were easily made in the periods from 1983 to 2015 4 results and discussions 4 1 validation on the three precipitation products at annual scale 4 1 1 spatial patterns of the three gridded precipitation products fig 3 shows the spatial patterns of the average 1951 2015 precipitation of aphrodite average 1981 2015 precipitation of chirps and 1983 2015 precipitation of persiann cdr over the tp all these three datasets presented an apparent increasing trend of precipitation from northwest to southeast on the whole with a large precipitation amount 1000 mm in the southern himalayas where the indian monsoon prevails and a small amount 250 mm in the tarim basin and the qaidam basin aphrodite captured the spatial characteristics well with restricted stations especially in the mountainous areas however the precipitation distribution performed smoothly in the interior part of the tp which may be caused by the lack of rain gauges in the high elevations and the elevation depending interpolation algorithm fig 3a there were also some invalid pixels in this dataset chirps presented the most spatial details compared with the other two products suggesting dramatic differences of precipitation on the two sides of the himalayas fig 3b persiann cdr exhibited the spatial characteristics roughly because of the single data source and had an obvious large mass of precipitation in the central and southern tp fig 3c in the aspect of the spatial pattern chirps outperformed among the products 4 1 2 comparisons of the three gridded precipitation datasets against rain gauge data figs 4 7 show the spatial patterns of r2 bias rmse and mae between gauge based annual precipitation and that derived from three gridded precipitation products it is obvious that aphrodite showed the largest correlation r2 0 9 with gauge based measurements chirps the second and persiann cdr the least fig 4 the r2 values of chirps were smaller in the steep mountains and some of them were less than 0 4 the majority of r2 values between gauge data and persiann cdr were between 0 4 and 0 8 two factors contributed to the excellent performance of aphrodite some common stations were used when constructing the aphrodite product so that the gridded data was highly correlated with that of gauges the interpolation method of aphrodite was reasonable and reliable as for persiann cdr rainfall presented a weak correlation with ir brightness temperature when there was little water available in air profiles which means it is hard for persiann to deal with this situation for it is mainly based on ir brightness temperature in its ann gao and liu 2013 the bias values for the three products were significantly different in terms of both spatial distribution and magnitude above all the three products tended to overestimate annual precipitation from an overall perspective while both positive and negative biases existed persiann cdr had many large positive biases with an average value of 44 73 than aphrodite average 7 7 and chirps average 9 8 fig 5c also indicates that persiann cdr overestimated the magnitude of precipitation especially in the southern tp additionally chirps exhibited a relatively larger range of biases around 50 50 than aphrodite around 25 50 while persiann cdr exhibited the largest range of biases around 50 150 there was a clear distinction between the distributions of positive and negative values of aphrodite s bias and the negative values were concentrated in the hengduan mountains where monsoon precipitation was heavy in summer precipitation was underestimated because of the shortage of input data for nepal bhutan and northern india yatagai et al 2012 besides no evident rules could be found in the pattern of absolute biases of aphrodite as for chirps the plus or minus of biases seemed to distribute in random in most of the region with absolute values slightly larger than those of aphrodite figs 6 and 7 present some similarity in the spatial distribution of the two statistical indices the statistics showed a decrease from south to north possibly due to the increase in rainfall amount besides the rmses and maes of persiann cdr were larger than that of the other two products in evidence fig 8 a d display the time series of four statistics for three gridded precipitation products above all there was no intersection among the statistical polylines of these products indicating that they had apparent differences in the magnitude of the four statistics and had similar trends in a certain time period apart from the period before 1960 lack of efficient number of stations aphrodite behaved well and steadily in the light of r2 0 93 the biases of aphrodite were in the range of plus through minus 10 which was minor comparing with those of chirps and persiann cdr and 1980 seemed to be a dividing point after which the biases of aphrodite were almost negative also maes 67 mm year and rmses 116 mm year of aphrodite came to be lower as the number of stations increased the trends of statistics for chirps were relatively steady without cut off points persiann cdr presented a similar trend with chirps but magnitude and amplitude were larger relating with overestimation in the southern part of tp though the rmses and maes of chirps and persiann cdr were relatively larger compared with those of aphrodite chiprs and persiann cdr correlated well with rain gauge data r2 0 83 r2 0 67 respectively indicating that it has room to improve the quality of chiprs and persiann cdr by considering some correction algorithms furthermore the reason why the trends were similar could be contributed to the changes in annual precipitation 4 1 3 inter comparisons of three gridded precipitation datasets fig 9 presents the spatial patterns of inter comparisons results on the one hand aphrodite correlated better with chirps than persiann cdr fig 9a which could be expected since both datasets used station data from the same source it is noted that values of r2 in the southern and central tp were quite high exceed over 0 8 where rainfall was heavy while turned to be lower in the arid regions such as tarim basin and near the mountains on the other hand the correlations between persiann cdr and other two datasets were lower than that between aphrodite and chirps in general and lowest 0 4 in the mountainous regions in especial this was reasonable because both aphrodite and chirps took the topographical effects into consideration furthermore fig 9a c all indicated that the products corresponded well with each other in the southern and eastern tp while precipitation was more abundant than other parts of the plateau 4 2 validations on the three precipitation products at monthly scale the scatter diagrams of gridded precipitation products and observed precipitation in 12 months as shown in fig 10 suggested that the gridded precipitation products performed differently with each other above all aphrodite presented better agreement with observed data than the other two products with scatters close to 1 1 line in all months but the consistency with observed data of chirps and persiann cdr differed from month to month from october to march chirps and persiann cdr related worse with observational precipitation than from june to september when the amount of rainfall increased and this is more evident to chirps in addition chirps generated substantial underestimations especially when relatively larger precipitation occurs from december from march r2 bias rmse mae between gridded precipitation data and observed data differed in month respectively as shown in fig 11 aphrodite correlated highly with observed data with r2 values higher than 0 7 in all months and the highest r2 is up to 0 9 in august while chirps related not as highly as aphrodite with rain gauge data from november to april r2 values from may to october maintained at a relatively high level besides persiann cdr represented similar results with chirps from the perspective of r2 values lower than those between chirps and observed precipitation three products biases in monthly scale varied quitely from each other which is noteworthy aphrodite overestimated precipitation from october to may and underestimated precipitation from june to september on the contrary chirps generated overestimations from april to october and underestimations from november to march otherwise persiann cdr overestimated precipitation in all months numerically speaking biases between aphrodite and rain gauge data from march to october were in an acceptable range 4 726 8 587 but became larger in the other months 20 in december and january chirps showed relatively medium biases 18 439 11 693 in most months biases between persiann cdr and observational precipitation were almost greater than 20 in all months except june moreover maes and rmses between all products and rain gauge data became larger from june to september and reached their maximum in july thereinto aphrodite gave the smallest mae and rmse followed by chirps and persiann cdr 4 3 validations on the three precipitation products at daily scale the dispersion of four contingency statistics for aphrodite chirps and persiann cdr daily precipitation were illustrated in fig 12 aphrodite showed the largest pod mean 0 9 and the smallest far median 0 3 which indicated that aphrodite detected rain events correctly among the three products chirps gave the smallest pod persiann cdr the second far away from the perfect value of 1 along with a large range of data distribution compared with aphrodite s similarly chirps and persiann cdr showed relatively weak detective ability in regard to far whose medians of far were 0 5 in addition csi represented similar results with pod from the perspective of fbi aphrodite and persiann cdr both overstated rain occurrences with the mean of fbi around 1 5 while the mean of fbi for chirps was the closest to 1 furthermore plus symbols above whisker in fig 12d showed that all products tended to overestimate rain events in some sites 4 4 for the potential application fields long term precipitation data at greater accuracy is essential for many scientific studies and practical applications e g soil science ecology water resource research climate studies higgins et al 2007 liu et al 2016 particularly for the tp which has relatively few rain gauges because of its geographical location natural environment and complex topography xie and xiong 2011 ma et al 2017a for instance in soil science sanchez et al 2009 highlighted the need to generate climate variables at different resolutions e g 30 m 90 m 1 km 25 km scales to quantitatively predict and map soil properties in relation to carbon cycling and climate change and viscarra rossel and chen 2011 predicted the soil information from vis nir spectra 90 m used precipitation estimates simply interpolated from ground observations at annul scale carbon models e g the century model parton et al 1995 will also benefit from long term precipitation estimates at annual monthly scales for investigating long term water balances and runoff precipitation data with finer accuracy are also acted as a primary parameter wang et al 2017 climate change over the tp is also an indicator of worldwide climate change and the area is more sensitive than other regions lin and zhao 1996 and the more accurate precipitation would result in better cognitions of the accurate regional climate change information long term precipitation estimates are also critical to investigating the water balance over the tp which is considered as the water tower of asia providing freshwater for 1 4 billion human beings immerzeel et al 2010 while in above mentioned research most of them lacked entire evaluations on the precipitation data they have selected e g viscarra rossel and chen 2011 therefore we conducted this research for demonstrating the qualities of the mainstream long term precipitation datasets over the tp which would provide potential references for the scientists when they decide which one is the most suitable precipitation dataset for them in different application situations 5 conclusion rainfall information is a prequisite and plays vital roles in climate study however limited by the observation methods the obtained precipitation data at present cannot afford the demand of high resolution and long term in this study we evaluated three gridded precipitation datasets annually monthly and daily the gridded precipitation products were compared against gauge measured data and were inter compared in the temporal spatial patterns the main conclusions can be summarized as follows a in precipitation amount aphrodite showed better performance than chirps and persiann cdr with higher r2 and lower bias mae and rmse b in rain occurrence aphrodite had the strongest ability to detect rain events correctly followed by persiann cdr and chirps c chirps offered the most detailed spatial pattern of precipitation and performed nearly to aphrodite in amount but the lowest pod 0 4 implied its relatively weak ability in detecting rain no rain conditions d despite the general overestimations persiann cdr had better potential of detecting rainfall occurrences than chirps e the three precipitation products generally tended to estimate heavy rainfall inaccurately aphrodite s biases of the first 30 years and the second 30 years performed quite differently and f topography played a significant role in estimating precipitation and should be carefully considered when developing the retrieval algorithm especially over mountainous regions overall the results showed that spatiotemporal characteristics were well captured by the three products across the tp although the limitation of rain gauge numbers and distribution made it hard to evaluate independently satellite based data provided an important perspective to estimate precipitation where rain gauges were limited especially in mountains regions we finally recommended aphrodite for climate change study for its long time series and high quality in the future more algorithms and methods are still needed to be proposed to produce high resolution and long term accurate precipitation products for example downscaling research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

5791,long term precipitation data play significant roles in hydrological applications and climate change studies in this study three gridded precipitation products asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation of water resources aphrodite climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps and precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr with the spatial resolution of 0 25 were evaluated using rain gauge data at the daily monthly and annual scales over the tibetan plateau and its surrounding areas tp r2 bias rmse and mae were adopted to assess precipitation amount indices including the probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far critical success index csi and frequency bias index fbi were used to evaluate gridded products ability to detect precipitation occurrences we found that 1 aphrodite outperformed chirps and persiann cdr against observations at the annual scale with the highest r2 0 93 the lowest mae 67 mm year and rmse 116 mm year and aphrodite also showed better performance in distinguishing rain no rain events with the highest pod 0 9 and csi 0 6 the lowest far 0 35 followed by persainn cdr and chirps 2 chirps performed nearly to aphrodite in precipitation amount with r2 around 0 8 while the lowest pod 0 4 implied the shortage for chirps in detecting rain no rain conditions 3 in spite of the lowest agreement with gauge measurements with the largest bias 25 persiann cdr had a relatively higher mean pod 0 5 indicating that persiann cdr had better potential of detecting rainfall occurrences than chirps but tended to overestimate precipitation 4 generally persiann cdr overestimated the precipitation greater than chirps and aphrodite data at monthly scale and 5 the three products correlated well with each other in the interior southern and eastern regions of tp but there were still some significant differences along the borders and surroundings of the tp by inter comparisons finally we recommended aphrodite for climate change study for its high accuracy and long time series chirps and persiann cdr could also be considered after correction keywords precipitation evaluation long term aphrodite chirps persiann cdr tibetan plateau 1 introduction precipitation is a critical variable in the climate system and plays an important role in coupled land surface atmosphere interactions sorooshian et al 2005 ma et al 2017b ma et al 2018a in the application high quality precipitation data is considered as one of the most important inputs of hydrological models to simulate land surface hydrologic processes to understand the hydrological balance and investigate how climate changes influence the hydrological cycle ma et al 2018c yang et al 2011 furthermore knowledge of the long term spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation acts as a pivotal part in improving climate diagnostics as well as perfecting weather and climate forecast models adler et al 2003 obtaining accurate precipitation has always been a challenge for scientists traditionally rain gauges are used to measure precipitation accurately in a high temporal frequency but sparsely located rain gauges cannot represent the spatial distribution of precipitation in large areas and mountainous regions yang and luo 2014 gauge based products were established in the last few decades such as global precipitation climatology centre gpcc rudolf et al 2010 and asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation of water resources aphrodite yatagai et al 2012 aphrodite was always taken as ground truth in previous studies due to its high accuracy which resulted from sufficient rain gauges in asia and an improved angular distance weighting adw method duncan and biggs 2012 table 1 with the rapid development of satellite instruments and techniques a variety of precipitation products have been established and come into service they can be divided into two main categories 1 those derived from geosynchronous orbiting infrared ir measurements and 2 those based on polar orbiting microwave mw observations sapiano and arkin 2009 ir imagery benefits from a high sampling frequency but producing accurate estimations is difficult on account of the indirect relationship between precipitation rates and cloud top temperature mw observations are based on a more physical contact with rain occurrence thus they tend to be better compared with ir data in accurately estimating the precipitation but they are hampered by inadequate temporal sampling meanwhile precipitation products by merging ir and mw data have been developed and used in climate studies and hydrological analysis for instance the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann sorooshian et al 2000 and its improved version persiann ccs hong et al 2004 the climate precipitation center cpc morphing algorithm cmorph joyce et al 2004 the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa products huffman et al 2007 and so on previous studies showed great potential for these products in various applications for example hong et al 2007 compared persiann ccs estimates with rain gauge observations in the north american monsoon region of northwestern mexico and found that persiann ccs tended to generate underestimates in the occurrence of light precipitation at high elevations and overestimates in the occurrence of precipitation at low elevations indicating the elevation dependent trends nevertheless all retrieval methods or algorithms have pros and cons so it is necessary to validate the accuracy of precipitation products especially in large mountainous areas han and zhou 2012 there have been many studies evaluating the performances of high resolution precipitation products and revealing that these products showed considerable differences and biases comparing with in situ measurements hong et al 2007 tang et al 2016 yang et al 2018 ma et al 2018b ma et al 2018d while most evaluations have been conducted focused on a short period as for studying climatic events at least a 30 year record is preferred burroughs 2003 for time series measurements of sufficient length consistency and continuity to determine the variability and climate change national research council 2004 thus three long term gridded precipitation products were considered in this study they were aphrodite chirps 2 0 and persiann cdr in iran alijanian et al 2017 evaluated cmorph persiann cdr persiann trmm and multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep beck et al 2017 against gauge data in different rainfall regimes reporting that mswep persiann cdr and trmm performed better in distinguishing rain from no rain condition while persiann cdr outperformed for the other products in capturing larger rainfall rates additionally miao et al 2015 found that persiann cdr slightly underestimated the values of extreme heavy precipitation in the station rich regions in eastern china katsanos et al 2015 validated chirps over cyprus for a 30 year period and results showed that chirps had a good correlation with in situ measurements but overestimated rainfall during 2001 2010 bai et al 2018 reported that chirps had better performances for large precipitation than it did for the arid and semi arid regime the superiority of persiann cdr and chirps to assess the applicability for agricultural drought over chile was also validated by zambrano et al 2017 this paper aimed to evaluate three long term precipitation products in amounts and occurrences at daily monthly and annual scales aphrodite chirps and persiann cdr were compared against in situ measurements and inter compared over the tp the goal of this study was to assess the accuracies and applicabilities of these products to characterize precipitation patterns and events across the tp and finally determined recommendations on these products for related applications in tp 2 study area and materials 2 1 study area in this study we focused on the tibetan plateau tp and its surrounding areas 25 43 n and 72 105 e located in central asia and mainly within the territory of china apart from the southwest edge belonging to india pakistan nepal sikkim bhutan and myanmar the tp is the highest plateau in the world with an area of 2 5 million km2 and an average altitude of more than 4000 m above sea level m a s l surrounded by asia s highest mountains the himalayas in the south kela kunlun ranges in the west and the steep hengduan ranges in the east whose average peak heights are more than 6000 m while there is a relatively low undulate area in the interior of the plateau fig 1 topographical characteristics lead a profound impact on the regional climate and create unique microclimates within this region the annual rainfall in the tp decreases gradually from the brahmaputra basin to the northwest as the southern warm moist air is blocked by many high mountains in the downstream of the brahmaputra basin the average annual precipitation is almost more than 600 mm while it is only 17 6 mm in the northwest of the qaidam basin wei et al 2003 lakes are also essential components of the hydrosphere over the tp which have important implications for estimations of water balance and water resource management around 96 of all lakes in the tp are small with an area 1 km2 while the 1204 large lakes 1 km2 account for 96 of the total lake area zhang et al 2014 wan et al 2016 many previous studies showed strong evidence that the tp exerted far reaching thermal and dynamical impacts on the regional climate along with atmospheric circulation in the world especially in the northern hemisphere manabe and terpstra 1974 yeh and gao 1979 kutzbach et al 1993 additionally the tp is also known as one of the asian water towers feeding five major southeast asian basins which provide fresh water to more than 1 4 billion people over 20 of the global population however the asian water towers were threatened by climate change especially in the brahmaputra basin immerzeel et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 found that the hydrologic cycle in the tp has intensified remarkably during recent decades according to previous studies the tp is the most sensitive area to respond to global climate change liu and chen 2000 generally speaking the tp is a typical region with complex rainfall conditions that deserves long term climate study 2 2 rain gauge data the rain gauge data set was collected from the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration cma we used annual monthly and daily precipitation records at 195 rain gauges whenever they have valid data from 1951 to 2015 cma executed a strict quality control qc step to avoid errors ren et al 2010 fig 1 displays the locations of stations used in this study and it could be seen that the distribution of the 195 stations was uneven over the whole region sparse in the western tp where the elevation was very high and relatively intense in the eastern tp the rain gauges were located at altitudes between 351 and 5382 m and 84 6 of them located below 4000 m fig 2 in addition annual average precipitation decreased as the elevation became higher from 2500 m to 5000 m these rain gauge observations were used as a benchmark when evaluating the gridded precipitation products 2 3 gridded rain gauge data aphrodite constructed by aphrodite s water resources project in cooperation with the research institute for humanity and nature rihn is a gridded daily rain gauge product with long term 1951 2015 high resolution 0 25 and 0 5 for asia as aphrodite has a spatial extent for asia daily data used for interpolating precipitation over the tp extended beyond those gauge stations purely located within the region s boundary duncan and biggs 2012 for this study we used aphrodite v1101 for monsoon asia aphro v1101 ma with a spatial resolution of 0 25 which has more extensive qc before carrying out the interpolation algorithm compared with the previous version to eliminate erroneous station data this product was generated by an improved angular distance weighting adw method considering the local topography between each rain gauge and interpolation point which represented the orographic precipitation pattern better yatagai et al 2012 previous studies yatagai et al 2012 han and zhou 2012 indicated that aphrodite showed high correlations 0 9 with rain gauge data along with smaller precipitation intensity and higher precipitation frequency the datasets and more details are accessible on

rainfall rate with ir brightness temperature data from global geostationary satellites provided by climate prediction center cpc and national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa to produce persiann sorooshian et al 2000 persiann cdr was constructed by the national climatic data center climate data record cdr programme of noaa for long term studies ashouri et al 2014 persiann cdr is a retrospective multi satellite high resolution precipitation product that provides daily precipitation estimates at 0 25 spatial resolution from 1983 to present the retrieval algorithm uses ir satellite data from global geosynchronous satellites as the primary source of precipitation information the model is pre trained using the national centers for environmental prediction stage iv hourly precipitation data to calibrate persiann then the parameters of the model are kept fixed and the model is run for the full historical record of gridsat b1 ir knapp 2008 data to reduce the biases in the estimated precipitation the estimates were adjusted using the gpcp monthly 2 5 gauge precipitation analysis products ashouri et al 2014 the data sets are accessible in the website http www ncdc noaa gov cdr operationalcdrs html 3 methods 3 1 evaluation statistics four popularly used diagnostic statistics coefficient of determination r2 bias root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae were adopted in this study to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of the three products with rain gauge measurements r2 was also used to compare gridded products in pairs without rain gauge data four contingency table statistics were also used to analyze the gridded products abilities to detect rain no rain events probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far critical success index csi and frequency bias index fbi the pod and far measured the ratio of rain occurrences correctly detected and false alarmed to the total number of observed events respectively the csi could be viewed as a proportion correct for the quantity being forecast after removing correct no forecasts from consideration wilks 1995 the fbi indicated that whether there was a tendency to underestimate fbi 1 or to overestimate fbi 1 precipitation occurrences the best possible values were pod 1 far 0 csi 1 and fbi 1 su et al 2011 and the equations of the aforementioned statistics are shown below table 2 where o i means gauge measured precipitation o means the average gauge measured precipitation p i and p are gridded precipitation estimates and their average respectively and n means the number of precipitation pairs in the analysis and h means observed rain correctly detected m means observed rain not detected and f means rain detected but not observed in this study a threshold of 1 mm day 1 was used to discriminate whether rain occurs ebert et al 2010 all the statistics were derived when both rain gauge data and gridded precipitation products have valid data table 3 3 2 evaluation methods in this study we focused on data from 1951 to 2015 to evaluate gridded precipitation data in the long term on the three datasets aphrodite chirps and persiann cdr all gridded precipitation datasets were evaluated with cma rain gauge data in their own valid periods fundamental difficulties such as retrieval errors of satellite algorithms and systematic gauge errors related to instruments made it impossible to reach perfect spatial matching between point measurements from rain gauges and spatially averaged estimates from satellite products hong et al 2007 sapiano and arkin 2009 additionally rain gauges over the tp are sparse and uneven interpolating them to the regular grids is of great difficult and may cause errors so we chose to extract grid into point using the nearest neighbor method which built the matched precipitation series for each gauge by extracting value of the nearest grid point from the satellite products to compare in a common aspect statistics in the spatial and temporal scale were then calculated we compared the gridded precipitation datasets in pairs on the basis of a pixel from 1983 to 2015 since the resolutions of gridded precipitation were all 0 25 they were well matched without resampling to build precipitation series for each grid and inter comparisons were easily made in the periods from 1983 to 2015 4 results and discussions 4 1 validation on the three precipitation products at annual scale 4 1 1 spatial patterns of the three gridded precipitation products fig 3 shows the spatial patterns of the average 1951 2015 precipitation of aphrodite average 1981 2015 precipitation of chirps and 1983 2015 precipitation of persiann cdr over the tp all these three datasets presented an apparent increasing trend of precipitation from northwest to southeast on the whole with a large precipitation amount 1000 mm in the southern himalayas where the indian monsoon prevails and a small amount 250 mm in the tarim basin and the qaidam basin aphrodite captured the spatial characteristics well with restricted stations especially in the mountainous areas however the precipitation distribution performed smoothly in the interior part of the tp which may be caused by the lack of rain gauges in the high elevations and the elevation depending interpolation algorithm fig 3a there were also some invalid pixels in this dataset chirps presented the most spatial details compared with the other two products suggesting dramatic differences of precipitation on the two sides of the himalayas fig 3b persiann cdr exhibited the spatial characteristics roughly because of the single data source and had an obvious large mass of precipitation in the central and southern tp fig 3c in the aspect of the spatial pattern chirps outperformed among the products 4 1 2 comparisons of the three gridded precipitation datasets against rain gauge data figs 4 7 show the spatial patterns of r2 bias rmse and mae between gauge based annual precipitation and that derived from three gridded precipitation products it is obvious that aphrodite showed the largest correlation r2 0 9 with gauge based measurements chirps the second and persiann cdr the least fig 4 the r2 values of chirps were smaller in the steep mountains and some of them were less than 0 4 the majority of r2 values between gauge data and persiann cdr were between 0 4 and 0 8 two factors contributed to the excellent performance of aphrodite some common stations were used when constructing the aphrodite product so that the gridded data was highly correlated with that of gauges the interpolation method of aphrodite was reasonable and reliable as for persiann cdr rainfall presented a weak correlation with ir brightness temperature when there was little water available in air profiles which means it is hard for persiann to deal with this situation for it is mainly based on ir brightness temperature in its ann gao and liu 2013 the bias values for the three products were significantly different in terms of both spatial distribution and magnitude above all the three products tended to overestimate annual precipitation from an overall perspective while both positive and negative biases existed persiann cdr had many large positive biases with an average value of 44 73 than aphrodite average 7 7 and chirps average 9 8 fig 5c also indicates that persiann cdr overestimated the magnitude of precipitation especially in the southern tp additionally chirps exhibited a relatively larger range of biases around 50 50 than aphrodite around 25 50 while persiann cdr exhibited the largest range of biases around 50 150 there was a clear distinction between the distributions of positive and negative values of aphrodite s bias and the negative values were concentrated in the hengduan mountains where monsoon precipitation was heavy in summer precipitation was underestimated because of the shortage of input data for nepal bhutan and northern india yatagai et al 2012 besides no evident rules could be found in the pattern of absolute biases of aphrodite as for chirps the plus or minus of biases seemed to distribute in random in most of the region with absolute values slightly larger than those of aphrodite figs 6 and 7 present some similarity in the spatial distribution of the two statistical indices the statistics showed a decrease from south to north possibly due to the increase in rainfall amount besides the rmses and maes of persiann cdr were larger than that of the other two products in evidence fig 8 a d display the time series of four statistics for three gridded precipitation products above all there was no intersection among the statistical polylines of these products indicating that they had apparent differences in the magnitude of the four statistics and had similar trends in a certain time period apart from the period before 1960 lack of efficient number of stations aphrodite behaved well and steadily in the light of r2 0 93 the biases of aphrodite were in the range of plus through minus 10 which was minor comparing with those of chirps and persiann cdr and 1980 seemed to be a dividing point after which the biases of aphrodite were almost negative also maes 67 mm year and rmses 116 mm year of aphrodite came to be lower as the number of stations increased the trends of statistics for chirps were relatively steady without cut off points persiann cdr presented a similar trend with chirps but magnitude and amplitude were larger relating with overestimation in the southern part of tp though the rmses and maes of chirps and persiann cdr were relatively larger compared with those of aphrodite chiprs and persiann cdr correlated well with rain gauge data r2 0 83 r2 0 67 respectively indicating that it has room to improve the quality of chiprs and persiann cdr by considering some correction algorithms furthermore the reason why the trends were similar could be contributed to the changes in annual precipitation 4 1 3 inter comparisons of three gridded precipitation datasets fig 9 presents the spatial patterns of inter comparisons results on the one hand aphrodite correlated better with chirps than persiann cdr fig 9a which could be expected since both datasets used station data from the same source it is noted that values of r2 in the southern and central tp were quite high exceed over 0 8 where rainfall was heavy while turned to be lower in the arid regions such as tarim basin and near the mountains on the other hand the correlations between persiann cdr and other two datasets were lower than that between aphrodite and chirps in general and lowest 0 4 in the mountainous regions in especial this was reasonable because both aphrodite and chirps took the topographical effects into consideration furthermore fig 9a c all indicated that the products corresponded well with each other in the southern and eastern tp while precipitation was more abundant than other parts of the plateau 4 2 validations on the three precipitation products at monthly scale the scatter diagrams of gridded precipitation products and observed precipitation in 12 months as shown in fig 10 suggested that the gridded precipitation products performed differently with each other above all aphrodite presented better agreement with observed data than the other two products with scatters close to 1 1 line in all months but the consistency with observed data of chirps and persiann cdr differed from month to month from october to march chirps and persiann cdr related worse with observational precipitation than from june to september when the amount of rainfall increased and this is more evident to chirps in addition chirps generated substantial underestimations especially when relatively larger precipitation occurs from december from march r2 bias rmse mae between gridded precipitation data and observed data differed in month respectively as shown in fig 11 aphrodite correlated highly with observed data with r2 values higher than 0 7 in all months and the highest r2 is up to 0 9 in august while chirps related not as highly as aphrodite with rain gauge data from november to april r2 values from may to october maintained at a relatively high level besides persiann cdr represented similar results with chirps from the perspective of r2 values lower than those between chirps and observed precipitation three products biases in monthly scale varied quitely from each other which is noteworthy aphrodite overestimated precipitation from october to may and underestimated precipitation from june to september on the contrary chirps generated overestimations from april to october and underestimations from november to march otherwise persiann cdr overestimated precipitation in all months numerically speaking biases between aphrodite and rain gauge data from march to october were in an acceptable range 4 726 8 587 but became larger in the other months 20 in december and january chirps showed relatively medium biases 18 439 11 693 in most months biases between persiann cdr and observational precipitation were almost greater than 20 in all months except june moreover maes and rmses between all products and rain gauge data became larger from june to september and reached their maximum in july thereinto aphrodite gave the smallest mae and rmse followed by chirps and persiann cdr 4 3 validations on the three precipitation products at daily scale the dispersion of four contingency statistics for aphrodite chirps and persiann cdr daily precipitation were illustrated in fig 12 aphrodite showed the largest pod mean 0 9 and the smallest far median 0 3 which indicated that aphrodite detected rain events correctly among the three products chirps gave the smallest pod persiann cdr the second far away from the perfect value of 1 along with a large range of data distribution compared with aphrodite s similarly chirps and persiann cdr showed relatively weak detective ability in regard to far whose medians of far were 0 5 in addition csi represented similar results with pod from the perspective of fbi aphrodite and persiann cdr both overstated rain occurrences with the mean of fbi around 1 5 while the mean of fbi for chirps was the closest to 1 furthermore plus symbols above whisker in fig 12d showed that all products tended to overestimate rain events in some sites 4 4 for the potential application fields long term precipitation data at greater accuracy is essential for many scientific studies and practical applications e g soil science ecology water resource research climate studies higgins et al 2007 liu et al 2016 particularly for the tp which has relatively few rain gauges because of its geographical location natural environment and complex topography xie and xiong 2011 ma et al 2017a for instance in soil science sanchez et al 2009 highlighted the need to generate climate variables at different resolutions e g 30 m 90 m 1 km 25 km scales to quantitatively predict and map soil properties in relation to carbon cycling and climate change and viscarra rossel and chen 2011 predicted the soil information from vis nir spectra 90 m used precipitation estimates simply interpolated from ground observations at annul scale carbon models e g the century model parton et al 1995 will also benefit from long term precipitation estimates at annual monthly scales for investigating long term water balances and runoff precipitation data with finer accuracy are also acted as a primary parameter wang et al 2017 climate change over the tp is also an indicator of worldwide climate change and the area is more sensitive than other regions lin and zhao 1996 and the more accurate precipitation would result in better cognitions of the accurate regional climate change information long term precipitation estimates are also critical to investigating the water balance over the tp which is considered as the water tower of asia providing freshwater for 1 4 billion human beings immerzeel et al 2010 while in above mentioned research most of them lacked entire evaluations on the precipitation data they have selected e g viscarra rossel and chen 2011 therefore we conducted this research for demonstrating the qualities of the mainstream long term precipitation datasets over the tp which would provide potential references for the scientists when they decide which one is the most suitable precipitation dataset for them in different application situations 5 conclusion rainfall information is a prequisite and plays vital roles in climate study however limited by the observation methods the obtained precipitation data at present cannot afford the demand of high resolution and long term in this study we evaluated three gridded precipitation datasets annually monthly and daily the gridded precipitation products were compared against gauge measured data and were inter compared in the temporal spatial patterns the main conclusions can be summarized as follows a in precipitation amount aphrodite showed better performance than chirps and persiann cdr with higher r2 and lower bias mae and rmse b in rain occurrence aphrodite had the strongest ability to detect rain events correctly followed by persiann cdr and chirps c chirps offered the most detailed spatial pattern of precipitation and performed nearly to aphrodite in amount but the lowest pod 0 4 implied its relatively weak ability in detecting rain no rain conditions d despite the general overestimations persiann cdr had better potential of detecting rainfall occurrences than chirps e the three precipitation products generally tended to estimate heavy rainfall inaccurately aphrodite s biases of the first 30 years and the second 30 years performed quite differently and f topography played a significant role in estimating precipitation and should be carefully considered when developing the retrieval algorithm especially over mountainous regions overall the results showed that spatiotemporal characteristics were well captured by the three products across the tp although the limitation of rain gauge numbers and distribution made it hard to evaluate independently satellite based data provided an important perspective to estimate precipitation where rain gauges were limited especially in mountains regions we finally recommended aphrodite for climate change study for its long time series and high quality in the future more algorithms and methods are still needed to be proposed to produce high resolution and long term accurate precipitation products for example downscaling research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

5792,monthly streamflow forecasting is required for short and long term water resources management especially in extreme events such as flood and drought therefore there is need to develop a reliable and precise model for streamflow forecasting the precision of artificial intelligence ai models can be improved by using hybrid ai models which consist of coupled models therefore the chief aim of this study is to propose efficient hybrid system by integrating grey wolf optimization gwo algorithm with artificial intelligence ai models 130 years of monthly historical natural streamflow data will be used to evaluate the performance of the proposed modelling technique quantitative performance indicators will be introduced to evaluate the validity of the integrated models in addition to that comprehensive analysis will be conducted between the predicted and the observed streamflow the results show the integrated ai with gwo outperform the standard ai methods and can make better forecasting during training and testing phases for the monthly inflow in all input cases this finding reveals the superiority of gwo meta heuristic algorithm in improving the accuracy of the standard ai in forecasting the monthly inflow keywords streamflow estimation evolutionary algorithms aswan high dam 1 introduction broad scale of applications in water resources management and planning require an imperative development to obtain an optimum model for streamflow prediction it is essential to know that the precise estimation of streamflow is considered a significant stochastic feature in environmental modeling and it has attracted a big deal of importance in different kinds of applications in such as activities of water operation maintenance management agricultural and irrigation management drought and flood alert systems etc as reported in bruins 1990 amiri 2015 vogel et al 2015 from a practical point of view the performance of streamflow model necessitates a specific period of time to function which can either be a long time period e g weekly monthly and seasonal or short time period e g hourly and daily and this matter was the main focus of the researchers in water resources field over the past twenty years zealand et al 1999 wu et al 2009a b ismail et al 2012 terzi and ergin 2014 zia et al 2015 generally it is difficult to attain a precise and dependable streamflow model because the chaotic properties of streamflow el shafie et al 2007a including non linearity stochasticity and non stationarity govern the behavior of streamflow and cause its complexity bayazit 2015 moreover several factors are also influencing the stream flow for instance environment climate variability narsimlu et al 2015 local and seasonal patterns heterogeneity in temperature at the local and regional scale and the frequent of the precipitations temporal and spatial variability of watershed the properties of catchments as well as the activities of human beings danandeh mehr et al 2013 dehghani et al 2014 maity and kashid 2011 singh and cui 2015 despite of all water resources scholars are still making marvelous efforts to develop a reliable and precise model for streamflow forecasting angelakis and gikas 2014 those scholars thrive to develop and acquire original and innovative systems to beat the complexities in their models for stream flow estimating 1 1 background the hydrologists are vitally depends on streamflow forecasting in production of sustainable theoretical basis of water infrastructures in flood measurement control in monitoring the operational projects through observation of river behavior however the conventional regression based models are incapable to estimate the streamflow data sufficiently because the relationship between the output and input variables are inherently non linear based on that it is substantial to improve the capability of the model employed for streamflow data prediction by effectively evaluate and extract the non linear manner of the relationship between the predictor predicted originally the conventional statistical approaches mainly the ones that based on theoretical techniques such as regression methods and box jenkin time series approaches were applied widely to analyze and model the hydrological time series mainly the estimation of streamflow amisigo et al 2008 box and jenkins 1970 chua and wong 2011 valipour et al 2013 during the last two decades there are abundant of researches have been developed to investigate the potential of using data driven models such as artificial intelligence ai methods the purpose of data driven modeling is to use the techniques of artificial intelligence ai for extraction of documented data pattern in past to predict streamflow data in future and it has proven to be highly prevalent and favorable forecasting tool by generating estimated streamflow data that effectively represent the actual streamflow data chen et al 2015 deo and şahin 2016 fathian et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 a variety of ai based approaches which involve different variables related to streamflow such as evaporation drought and temperature have been applied in a plethora of forecasting studies for wide range of reasons for instance the models can be employed for local scale processes e g irrigation or farms they show a relative competitive performance with low complexity comparing to the common physically based hydrological models additionally the data inexpensive nature of ai based models and they can be used easily designing of forecasting models and related applications ahmed et al 2019 afan et al 2017 several of ai models have been established using artificial neural networks ann technique bai et al 2016 el shafie et al 2009 bahrami et al 2016 valipour et al 2012 fuzzy logic and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis el shafie et al 2007b kisi 2015 sharma et al 2015 zounemat kermani and teshnehlab 2008 genetic programing danandeh mehr et al 2014 makkeasorn et al 2008 turan and yurdusev 2014 algorithms of regression and support vector machine guo et al 2011 rasouli et al 2012 wang et al 2009a b in general compared to the traditional auto regression and other regression based methods the performance of ai based approaches for forecasting of streamflow is proven to be more reliable and effective yaseen et al 2015a yaseen et al 2016a b recently major efforts have been made to review and explore the weakness and merits of different types of ai methods in water resources field nourani et al 2014 yaseen et al 2015b it was concluded that there is no absolute ai model appropriate for all kinds of modelling such as estimation forecasting classification optimization etc and generally there was no individual machine learning approach appropriate for all definite problems nevertheless the precision of ai models with no data pre processing techniques can be improved by using hybrid ai models consist of coupled models with data pre processing methods the common used method for preprocessing of data in water resources applications is wavelet transformation wt okkan and ali serbes 2013 parmar and bhardwaj 2014 pramanik et al 2010 wei et al 2013 from this perspective it is evident that the certainty of the forecasted streamflow data can be effectively enhanced by the integration of two or more techniques to model and assimilate the data patterns and this is defined as hybrid approach fahimi et al 2016 the incorporation of different optimization models implanted into a separate ai based model leads to a noticeable improvement in the efficiency of streamflow forecasting model which is demonstrated by reduction of the computational time and by inference of an ideal solution for the valuation problem ch et al 2014 kavousi fard et al 2014a b although the accuracy of forecasting model can be improved by hybrid models researchers are still conducting many experiments to generate a sufficient approach that can deduce the optimal solutions in the area of forecasting through the utilization of ai models with preprocessing methods in general it has been proved that for engineering optimization application the achievement of global optima is a vital step in the successfulness of the prediction forecasting models a few researches showed that the meta heuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga particle swarm optimization pso harmony search hs ante colony optimization aco have excellent searching aptitudes to achieve the global optima and elude the local optima compared to the classical optimization algorithms these meta heuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga particle swarm optimization pso harmony search hs ante colony optimization aco this is due to the fact that these meta heuristics algorithms might have the nature behave which tolerates the stagnations in the local optima and rapidly switch to searching mode again to achieve the global optima position in fact the mentioned optimization algorithms have several advantages and disadvantages the major advantage in these algorithms is their ability to be adjusted to include several nonlinear systems in parallel or series with different constraints and objective functions the major disadvantage is the difficulty of addressing the stochastic pattern of the system parameters slow convergence and lack of ability to distinguish the optimal global solutions in this context this study introduces an improved meta heuristic algorithm to address the stochastic pattern of the prediction methods internal parameters and improve the ability of the search procedure to return global optima with relatively faster convergence furthermore the gwo algorithm has the capability of balance between exploration and exploitation efficiently and much better this avoids a large number of local solutions and provides an assessment of both accuracy and convergence speed on the other hand the gwo algorithm with ann model has been utilized to estimate reference evapotranspiration et0 and compared with other four optimization algorithms pso alo woa and mvo tikhamarine et al 2019a the results obtained demonstrate the superiority of the gwo algorithm over other optimization algorithms in all cases toward this end this study proposes the grey wolf optimization gwo algorithm to be integrated with the prediction model to optimally search for the optimal modelling parameters the fact that most of the engineering applications of optimization especially those applications for prediction forecasting desired variable the entire searching space is not initially recognized and has quite great numbers of local optima and hence the meta heuristic algorithms could help overcoming such challenges as a consequence this work aims to integrate relatively new meta heuristic optimization algorithm namely grey wolf optimization gwo algorithm mirjalili et al 2014 with ann models to develop robust integrated systems as well as to examine the applicability of these hybrid schemes in streamflow forecasting the effectiveness of the proposed gwo algorithm is suggested to be examined for ann and ar methods as well 1 2 objective the foremost aim of this research paper is to create an effective hybrid system for streamflow forecasting on monthly timescales by integrating a new meta heuristic optimization algorithm namely grey wolf optimization gwo algorithm with ai models in this study the proposed gwo has been integrated with support vector machine svm multi layer perceptron neural network mlp nn and auto regression ar for comparative analysis purposes historical natural streamflow for 130 years on monthly basis have been collected at aswan high dam ahd on the nile river egypt to evaluate the performance of the proposed modelling technique hydrological and statistical analysis for the collected dataset will be carried out to investigate the practicality of the proposed integrated scheme for forecasting streamflow at semi arid zone moreover quantitative performance indicators were calculated to evaluate the validity of the integrated models also the predicted and the observed streamflow date were comprehensively analyzed 2 case study and data description before introducing the theory and the development of the proposed model it is necessary to introduce the nature of the selected case study to evaluate the model in this section information about the historical natural streamflow of the nile river at aswan high dam ahd will be presented the importance of the choice of this case study to examine the proposed model is due to the fact that ahd is considered as the controller and the regulator for the water resources supply almost 95 for arab republic of egypt in addition the average amount of the annual streamflow of the nile river that crossing the ahd is relatively large and equal to 84 billion cubic meter bcm furthermore the nile river is considered as one of the longest river and largest catchment in the world and its streamflow is believed as highly stochastic and non linear and hence it is an advantageous and trustworthy illustration for examining any potential method for streamflow forecasting model finally it is vital to accurately develop a model for streamflow forecasting in order to generate a proper operational rule for ahd to have optimal water release policy that meet the water demand downstream the dam fortunately 130 years of monthly natural streamflow at ahd is available during the period between 1871 and 2000 at the nile river sector ministry of water resources and irrigation egypt fig 1 shows the natural monthly streamflow at ahd in bcm with careful visualization for fig 1 it could be depicted that during these 130 years there are two major seasons for hydrological regime for streamflow wet season during months between july and december while dry season during the period between january and june in addition the fluctuation in the streamflow for the same month along these 130 years showed that the streamflow is greatly stochastic and extremely non linear for detailed analysis it could be noticed that the maximum annual streamflow was happened in 1877 78 water year an amount is almost equal to 150 33 bcm and the annual minimum streamflow has been experienced in 1913 14 water year with an amount of 42 09 bcm it is essential to assure the reliabilty of the recorded data before the year 1900 because during this time the natural streamflow were recorded by using manual measurment during this time the streamflow records have been recorded by monitoring the water level and hence using the rating curve to calculate the coresponding streamflow in order to verify the streamflow records before 1900 hurst et al 1966 has been reviewed it has been concluded in hurst et al 1966 that during this period double verification with another monitoring station namely halfa gauge station south of ahd has been acquired and examined to assure the matching with those streamflow records at ahd in addition it has been found out that the recent streamflow records during the period between 1900 and 1960 maintain the same means and standard deviation as the period before 1900 hurst et al 1966 generally one of the major step that should be carried out before using such historical data is to assure its reliability in this context prior statistical analysis of the collected data have been accomplished to substantiate the realibilty and the accuracy of the collected data two main indices namely the mean and the standard deviation have been evaluated for different 30 sets of 100 annual streamflow records for these 130 years data it has been found that the mean values are ranged between 82 1 and 84 2 bcm while the standard deviation is ranged between 17 95 and 19 25 bcn with this pre analysis for the collected data that showed a narrow range of the mean and the standard deviation of the collected data could result in high confidenant of the collected data that will be used in the current study further analysis for the collected data have been performed at the monthly basis to show that the data is highly frequent from one month to another and its wide range for each month to demonstrate the difficulty modelling it table 1 shows the simple statistical indices such as the minimum maximum and the mean monthly streamflow for each month during the period between the 1871 and 2000 as it could be noticed in table 1 the maximum and the maximum average streamflow have been experienced in september with an amount of 32 79 bcm and 21 51 bcm respectively in addition it could be depicted that the minimum streamflow has been occurred in may with an amount equal to 0 80 bcm in addition the maximum and the minimum standard deviation is ranged between 0 91 and 5 24 bcm for march and september respectively finally in order to demonstrate how the range of the streamflow is wide for each month it is obvious that the largest range is occurred in july the maximum streamflow is almost six times the minimum streamflow while the smallest range is experienced in november the maximum streamflow is almost three times the minimum streamflow in order to recognize the wide range of the possible streamflow at the ahd for each month the streamflow data for each month has been discretized into different classes if the data for each month has been individually analyzed it could be determined that the streamflow for each month could categorized into three different classes high medium and low streamflow in order to carry out this analysis a straightforward process has been performed to the experienced range of the streamflow for each month the difference between the maximum value of the streamflow events and the minimum value during these 130 years records the upper limit of the range of the high class for any month is the maximum streamflow record while the lower limit is 70 of the difference between the minimum and the maximum streamflow records the lower limit of the range of the low class is the minimum streamflow record while the upper limit is 30 of the difference between the minimum and the maximum streamflow records finally the upper limit of the range of the medium class is the lower limit of the high class and lower limit is the upper limit of the lower class range it could be observed that there is a quite high variation of the ranges of the streamflow class for each month which reflects the highly stochastic of the streamflow pattern as shown in fig 2 3 methodology 3 1 methods 3 1 1 support vector regression svr support vector regression svr is a kind of regression intelligent model based on support vector machine svm which is developed by smola 1996 vapnik 1995 developed the svm technique for the first time on the basis of statistical learning theory and structural risk minimization principle the main objective of svr is to identify a function f x that uses all pairs training data xi observed targets yi with the most minimum ε precision and became to be as linear as possible smola 1996 the svr regression function is declaredas 1 f x w x b where b is the bias term w is the weight vector in the feature space ϕ is the transfer function in order to find a suitable svr function f x the problem of regression can be expressed 2 m i n i m i z e 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i 3 s u b j e c t t o t h e c o n d i t i o n y i f x ε ξ i f x y i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 i 1 2 3 n where c 0 is a penalty parameter ξ i and ξ i are the two slack variables to specify the distance from observed values to the ε that corresponding boundary values by using the lagrangian multipliers the optimization issue is largely converted into a quadratic programming and the solution of the nonlinear regression function can be given as follows 4 f x i 1 n α i α i k x x i b where k x xi is the kernel function αi αi 0 are dual variables steve gunn 1998 describes the details of the use of svm and svr techniques in the technical report vector machinery support for classification and regression the kernel function can be selected by different options including linear polynomial sigmoid and radial basis function rbf kernels however choosing the appropriate kernel function is an important step in using svr model in this research the rbf was adopted as the kernel function because of its performance compared with other kernel functions and the most popular used in literatures liong and sivapragasam 2002 asefa et al 2006 kisi and cimen 2011 tikhamarine et al 2019b he et al 2014 the rbf kernel is defined as 5 k x x i e x p γ x i x 2 where γ is the kernel parameter which means that c γ and ε are the three parameters that are responsible for the svr performance in this study svr models were implemented using matlab software and libsvm version 3 23 developed by chang and lin 2011 and the default parameters were selected as follows c 1 γ 0 01 and ε 0 001 which are used in standard svr 3 1 2 multiple linear regression mlr multiple linear regression mlr is a simple regression equation and one of the most common methods used to solve classical regression problems in statistical analysis tabari et al 2011 in general mlr is used to find an appropriate relationship between the dependent variable y and one or a set of independent variables xi mlr can generate a dependent relationship by building a linear equation calculated based on the following formula 6 y α 0 α 1 x 1 α 2 x 2 α 3 x 3 α n x n where y is the dependent variable qt and xi are the independent variables and α 0 to α n are the regression coefficients of mlr 3 1 3 artificial neural network ann artificial neural network ann is a mathematical model inspired by the function of the biological nervous system of the human being the ann has been presented for the first time by mcculloch and pitts 1943 and can be considered as a mathematical model to solve the complex relationships between variables haykin 1994 the most commonly used ann model is the multilayer perceptron neural network mlp consisting of input and output layers and only one hidden layer in the middle connected to each other with weights and biases standard ann can be reported as an mlp with levenberg marquardt lm training algorithm the explicit mathematical expression to calculate the predicted streamflow can be expressed using the artificial neural network as follows 7 y f 2 i 1 m w kj f 1 a j b o 8 a j i 1 n x i w ji b j where y is the output variable which calculated by the ann model the streamflow predicted reported as y x i is the input variable a j is the summation of the inputs and their weights represented by equation 8 f 1 is the activation function for the hidden layer represented by equation 9 f 2 is the activation function for the output layer wi j is the weight between the input i and the hidden node j b j is the bias of the hidden neuron j wjk is the weight of connection of neuron j in the hidden layer to neuron k in the output layer and b o is the bias of the output node k 9 f 1 a j 1 1 e x p a j because there is no fixed way for selecting the appropriate number of hidden nodes in ann and in order to avoiding drawback in the large numbers of trial and error process from other side the number of hidden nodes was calculated based on the eq 10 used in literatures mirjalili 2015 faris et al 2016 aljarah et al 2018 2019 10 m 2 n 1 where m is the number of neurons n is the number of inputs 3 1 4 grey wolf optimizer gwo algorithm the gwo algorithm is a new intelligent algorithm mimics the hierarchy and social hunting of grey wolves proposed by mirjalili et al 2014 generally the pack of wolves are divided into four groups alpha α beta β delta δ and the rest of wolves are the omega ω the most dominated wolf is alpha and can be considered as a leader of the pack the domination level decrease from alpha to omega is shown in fig 4 a the gwo mechanism is carried out by splitting a set of solutions to the given optimization problem into four groups the first three solutions are the best α β and δ the remaining solutions belong to ω wolves to implement this mechanism the hierarchy in each iteration is updated is updated based on the three best solutions the illustration of the update location is shown in fig 4 b the main principal in gwo algorithm is searching encircling hunting and attacking the prey before hunting process the grey wolves are encircling the prey the following equations represent encircling behaviour of grey wolves 11 x t 1 x p t a d where x t 1 is the next location of any wolf x p t is position vector of the grey wolf t is the current iteration a is matrix coefficient and d is the distance separating the grey wolf and the prey which can be estimated as follows 12 d c x p t x t 13 a 2 a r 1 a 14 c 2 r 2 where r 1 a n d r 2 are randomly generated from 0 to 1 the previous equations permit a solution to relocate around the prey in a hyper sphere form fig 4 b this is not sufficient nevertheless to simulate the social intelligence of grey wolves in order to simulate the prey the best solution obtained so far considered as the alpha wolf is closer to the prey position but the global optimal solution is unknown so it is assumed that the top three solutions have a good idea of their location therefore other wolves should be obliged to update their locations by using the following equations 15 x t 1 1 3 x 1 1 3 x 2 1 3 x 3 where x 1 x 2 a n d x 3 are calculated using the following equations 16 x 1 x α t a 1 d α 17 x 2 x β t a 2 d β 18 x 2 x β t a 2 d β where d α d β a n d d δ are given by 19 d α c 1 x α t x 20 d β c 2 x β t x 21 d δ c 3 x δ t x the prey encircling and attacking are repeated until an optimum solution is obtained or it reaches the maximum number of iterations 3 2 inputs selection and model development 3 2 1 inputs selection choosing proper input variables is very important for the development of svr ann and mlr models since it gives the essential information about the designed system in the present study eight different input combinations including the previous values of streamflow have been selected based on simple autocorrelation function acf and partial autocorrelation function pcf acf and pcf are frequently used to determine the appropriate inputs in the time series prediction field the acf and pcf were utilized to identify delays that clarify the variance in the predicted streamflow fig 3 represents the acf and pacf curves for the nile river at aswan high dam the lag that shows the great correlation have been chosen to be an input to the selected model the optimal input sets derived examining acf and pacf in terms of model number inputs and output for each model are reported in table 3 fig 4 3 2 2 model development the optimization algorithm used in this study is the grey wolf optimize mirjalili et al 2014 because it is one of the modern swarm intelligence algorithm and used successfully in the engineering field yu and lu 2018 al shorman et al 2019 tikhamarine et al 2019a maroufpoor et al 2019 support vector regression and artificial neural network are belongs to the models of artificial intelligence and shows high performance accuracy in modeling the nonlinear relationship between predictors and predictors asefa et al 2006 lin et al 2006 wang et al 2009a b however the performance of the svr depends on its parameters and the choice of kernel function as with the artificial neural network the performance of the ann is also depends on the correct selection of weights and biases the mlr is a linear regression models used to find an appreciated relationship between variables nevertheless the accuracy of mlr also depends on the correct choice of regression coefficients α i consequently the correct selection of parameters can be considered an optimization problem and need a high optimization algorithm to resolve this problem therefore svr was coupledwith gwo to build the svr gwo model ann was coupled with gwo to build the ann gwo and the mlr embedded with gwo to construct the mlr gwo model to predict the streamflow for the nile river at aswan high dam the svr gwo ann gwo and mlr gwo models were trained and tested for each of eight combination the flowcharts of the proposed hybrid models are illustrated in fig 4 a for the hybrid ann gwo b for mlr gwo and c for svr gwo for the mlr gwo the search agent number is the number of regression coefficients eq 6 while in ann gwo the search agent number can be obtained using the following equation 22 n u m b e r o f w i g h t s a n d b i e s e s n m 1 m m 1 1 where the search agent number is the number of weights and biases for ann model n is the number of inputs and m is the number of hidden neurons in the hidden layer besides as prescribed in literatures we utilized the most parameter settings for gwo algorithm table 4 gives initial parameters of gwo algorithm in detail for the svr ann and mlr models 3 3 performance indicators in this study the performance criteria used to assess the model s performance are root mean squared

predictions and n is the number of the data 4 results and discussions in this research the abilities of hybrid ann gwo svr gwo and mlr gwo data driven methods are investigated in monthly inflow forecasting and their results are compared with those of standard ann and svr approaches before applying the mentioned methods whole data are split in two data sets 70 for training and 30 for testing table 2 sums up the brief statistical parameters of the utilized data sets it is clear that both periods have generally similar characteristics and test data have a little more skewed distribution compared to that of training previous inflow values were utilized as inputs to the implemented methods and optimal inputs were decided by applying correlation analysis autocorrelation function acf and partial autocorrelation function pacf are demonstrated in fig 2 and the optimal input sets derived examining acf and pacf are reported in table 3 totally 8 input combinations were selected considering the correlation magnitude of inflow data and as can be observed all previous values up to 13 lags were also utilized as input to better see the usefulness of such analysis in modeling stage of data driven methods table 4givesinitial parameters of gwo algorithm in detail for the svr ann and mlr methods some control parameters were decided considering the past literature the performance of the scr gwo is summarized in table 5 for both training and test stages the optimized svr parameters utilizing meta heuristic gwo algorithm are also provided in the table for each input case table 5 clearly shows that the simulation training stage and forecasting testing stage accuracy of the svr gwo method varies with respect to input combination and the lowest training and testing rmse 1 5578 m3 s and 2 0570 m3 s mae 1 0762 m3 s and 1 2005 m3 s and the highest training and testing r 0 9682 and 0 9363 nse 0 9566 and 0 8728 and wi 0 9886 and 0 9671 belong to the third model with input of qt 1 qt 2 qt 11 qt 12 qt 13 test accuracy of the svr gwo method increases up to 3rd input case decrease in rmse from 2 7808 m3 s to 2 0570 m3 s and increase nse from 0 7676 to 0 8728 and then decrease till 5th input combination increase in rmse from 2 1937 m3 s to 2 2880 m3 s and decrease in nse from 0 8554 to 0 8427 as evident from the results including high number inputs do not guarantee better forecasting accuracy e g zhang 2019 because increasing inputs number may increase variance and add more complexity to the implemented model and this deteriorate the model accuracy in forecasting the other important issue which is worthy to mention here that the input combination recommended by the correlation analysis should not be directly applied to the data driven methods and it is better to try several input cases by considering acf and pacf table 6 sums up the performance of hybrid ann gwo method in training and testing stages of different input cases the optimal model structures are also provided in the table in the structure column first number indicates input number second number is hidden node number and last number indicates the output qt 1 inflow value of current month for example the ann with 2 5 1structure has 2 inputs qt 1 and qt 2 5 hidden nodes and one output similar to the svr gwo among the ann based models the third one having 5 11 1 structure with the input of qt 1 qt 2 qt 11 qt 12 qt 13has the lowest training and testing rmse 1 7663 m3 s and 2 1883 m3 s mae 1 0168 m3 s and 1 2999 m3 s and the highest training and testing r 0 9717 and 0 9314 nse 0 9441 and 0 8561 and wi 0 9854 and 0 9636 an increase in accuracy decrease in rmse from 3 1324 m3 s to 2 1883 m3 s and increase nse from 0 7051 to 0 8561 from 1st input to 3rd input cases and then an increase in accuracy increase in rmse from 2 3782 m3 s to 2 3850 m3 s and decrease in nse from 0 8300 to 0 8290 is seen from 4th input to 5th input cases for the testing stage of ann gwo method for this method also less number of inputs provides better accuracy compare the m3 with m2 m5 m6 m7 and m8 tables 7 and 8 give the accuracy of standard svr and ann methods in forecasting monthly inflows alike to hybrid svr gwo and svr gwo among the svr based models the third svr based model has the lowest performance in both training rmse 1 8253 m3 s mae 0 9780 m3 s r 0 9724 nse 0 9404 wi 0 9834 and testing rmse 2 2248 m3 s mae 1 3190 m3 s r 0 9244 nse 0 8512 wi 0 9605 stages table 7 similarly among the ann based models the third ann based model has the lowest performance in training rmse 1 3110 m3 s mae 0 8006 m3 s r 0 9845 nse 0 9692 wi 0 9921 and testing rmse 2 4214 m3 s mae 1 3105 m3 s r 0 9118 nse 0 8238 wi 0 9539 stages table 8 in both svr and ann methods accuracy of the models increase from 1st input to 3rd input and decrease from 4th to 5th input similar to hybrid versions also for these methods better accuracy can be obtained utilizing the models with a smaller number of inputs the accuracy of hybrid mlr gwo method is provided in table 9 for training and test periods parallel results were also obtained from this method so that the third model had the best accuracy rmse 2 0366 m3 s and2 3883 m3 s mae 1 1255 m3 s and 1 3370 m3 s r 0 9623 and 0 9121 nse 0 9257 and 0 8286 wi 0 9806 and 0 9538 for training and testing respectively in both periods and accuracy variation with respect to input cases is similar to previous methods comparison of hybrid methods table 5 6 and 9 reveals that the both hybrid svr gwo and ann gwo methods have better approximation accuracy in training stage and performs superior to the mlr gwoin forecasting testing stage in all input cases the best model is svr gwo based model with 3rd input combination and followed by the ann gwo based model with the same input this indicates the nonlinearity of the investigated phenomenon and therefore linear mlr gwo based models cannot adequately map monthly inflows the other advantages of hybrid svr and ann methods are involving much more model parameters compared to hybrid mlr approach this can be clearly seen from the tables 10 and 11 which present the optimized parameters of ann and mlr methods high number of parameters adds flexibility to the data driven methods but if they are adequately calibrated the relative rmse mae r nse and wi differences between the optimal hybrid svr gwo model m3 and ann gwo model m3 in the testing stage are 6 7 6 0 5 2 0 4 respectively comparison of hybrid svr gwo and standard svr methods table 5 and 7 indicates that the hybrid svr gwo method can make better approximation in training stage and produce better forecasts than the single svr in forecasting monthly inflow in all input cases this indicates the superiority of gwo meta heuristic algorithm compared to training algorithm of standard svr the relative rmse mae r nse and wi differences between the optimal hybrid svr gwo model m3 and svr model m3 in the testing stage are 7 5 9 1 3 2 5 0 7 respectively similarly comparison of hybrid ann gwo and standard ann methods tables 6 and 8 indicates that the gwo algorithm makes better approximation in training stage and provides better forecasts than the single ann in forecasting inflow in all input cases this reveals the superiority of gwo meta heuristic algorithm compared to the training algorithm levenberg marquardt of standard ann the relative rmse mae r nse and wi differences between the optimal hybrid ann gwo m3 and ann m3 in the testing stage are 10 7 0 8 2 1 3 8 and 1 respectively from the results obtained from table 5 8 we can say that the svr method performs superior to the ann method in forecasting monthly inflows kernel function add flexibility to the svr and thus it can implicitly simulate the input data to a higher dimensional hd space linear solutions of the problems in the feature space of hd correspond to non linear solutions in the original lower dimensional input space these characteristicsmake svr a feasible alternative for the solution of several problems in water resources and hydrology which are naturally non linear naganna and deka 2014 fig 6 illustrates time variation graph of observed and forecasted monthly inflows by the optimal models it also includes detail graphs of two sections it is clearly seen from detail graphs that the forecasts of the svr gwo 3 model are closer to the corresponding observed inflow values the forecasts of the optimal models are compared in fig 7 in the scatter plot form it is apparent from the graphs that the svr gwo 3 model m3 has less scattered forecasts compared to ann gwo 3 mlr gwo 3 ann 3 and svr 3 models the time variation of relative errors is shown in fig 8 for each method as observed from the figure the range of relative errors is less for the svr gwo 3 model in comparison to the other models 5 conclusion a new integrated model which combines the grey wolf optimization gwo algorithm and support vector regression was proposed to predict monthly streamflow in aswan high dam gwo was developed for optimizing the hyper parameters of svr such as the global solution parameters and then it compared with two more integrated algorithms such as artificial neural network ann and multiple linear regression mlr the results reveal the integrated ai models with gwo were proven to be more accurate and effective compared with the standard ai moreover the integrated svr gwo outperformed in terms of performance criteria convergence ann gwo and mlr gwo in forecasting the monthly streamflow this reveals the superiority of gwo meta heuristic algorithm in optimizing the parameter of the standard svr to improve its accuracy in forecasting the streamflow in future researches the improved revised algorithm of grey wolf optimization can be introduced to enhance the hyper parameters optimization in order to avoid trapping in local optima in addition in a few cases studies there is a need to develop real time forecasting model and hence the time consuming for the model execution should be lessen therefore there is a need to improve the searching algorithm for the gwo to achieve fast convergence procedure as well moreover other advanced meta heuristic algorithms could be investigated to improve streamflow forecasting credit authorship contribution statement yazid tikhamarine methodology software visualization doudja souag

5792,monthly streamflow forecasting is required for short and long term water resources management especially in extreme events such as flood and drought therefore there is need to develop a reliable and precise model for streamflow forecasting the precision of artificial intelligence ai models can be improved by using hybrid ai models which consist of coupled models therefore the chief aim of this study is to propose efficient hybrid system by integrating grey wolf optimization gwo algorithm with artificial intelligence ai models 130 years of monthly historical natural streamflow data will be used to evaluate the performance of the proposed modelling technique quantitative performance indicators will be introduced to evaluate the validity of the integrated models in addition to that comprehensive analysis will be conducted between the predicted and the observed streamflow the results show the integrated ai with gwo outperform the standard ai methods and can make better forecasting during training and testing phases for the monthly inflow in all input cases this finding reveals the superiority of gwo meta heuristic algorithm in improving the accuracy of the standard ai in forecasting the monthly inflow keywords streamflow estimation evolutionary algorithms aswan high dam 1 introduction broad scale of applications in water resources management and planning require an imperative development to obtain an optimum model for streamflow prediction it is essential to know that the precise estimation of streamflow is considered a significant stochastic feature in environmental modeling and it has attracted a big deal of importance in different kinds of applications in such as activities of water operation maintenance management agricultural and irrigation management drought and flood alert systems etc as reported in bruins 1990 amiri 2015 vogel et al 2015 from a practical point of view the performance of streamflow model necessitates a specific period of time to function which can either be a long time period e g weekly monthly and seasonal or short time period e g hourly and daily and this matter was the main focus of the researchers in water resources field over the past twenty years zealand et al 1999 wu et al 2009a b ismail et al 2012 terzi and ergin 2014 zia et al 2015 generally it is difficult to attain a precise and dependable streamflow model because the chaotic properties of streamflow el shafie et al 2007a including non linearity stochasticity and non stationarity govern the behavior of streamflow and cause its complexity bayazit 2015 moreover several factors are also influencing the stream flow for instance environment climate variability narsimlu et al 2015 local and seasonal patterns heterogeneity in temperature at the local and regional scale and the frequent of the precipitations temporal and spatial variability of watershed the properties of catchments as well as the activities of human beings danandeh mehr et al 2013 dehghani et al 2014 maity and kashid 2011 singh and cui 2015 despite of all water resources scholars are still making marvelous efforts to develop a reliable and precise model for streamflow forecasting angelakis and gikas 2014 those scholars thrive to develop and acquire original and innovative systems to beat the complexities in their models for stream flow estimating 1 1 background the hydrologists are vitally depends on streamflow forecasting in production of sustainable theoretical basis of water infrastructures in flood measurement control in monitoring the operational projects through observation of river behavior however the conventional regression based models are incapable to estimate the streamflow data sufficiently because the relationship between the output and input variables are inherently non linear based on that it is substantial to improve the capability of the model employed for streamflow data prediction by effectively evaluate and extract the non linear manner of the relationship between the predictor predicted originally the conventional statistical approaches mainly the ones that based on theoretical techniques such as regression methods and box jenkin time series approaches were applied widely to analyze and model the hydrological time series mainly the estimation of streamflow amisigo et al 2008 box and jenkins 1970 chua and wong 2011 valipour et al 2013 during the last two decades there are abundant of researches have been developed to investigate the potential of using data driven models such as artificial intelligence ai methods the purpose of data driven modeling is to use the techniques of artificial intelligence ai for extraction of documented data pattern in past to predict streamflow data in future and it has proven to be highly prevalent and favorable forecasting tool by generating estimated streamflow data that effectively represent the actual streamflow data chen et al 2015 deo and şahin 2016 fathian et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 a variety of ai based approaches which involve different variables related to streamflow such as evaporation drought and temperature have been applied in a plethora of forecasting studies for wide range of reasons for instance the models can be employed for local scale processes e g irrigation or farms they show a relative competitive performance with low complexity comparing to the common physically based hydrological models additionally the data inexpensive nature of ai based models and they can be used easily designing of forecasting models and related applications ahmed et al 2019 afan et al 2017 several of ai models have been established using artificial neural networks ann technique bai et al 2016 el shafie et al 2009 bahrami et al 2016 valipour et al 2012 fuzzy logic and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis el shafie et al 2007b kisi 2015 sharma et al 2015 zounemat kermani and teshnehlab 2008 genetic programing danandeh mehr et al 2014 makkeasorn et al 2008 turan and yurdusev 2014 algorithms of regression and support vector machine guo et al 2011 rasouli et al 2012 wang et al 2009a b in general compared to the traditional auto regression and other regression based methods the performance of ai based approaches for forecasting of streamflow is proven to be more reliable and effective yaseen et al 2015a yaseen et al 2016a b recently major efforts have been made to review and explore the weakness and merits of different types of ai methods in water resources field nourani et al 2014 yaseen et al 2015b it was concluded that there is no absolute ai model appropriate for all kinds of modelling such as estimation forecasting classification optimization etc and generally there was no individual machine learning approach appropriate for all definite problems nevertheless the precision of ai models with no data pre processing techniques can be improved by using hybrid ai models consist of coupled models with data pre processing methods the common used method for preprocessing of data in water resources applications is wavelet transformation wt okkan and ali serbes 2013 parmar and bhardwaj 2014 pramanik et al 2010 wei et al 2013 from this perspective it is evident that the certainty of the forecasted streamflow data can be effectively enhanced by the integration of two or more techniques to model and assimilate the data patterns and this is defined as hybrid approach fahimi et al 2016 the incorporation of different optimization models implanted into a separate ai based model leads to a noticeable improvement in the efficiency of streamflow forecasting model which is demonstrated by reduction of the computational time and by inference of an ideal solution for the valuation problem ch et al 2014 kavousi fard et al 2014a b although the accuracy of forecasting model can be improved by hybrid models researchers are still conducting many experiments to generate a sufficient approach that can deduce the optimal solutions in the area of forecasting through the utilization of ai models with preprocessing methods in general it has been proved that for engineering optimization application the achievement of global optima is a vital step in the successfulness of the prediction forecasting models a few researches showed that the meta heuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga particle swarm optimization pso harmony search hs ante colony optimization aco have excellent searching aptitudes to achieve the global optima and elude the local optima compared to the classical optimization algorithms these meta heuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga particle swarm optimization pso harmony search hs ante colony optimization aco this is due to the fact that these meta heuristics algorithms might have the nature behave which tolerates the stagnations in the local optima and rapidly switch to searching mode again to achieve the global optima position in fact the mentioned optimization algorithms have several advantages and disadvantages the major advantage in these algorithms is their ability to be adjusted to include several nonlinear systems in parallel or series with different constraints and objective functions the major disadvantage is the difficulty of addressing the stochastic pattern of the system parameters slow convergence and lack of ability to distinguish the optimal global solutions in this context this study introduces an improved meta heuristic algorithm to address the stochastic pattern of the prediction methods internal parameters and improve the ability of the search procedure to return global optima with relatively faster convergence furthermore the gwo algorithm has the capability of balance between exploration and exploitation efficiently and much better this avoids a large number of local solutions and provides an assessment of both accuracy and convergence speed on the other hand the gwo algorithm with ann model has been utilized to estimate reference evapotranspiration et0 and compared with other four optimization algorithms pso alo woa and mvo tikhamarine et al 2019a the results obtained demonstrate the superiority of the gwo algorithm over other optimization algorithms in all cases toward this end this study proposes the grey wolf optimization gwo algorithm to be integrated with the prediction model to optimally search for the optimal modelling parameters the fact that most of the engineering applications of optimization especially those applications for prediction forecasting desired variable the entire searching space is not initially recognized and has quite great numbers of local optima and hence the meta heuristic algorithms could help overcoming such challenges as a consequence this work aims to integrate relatively new meta heuristic optimization algorithm namely grey wolf optimization gwo algorithm mirjalili et al 2014 with ann models to develop robust integrated systems as well as to examine the applicability of these hybrid schemes in streamflow forecasting the effectiveness of the proposed gwo algorithm is suggested to be examined for ann and ar methods as well 1 2 objective the foremost aim of this research paper is to create an effective hybrid system for streamflow forecasting on monthly timescales by integrating a new meta heuristic optimization algorithm namely grey wolf optimization gwo algorithm with ai models in this study the proposed gwo has been integrated with support vector machine svm multi layer perceptron neural network mlp nn and auto regression ar for comparative analysis purposes historical natural streamflow for 130 years on monthly basis have been collected at aswan high dam ahd on the nile river egypt to evaluate the performance of the proposed modelling technique hydrological and statistical analysis for the collected dataset will be carried out to investigate the practicality of the proposed integrated scheme for forecasting streamflow at semi arid zone moreover quantitative performance indicators were calculated to evaluate the validity of the integrated models also the predicted and the observed streamflow date were comprehensively analyzed 2 case study and data description before introducing the theory and the development of the proposed model it is necessary to introduce the nature of the selected case study to evaluate the model in this section information about the historical natural streamflow of the nile river at aswan high dam ahd will be presented the importance of the choice of this case study to examine the proposed model is due to the fact that ahd is considered as the controller and the regulator for the water resources supply almost 95 for arab republic of egypt in addition the average amount of the annual streamflow of the nile river that crossing the ahd is relatively large and equal to 84 billion cubic meter bcm furthermore the nile river is considered as one of the longest river and largest catchment in the world and its streamflow is believed as highly stochastic and non linear and hence it is an advantageous and trustworthy illustration for examining any potential method for streamflow forecasting model finally it is vital to accurately develop a model for streamflow forecasting in order to generate a proper operational rule for ahd to have optimal water release policy that meet the water demand downstream the dam fortunately 130 years of monthly natural streamflow at ahd is available during the period between 1871 and 2000 at the nile river sector ministry of water resources and irrigation egypt fig 1 shows the natural monthly streamflow at ahd in bcm with careful visualization for fig 1 it could be depicted that during these 130 years there are two major seasons for hydrological regime for streamflow wet season during months between july and december while dry season during the period between january and june in addition the fluctuation in the streamflow for the same month along these 130 years showed that the streamflow is greatly stochastic and extremely non linear for detailed analysis it could be noticed that the maximum annual streamflow was happened in 1877 78 water year an amount is almost equal to 150 33 bcm and the annual minimum streamflow has been experienced in 1913 14 water year with an amount of 42 09 bcm it is essential to assure the reliabilty of the recorded data before the year 1900 because during this time the natural streamflow were recorded by using manual measurment during this time the streamflow records have been recorded by monitoring the water level and hence using the rating curve to calculate the coresponding streamflow in order to verify the streamflow records before 1900 hurst et al 1966 has been reviewed it has been concluded in hurst et al 1966 that during this period double verification with another monitoring station namely halfa gauge station south of ahd has been acquired and examined to assure the matching with those streamflow records at ahd in addition it has been found out that the recent streamflow records during the period between 1900 and 1960 maintain the same means and standard deviation as the period before 1900 hurst et al 1966 generally one of the major step that should be carried out before using such historical data is to assure its reliability in this context prior statistical analysis of the collected data have been accomplished to substantiate the realibilty and the accuracy of the collected data two main indices namely the mean and the standard deviation have been evaluated for different 30 sets of 100 annual streamflow records for these 130 years data it has been found that the mean values are ranged between 82 1 and 84 2 bcm while the standard deviation is ranged between 17 95 and 19 25 bcn with this pre analysis for the collected data that showed a narrow range of the mean and the standard deviation of the collected data could result in high confidenant of the collected data that will be used in the current study further analysis for the collected data have been performed at the monthly basis to show that the data is highly frequent from one month to another and its wide range for each month to demonstrate the difficulty modelling it table 1 shows the simple statistical indices such as the minimum maximum and the mean monthly streamflow for each month during the period between the 1871 and 2000 as it could be noticed in table 1 the maximum and the maximum average streamflow have been experienced in september with an amount of 32 79 bcm and 21 51 bcm respectively in addition it could be depicted that the minimum streamflow has been occurred in may with an amount equal to 0 80 bcm in addition the maximum and the minimum standard deviation is ranged between 0 91 and 5 24 bcm for march and september respectively finally in order to demonstrate how the range of the streamflow is wide for each month it is obvious that the largest range is occurred in july the maximum streamflow is almost six times the minimum streamflow while the smallest range is experienced in november the maximum streamflow is almost three times the minimum streamflow in order to recognize the wide range of the possible streamflow at the ahd for each month the streamflow data for each month has been discretized into different classes if the data for each month has been individually analyzed it could be determined that the streamflow for each month could categorized into three different classes high medium and low streamflow in order to carry out this analysis a straightforward process has been performed to the experienced range of the streamflow for each month the difference between the maximum value of the streamflow events and the minimum value during these 130 years records the upper limit of the range of the high class for any month is the maximum streamflow record while the lower limit is 70 of the difference between the minimum and the maximum streamflow records the lower limit of the range of the low class is the minimum streamflow record while the upper limit is 30 of the difference between the minimum and the maximum streamflow records finally the upper limit of the range of the medium class is the lower limit of the high class and lower limit is the upper limit of the lower class range it could be observed that there is a quite high variation of the ranges of the streamflow class for each month which reflects the highly stochastic of the streamflow pattern as shown in fig 2 3 methodology 3 1 methods 3 1 1 support vector regression svr support vector regression svr is a kind of regression intelligent model based on support vector machine svm which is developed by smola 1996 vapnik 1995 developed the svm technique for the first time on the basis of statistical learning theory and structural risk minimization principle the main objective of svr is to identify a function f x that uses all pairs training data xi observed targets yi with the most minimum ε precision and became to be as linear as possible smola 1996 the svr regression function is declaredas 1 f x w x b where b is the bias term w is the weight vector in the feature space ϕ is the transfer function in order to find a suitable svr function f x the problem of regression can be expressed 2 m i n i m i z e 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i 3 s u b j e c t t o t h e c o n d i t i o n y i f x ε ξ i f x y i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 i 1 2 3 n where c 0 is a penalty parameter ξ i and ξ i are the two slack variables to specify the distance from observed values to the ε that corresponding boundary values by using the lagrangian multipliers the optimization issue is largely converted into a quadratic programming and the solution of the nonlinear regression function can be given as follows 4 f x i 1 n α i α i k x x i b where k x xi is the kernel function αi αi 0 are dual variables steve gunn 1998 describes the details of the use of svm and svr techniques in the technical report vector machinery support for classification and regression the kernel function can be selected by different options including linear polynomial sigmoid and radial basis function rbf kernels however choosing the appropriate kernel function is an important step in using svr model in this research the rbf was adopted as the kernel function because of its performance compared with other kernel functions and the most popular used in literatures liong and sivapragasam 2002 asefa et al 2006 kisi and cimen 2011 tikhamarine et al 2019b he et al 2014 the rbf kernel is defined as 5 k x x i e x p γ x i x 2 where γ is the kernel parameter which means that c γ and ε are the three parameters that are responsible for the svr performance in this study svr models were implemented using matlab software and libsvm version 3 23 developed by chang and lin 2011 and the default parameters were selected as follows c 1 γ 0 01 and ε 0 001 which are used in standard svr 3 1 2 multiple linear regression mlr multiple linear regression mlr is a simple regression equation and one of the most common methods used to solve classical regression problems in statistical analysis tabari et al 2011 in general mlr is used to find an appropriate relationship between the dependent variable y and one or a set of independent variables xi mlr can generate a dependent relationship by building a linear equation calculated based on the following formula 6 y α 0 α 1 x 1 α 2 x 2 α 3 x 3 α n x n where y is the dependent variable qt and xi are the independent variables and α 0 to α n are the regression coefficients of mlr 3 1 3 artificial neural network ann artificial neural network ann is a mathematical model inspired by the function of the biological nervous system of the human being the ann has been presented for the first time by mcculloch and pitts 1943 and can be considered as a mathematical model to solve the complex relationships between variables haykin 1994 the most commonly used ann model is the multilayer perceptron neural network mlp consisting of input and output layers and only one hidden layer in the middle connected to each other with weights and biases standard ann can be reported as an mlp with levenberg marquardt lm training algorithm the explicit mathematical expression to calculate the predicted streamflow can be expressed using the artificial neural network as follows 7 y f 2 i 1 m w kj f 1 a j b o 8 a j i 1 n x i w ji b j where y is the output variable which calculated by the ann model the streamflow predicted reported as y x i is the input variable a j is the summation of the inputs and their weights represented by equation 8 f 1 is the activation function for the hidden layer represented by equation 9 f 2 is the activation function for the output layer wi j is the weight between the input i and the hidden node j b j is the bias of the hidden neuron j wjk is the weight of connection of neuron j in the hidden layer to neuron k in the output layer and b o is the bias of the output node k 9 f 1 a j 1 1 e x p a j because there is no fixed way for selecting the appropriate number of hidden nodes in ann and in order to avoiding drawback in the large numbers of trial and error process from other side the number of hidden nodes was calculated based on the eq 10 used in literatures mirjalili 2015 faris et al 2016 aljarah et al 2018 2019 10 m 2 n 1 where m is the number of neurons n is the number of inputs 3 1 4 grey wolf optimizer gwo algorithm the gwo algorithm is a new intelligent algorithm mimics the hierarchy and social hunting of grey wolves proposed by mirjalili et al 2014 generally the pack of wolves are divided into four groups alpha α beta β delta δ and the rest of wolves are the omega ω the most dominated wolf is alpha and can be considered as a leader of the pack the domination level decrease from alpha to omega is shown in fig 4 a the gwo mechanism is carried out by splitting a set of solutions to the given optimization problem into four groups the first three solutions are the best α β and δ the remaining solutions belong to ω wolves to implement this mechanism the hierarchy in each iteration is updated is updated based on the three best solutions the illustration of the update location is shown in fig 4 b the main principal in gwo algorithm is searching encircling hunting and attacking the prey before hunting process the grey wolves are encircling the prey the following equations represent encircling behaviour of grey wolves 11 x t 1 x p t a d where x t 1 is the next location of any wolf x p t is position vector of the grey wolf t is the current iteration a is matrix coefficient and d is the distance separating the grey wolf and the prey which can be estimated as follows 12 d c x p t x t 13 a 2 a r 1 a 14 c 2 r 2 where r 1 a n d r 2 are randomly generated from 0 to 1 the previous equations permit a solution to relocate around the prey in a hyper sphere form fig 4 b this is not sufficient nevertheless to simulate the social intelligence of grey wolves in order to simulate the prey the best solution obtained so far considered as the alpha wolf is closer to the prey position but the global optimal solution is unknown so it is assumed that the top three solutions have a good idea of their location therefore other wolves should be obliged to update their locations by using the following equations 15 x t 1 1 3 x 1 1 3 x 2 1 3 x 3 where x 1 x 2 a n d x 3 are calculated using the following equations 16 x 1 x α t a 1 d α 17 x 2 x β t a 2 d β 18 x 2 x β t a 2 d β where d α d β a n d d δ are given by 19 d α c 1 x α t x 20 d β c 2 x β t x 21 d δ c 3 x δ t x the prey encircling and attacking are repeated until an optimum solution is obtained or it reaches the maximum number of iterations 3 2 inputs selection and model development 3 2 1 inputs selection choosing proper input variables is very important for the development of svr ann and mlr models since it gives the essential information about the designed system in the present study eight different input combinations including the previous values of streamflow have been selected based on simple autocorrelation function acf and partial autocorrelation function pcf acf and pcf are frequently used to determine the appropriate inputs in the time series prediction field the acf and pcf were utilized to identify delays that clarify the variance in the predicted streamflow fig 3 represents the acf and pacf curves for the nile river at aswan high dam the lag that shows the great correlation have been chosen to be an input to the selected model the optimal input sets derived examining acf and pacf in terms of model number inputs and output for each model are reported in table 3 fig 4 3 2 2 model development the optimization algorithm used in this study is the grey wolf optimize mirjalili et al 2014 because it is one of the modern swarm intelligence algorithm and used successfully in the engineering field yu and lu 2018 al shorman et al 2019 tikhamarine et al 2019a maroufpoor et al 2019 support vector regression and artificial neural network are belongs to the models of artificial intelligence and shows high performance accuracy in modeling the nonlinear relationship between predictors and predictors asefa et al 2006 lin et al 2006 wang et al 2009a b however the performance of the svr depends on its parameters and the choice of kernel function as with the artificial neural network the performance of the ann is also depends on the correct selection of weights and biases the mlr is a linear regression models used to find an appreciated relationship between variables nevertheless the accuracy of mlr also depends on the correct choice of regression coefficients α i consequently the correct selection of parameters can be considered an optimization problem and need a high optimization algorithm to resolve this problem therefore svr was coupledwith gwo to build the svr gwo model ann was coupled with gwo to build the ann gwo and the mlr embedded with gwo to construct the mlr gwo model to predict the streamflow for the nile river at aswan high dam the svr gwo ann gwo and mlr gwo models were trained and tested for each of eight combination the flowcharts of the proposed hybrid models are illustrated in fig 4 a for the hybrid ann gwo b for mlr gwo and c for svr gwo for the mlr gwo the search agent number is the number of regression coefficients eq 6 while in ann gwo the search agent number can be obtained using the following equation 22 n u m b e r o f w i g h t s a n d b i e s e s n m 1 m m 1 1 where the search agent number is the number of weights and biases for ann model n is the number of inputs and m is the number of hidden neurons in the hidden layer besides as prescribed in literatures we utilized the most parameter settings for gwo algorithm table 4 gives initial parameters of gwo algorithm in detail for the svr ann and mlr models 3 3 performance indicators in this study the performance criteria used to assess the model s performance are root mean squared

predictions and n is the number of the data 4 results and discussions in this research the abilities of hybrid ann gwo svr gwo and mlr gwo data driven methods are investigated in monthly inflow forecasting and their results are compared with those of standard ann and svr approaches before applying the mentioned methods whole data are split in two data sets 70 for training and 30 for testing table 2 sums up the brief statistical parameters of the utilized data sets it is clear that both periods have generally similar characteristics and test data have a little more skewed distribution compared to that of training previous inflow values were utilized as inputs to the implemented methods and optimal inputs were decided by applying correlation analysis autocorrelation function acf and partial autocorrelation function pacf are demonstrated in fig 2 and the optimal input sets derived examining acf and pacf are reported in table 3 totally 8 input combinations were selected considering the correlation magnitude of inflow data and as can be observed all previous values up to 13 lags were also utilized as input to better see the usefulness of such analysis in modeling stage of data driven methods table 4givesinitial parameters of gwo algorithm in detail for the svr ann and mlr methods some control parameters were decided considering the past literature the performance of the scr gwo is summarized in table 5 for both training and test stages the optimized svr parameters utilizing meta heuristic gwo algorithm are also provided in the table for each input case table 5 clearly shows that the simulation training stage and forecasting testing stage accuracy of the svr gwo method varies with respect to input combination and the lowest training and testing rmse 1 5578 m3 s and 2 0570 m3 s mae 1 0762 m3 s and 1 2005 m3 s and the highest training and testing r 0 9682 and 0 9363 nse 0 9566 and 0 8728 and wi 0 9886 and 0 9671 belong to the third model with input of qt 1 qt 2 qt 11 qt 12 qt 13 test accuracy of the svr gwo method increases up to 3rd input case decrease in rmse from 2 7808 m3 s to 2 0570 m3 s and increase nse from 0 7676 to 0 8728 and then decrease till 5th input combination increase in rmse from 2 1937 m3 s to 2 2880 m3 s and decrease in nse from 0 8554 to 0 8427 as evident from the results including high number inputs do not guarantee better forecasting accuracy e g zhang 2019 because increasing inputs number may increase variance and add more complexity to the implemented model and this deteriorate the model accuracy in forecasting the other important issue which is worthy to mention here that the input combination recommended by the correlation analysis should not be directly applied to the data driven methods and it is better to try several input cases by considering acf and pacf table 6 sums up the performance of hybrid ann gwo method in training and testing stages of different input cases the optimal model structures are also provided in the table in the structure column first number indicates input number second number is hidden node number and last number indicates the output qt 1 inflow value of current month for example the ann with 2 5 1structure has 2 inputs qt 1 and qt 2 5 hidden nodes and one output similar to the svr gwo among the ann based models the third one having 5 11 1 structure with the input of qt 1 qt 2 qt 11 qt 12 qt 13has the lowest training and testing rmse 1 7663 m3 s and 2 1883 m3 s mae 1 0168 m3 s and 1 2999 m3 s and the highest training and testing r 0 9717 and 0 9314 nse 0 9441 and 0 8561 and wi 0 9854 and 0 9636 an increase in accuracy decrease in rmse from 3 1324 m3 s to 2 1883 m3 s and increase nse from 0 7051 to 0 8561 from 1st input to 3rd input cases and then an increase in accuracy increase in rmse from 2 3782 m3 s to 2 3850 m3 s and decrease in nse from 0 8300 to 0 8290 is seen from 4th input to 5th input cases for the testing stage of ann gwo method for this method also less number of inputs provides better accuracy compare the m3 with m2 m5 m6 m7 and m8 tables 7 and 8 give the accuracy of standard svr and ann methods in forecasting monthly inflows alike to hybrid svr gwo and svr gwo among the svr based models the third svr based model has the lowest performance in both training rmse 1 8253 m3 s mae 0 9780 m3 s r 0 9724 nse 0 9404 wi 0 9834 and testing rmse 2 2248 m3 s mae 1 3190 m3 s r 0 9244 nse 0 8512 wi 0 9605 stages table 7 similarly among the ann based models the third ann based model has the lowest performance in training rmse 1 3110 m3 s mae 0 8006 m3 s r 0 9845 nse 0 9692 wi 0 9921 and testing rmse 2 4214 m3 s mae 1 3105 m3 s r 0 9118 nse 0 8238 wi 0 9539 stages table 8 in both svr and ann methods accuracy of the models increase from 1st input to 3rd input and decrease from 4th to 5th input similar to hybrid versions also for these methods better accuracy can be obtained utilizing the models with a smaller number of inputs the accuracy of hybrid mlr gwo method is provided in table 9 for training and test periods parallel results were also obtained from this method so that the third model had the best accuracy rmse 2 0366 m3 s and2 3883 m3 s mae 1 1255 m3 s and 1 3370 m3 s r 0 9623 and 0 9121 nse 0 9257 and 0 8286 wi 0 9806 and 0 9538 for training and testing respectively in both periods and accuracy variation with respect to input cases is similar to previous methods comparison of hybrid methods table 5 6 and 9 reveals that the both hybrid svr gwo and ann gwo methods have better approximation accuracy in training stage and performs superior to the mlr gwoin forecasting testing stage in all input cases the best model is svr gwo based model with 3rd input combination and followed by the ann gwo based model with the same input this indicates the nonlinearity of the investigated phenomenon and therefore linear mlr gwo based models cannot adequately map monthly inflows the other advantages of hybrid svr and ann methods are involving much more model parameters compared to hybrid mlr approach this can be clearly seen from the tables 10 and 11 which present the optimized parameters of ann and mlr methods high number of parameters adds flexibility to the data driven methods but if they are adequately calibrated the relative rmse mae r nse and wi differences between the optimal hybrid svr gwo model m3 and ann gwo model m3 in the testing stage are 6 7 6 0 5 2 0 4 respectively comparison of hybrid svr gwo and standard svr methods table 5 and 7 indicates that the hybrid svr gwo method can make better approximation in training stage and produce better forecasts than the single svr in forecasting monthly inflow in all input cases this indicates the superiority of gwo meta heuristic algorithm compared to training algorithm of standard svr the relative rmse mae r nse and wi differences between the optimal hybrid svr gwo model m3 and svr model m3 in the testing stage are 7 5 9 1 3 2 5 0 7 respectively similarly comparison of hybrid ann gwo and standard ann methods tables 6 and 8 indicates that the gwo algorithm makes better approximation in training stage and provides better forecasts than the single ann in forecasting inflow in all input cases this reveals the superiority of gwo meta heuristic algorithm compared to the training algorithm levenberg marquardt of standard ann the relative rmse mae r nse and wi differences between the optimal hybrid ann gwo m3 and ann m3 in the testing stage are 10 7 0 8 2 1 3 8 and 1 respectively from the results obtained from table 5 8 we can say that the svr method performs superior to the ann method in forecasting monthly inflows kernel function add flexibility to the svr and thus it can implicitly simulate the input data to a higher dimensional hd space linear solutions of the problems in the feature space of hd correspond to non linear solutions in the original lower dimensional input space these characteristicsmake svr a feasible alternative for the solution of several problems in water resources and hydrology which are naturally non linear naganna and deka 2014 fig 6 illustrates time variation graph of observed and forecasted monthly inflows by the optimal models it also includes detail graphs of two sections it is clearly seen from detail graphs that the forecasts of the svr gwo 3 model are closer to the corresponding observed inflow values the forecasts of the optimal models are compared in fig 7 in the scatter plot form it is apparent from the graphs that the svr gwo 3 model m3 has less scattered forecasts compared to ann gwo 3 mlr gwo 3 ann 3 and svr 3 models the time variation of relative errors is shown in fig 8 for each method as observed from the figure the range of relative errors is less for the svr gwo 3 model in comparison to the other models 5 conclusion a new integrated model which combines the grey wolf optimization gwo algorithm and support vector regression was proposed to predict monthly streamflow in aswan high dam gwo was developed for optimizing the hyper parameters of svr such as the global solution parameters and then it compared with two more integrated algorithms such as artificial neural network ann and multiple linear regression mlr the results reveal the integrated ai models with gwo were proven to be more accurate and effective compared with the standard ai moreover the integrated svr gwo outperformed in terms of performance criteria convergence ann gwo and mlr gwo in forecasting the monthly streamflow this reveals the superiority of gwo meta heuristic algorithm in optimizing the parameter of the standard svr to improve its accuracy in forecasting the streamflow in future researches the improved revised algorithm of grey wolf optimization can be introduced to enhance the hyper parameters optimization in order to avoid trapping in local optima in addition in a few cases studies there is a need to develop real time forecasting model and hence the time consuming for the model execution should be lessen therefore there is a need to improve the searching algorithm for the gwo to achieve fast convergence procedure as well moreover other advanced meta heuristic algorithms could be investigated to improve streamflow forecasting credit authorship contribution statement yazid tikhamarine methodology software visualization doudja souag

5793,we present a new open source and modular instrumentation package composed of up to ten automatic infiltrometers connected to data acquisition systems for automatic recording of multiple infiltration experiments the infiltrometers are equipped with differential transducers to monitor water level changes in a mariotte reservoir and in turn to quantify water infiltration rates the data acquisition systems consist of low cost components and operate on the open source microcontroller platform arduino the devices were tested both in the laboratory and on different urban and agricultural soils in france and india more specifically we tested three procedures to treat the transducers readings including a filtering algorithm that substantially improved the ability to determine cumulative infiltration from raw data we combined these three procedures with four methods for estimating the soil parameters from infiltrometer data showing pros and cons of each scenario we also demonstrated advantages in using the automatic infiltrometers when infiltration measurements were hindered by i linearity in cumulative infiltration curves owing to gravity driven flow ii an imprecise description of the transient state of infiltration and iii the occurrence of soil water repellency the use of the automatic infiltrometers allows the user to obtain more accurate estimates of soil hydraulic parameters while also reducing the amount of effort needed to run multiple experiments keywords automatic infiltrometer infiltration rate measurements soil hydraulic properties arduino 1 introduction different automated devices have been developed to measure water infiltration rates in the field automation strategies have involved the use of many different set ups and sensors including pressure transducers e g ankeny et al 1988 casey and derby 2002 constantz and murphy 1987 di prima 2015 madsen and chandler 2007 prieksat et al 1992 infrared sensor systems milla and kish 2006 micro flow meters moret fernández et al 2012 reflectometry probes moret et al 2004 and load cell sensors klípa et al 2015 zumr et al 2019 among these approaches pressure transducers are widely used for field applications given their simplicity of use and low price these sensors allow the user to monitor water level changes in a mariotte reservoir and in turn to quantify water infiltration rates automation of a mariotte reservoir was firstly proposed by constantz and murphy 1987 these authors used a pressure transducer connected at the top of a mariotte reservoir to monitor the head space tension during the drop of the water level this technique was used by ankeny et al 1988 to automate a tension infiltrometer for infiltration rates measurements under negative suction these authors tested two different set ups the first configuration had a single pressure transducer located at the top of the mariotte reservoir while the second configuration added another pressure transducer at the base of the water column the use of two transducers overcame some of the difficulties generated from the tension fluctuations caused by bubbling this strategy was further improved by casey and derby 2002 who used a differential transducer with two ports to automate an sw 080b tension infiltrometer and madsen and chandler 2007 who automated a mini disk infiltrometer decagon 2014 using pressure transducers selker et al 2009 incorporated pressure transducers and pneumatic reed switches to create a tension infiltrometer with automated near instantaneous control over the tension applied to the water source pressure transducers have also been used to automate single ring infiltrometers prieksat et al 1992 the single ring infiltrometer technique reynolds and elrick 1990 is a widespread method e g braud et al 2017 which has the advantages of speed and simplicity over more cumbersome procedures for performing field saturated soil hydraulic conductivity measurements such as the guelph permeameter and the double ring infiltrometer di prima et al 2019 these infiltrometers maintain a quasi constant head in a containment ring allowing to calculate infiltration rates under ponding conditions angulo jaramillo et al 2016 recently di prima 2015 presented a new automated single ring infiltrometer this device is equipped with a differential transducer to measure the stepwise drop of water level in a mariotte reservoir the data acquisition system consists of low cost components and uses the open source arduino microcontroller platform the potential of this automated infiltrometer to reliably derive saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and sorptivity s was tested by using three existing best algorithms i e best slope lassabatere et al 2006 best intercept yilmaz et al 2010 and best steady bagarello et al 2014 this approach demonstrated that the total volume applied with the prototype version of the infiltrometer 130 mm may not be sufficient to evaluate steady state conditions compromising the reliability of the estimates in some cases e g loamy soil the importance to collect an appropriate number of data points during the transient state was investigated using analytically generated data by increasing the precision of the collected information namely decreasing the cumulative infiltration interval from 5 mm to 2 5 mm in the case of readings every 2 5 mm the number of points used to describe the same curve doubled and generated enough points to accurately model the transient state of infiltration based on these results di prima et al 2016 proposed guidelines for the optimization of the design in terms of capacity of the mariotte reservoir which affects the cumulative amount of infiltration that can be measured and the radius of air entry tube which affects the increment size between two successive measurements these guidelines thus suggest ways to optimize infiltrometers to accurately measure transient and steady state infiltration conditions yet the actual effectiveness of these improvements have not been assessed using experimental data another limitation on the use of the initial prototype is the need to filter raw data recorded by the transducer the transducer readings produce a step shaped or stair like relationship between time and recorded voltage these artifacts tend to be caused by air bubble formation in the mariotte system and the magnitude and rate of change of the resulting steps tend to depend on the infiltrometer set up di prima 2015 and di prima et al 2016 2017 manually processed the data which complicated post processing step and required a tremendous amount of work and time to determine cumulative infiltration curves while previous work has attempted to ease the analysis of infiltration data from automated infiltrometers for instance using the flowdata software developed by ankeny et al 1993 such methods are not able to filter out stair like relationships that are often obtained with the proposed infiltrometer lastly previous studies have shown that the strong spatial variability of hydraulic properties and water infiltration at the field scale may affect measurement of water cumulative infiltration and related estimates for hydraulic parameters e g zimmermann et al 2008 for instance lassabatere et al 2019a developed the concept of the bmr beerkan multi run showing the need for a large dataset of experimental data for a proper representation of the average response and its variability automated infiltrometers may be used to collect simultaneous measurements at multiple locations for relatively long periods of time thus providing accurate data at high spatial and temporal resolutions the use of automated infiltrometers may therefore improve characterization of spatial variability in soil hydraulic characteristics making it important to develop a system that can collect and integrate measurements from multiple units in this investigation we present a new modular instrumentation package based on the original design of di prima 2015 that has been updated to include up to ten automatic infiltrometers for automatic recording of simultaneous infiltration experiments following the guidelines in di prima et al 2016 we improved the design of the devices in terms of reservoir capacity to ensure steady state at the end of the experiment accuracy of the description of the transient phase of the infiltration process and number of infiltrometers that can be simultaneously operated this set of new devices should produce an optimum description of the cumulative infiltration for an optimum hydraulic characterization the main objectives of this paper were to i testing the potential of the instrumentation package to automatically collect data from multiple infiltrometers working simultaneously ii improving the treatment of the raw data recorded by the transducers iii assessing the use of the infiltrometers in conjunction with different methods for estimating the soil parameters from infiltrometer data and iv evaluating instrument performance under specific and challenging field conditions such as highly permeable slightly sorptive and water repellent conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 improved infiltrometer design the main components of the complete system are illustrated in fig 1 each infiltrometer consists of a mariotte bottle with a 94 mm inner diameter and a height of 850 mm with effective water storage height of 740 mm it provides the capacity to hold the volume of water corresponding to a total cumulative infiltration of 280 mm based on a 150 mm infiltration ring diameter this water volume represents 150 mm of additional water available for infiltration compared to the prototype proposed by di prima 2015 an air entry tube is positioned with its lower end at short distance from the reservoir base which controls the air entry in the mariotte bottle and thus the water level inside the ring the air entry tube has a 7 mm inner diameter compared to the 6 5 mm inner diameter used in the original prototype using this larger diameter tube changed the cumulative infiltration interval from 4 5 mm in the original prototype to 2 mm in the updated version see section 3 3 this change was implemented with the goals of increasing the precision of the collected information and allowing the collection of many data points during the first stage of the process the mariotte bottle is closed by a top and a bottom plug fig 1c e and sustained through a tripod fig 1f g made of four interlocking parts 3 legs and 1 circular support the design of the tripod allows the user to easily regulate the distance between the base of the infiltrometer and the infiltration surface with an adjustable range from 2 to 3 mm at the closest setting up to 90 mm at the most distant setting the tripod components were manufactured through an online laser cutting service this type of service is offered by a number of online companies which typically allow users to choose the thickness and the type of material and then upload a file e g eps svg or dxf that specifies the cutting lines an illustration of the cutting lines is provided in fig 1f the plugs can be realized by different 3d printing technologies such as stereolithography sla selective laser sintering sls and multi jet fusion mjf the project files for the realization of the plugs fig 1c and the tripod fig 1f can be downloaded from the website bestsoilhydro net we note that online manufacturer services tend to be cost effective allowing the user to build the system for relatively low cost 2 2 data acquisition system and differential pressure sensor the core of the data acquisition system consists of an arduino mega microcontroller board an arduino wireless shield with an onboard micro sd socket and a lcd module shield 20 columns and 4 rows and a differential pressure transducer the list of components and the arduino code can be downloaded from the website bestsoilhydro net the lcd module requires that a specific library liquidcrystal i2c be installed into the arduino ide this library can be downloaded from the website wiki sunfounder cc the data acquisition system fig 1b is connected to differential pressure sensors fig 1a using 3 m long cables each system simultaneously connects to as many as five infiltrometers the differential pressure sensor box is mounted on the top of the infiltrometer fig 1d the two ends of the transducer are connected using small plastic flexible tubes outer diameter 4 mm to the head space of the reservoir and to an acrylic tube outer diameter 10 mm inner diameter 7 mm height 790 mm descending inside the reservoir this configuration enables measurement of the pressure difference between the head space and the bottom of the column of water the differential pressure transducer used for this application is the piezoresistive differential pressure transducer mpxv5010dp from nxp semiconductors nxp com other companies that provide similar transducers include smi and honeywell this sensor requires a power supply of 5 v and has an integrated temperature compensation and signal amplification circuit the transducer provides a linear voltage output for a differential pressure range from 0 to 1000 mm h2o the data are recorded on a sd card and simultaneously displayed on the lcd display the software generates a new comma separated values csv file every time that the microcontroller is activated the name of the generated file appears on the lcd 2 3 infiltrometer system calibration laboratory calibration of the devices was carried out by visually monitoring the height of the water column inside the mariotte bottle during the complete emptying of the reservoirs each infiltrometer was placed within a 150 mm inner diameter cylinder a quasi constant water head of 5 mm was maintained inside the cylinder visual readings of the water levels were done on a 740 mm long ruler with the zero positioned 10 mm above the bottom end of the tube connected to the pressure side of the differential pressure sensor then a calibration function was created via linear regression between the visual readings of the heights of the water column and the corresponding recorded volts the calibration function for each infiltrometer was used in subsequent experiments to convert recorded transducer outputs into water column heights which were then used to estimate infiltration amounts 2 4 laboratory testing all of the infiltrometers were also tested in the laboratory example shown in fig 2 similar to the calibration procedure the infiltrometer was used to maintain a quasi constant head of water inside a 150 mm inner diameter cylinder that was connected via an outlet pipe to a collection container set on a balance fig 2a the experiments were carried out by recording the transducer output during the complete emptying of the reservoir while weighing the mass of discharged water fig 2a and b in the example of infiltrometer 3 the transducer voltage was constant during intervals where bubbles form in the air entry tube reflecting a constant water level in the reservoir once a bubble reached sufficient size to enter the water column e g at time t 509 s observations in fig 2b and left most red triangle in fig 2c the transducer readings fluctuated and generated easily detectable outliers blue solid circles in fig 2c as already discussed by ankeny et al 1988 the transducer readings then stabilized at a constant value until the subsequent bubbling event e g the transducer output stayed at 2 85 v between t 510 and 517 s as highlighted by di prima 2015 and di prima et al 2016 this typically behavior produces a step shaped relationship between time and recorded voltage fig 2c 2 5 field testing after laboratory calibration and testing we also tested the devices during four experimental campaigns in the field with three sites in france and one in india the first two sites entpe 1 and entpe 2 sites are located in the garden of the école nationale des travaux publics de l état entpe in the municipality of vaulx en velin france the third site doua site is a drainage ditch located at the la doua scientific campus in the municipality of villeurbanne france which receives runoff mainly originating from adjacent parking lots and sidewalks these municipalities belong to the metropolis of lyon in auvergne rhône alpes region in eastern france the three sites are part of the lyon city field observatory for urban water management othu the sampled soils ranged in texture from silt to sand bouarafa et al 2019 the fourth experimental site is a sandy loam soil covered by maize crop that is located at the anand agricultural university in the western indian state of gujarat for each site in france a total of four undisturbed soil cores 50 mm in height and 50 mm in diameter were collected at randomly sampled points and used to determine both the soil bulk density ρ b g cm 3 and the initial volumetric soil water content θ i cm3 cm 3 table 1 we used the infiltrometers to carry out a total of fifteen infiltration experiments with five simultaneous experiments conducted at each french site fig 3 a we used stainless steel rings with an inner diameter of 150 mm inserted shallowly into the soil 10 mm according to the beerkan procedure for single ring infiltration experiments lassabatere et al 2006 following the procedure described in di prima et al 2016 we firstly positioned a plastic film on the soil surface inside each ring and applied a small water head of few millimeters 2 3 mm depending on the surface roughness the plastic film was also used to minimize disturbance on the soil surface while establishing ponding conditions and to have an accurate data acquisition from the beginning of the run the infiltrometers were positioned inside the rings and regulated in height so that the bases were in contact with the ponding water the mariotte bottles were filled with tap water and then activated through lifting the pistons a few seconds before flow began the data acquisition was started by simply switching on the data acquisition system finally the infiltration experiments started when the plastic films were removed a video tutorial showing this procedure can be viewed online di prima 2014 at the entpe 1 site we also used all the automatic infiltrometers connected to two data acquisition systems for automatic recording of ten simultaneous infiltration experiments these experiments were aimed to test the potential of the proposed instrumentation package to capture soil heterogeneity the hypothesis of an improved description of the cumulative infiltration curve was investigated through a comparison with the prototype proposed by di prima 2015 at this aim we made a comparison between 45 curves collected with the prototype during previous field campaigns di prima 2015 di prima et al 2017 2016 and the curves collected with new infiltrometers at the entpe 1 entpe 2 and doua sites at the experimental site in india we conducted a total of six infiltration experiments three runs of the double ring type were carried out using an inner ring of 150 mm diameter and outer ring of 300 mm diameter the automatic infiltrometer was used to maintain constant water depths in the inner rings of 25 mm run 1 50 mm run 2 and 75 mm run 3 while the same water depths were maintained in the outer ring manually by pouring the water during the experiments assuming that water infiltration below the inner ring was one dimensional 1d and that the final steady flow was only gravity driven we estimated the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity based on the steady infiltration rate reynolds et al 2002 the other three runs used single rings with 150 mm inner diameter the infiltrometers were used to maintain constant depths of 25 mm run 4 50 mm run 5 and 75 mm run 6 2 6 treatment of the raw data recorded by the transducers in this investigation we propose three different procedures to treat the raw data recorded by the transducer the first procedure proposed by di prima 2015 and applied by di prima et al 2016 2017 requires the user to manually select values at the end of the constant height stages i e by sampling the transducer readings at time immediately preceding the bubbling the second procedure automatically selects these values through an algorithm coded with the open source software scilab the code can be downloaded from the website bestsoilhydro net because the code may fail in certain cases owing to unpredictable noise in the transducer readings in this investigation we decided to apply both procedures further these two procedures cannot be adopted whenever rapid emptying of the mariotte bottle causes uninterrupted air bubbling which may occur during high infiltration rates di prima et al 2016 following the suggestion by di prima et al 2016 we therefore applied a third procedure that calculated a moving median to identify the underlying trend of transducer output with time in the laboratory the accuracy of these procedures was evaluated through the comparison between recorded and measured cumulative flow data fig 2d in terms of relative error er and root mean squared differences rmsd mm defined as 1 er 100 i 1 n i i exp i i 2 i 1 n i i exp 2 2 rmsd i 1 n i i exp i i 2 n where n is the total number of data pairs i i exp mm are the measured data estimated from the mass of discharged water during laboratory tests and i i mm are the values estimated from the recorded transducer data using the calibration functions also the recorded total cumulative flow i tot mm were compared with the corresponding measured data i tot exp mm using the relative error er i tot defined as follows 3 e r i tot 100 i tot i tot exp i tot exp the three procedures presented above to treat the transducer output i e manual selection automatic selection and moving median were subsequently applied to determine the cumulative infiltration curves in addition we also considered a fourth procedure described below according to angulo jaramillo et al 2016 an expected advantage of the use of the automatic infiltrometers is better accuracy during the transient flow state in this paper we investigated this hypothesis by processing the raw data in order to obtain beerkan like data i e cumulative infiltration curves having the same increments 8 5 mm as manually pouring water volumes into the containment ring more specifically the curves obtained by manually sampling the transducer readings were further processed and polynomial regression functions were applied to cumulative data to model the discretized infiltration measurements 2 7 estimating hydrodynamic parameters from field experiments all the cumulative infiltration curves from the four different procedures were subsequently inverted by three different approaches to estimate the soil sorptivity s mm h 0 5 and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks mm h 1 the three approaches represented different algorithms within the beerkan estimation of the soil transfer parameters best solution introduced by lassabatere et al 2006 yilmaz et al 2010 and bagarello et al 2014 and differed from one another in the manner by which they fit the experimental cumulative infiltration to the approximate expansion for transient and steady states defined by haverkamp et al 1994 and to derive s and ks more specifically best slope lassabatere et al 2006 uses the slope of the straight line defined by the last points representative of the steady state to constrain s and ks before fitting the transient model to the experimental data by the optimization of s best intercept yilmaz et al 2010 uses the intercept of the steady state model to constrains s and ks priori fitting the experimental data lastly best steady bagarello et al 2014 uses both the slope and the intercept to resolve a set of two equations di prima et al 2016 leading to the estimation of the two unknowns s and ks more information on best can be found in angulo jaramillo et al 2019 ks values were also estimated using approach 4 in stewart and abou najm 2018 in which the macroscopic capillary length λ was assumed to have a constant value of λ 150 mm following the recommendation of stewart and abou najm 2018 note that this approach does not require additional information e g particle size distribution initial and final soil water content and dry soil bulk density to estimate ks from infiltration runs therefore it is particularly useful when a large number of locations needs to be sampled particularly when time and financial resources are limited di prima et al 2019 at the indian site ks values were estimated using approach 4 as this method is also usable for both quasi zero i e the french sites and positive values indian site of ponded depth on the infiltration surface 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and laboratory testing each infiltrometer had a unique calibration function between the visual readings of the water column heights and the corresponding voltage recorded during the emptying of the mariotte bottle table 2 all transducers provided a nearly linear relationship between the voltage output and the heights of the water columns as an example r 2 1 0 for the calibration relationship collected using infiltrometer 3 fig 4 table 2 they also had nearly identical values of the calibration multiplier ranging from 4 32 10 3 and 4 36 10 3 v mm h2o while as also noted by ankeny 1992 the intercept yielded more variable values ranging from 0 328 and 0 390 mm nonetheless while the calculation of the water levels is affected by the intercept value the calculation of the water volume change between readings is independent from this parameter casey and derby 2002 however the intercept value is still useful to exclude the water levels measured below the zero of the rule from the calculation of the water volumes as the internal geometry of the mariotte bottles changes below this level fig 2a in the laboratory the accuracy of the three procedures to treat the transducer output i e manual selection automatic selection and moving median was evaluated through a comparison between recorded and measured cumulative flow data all procedures yielded small errors table 3 suggesting that the ten infiltrometers had good accuracy when measuring water flow more specifically the three procedures yielded rmsd ranging between 0 41 and 3 06 mm er between 0 28 and 2 06 and er i tot between 0 06 and 1 76 the three procedures did not yield significantly different errors table 3 and fig 5 this result suggests that adopting a simplified procedure to treat the transducer output such as a moving median does not negatively affect determination of flow data in addition the laboratory experiments with a quasi constant head of water maintained inside a cylinder allowed us to test the infiltrometers with a similar set up to that one used on the field thus increasing our confidence in the field measurements 3 2 field testing 3 2 1 optimum case and peculiarities cumulative infiltration into an unsaturated porous medium typically exhibits a concave shape as a function of time due to a decreasing hydraulic gradient as the wetting front moves away from the source and the influence of capillarity decreases xu et al 2012 as flow rates approach steady state cumulative infiltration becomes approximately linear with time angulo jaramillo et al 2016 an example of this behavior is depicted in fig 6 a e in this example the measured infiltration rates showed the typical stepwise drop in water level within the reservoir yielding the same kind of stair like output fig 6a as the one reported for the laboratory experiments fig 2c all three procedures used to treat the transducer output i e manual selection automatic selection and moving median were successfully applied to these data fig 6c and e and yielded similar cumulative infiltration curves as one another fig 6b besides all combinations of treatment procedure and best algorithms gave similar results for this example this result suggests that in case of stair like output using the automatic procedure to treat the raw data is preferable given that it avoids the tremendous amount of work and time required when manually processing the data the success of this example case above did not translate to all infiltration tests certain combinations of data treatment procedures and soil characterization algorithms failed to successfully characterize soil properties yielding success rates as low as 40 for the manual selection method combined with best slope table 4 fig 7 a further for each site and treatment procedure the four methods i e best slope best intercept best steady and approach 4 provided different success rates table 4 these differences then carried over to the overall distributions for ks fig 7b and s fig 7c thus as demonstrated by these results different assumptions and analysis structures inherent to the four methods and three alternative procedures used to treat the transducer output i e manual selection automatic selection and moving median makes each combination sensitive to different kinds of non ideal conditions below we discuss different types of obstacles that may commonly hinder infiltration measurements in the field including i linearity in cumulative infiltration curves owing to gravity driven flow ii imprecise description of the transient state of infiltration and iii occurrence of soil water repellency we also discuss related advantages provided by automatic infiltrometers when dealing with these issues 3 2 2 high flow rate experiments for six out of fifteen experiments the infiltration processes were entirely dominated by the influence of preferential flow paths with infiltration rates ranging between 1529 8 and 5215 1 mm h 1 as estimated by the moving median approach in such circumstances we distinguished two different scenarios depending on the rapidity of the process in three cases first scenario one at the entpe 1 site and two at the doua site we measured infiltration rates equal or lower than 3159 3 mm h 1 table 4 still the rapid infiltration process and the high measured infiltration rates did not cause uninterrupted bubbling within the mariotte bottle therefore the emptying process was characterized by the typical stepwise drop of water level in the reservoirs yielding the same kind of stair like output reported previously figs 2c and 6a and all the three procedures to treat the transducer output were successful applied however the influence of preferential flow paths on the infiltration processes made it impossible to evaluate any effect of the capillary flow obviously in such condition the use of transient models to fit infiltration data was inappropriate and best slope and best intercept failed to provide s and ks values lassabatere et al 2019b three other experiments at the doua sites yielded even higher infiltration rates ranging from 3496 3 and 5215 1 mm h 1 second scenario under these conditions the manual and automatic procedures to treat the raw data could not be applied owing to the rapid emptying of the mariotte bottle causing an uninterrupted air bubbling that spoiled the transducer readings fig 6h and i also discussed in di prima et al 2016 on the contrary the application of a moving median successfully revealed the underlying trend of the transducer output with time fig 6f and j thus allowing cumulative infiltration to be determined fig 6g it also should be noted that when the infiltration process was mainly driven by gravity and cumulative infiltration curves were near linear lassabatere et al 2019b best slope and best intercept failed to provide s and ks estimates while best steady was successfully applied indeed according to bagarello et al 2014 best steady does not require data from the transient stage of the run but rather relies solely on the regression analysis of the final few cumulative infiltration depths this particular algorithm avoided the uncertainties due to the linearity of the cumulative infiltration which can obscure the distinction between the early and late time infiltration processes di prima et al 2018 3 2 3 improved description of the transient phase the hypothesis of a better description of the transient phase when using the automatic infiltrometers was investigated through a comparison between the cumulative infiltration curves obtained from transducer output and discretized curves having the same increments as manually pouring water volumes into the containment ring in the reported example fig 8 the infiltration reached steady state early i e within the first 0 03 h and only one discretized data point occurred within the transient flow regime as a consequence the transient infiltration models in best slope and best intercept could not be fitted to the discretized data conversely the high resolution cumulative infiltration curve obtained from the transducer output captured 14 points during the transient state allowing for the best slope fig 8c and best intercept algorithms to be fitted in some cases too few points could be identified for the description of the transient state such a problem occurred at the entpe 1 site likely due to the high local initial soil water content there table 1 in addition to this example best slope also failed in two cases at the entpe 2 site whereas best intercept was successfully applied consequently the former method had the lowest success rate fig 7 this shortcoming was already investigated in several investigations e g castellini et al 2018 di prima et al 2018 more specifically when the early and late time infiltration stages greatly differ in terms of infiltration rates the strong concavity of cumulative infiltration results in an over estimation of soil sorptivity such overestimations result in negative values for ks as already suggested by yilmaz et al 2010 3 2 4 water repellent soils the first obvious advantage in using automatic infiltrometer in case of water repellent soils is that data collection is automated and it does not require any further manipulation by the user once the device is installed therefore tests can be successfully and simultaneously performed even if water repellency impedes infiltration and causes long testing durations alagna et al 2018 in addition the automatic infiltrometer used in this investigation was capable of maintaining a small water head on the soil surface which helps to prevent excessive positive pressure from overcoming the soil water repellency nyman et al 2010 for one experiment at the entpe 1 site this experimental approach was useful to signal the occurrence of soil water repellency as identified by cumulative infiltration having a convex curve shape di prima et al 2017 the cumulative infiltration data in that instance yielded a negative value for the intercept of the regression line fitted to the data points describing steady state conditions e g alagna et al 2018 di prima et al 2019 2017 lozano baez et al 2018 this circumstance led to the failure of all the best algorithms lassabatere et al 2019a only approach 4 provided an estimate of ks more specifically best slope and best intercept failed because both algorithms required fitting transient models to early infiltration data that must be concave instead of convex as determined by soil water repellency the best steady algorithm avoids most problems associated with the use of the transient infiltration data yet still estimates meaningless ks data in case of negative intercept values on the other hand approach 4 by stewart and abou najm 2018 differs by the term expressing steady state condition considering exclusively the final infiltration rate i e the slope of regression line fitted to the last data points of the cumulative infiltration the exclusive use of this term allowed to consider only the final stage of the infiltration process i e when the water repellency had diminished or no effect on infiltration therefore we suggest to use steady state methods such as approach 4 in case of water repellent soils angulo jaramillo et al 2019 this example also illustrates that when the physics of infiltration change as in the case of water infiltration into water repellent soils all the best methods are questionable bauters et al 2003 3 3 comparison with the prototype we also compared the cumulative infiltrations curves collected using the new infiltrometers with those measured by the prototype proposed by di prima 2015 on different soils analyzed during previous field campaigns di prima 2015 di prima et al 2017 2016 fig 9 depicts a comparison between 45 curves collected with the prototype fig 9a versus the curves collected with new infiltrometers at the entpe 1 entpe 2 and doua sites fig 9b the mean value of the cumulative infiltration intervals δi decreased from 4 65 mm with the original prototype to 2 15 mm with the new version fig 9c therefore the new infiltrometers had more than twice the resolution i e shorter increments between readings of the prototype returning the example shown in fig 8 the updated version of the automated infiltrometer provided 14 measurements during the transient regime fig 8c whereas the prototype would only have the capability to capture 3 4 points accurately modeling the transient state requires a minimum of five measurements angulo jaramillo et al 2019 meaning that the prototype system would be inadequate in that scenario at the same time the new devices were able to collect measurements for longer durations and greater cumulative infiltration amounts due to their larger storage capacity thus compared to the prototype system the new version of the infiltrometer can generate more data points during both transient and steady state flow regimes 3 4 application of the proposed device to double ring measures an automatic infiltrometer constructed at the anand agricultural university was used to run both of the single and double ring infiltration experiments ks values ranged between 15 0 and 105 8 mm h 1 table 5 the different experimental set ups including multiple imposed water depths 25 50 and 75 mm showed the versatility of the device to execute experiments with multiple positive water heads such as the one requested for the two or multiple ponding depth approaches reynolds and elrick 2002a for the double ring experiments the use of the infiltrometer to maintain the water level in the inner ring improved monitoring of the infiltration process while reducing the amount of effort needed to maintain a constant depth of water in both rings lai and ren 2007 the main advantage of using the automated infiltrometer in this scenario was its simplicity in that it allowed a single operator to carry out the field experiments in addition the limited cost of the device means that it can contribute to more widespread applications of accurate and automated infiltration rates measurements even when combined with cumbersome experiments such as the double ring infiltrometer 3 5 on the advantage of multiple infiltration experiments the ability of the proposed instrumentation package to automatically collect data from up to ten infiltrometers working simultaneously i e when using ten infiltrometers connected to two data acquisition systems was tested at the entpe 1 site fig 10 such a protocol had many advantages indeed ten replicates enabled the identification of specific runs revealing either the effect of preferential flow e g fig 10b run n 10 or on the contrary the impedance of flux owing to water repellency e g fig 10b runs n 4 and 8 in addition ten replicates should be appropriate to obtain representative mean values of soil hydrodynamic parameters at the field scale reynolds and elrick 2002b verbist et al 2010 this protocol can help to overcome uncertainties in the hydraulic characterization of highly heterogeneous soils the new instrumentation package may constitute a valuable tool for the application of the beerkan multi runs procedure proposed by lassabatere et al 2019a which consists in carrying out ten beerkan infiltration experiments along a transect the use of the automatic infiltrometers in this protocol may both provide sufficient water supply to reach steady state and provide measurement resolution needed to improve the description of the transient state these advances allow the user to obtain more accurate estimates of soil hydraulic parameters while also reducing the amount of effort needed to run multiple experiments 4 summary and conclusions in this investigation we designed and manufactured a set of ten devices that automatically provide water at a constant head and record the resulting infiltration rates the design of the devices was improved over a previously presented prototype in terms of reservoir capacity which controls the duration of the test diameter of the air entry tube which controls the measurement resolution and corresponding accuracy of infiltration measurements and number of infiltrometers that can be simultaneously operated here up to ten at one time we also proposed a new algorithm for the automatic processing of the transducer readings which substantially reduced the amount of work necessary to analyze the raw data we encourage the readers to check the website bestsoilhydro net for the latest updates and also to download arduino sketches electronic schemes codes for data treatment lists of components models for 3d printing and laser cutting projects the devices were firstly tested in the laboratory and then on four different experimental sites under specific and challenging field conditions such as highly permeable slightly sorptive and water repellent conditions the field campaigns highlighted the ease of use of the devices when performing either single ring or double ring infiltration experiments the new instrumentation package provided in this study allows the user to intensively measure soil infiltration rates with the capability of automatically recording multiple experiments automated measurements also facilitate better detection

5793,we present a new open source and modular instrumentation package composed of up to ten automatic infiltrometers connected to data acquisition systems for automatic recording of multiple infiltration experiments the infiltrometers are equipped with differential transducers to monitor water level changes in a mariotte reservoir and in turn to quantify water infiltration rates the data acquisition systems consist of low cost components and operate on the open source microcontroller platform arduino the devices were tested both in the laboratory and on different urban and agricultural soils in france and india more specifically we tested three procedures to treat the transducers readings including a filtering algorithm that substantially improved the ability to determine cumulative infiltration from raw data we combined these three procedures with four methods for estimating the soil parameters from infiltrometer data showing pros and cons of each scenario we also demonstrated advantages in using the automatic infiltrometers when infiltration measurements were hindered by i linearity in cumulative infiltration curves owing to gravity driven flow ii an imprecise description of the transient state of infiltration and iii the occurrence of soil water repellency the use of the automatic infiltrometers allows the user to obtain more accurate estimates of soil hydraulic parameters while also reducing the amount of effort needed to run multiple experiments keywords automatic infiltrometer infiltration rate measurements soil hydraulic properties

kish 2006 micro flow meters moret fernández et al 2012 reflectometry probes moret et al 2004 and load cell sensors klípa et al 2015 zumr et al 2019 among these approaches pressure transducers are widely used for field applications given their simplicity of use and low price these sensors allow the user to monitor water level changes in a mariotte reservoir and in turn to quantify water infiltration rates automation of a mariotte reservoir was firstly proposed by constantz and murphy 1987 these authors used a pressure transducer connected at the top of a mariotte reservoir to monitor the head space tension during the drop of the water level this technique was used by ankeny et al 1988 to automate a tension infiltrometer for infiltration rates measurements under negative suction these authors tested two different set ups the first configuration had a single pressure transducer located at the top of the mariotte reservoir while the second configuration added another pressure transducer at the base of the water column the use of two transducers overcame some of the difficulties generated from the tension fluctuations caused by bubbling this strategy was further improved by casey and derby 2002 who used a differential transducer with two ports to automate an sw 080b tension infiltrometer and madsen and chandler 2007 who automated a mini disk infiltrometer decagon 2014 using pressure transducers selker et al 2009 incorporated pressure transducers and pneumatic reed switches to create a tension infiltrometer with automated near instantaneous control over the tension applied to the water source pressure transducers have also been used to automate single ring infiltrometers prieksat et al 1992 the single ring infiltrometer technique reynolds and elrick 1990 is a widespread method e g braud et al 2017 which has the advantages of speed and simplicity over more cumbersome procedures for performing field saturated soil hydraulic conductivity measurements such as the guelph permeameter and the double ring infiltrometer di prima et al 2019 these infiltrometers maintain a quasi constant head in a containment ring allowing to calculate infiltration rates under ponding conditions angulo jaramillo et al 2016 recently di prima 2015 presented a new automated single ring infiltrometer this device is equipped with a differential transducer to measure the stepwise drop of water level in a mariotte reservoir the data acquisition system consists of low cost components and uses the open source arduino microcontroller platform the potential of this automated infiltrometer to reliably derive saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and sorptivity s was tested by using three existing best algorithms i e best slope lassabatere et al 2006 best intercept yilmaz et al 2010 and best steady bagarello et al 2014 this approach demonstrated that the total volume applied with the prototype version of the infiltrometer 130 mm may not be sufficient to evaluate steady state conditions compromising the reliability of the estimates in some cases e g loamy soil the importance to collect an appropriate number of data points during the transient state was investigated using analytically generated data by increasing the precision of the collected information namely decreasing the cumulative infiltration interval from 5 mm to 2 5 mm in the case of readings every 2 5 mm the number of points used to describe the same curve doubled and generated enough points to accurately model the transient state of infiltration based on these results di prima et al 2016 proposed guidelines for the optimization of the design in terms of capacity of the mariotte reservoir which affects the cumulative amount of infiltration that can be measured and the radius of air entry tube which affects the increment size between two successive measurements these guidelines thus suggest ways to optimize infiltrometers to accurately measure transient and steady state infiltration conditions yet the actual effectiveness of these improvements have not been assessed using experimental data another limitation on the use of the initial prototype is the need to filter raw data recorded by the transducer the transducer readings produce a step shaped or stair like relationship between time and recorded voltage these artifacts tend to be caused by air bubble formation in the mariotte system and the magnitude and rate of change of the resulting steps tend to depend on the infiltrometer set up di prima 2015 and di prima et al 2016 2017 manually processed the data which complicated post processing step and required a tremendous amount of work and time to determine cumulative infiltration curves while previous work has attempted to ease the analysis of infiltration data from automated infiltrometers for instance using the flowdata software developed by ankeny et al 1993 such methods are not able to filter out stair like relationships that are often obtained with the proposed infiltrometer lastly previous studies have shown that the strong spatial variability of hydraulic properties and water infiltration at the field scale may affect measurement of water cumulative infiltration and related estimates for hydraulic parameters e g zimmermann et al 2008 for instance lassabatere et al 2019a developed the concept of the bmr beerkan multi run showing the need for a large dataset of experimental data for a proper representation of the average response and its variability automated infiltrometers may be used to collect simultaneous measurements at multiple locations for relatively long periods of time thus providing accurate data at high spatial and temporal resolutions the use of automated infiltrometers may therefore improve characterization of spatial variability in soil hydraulic characteristics making it important to develop a system that can collect and integrate measurements from multiple units in this investigation we present a new modular instrumentation package based on the original design of di prima 2015 that has been updated to include up to ten automatic infiltrometers for automatic recording of simultaneous infiltration experiments following the guidelines in di prima et al 2016 we improved the design of the devices in terms of reservoir capacity to ensure steady state at the end of the experiment accuracy of the description of the transient phase of the infiltration process and number of infiltrometers that can be simultaneously operated this set of new devices should produce an optimum description of the cumulative infiltration for an optimum hydraulic characterization the main objectives of this paper were to i testing the potential of the instrumentation package to automatically collect data from multiple infiltrometers working simultaneously ii improving the treatment of the raw data recorded by the transducers iii assessing the use of the infiltrometers in conjunction with different methods for estimating the soil parameters from infiltrometer data and iv evaluating instrument performance under specific and challenging field conditions such as highly permeable slightly sorptive and water repellent conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 improved infiltrometer design the main components of the complete system are illustrated in fig 1 each infiltrometer consists of a mariotte bottle with a 94 mm inner diameter and a height of 850 mm with effective water storage height of 740 mm it provides the capacity to hold the volume of water corresponding to a total cumulative infiltration of 280 mm based on a 150 mm infiltration ring diameter this water volume represents 150 mm of additional water available for infiltration compared to the prototype proposed by di prima 2015 an air entry tube is positioned with its lower end at short distance from the reservoir base which controls the air entry in the mariotte bottle and thus the water level inside the ring the air entry tube has a 7 mm inner diameter compared to the 6 5 mm inner diameter used in the original prototype using this larger diameter tube changed the cumulative infiltration interval from 4 5 mm in the original prototype to 2 mm in the updated version see section 3 3 this change was implemented with the goals of increasing the precision of the collected information and allowing the collection of many data points during the first stage of the process the mariotte bottle is closed by a top and a bottom plug fig 1c e and sustained through a tripod fig 1f g made of four interlocking parts 3 legs and 1 circular support the design of the tripod allows the user to easily regulate the distance between the base of the infiltrometer and the infiltration surface with an adjustable range from 2 to 3 mm at the closest setting up to 90 mm at the most distant setting the tripod components were manufactured through an online laser cutting service this type of service is offered by a number of online companies which typically allow users to choose the thickness and the type of material and then upload a file e g eps svg or dxf that specifies the cutting lines an illustration of the cutting lines is provided in fig 1f the plugs can be realized by different 3d printing technologies such as stereolithography sla selective laser sintering sls and multi jet fusion mjf the project files for the realization of the plugs fig 1c and the tripod fig 1f can be downloaded from the website bestsoilhydro net we note that online manufacturer services tend to be cost effective allowing the user to build the system for relatively low cost 2 2 data acquisition system and differential pressure sensor the core of the data acquisition system consists of an arduino mega microcontroller board an arduino wireless shield with an onboard micro sd socket and a lcd module shield 20 columns and 4 rows and a differential pressure transducer the list of components and the arduino code can be downloaded from the website bestsoilhydro net the lcd module requires that a specific library liquidcrystal i2c be installed into the arduino ide this library can be downloaded from the website wiki sunfounder cc the data acquisition system fig 1b is connected to differential pressure sensors fig 1a using 3 m long cables each system simultaneously connects to as many as five infiltrometers the differential pressure sensor box is mounted on the top of the infiltrometer fig 1d the two ends of the transducer are connected using small plastic flexible tubes outer diameter 4 mm to the head space of the reservoir and to an acrylic tube outer diameter 10 mm inner diameter 7 mm height 790 mm descending inside the reservoir this configuration enables measurement of the pressure difference between the head space and the bottom of the column of water the differential pressure transducer used for this application is the piezoresistive differential pressure transducer mpxv5010dp from nxp semiconductors nxp com other companies that provide similar transducers include smi and honeywell this sensor requires a power supply of 5 v and has an integrated temperature compensation and signal amplification circuit the transducer provides a linear voltage output for a differential pressure range from 0 to 1000 mm h2o the data are recorded on a sd card and simultaneously displayed on the lcd display the software generates a new comma separated values csv file every time that the microcontroller is activated the name of the generated file appears on the lcd 2 3 infiltrometer system calibration laboratory calibration of the devices was carried out by visually monitoring the height of the water column inside the mariotte bottle during the complete emptying of the reservoirs each infiltrometer was placed within a 150 mm inner diameter cylinder a quasi constant water head of 5 mm was maintained inside the cylinder visual readings of the water levels were done on a 740 mm long ruler with the zero positioned 10 mm above the bottom end of the tube connected to the pressure side of the differential pressure sensor then a calibration function was created via linear regression between the visual readings of the heights of the water column and the corresponding recorded volts the calibration function for each infiltrometer was used in subsequent experiments to convert recorded transducer outputs into water column heights which were then used to estimate infiltration amounts 2 4 laboratory testing all of the infiltrometers were also tested in the laboratory example shown in fig 2 similar to the calibration procedure the infiltrometer was used to maintain a quasi constant head of water inside a 150 mm inner diameter cylinder that was connected via an outlet pipe to a collection container set on a balance fig 2a the experiments were carried out by recording the transducer output during the complete emptying of the reservoir while weighing the mass of discharged water fig 2a and b in the example of infiltrometer 3 the transducer voltage was constant during intervals where bubbles form in the air entry tube reflecting a constant water level in the reservoir once a bubble reached sufficient size to enter the water column e g at time t 509 s observations in fig 2b and left most red triangle in fig 2c the transducer readings fluctuated and generated easily detectable outliers blue solid circles in fig 2c as already discussed by ankeny et al 1988 the transducer readings then stabilized at a constant value until the subsequent bubbling event e g the transducer output stayed at 2 85 v between t 510 and 517 s as highlighted by di prima 2015 and di prima et al 2016 this typically behavior produces a step shaped relationship between time and recorded voltage fig 2c 2 5 field testing after laboratory calibration and testing we also tested the devices during four experimental campaigns in the field with three sites in france and one in india the first two sites entpe 1 and entpe 2 sites are located in the garden of the école nationale des travaux publics de l état entpe in the municipality of vaulx en velin france the third site doua site is a drainage ditch located at the la doua scientific campus in the municipality of villeurbanne france which receives runoff mainly originating from adjacent parking lots and sidewalks these municipalities belong to the metropolis of lyon in auvergne rhône alpes region in eastern france the three sites are part of the lyon city field observatory for urban water management othu the sampled soils ranged in texture from silt to sand bouarafa et al 2019 the fourth experimental site is a sandy loam soil covered by maize crop that is located at the anand agricultural university in the western indian state of gujarat for each site in france a total of four undisturbed soil cores 50 mm in height and 50 mm in diameter were collected at randomly sampled points and used to determine both the soil bulk density ρ b g cm 3 and the initial volumetric soil water content θ i cm3 cm 3 table 1 we used the infiltrometers to carry out a total of fifteen infiltration experiments with five simultaneous experiments conducted at each french site fig 3 a we used stainless steel rings with an inner diameter of 150 mm inserted shallowly into the soil 10 mm according to the beerkan procedure for single ring infiltration experiments lassabatere et al 2006 following the procedure described in di prima et al 2016 we firstly positioned a plastic film on the soil surface inside each ring and applied a small water head of few millimeters 2 3 mm depending on the surface roughness the plastic film was also used to minimize disturbance on the soil surface while establishing ponding conditions and to have an accurate data acquisition from the beginning of the run the infiltrometers were positioned inside the rings and regulated in height so that the bases were in contact with the ponding water the mariotte bottles were filled with tap water and then activated through lifting the pistons a few seconds before flow began the data acquisition was started by simply switching on the data acquisition system finally the infiltration experiments started when the plastic films were removed a video tutorial showing this procedure can be viewed online di prima 2014 at the entpe 1 site we also used all the automatic infiltrometers connected to two data acquisition systems for automatic recording of ten simultaneous infiltration experiments these experiments were aimed to test the potential of the proposed instrumentation package to capture soil heterogeneity the hypothesis of an improved description of the cumulative infiltration curve was investigated through a comparison with the prototype proposed by di prima 2015 at this aim we made a comparison between 45 curves collected with the prototype during previous field campaigns di prima 2015 di prima et al 2017 2016 and the curves collected with new infiltrometers at the entpe 1 entpe 2 and doua sites at the experimental site in india we conducted a total of six infiltration experiments three runs of the double ring type were carried out using an inner ring of 150 mm diameter and outer ring of 300 mm diameter the automatic infiltrometer was used to maintain constant water depths in the inner rings of 25 mm run 1 50 mm run 2 and 75 mm run 3 while the same water depths were maintained in the outer ring manually by pouring the water during the experiments assuming that water infiltration below the inner ring was one dimensional 1d and that the final steady flow was only gravity driven we estimated the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity based on the steady infiltration rate reynolds et al 2002 the other three runs used single rings with 150 mm inner diameter the infiltrometers were used to maintain constant depths of 25 mm run 4 50 mm run 5 and 75 mm run 6 2 6 treatment of the raw data recorded by the transducers in this investigation we propose three different procedures to treat the raw data recorded by the transducer the first procedure proposed by di prima 2015 and applied by di prima et al 2016 2017 requires the user to manually select values at the end of the constant height stages i e by sampling the transducer readings at time immediately preceding the bubbling the second procedure automatically selects these values through an algorithm coded with the open source software scilab the code can be downloaded from the website bestsoilhydro net because the code may fail in certain cases owing to unpredictable noise in the transducer readings in this investigation we decided to apply both procedures further these two procedures cannot be adopted whenever rapid emptying of the mariotte bottle causes uninterrupted air bubbling which may occur during high infiltration rates di prima et al 2016 following the suggestion by di prima et al 2016 we therefore applied a third procedure that calculated a moving median to identify the underlying trend of transducer output with time in the laboratory the accuracy of these procedures was evaluated through the comparison between recorded and measured cumulative flow data fig 2d in terms of relative error er and root mean squared differences rmsd mm defined as 1 er 100 i 1 n i i exp i i 2 i 1 n i i exp 2 2 rmsd i 1 n i i exp i i 2 n where n is the total number of data pairs i i exp mm are the measured data estimated from the mass of discharged water during laboratory tests and i i mm are the values estimated from the recorded transducer data using the calibration functions also the recorded total cumulative flow i tot mm were compared with the corresponding measured data i tot exp mm using the relative error er i tot defined as follows 3 e r i tot 100 i tot i tot exp i tot exp the three procedures presented above to treat the transducer output i e manual selection automatic selection and moving median were subsequently applied to determine the cumulative infiltration curves in addition we also considered a fourth procedure described below according to angulo jaramillo et al 2016 an expected advantage of the use of the automatic infiltrometers is better accuracy during the transient flow state in this paper we investigated this hypothesis by processing the raw data in order to obtain beerkan like data i e cumulative infiltration curves having the same increments 8 5 mm as manually pouring water volumes into the containment ring more specifically the curves obtained by manually sampling the transducer readings were further processed and polynomial regression functions were applied to cumulative data to model the discretized infiltration measurements 2 7 estimating hydrodynamic parameters from field experiments all the cumulative infiltration curves from the four different procedures were subsequently inverted by three different approaches to estimate the soil sorptivity s mm h 0 5 and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks mm h 1 the three approaches represented different algorithms within the beerkan estimation of the soil transfer parameters best solution introduced by lassabatere et al 2006 yilmaz et al 2010 and bagarello et al 2014 and differed from one another in the manner by which they fit the experimental cumulative infiltration to the approximate expansion for transient and steady states defined by haverkamp et al 1994 and to derive s and ks more specifically best slope lassabatere et al 2006 uses the slope of the straight line defined by the last points representative of the steady state to constrain s and ks before fitting the transient model to the experimental data by the optimization of s best intercept yilmaz et al 2010 uses the intercept of the steady state model to constrains s and ks priori fitting the experimental data lastly best steady bagarello et al 2014 uses both the slope and the intercept to resolve a set of two equations di prima et al 2016 leading to the estimation of the two unknowns s and ks more information on best can be found in angulo jaramillo et al 2019 ks values were also estimated using approach 4 in stewart and abou najm 2018 in which the macroscopic capillary length λ was assumed to have a constant value of λ 150 mm following the recommendation of stewart and abou najm 2018 note that this approach does not require additional information e g particle size distribution initial and final soil water content and dry soil bulk density to estimate ks from infiltration runs therefore it is particularly useful when a large number of locations needs to be sampled particularly when time and financial resources are limited di prima et al 2019 at the indian site ks values were estimated using approach 4 as this method is also usable for both quasi zero i e the french sites and positive values indian site of ponded depth on the infiltration surface 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and laboratory testing each infiltrometer had a unique calibration function between the visual readings of the water column heights and the corresponding voltage recorded during the emptying of the mariotte bottle table 2 all transducers provided a nearly linear relationship between the voltage output and the heights of the water columns as an example r 2 1 0 for the calibration relationship collected using infiltrometer 3 fig 4 table 2 they also had nearly identical values of the calibration multiplier ranging from 4 32 10 3 and 4 36 10 3 v mm h2o while as also noted by ankeny 1992 the intercept yielded more variable values ranging from 0 328 and 0 390 mm nonetheless while the calculation of the water levels is affected by the intercept value the calculation of the water volume change between readings is independent from this parameter casey and derby 2002 however the intercept value is still useful to exclude the water levels measured below the zero of the rule from the calculation of the water volumes as the internal geometry of the mariotte bottles changes below this level fig 2a in the laboratory the accuracy of the three procedures to treat the transducer output i e manual selection automatic selection and moving median was evaluated through a comparison between recorded and measured cumulative flow data all procedures yielded small errors table 3 suggesting that the ten infiltrometers had good accuracy when measuring water flow more specifically the three procedures yielded rmsd ranging between 0 41 and 3 06 mm er between 0 28 and 2 06 and er i tot between 0 06 and 1 76 the three procedures did not yield significantly different errors table 3 and fig 5 this result suggests that adopting a simplified procedure to treat the transducer output such as a moving median does not negatively affect determination of flow data in addition the laboratory experiments with a quasi constant head of water maintained inside a cylinder allowed us to test the infiltrometers with a similar set up to that one used on the field thus increasing our confidence in the field measurements 3 2 field testing 3 2 1 optimum case and peculiarities cumulative infiltration into an unsaturated porous medium typically exhibits a concave shape as a function of time due to a decreasing hydraulic gradient as the wetting front moves away from the source and the influence of capillarity decreases xu et al 2012 as flow rates approach steady state cumulative infiltration becomes approximately linear with time angulo jaramillo et al 2016 an example of this behavior is depicted in fig 6 a e in this example the measured infiltration rates showed the typical stepwise drop in water level within the reservoir yielding the same kind of stair like output fig 6a as the one reported for the laboratory experiments fig 2c all three procedures used to treat the transducer output i e manual selection automatic selection and moving median were successfully applied to these data fig 6c and e and yielded similar cumulative infiltration curves as one another fig 6b besides all combinations of treatment procedure and best algorithms gave similar results for this example this result suggests that in case of stair like output using the automatic procedure to treat the raw data is preferable given that it avoids the tremendous amount of work and time required when manually processing the data the success of this example case above did not translate to all infiltration tests certain combinations of data treatment procedures and soil characterization algorithms failed to successfully characterize soil properties yielding success rates as low as 40 for the manual selection method combined with best slope table 4 fig 7 a further for each site and treatment procedure the four methods i e best slope best intercept best steady and approach 4 provided different success rates table 4 these differences then carried over to the overall distributions for ks fig 7b and s fig 7c thus as demonstrated by these results different assumptions and analysis structures inherent to the four methods and three alternative procedures used to treat the transducer output i e manual selection automatic selection and moving median makes each combination sensitive to different kinds of non ideal conditions below we discuss different types of obstacles that may commonly hinder infiltration measurements in the field including i linearity in cumulative infiltration curves owing to gravity driven flow ii imprecise description of the transient state of infiltration and iii occurrence of soil water repellency we also discuss related advantages provided by automatic infiltrometers when dealing with these issues 3 2 2 high flow rate experiments for six out of fifteen experiments the infiltration processes were entirely dominated by the influence of preferential flow paths with infiltration rates ranging between 1529 8 and 5215 1 mm h 1 as estimated by the moving median approach in such circumstances we distinguished two different scenarios depending on the rapidity of the process in three cases first scenario one at the entpe 1 site and two at the doua site we measured infiltration rates equal or lower than 3159 3 mm h 1 table 4 still the rapid infiltration process and the high measured infiltration rates did not cause uninterrupted bubbling within the mariotte bottle therefore the emptying process was characterized by the typical stepwise drop of water level in the reservoirs yielding the same kind of stair like output reported previously figs 2c and 6a and all the three procedures to treat the transducer output were successful applied however the influence of preferential flow paths on the infiltration processes made it impossible to evaluate any effect of the capillary flow obviously in such condition the use of transient models to fit infiltration data was inappropriate and best slope and best intercept failed to provide s and ks values lassabatere et al 2019b three other experiments at the doua sites yielded even higher infiltration rates ranging from 3496 3 and 5215 1 mm h 1 second scenario under these conditions the manual and automatic procedures to treat the raw data could not be applied owing to the rapid emptying of the mariotte bottle causing an uninterrupted air bubbling that spoiled the transducer readings fig 6h and i also discussed in di prima et al 2016 on the contrary the application of a moving median successfully revealed the underlying trend of the transducer output with time fig 6f and j thus allowing cumulative infiltration to be determined fig 6g it also should be noted that when the infiltration process was mainly driven by gravity and cumulative infiltration curves were near linear lassabatere et al 2019b best slope and best intercept failed to provide s and ks estimates while best steady was successfully applied indeed according to bagarello et al 2014 best steady does not require data from the transient stage of the run but rather relies solely on the regression analysis of the final few cumulative infiltration depths this particular algorithm avoided the uncertainties due to the linearity of the cumulative infiltration which can obscure the distinction between the early and late time infiltration processes di prima et al 2018 3 2 3 improved description of the transient phase the hypothesis of a better description of the transient phase when using the automatic infiltrometers was investigated through a comparison between the cumulative infiltration curves obtained from transducer output and discretized curves having the same increments as manually pouring water volumes into the containment ring in the reported example fig 8 the infiltration reached steady state early i e within the first 0 03 h and only one discretized data point occurred within the transient flow regime as a consequence the transient infiltration models in best slope and best intercept could not be fitted to the discretized data conversely the high resolution cumulative infiltration curve obtained from the transducer output captured 14 points during the transient state allowing for the best slope fig 8c and best intercept algorithms to be fitted in some cases too few points could be identified for the description of the transient state such a problem occurred at the entpe 1 site likely due to the high local initial soil water content there table 1 in addition to this example best slope also failed in two cases at the entpe 2 site whereas best intercept was successfully applied consequently the former method had the lowest success rate fig 7 this shortcoming was already investigated in several investigations e g castellini et al 2018 di prima et al 2018 more specifically when the early and late time infiltration stages greatly differ in terms of infiltration rates the strong concavity of cumulative infiltration results in an over estimation of soil sorptivity such overestimations result in negative values for ks as already suggested by yilmaz et al 2010 3 2 4 water repellent soils the first obvious advantage in using automatic infiltrometer in case of water repellent soils is that data collection is automated and it does not require any further manipulation by the user once the device is installed therefore tests can be successfully and simultaneously performed even if water repellency impedes infiltration and causes long testing durations alagna et al 2018 in addition the automatic infiltrometer used in this investigation was capable of maintaining a small water head on the soil surface which helps to prevent excessive positive pressure from overcoming the soil water repellency nyman et al 2010 for one experiment at the entpe 1 site this experimental approach was useful to signal the occurrence of soil water repellency as identified by cumulative infiltration having a convex curve shape di prima et al 2017 the cumulative infiltration data in that instance yielded a negative value for the intercept of the regression line fitted to the data points describing steady state conditions e g alagna et al 2018 di prima et al 2019 2017 lozano baez et al 2018 this circumstance led to the failure of all the best algorithms lassabatere et al 2019a only approach 4 provided an estimate of ks more specifically best slope and best intercept failed because both algorithms required fitting transient models to early infiltration data that must be concave instead of convex as determined by soil water repellency the best steady algorithm avoids most problems associated with the use of the transient infiltration data yet still estimates meaningless ks data in case of negative intercept values on the other hand approach 4 by stewart and abou najm 2018 differs by the term expressing steady state condition considering exclusively the final infiltration rate i e the slope of regression line fitted to the last data points of the cumulative infiltration the exclusive use of this term allowed to consider only the final stage of the infiltration process i e when the water repellency had diminished or no effect on infiltration therefore we suggest to use steady state methods such as approach 4 in case of water repellent soils angulo jaramillo et al 2019 this example also illustrates that when the physics of infiltration change as in the case of water infiltration into water repellent soils all the best methods are questionable bauters et al 2003 3 3 comparison with the prototype we also compared the cumulative infiltrations curves collected using the new infiltrometers with those measured by the prototype proposed by di prima 2015 on different soils analyzed during previous field campaigns di prima 2015 di prima et al 2017 2016 fig 9 depicts a comparison between 45 curves collected with the prototype fig 9a versus the curves collected with new infiltrometers at the entpe 1 entpe 2 and doua sites fig 9b the mean value of the cumulative infiltration intervals δi decreased from 4 65 mm with the original prototype to 2 15 mm with the new version fig 9c therefore the new infiltrometers had more than twice the resolution i e shorter increments between readings of the prototype returning the example shown in fig 8 the updated version of the automated infiltrometer provided 14 measurements during the transient regime fig 8c whereas the prototype would only have the capability to capture 3 4 points accurately modeling the transient state requires a minimum of five measurements angulo jaramillo et al 2019 meaning that the prototype system would be inadequate in that scenario at the same time the new devices were able to collect measurements for longer durations and greater cumulative infiltration amounts due to their larger storage capacity thus compared to the prototype system the new version of the infiltrometer can generate more data points during both transient and steady state flow regimes 3 4 application of the proposed device to double ring measures an automatic infiltrometer constructed at the anand agricultural university was used to run both of the single and double ring infiltration experiments ks values ranged between 15 0 and 105 8 mm h 1 table 5 the different experimental set ups including multiple imposed water depths 25 50 and 75 mm showed the versatility of the device to execute experiments with multiple positive water heads such as the one requested for the two or multiple ponding depth approaches reynolds and elrick 2002a for the double ring experiments the use of the infiltrometer to maintain the water level in the inner ring improved monitoring of the infiltration process while reducing the amount of effort needed to maintain a constant depth of water in both rings lai and ren 2007 the main advantage of using the automated infiltrometer in this scenario was its simplicity in that it allowed a single operator to carry out the field experiments in addition the limited cost of the device means that it can contribute to more widespread applications of accurate and automated infiltration rates measurements even when combined with cumbersome experiments such as the double ring infiltrometer 3 5 on the advantage of multiple infiltration experiments the ability of the proposed instrumentation package to automatically collect data from up to ten infiltrometers working simultaneously i e when using ten infiltrometers connected to two data acquisition systems was tested at the entpe 1 site fig 10 such a protocol had many advantages indeed ten replicates enabled the identification of specific runs revealing either the effect of preferential flow e g fig 10b run n 10 or on the contrary the impedance of flux owing to water repellency e g fig 10b runs n 4 and 8 in addition ten replicates should be appropriate to obtain representative mean values of soil hydrodynamic parameters at the field scale reynolds and elrick 2002b verbist et al 2010 this protocol can help to overcome uncertainties in the hydraulic characterization of highly heterogeneous soils the new instrumentation package may constitute a valuable tool for the application of the beerkan multi runs procedure proposed by lassabatere et al 2019a which consists in carrying out ten beerkan infiltration experiments along a transect the use of the automatic infiltrometers in this protocol may both provide sufficient water supply to reach steady state and provide measurement resolution needed to improve the description of the transient state these advances allow the user to obtain more accurate estimates of soil hydraulic parameters while also reducing the amount of effort needed to run multiple experiments 4 summary and conclusions in this investigation we designed and manufactured a set of ten devices that automatically provide water at a constant head and record the resulting infiltration rates the design of the devices was improved over a previously presented prototype in terms of reservoir capacity which controls the duration of the test diameter of the air entry tube which controls the measurement resolution and corresponding accuracy of infiltration measurements and number of infiltrometers that can be simultaneously operated here up to ten at one time we also proposed a new algorithm for the automatic processing of the transducer readings which substantially reduced the amount of work necessary to analyze the raw data we encourage the readers to check the website

5794,in an open channel a vegetation patch increases local flow resistances which impacts velocity fields inside and outside the patch a series of experiments was performed to investigate the longitudinal evolution of velocities in a channel with an emergent vegetation patch near the upstream edge of a patch lateral flow adjustments led to decreased velocity inside the patch and increased velocity in the adjacent bare channel a model based on exponential decay was proposed to predict the longitudinal profiles of streamwise velocities upstream of and inside a patch and in the bare channel the longitudinal transect across a patch was divided into two regions in each region the e fold decay parameter was determined fourteen groups of velocity data from cases of model and natural rice patches were used to verify the proposed model the predicted velocity profiles agreed well with the measurements in both the vegetated region and the bare channel indicating that the proposed

landscapes and they influence local flow patterns and bed morphologies bouma et al 2007 sand jensen and pedersen 2008 widdows et al 2008 vandenbruwaene et al 2011 liu et al 2013 2016 yan et al 2016 shan et al 2017 yang et al 2007 for example vegetation can cover the entire floodplains of natural rivers e g yang et al 2007 or can be of finite width and length in intertidal landscapes e g vandenbruwaene et al 2011 in the field the patch width d and length l can range from 0 5 to 5 m and the patch width is generally smaller than patch length i e d l 0 17 to 0 74 sand jensen and pedersen 2008 cornacchia et al 2018 this ratio d l may be attributable to the interaction between flow vegetation patch and bed morphology the interactions are different inside and outside a patch inside a patch flow velocity is reduced but turbulence increases due to the presence of stem scale vortices induced by individual plants resulting in local bed erosion near the upstream edge of a patch gu et al 2019 kim et al 2015 the presence of stem scale turbulence is related to the stem reynolds number red ul d ν where ul is the local time averaged velocity d is the stem diameter and ν is the kinematic viscosity within a patch of rigid cylinders stem scale turbulent mixing is present when red 120 and absent when red 120 liu and nepf 2016 outside a patch the velocities lateral to a patch are increased due to the lateral flow deflection resulting in bed erosion at the two side edges of the patch bouma et al 2007 chen et al 2012a in the wake of a patch the velocities and turbulence kinetic energy tke are both diminished chen et al 2012b li et al 2018 resulting in an enhanced deposition region in the patch wake follett and nepf 2012 kang 2013 the length of the deposition region has been linked to that of the wake region for emergent dense patches cdad 4 the deposition region is determined by the patch width whereas for submerged dense patches ahv 0 1 the deposition region is determined by the smaller scales of both patch width and height liu et al 2018 where a nd with the stem density n is the frontal area per patch volume and hv is the canopy height suspended fine sediment containing nutrients and organic matter favors deposition in the wake of a patch which may promote patch extension in the longitudinal direction in contrast the bed erosion at the two sides of a patch restrict patch extensions in the lateral direction these two feedback mechanisms may explain why patch widths are often smaller than patch lengths in natural rivers in laboratory experiments a large number of studies have constructed model vegetation patches using rigid cylinders to facilitate detailed measurements within and around the model patches follett and nepf 2012 liu and nepf 2016 hu et al 2018 wang et al 2018 2019 yu et al 2019 fig 1 shows a schematic of an open channel with a patch in which the vegetated region and open channel are divided the influence of a model patch on local flow patterns is similar to that of a real vegetation patch for example near the upstream edge of an emergent model patch the flow is deflected laterally from the patch to its adjacent bare channel resulting in decreasing velocities inside the patch and increasing velocities in the bare channel ortiz et al 2013 meftah and mossa 2016 inside a patch the distance associated with flow adjustments over which velocities decrease is dependent on the patch density cda and the half patch width b where cd is the drag coefficient beyond this distance the velocities become constant because the flow deep inside a patch is fully developed based on this understanding rominger and nepf 2011 defined the interior adjustment length li inside a patch over which streamwise velocities decrease to a minimum and then remain constant and proposed an equation to estimate li inside patches where a varies from 0 05 to 0 8 cm 1 and b varies from 4 to 40 cm as shown below 1 l i 5 5 0 4 2 c d a 2 b 2 because the velocities inside a patch decrease over li and the flow is deflected laterally to the bare channel the velocities in the bare channel should increase over the same distance li this study examines whether the longitudinal evolutions of velocities inside a patch and in the bare channel share the same flow adjustment distance see section 4 2 the difference between the velocities inside and outside a patch produces a mixing layer at the two sides of the patch that forms at the upstream patch edge x 0 cm the mixing layer develops quickly over the interior flow adjustment distance at 0 cm x li where the kelvin helmholtz kh vortex street has not yet formed huai et al 2015 beyond li x li the mixing layer along the patch edges becomes stable and kh vortices form when the shear between the inner and outer flows is sufficiently strong white and nepf 2008 the kh vortices penetrate through the edges into a patch the penetration distance δ is related to the drag of the vegetation cda 1 when cda 1 5 cm 1 and the diameter of the cylinder d when cda 1 5 cm 1 poggi et al 2004 nepf et al 2007 based on this finding white and nepf 2008 proposed the following equation to estimate δ 2 δ m a x 0 5 c d a 1 1 8 d the flow passing through an emergent model patch can be simulated by numerical models and the detailed velocity fields within and around a patch can be modeled well e g nicolle and eames 2011 huai et al 2015 kim et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 sonnenwald et al 2019 analytical models cannot present a detailed velocity field around a model patch but can predict velocities inside a patch for example eqs 4 and 5 in chen et al 2012b can predict velocities inside a patch shorter than the interior adjustment length l li and eq 4 10 in rominger and nepf 2011 can predict velocities at x li in the fully developed region deeply inside a patch an analytical model recently proposed by liu and shan 2019 can predict the longitudinal profile of streamwise velocities upstream of and inside a model patch liu and shan s model has a dimensionless parameter determined by the depth averaged velocity ud 0 at the upstream edge of the patch x 0 cm when ud 0 cannot be measured liu and shan proposed eq 3 to estimate ud 0 for 0 cdab 9 when cd 1 corresponding to 0 005 ϕ 0 72 with the solid volume fraction ϕ π 4 n d 2 3 u d 0 u 0 1 0 15 0 02 c d a b where u0 is the mean channel velocity the disadvantage of the three analytical models listed above chen et al 2012b rominger and nepf 2011 liu and shan 2019 is that they can predict velocities only inside a patch to overcome this disadvantage this study proposes a model that can predict the mean velocities of both the vegetated region inside patches and of the bare channel outside patches previous studies have illustrated that the streamwise velocity of air flow inside forest canopies decays exponentially within a canopy lee 2000 belcher et al 2003 similarly chen et al 2013 investigated the longitudinal evolution of water flow near the upstream edge of submerged model patches and reported that depth averaged velocities over the canopy height inside patches decrease exponentially see figure 15 in chen et al 2013 in this study we focus on emergent vegetation patches although lateral flow adjustment occurs on the x y plane near the upstream edge of an emergent patch with a finite width in this study which is different from the vertical flow adjustment on the x z plane near the upstream edge of a channel spanning submerged patch lee 2000 belcher et al 2003 chen et al 2013 the flow adjustment on the x y plane should exhibit a similar two dimensional tendency as that on the x z plane hence the depth averaged streamwise velocities inside emergent patches decrease exponentially the main goal of this study is to propose a model for predicting the longitudinal profile of velocities based on exponential decay the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the experimental setup is introduced in section 2 and the experimental results are presented in section 3 the model theory is introduced in section 4 section 5 summarizes the published data for the model validation section 6 reports the model validation and section 7 further discusses the model 2 experimental methods the experiments were performed under uniform flow conditions in a 23 m long and 2 m wide flume with a horizontal bed the test section in the flume was 15 m long the water entered the flume through a flow straightener forming uniform velocities along the lateral direction a flow depth of h 17 8 0 2 cm and a mean channel velocity of u 0 18 0 0 5 cm s were used in the six cases shown in table 1 the flow depth was measured using water level gauges along the flume and was adjusted by manually modifying the tailgate downstream of the flume the slope of the water surface was s 1 10 4 producing a variation of 0 8 in flow depth and streamwise velocity over the test section the mean channel velocity u0 was measured 5 m upstream from model patches using a sontek acoustic doppler velocimeter adv across all the cases the flow was fully turbulent the channel reynolds number re u 0 r ν 27 000 and the flow was subcritical with the froude number fr u 0 gh 0 14 where r is the hydraulic radius and g is the local gravitational acceleration model vegetation patches were constructed using rigid cylinders and placed 7 m downstream from the entrance of the test section the cylinders were fixed into 1 cm thick polyvinyl chloride pvc boards with a staggered hole arrangement the board with and without holes was examined and found to have a negligible influence on the vertical profiles of the velocities inside and outside the model patches the pvc boards covered the entire channel bed producing a bed friction coefficient of cf 0 006 0 001 see the determination of cf in liu and shan 2019 the model patches were designed to be longer than the interior adjustment length i e l li the half patch width was b 30 40 cm and the half channel width was b 1 m along two sides of the patches the penetration distance δ was estimated using eq 2 across all the cases δ 4 to 20 cm constituting 13 to 47 of b rigid cylinder arrays were constructed to mimic vegetation patches see the images in fig 1b cylinders do not represent a specific macrophyte but can be used to represent cattails and reeds two cylinder diameters d 0 4 and 0 8 cm were chosen based on the observed range of marsh and floodplain vegetation d 0 1 to 1 cm sand jensen 1998 lightbody and nepf 2006 liu et al 2013 in this study cases a1 to a3 used cylinders with d 0 4 whereas cases b1 to b3 used cylinders with d 0 8 the model patches in the two case series had the same solid volume fraction range ϕ 0 015 to 0 045 which matched the observed range of cattails in the field ϕ 0 001 to 0 04 grace et al 1986 coon et al 2000 the drag coefficient cd was determined from the equation proposed by white 1991 as follows 4 c d 1 10 re d 0 2 3 where red 0 ud 0 d ν is the stem reynolds number at the upstream edge of a vegetation patch in this study across the six cases red 0 600 to 1200 producing cd 1 in this study coordinates in the channel with an emergent patch of finite width and length are shown in fig 1 where x y and z are the longitudinal lateral and vertical directions respectively x 0 cm indicates the upstream edge of the patch y 0 cm indicates the centerline of the patch and z 0 cm indicates the bed surface of the channel instantaneous velocities streamwise velocity u t lateral velocity v t and vertical velocity w t were recorded with the adv the adv which had a downward looking probe was placed on a measurement bridge above the flume that could move along the x y and z directions at each point the adv recordings had a period of 150 s and a frequency of 50 hz the unfiltered data were despiked using the method of goring and nikora 2002 code in matlab version r2018b was used to decompose the unfiltered velocities into time averaged velocities denoted as u v and w the 150 s records were compared to a 5 min record and the difference between the time averaged velocities was 0 8 thus the 150 s records were sufficient to obtain stable time averaged statistics the noise in the velocity measurements 0 4 cm s was determined in still water this study considers a patch of emergent vegetation thus the velocities at the mid depth z h 2 ud can be considered the same as the depth averaged velocities ud both inside and outside the patch in fact ud differed by 6 from ud in all six cases ϕ 0 015 to 0 045 therefore to facilitate more measurements per trial the velocities were measured only at the mid depth inside a vegetation patch a characteristic region in which velocities were measured at y 0 and dy 4 was considered at each measurement position to eliminate flow heterogeneity see fig 1 where dy is the lateral distance between in line neighboring cylinders the mean of two velocities in a characteristic region was defined as u d for each measurement the adv was placed in the same orientation and at the same relative position to neighboring cylinders to minimize the measurement error induced by spatial flow heterogeneity inside the cylinder arrays the detailed lateral profile of ud was recorded in a characteristic region in which the mean velocity of the two positions y 0 and dy 4 was within 12 of the spatial averaged velocity outside a patch the mid depth velocity ud is considered ud i e ud ud for the six cases the lateral profiles of velocity were measured at different x positions specifically in series a the lateral profiles of velocities were measured at x 180 and 420 cm for case a1 and at x 180 and 300 cm for cases a2 and a3 in series b the lateral profiles of velocities were measured at x 100 150 200 250 300 400 and 420 cm for the b1 cases and at x 0 50 100 150 200 and 300 cm for the b2 and b3 cases at a lateral transect the mean velocities of the vegetated region and of the bare channel are defined as uveg 1 b 0 b u d d y and ubare 1 b b b b u d d y respectively to verify the proposed model in the vegetated region b y b detailed longitudinal profiles of the velocities were measured only at the patch centerline because the mean velocity of the vegetated region uveg is the same as the velocity u d at the patch centerline see section 3 1 in the bare channel b y b detailed longitudinal profile of velocities were measured at y 60 cm y b 1 5 with b 40 cm in cases a1 and b1 and at the centerline of the bare channel y 65 cm y b 2 2 with b 30 cm in cases a2 and a3 in cases b2 and b3 ubare was determined from the lateral profiles of ud to quantitatively compare the differences between the predicted and measured velocities we adopted the root mean square error rmse which is defined as follows 5 r m s e 1 n i 1 n x m x p 2 where n is the number of measurements and predictions and x m and x p represent the measured and predicted uveg and ubare values respectively 3 experimental results and discussion 3 1 lateral profile of the velocities the experimental data from case a1 ϕ 0 015 and d 0 4 cm were taken as an example to show the lateral profile of the velocities across a partially vegetated channel fig 2 where velocity inside the patch u d the mean velocity of the vegetated region uveg and the mean velocity of the bare channel ubare were normalized by the mean channel velocity u0 the velocity profile was measured at the lateral transect of x 420 cm li where the flow was fully developed the velocity measurements confirm that the flow was symmetric across the centerline x b 0 of the patch and flume fig 2 thus we focused on the velocities over only half the channel 0 y b 2 5 next we discuss the velocities in the vegetated region 0 y b 1 across a transect the normalized mean velocity of the vegetated region uveg u0 0 13 0 02 the blue dashed line in fig 2 is the same as the normalized velocity at the centerline y b 0 of the vegetated region u d u 0 0 12 0 02 within uncertainty in the bare channel 1 y b 2 5 the normalized mean velocity of the bare channel is ubare u0 1 66 0 07 the red dashed line in fig 2 which is the same as the velocity ud u0 1 73 0 03 at y 60 cm y b 1 5 in all the six cases table 1 we compared ubare and ud at different transects and the difference between ubare and ud was 9 fig 3 overall it is reasonable to use u d at the centerline of the vegetated region as uveg and to use the ud near or at the centerline of the bare channel y b 1 5 for cases a1 and b1 and y b 2 2 for cases a2 and a3 as ubare 3 2 longitudinal profile of the velocities the longitudinal profiles of the mean velocities uveg in the vegetated region black circles and ubare in the bare channel red triangles normalized by the mean channel velocity u0 are plotted in fig 4 based on the data from case a1 both profiles share the same adjustment distances lu and li upstream of and inside the patch where lu is the adjustment length upstream of a patch but uveg u0 and ubare u0 have different tendencies we use the longitudinal profile of uveg u0 the black circles in fig 4 to explain the two flow adjustment distances the velocity far upstream from the patch is not influenced by the patch induced lateral flow deflection in this region x lu uveg u0 1 as the x position approaches the upstream edge of the patch uveg decreases over the upstream adjustment region lu x 0 cm the length of the upstream adjustment region is defined as the distance over which 90 of the velocity change δu u0 uveg 0 occurs where uveg 0 is the mean velocity of the vegetated region at the upstream edge of a patch in fig 4 lu 40 20 cm is the same as the half patch width b 40 cm within uncertainty across the six cases lu b see the red circles in fig 6 this result matches the finding of rominger and nepf 2011 who reported the beginning flow divergence upstream of a model patch over a length scale lu proportional to the patch width specifically rominger and nepf found that for canopies the pressure and inertial terms in the equations of continuity and momentum balance only when lu b because the flow can move both through and around a porous patch the patch density determines how much of the flow moves through versus around the patch and thus determines the flow divergence and the length scale lu for patches with ϕ 0 028 0 04 similar to this study where ϕ 0 015 0 045 chen et al 2012b also reported that lu b see figure 4 in their paper after the flow enters the patch the flow velocities continue to decrease over the interior flow adjustment length li due to the additional drag force from the cylinders but become constant beyond li to determine the constancy of velocity the measured velocities between x 0 and 490 cm were compared with the velocity farthest from the patch leading edge x 490 cm this comparison indicated that the velocities between x 350 and 480 cm are the same as the velocity at x 490 cm within uncertainty thus the region between x 350 cm and the patch trailing edge x 500 cm is defined as a fully developed flow region in which the velocities remain constant the interior adjustment region is defined as the distance 0 cm x li between the upstream edge of the patch and the position at which the velocities become constant thus x li is the position of the leading edge of the fully developed flow region for case a1 li 350 10 cm fig 4 which is close to the predicted li 320 cm by eq 1 the method of rominger and nepf 2011 across the six cases the average difference between the measured li and the values predicted by eq 1 is 15 thus eq 1 is a good estimator for li 3 3 region dividing method based on the longitudinal profile of uveg u0 inside a patch fig 4 the decrease in uveg u0 obeys an exponential decay near the upstream edge of the patch because the flow is deflected from the vegetated region to the bare channel recall that the longitudinal profiles of the velocities uveg u0 and ubare u0 in the vegetated region and bare channel have the same adjustment distances lu and li see the example in fig 4 the longitudinal transect in either the vegetated region or the bare channel is divided into two regions to predict the velocities see fig 1 specifically region 1 indicates 0 x l inside the vegetation patch and region 2 indicates x 0 upstream of the patch this region dividing method is applied not only in our cases table 1 but also in the cases in three other published studies table 2 for velocity prediction 4 theory 4 1 velocity prediction in the vegetated region based on the exponential decay we propose the equations in eqs 6a and 6b to predict the mean velocities for uveg 1 and uveg 2 in region 1 inside a patch and region 2 upstream of a patch in the vegetated region respectively 6a r e g i o n 1 u veg 1 u veg f u veg 0 u veg f e x l d 1 6b r e g i o n 2 u veg 2 u 0 u veg 0 u 0 e x l d 2 where u veg f is the mean velocity in the fully developed flow region x li and ld 1 and ld 2 are the e folding decay lengths for u veg 1 in region 1 and for u veg 2 in region 2 respectively at the interface of regions 1 and 2 x 0 cm eqs 6a and 6b must meet the velocity continuity i e u veg 1 u veg 2 u v e g 0 to apply eqs 6a and 6b three velocities u 0 u veg f and u veg 0 and two e folding decay lengths ld 1 and ld 2 must be known we next introduce their determinations first we introduce the determinations of the three velocities u0 uveg f and uveg 0 the mean channel velocity u0 is generally reported if u0 is not reported it can be estimated as follows 7 u 0 ghs c f 1 2 inside a patch the mean velocity u veg f in the fully developed flow region x li can be estimated by eq 8 as proposed by liu and shan 2019 8 u veg f ghs c f 1 2 c d a h 1 ϕ 1 2 note that u 0 and u veg f are the velocities far upstream of a patch and deep inside the patch respectively thus u 0 and u veg f are constant because neither are influenced by the lateral flow adjustments near the upstream patch edge fig 4 in eq 8 it is reasonable to use cd 1 for prediction although cd might be underestimated deep inside a patch however the velocity predictions of eqs 6a and 6b have been shown to be insensitive to cd see section 7 2 for the velocity uveg 0 at the upstream edge of a patch x 0 cm a measured uveg 0 is the best choice however it might not be possible to measure uveg 0 in some cases particularly in the field inside a patch the depth averaged velocity at the centerline of the vegetated region has been demonstrated to be the same as the mean velocity of the vegetated region section 3 1 therefore cdab can be used to estimate ud 0 uveg 0 through the relation proposed by liu and shan 2019 in eq 3 in the introduction second the determinations of the two e folding decay lengths ld 1 and ld 2 are introduced the relationship between ld 1 and ld 2 is established based on the continuity of the velocity gradients at the upstream edge of a patch x 0 cm specifically the velocities estimated by eqs 6a and 6b must meet the velocity gradient continuity constraint at x 0 cm as shown below 9 u veg 1 x u veg 2 x by combining eqs 6a and 6b we obtain the following expression 10 1 l d 1 u veg 0 u veg f e x l d 1 1 l d 2 u veg 0 u 0 e x l d 2 therefore the relationship between ld 1 and ld 2 is as follows 11 l d 2 u veg 0 u 0 u veg f u veg 0 l d 1 using eq 11 ld 2 will be known when ld 1 is determined thus eqs 6a and 6b can be used to predict the longitudinal profiles of the mean velocities in regions 1 and 2 we next introduce how to determine ld 1 eq 6a can be rewritten as eq 12 for the local e fold decay length ld 1 x at each x position in region 1 12 l d 1 x x l n u veg x u veg f u veg 0 u veg f where uveg x indicates the local velocity at each x position in region 1 x 0 cm the velocities measured inside patches are used to calculate l d 1 x at each x position with eq 12 in each case the mean of l d 1 x is defined as l d 1 i e l d 1 1 m i 1 m l d 1 x where m is the number of velocity measurements inside a patch first the measurements in this study are used to estimate ld 1 which is normalized by li as reported in table 1 yielding ld 1 li 0 27 to 0 49 for the frontal area of vegetation patch ad 0 019 to 0 057 to further examine ld 1 li over a wider range of ad 0 004 to 0 48 we used the experimental data from zong and nepf 2011 rominger and nepf 2011 and meftah and mossa 2016 to calculate ld 1 and li was estimated by eq 1 producing ld 1 li 0 23 to 0 37 all the ld 1 li values are plotted in fig 5 where ld 1 li can be considered constant within uncertainty at ad 0 004 to 0 48 if the number of ld 1 li is m the weighted mean of ld 1 li eq 13a and the uncertainty in the weighted mean eq 13b can be calculated by the method of julien 2010 13a t h e w e i g h t e d m e a n o f l d 1 l i y wm j 1 m ω j y j j 1 m ω j 13b t h e u n c e r t a i n t y i n y wm σ wm 1 j 1 m ω j where y j indicates individual ld 1 li and σ j indicates the uncertainty in individual ld 1 li and ω j 1 σ j 2 because the weight ω j eq 13b associated with each y j ld 1 li in this study involves the square of the corresponding uncertainty σ j any ld 1 li that is much less precise possesses greater uncertainty than the others contributes considerably less to the final weighted mean across all cases the weighted mean of ld 1 li is 14 l d 1 l i 0 30 0 01 eq 14 is substituted into eq 6a to predict the mean velocity uveg at the end of the interior adjustment length x li remember that inside a patch the interior adjustment region x 0 to li is defined as the distance over which the mean velocity decreases and it becomes constant beyond x li based on the prediction of eq 6a for the six cases in this study the decrease in velocity over the interior adjustment region x 0 to li is approximately 97 of the total velocity change u veg 0 u veg f inside a patch this result is consistent with the definition of the interior adjustment length and further verifies that eq 14 is reasonable for submerged canopies ϕ 0 012 to 0 098 chen et al 2013 reported a similar ratio 0 33 between the e fold decay length and the interior adjustment length although the flow near the upstream edge of submerged canopies was adjusted in the vertical direction therefore ld 1 0 3li is used to determine ld 2 where li can be predicted by rominger and nepf 2011 eq 1 in the introduction when li is not reported after the three velocities and two e fold length scales have been determined eqs 6a and 6b is able to predict the longitudinal profiles of the mean velocities of the vegetated region 4 2 velocity prediction in the bare channel based on the patch width 2b and channel width 2b the mean velocities in the vegetated region uveg and in the bare channel ubare meet the flow continuity condition shown below 15 u bare b b u veg b u 0 b the longitudinal profile of the mean velocities uveg in the vegetated region can be estimated by eqs 6a and 6b thus the longitudinal profile of the mean velocities in the bare channel ubare can be predicted as follows 16 u bare u 0 b u veg b b b based on eq 16 the mean velocity ubare in the bare channel depends on the channel blockage b b when b b is sufficiently small 0 ubare is approximately the same as the mean channel velocity u0 5 published data for model validation the experimental data from white and nepf 2008 zong and nepf 2011 and devi et al 2019 were used to verify the proposed model because they reported the mean velocities of the vegetated region uveg and the mean velocities of the bare channel ubare the details of the experimental setup were reported in those three studies for convenience we summarize the experimental parameters in table 2 and briefly introduce those experiments first white and nepf 2008 and zong and nepf 2011 performed experiments in the same recirculating flume 13 m long and 1 2 m wide with a horizontal bed a 40 cm wide emergent model vegetation patch was constructed using rigid cylinders with a diameter of d 0 6 cm the model patches were longer than the interior adjustment length li therefore a fully developed flow region was created inside the patch the penetration distance δ was 2 4 to 12 5 cm which is 6 to 30 of the half patch width b 40 cm pvc baseboards placed on the entire channel bed produced a bed friction coefficient of cf 0 006 however in these two studies the flow and patch conditions were different specifically white and nepf 2008 constructed a patch with a 0 1 cm 1 and ϕ 0 045 and performed experiments with h 6 6 cm and u0 11 cm s the lateral profiles of the streamwise velocities were measured at transects at x 33 66 132 195 386 513 and 577 cm see figure 3 in their paper to calculate uveg and ubare in contrast zong and nepf 2011 considered a wider range of u0 5 to 11 6 cm s and higher flow depths h 12 to 14 cm they used two cylinder densities a 0 04 and 0 21 cm 1 corresponding to ϕ 0 02 and 0 1 respectively the longitudinal profiles of ud which have been reported as being the same as uveg were measured along the centerlines of the patches figure 6 in their paper and the lateral profiles of ud were measured at transects from x 675 to 800 cm figure 7 in their paper therefore ubare was calculated in those two studies red 0 180 to 570 based on eq 4 cd 1 1 to 1 3 thus for simplicity we assume cd 1 for calculation second devi et al 2019 measured the velocities in a 20 m long and 1 m wide flume with s 0 0015 and u0 27 cm s a case with no seepage on the channel bed was chosen sand with d50 0 4 mm was placed on the channel bed and the flow depth was h 12 cm resulting in a cf of 0 006 based on the darcy weisbach friction relation in julien 2010 they constructed a 50 cm wide and 5 m long emergent patch using natural rice stems o sativa see figure 2 in their paper the stem density was n 0 26 0 07 cm 2 and the stem diameter was d 0 1 to 0 3 cm yielding a 0 06 0 04 cm 1 and ϕ 0 009 0 005 cd 1 is used for calculation because red 0 240 to 730 based on eq 4 the interior adjustment length was li 3 3 m estimated by eq 1 which was shorter than the patch length 5 m they measured the vertical profiles of the streamwise velocities along the centerlines of the o sativa patch y 25 cm and y b 0 25 and the bare channel y 75 cm and y b 0 75 at x 0 2 5 and 5 m the velocity data were extracted from figure 3 in their paper based on the velocity profiles depth averaged velocities ud were calculated at the centerlines of the patch and bare channel which were then considered as uveg and ubare respectively 6 model validations we used the experimental data from our study and the studies of white and nepf 2008 zong and nepf 2011 and devi et al 2019 to verify the proposed model first we applied our experimental data with ϕ 0 015 to 0 045 to verify the model for both cases a1 to a3 d 0 4 cm in fig 6a c and cases b1 to b3 d 0 8 cm in fig 6d f the predicted longitudinal profiles of uveg and ubare solid lines agree well with the measurements points in the vegetated region and bare channel second we applied the data from white and nepf 2008 and zong and nepf 2011 to verify the model over a wider range of ϕ 0 02 to 0 1 for the white and nepf 2008 data when ϕ 0 045 fig 7a the longitudinal profiles of uveg and ubare solid lines predicted by this model match well with the measured velocities points similarly in fig 7b d when ϕ 0 02 and 0 1 the predicted longitudinal profiles agree well with the measured uveg and ubare values in the vegetated region and bare channel respectively based on the data from zong and nepf 2011 third we compared the velocity measurements from the o sativa patch ϕ 0 009 with the predicted velocities of the proposed model fig 8 and found that the predicted longitudinal profiles of uveg and ubare solid lines are close to the measured velocities points across the four cases our study white and nepf 2008 zong and nepf 2011 and devi et al 2019 the rmse between the measured and predicted velocities in the vegetated region and bare channel ranges between 0 3 and 1 7 cm s corresponding to 2 8 to 9 8 of the mean channel velocity u0 see tables 1 and 2 this finding indicates that the proposed model is capable of accurately estimating the longitudinal profiles of streamwise velocities inside the vegetated region and bare channel 7 model discussion 7 1 comparison of the proposed model to a previous model liu and shan 2019 proposed an analytical model for predicting the longitudinal profile of streamwise velocities in the vegetated region the predicted profile captures the longitudinal evolution of velocitites upstream of and inside a model vegetation patch in contrast two previous models rominger and nepf 2011 chen et al 2012b have distinct limitations specifically chen s model can be applied only to a patch shorter than the interior adjustment length i e l li and rominger and nepf s model can estimate velocities only in the fully developed flow region inside a patch see the discussion in section 8 1 in liu and shan 2019 therefore we compare the proposed model only to liu and shan s model in this section we calculate the rmse values from the measured and predicted velocities in the vegetated region only we take case a1 as an example to show the model comparison the proposed model predicts the longitudinal profiles of velocities in both the vegetated region and bare channel which is advantageous in contrast the model of liu and shan 2019 can predict the longitudinal profile of velocities only in the vegetated region based on this restriction we compared the predictions of the proposed model and liu and shan s model only in the vegetated region fig 9 the two models yield the same velocity predictions upstream of the patch region 2 where x b 0 however inside the patch region 1 where x b 0 the predictions of the proposed model are closer to the real measurements than are those of liu and shan s model particularly over the interior adjustment length li b 8 8 0 3 specifically the rmse of the proposed model is 38 smaller than that of liu and shan s model similarly in cases a2 and a3 the average rmses of the proposed model are 28 smaller than are those of liu and shan s model indicating that the current model has better predictive accuracy than the previous model 7 2 sensitivity analysis the different impacts of the drag coefficient cd the e fold decay length for uveg 1 inside a patch ld 1 and the streamwise velocity at the upstream edge of the patch uveg 0 on the predictions of the proposed model are discussed below case a3 ϕ 0 045 is taken as an example when the target parameter is adjusted the other parameters are fixed as shown in table 1 first in the fully developed flow region x li inside the patch the measured velocity is uveg f 0 9 cm s yielding red uveg f d ν 36 which corresponds to cd 2 estimated by eq 4 thus we consider a wider range of cd 1 to 5 to examine the proposed model s sensitivity fig 10 a cd can impact the prediction only inside a patch region 1 x b 0 because only eqs 6a and 8 include cd however the impact of cd on the predicted velocities is negligible to further explain this result we provide a calculation example below based on eq 8 the fixed parameters in case a3 i e h 17 8 cm s 0 0001 cf 0 006 a 0 144 cm 1 and ϕ 0 045 and cd 1 lead to a uveg f of 1 2 cm s when cd increases to 2 the predicted uveg f decreases to 0 9 cm s the difference between the two predictions is 0 3 cm s which is smaller than the measurement noise 0 4 cm s indicating that the model is insensitive to cd therefore it is reasonable to use cd 1 for predictions as is generally done second the velocity predictions in the vegetated region and bare channel are sensitive to the e fold decay length ld 1 fig 10b in eq 11 u veg 0 u 0 u veg f u veg 0 is constant because uveg 0 u0 and uveg f are fixed therefore the change in ld 1 corresponds to the change in ld 2 to examine the parameter sensitivity we selected a wider range of ld 1 0 1li to 0 5li because across all cases ld 1 li ranges between approximately 0 2 and 0 5 fig 5 the predicted velocities are sensitive to ld 1 only between lu b x b li b i e 1 x b 7 between the two black dashed lines we take two values of ld 1 0 1li and 0 3li as examples in the upstream adjustment region lu a small ld 1 0 1li the blue line produces higher velocities relative to a large ld 1 0 3li the orange line in contrast in the interior adjustment region li a small ld 1 0 1li the blue line corresponds to lower velocities compared to a large ld 1 0 3li the orange line moreover inside a patch a small ld 1 e g ld 1 0 1li the blue line produces a shorter interior adjustment length li 2b that does not match the measured li 7b in contrast a large ld 1 e g ld 1 0 3li the orange line produces a longer interior adjustment length li 7 7b that is close to the measurement 7b based on the predicted velocities the length of the interior adjustment region li can be predicted and used to evaluate whether the selected ratio ld 1 li is appropriate for example in fig 10b the predicted velocity profile presents li 5b at ld 1 0 2li the green line which was shorter than the measured one 7b but presents li 9 3b at ld 1 0 4li the red line which was longer than 7b these results indicate that ld 1 0 2li and 0 4li are not appropriate values for this case because the predicted li does not match the measurement therefore the most appropriate li is between 0 2li and 0 4li we note that ld 1 li may not be a fixed number fig 5 when performing predictions a starting value of ld 1 li 0 3 is suggested subsequently this ratio can be adjusted until the predicted li matches the measured value third the mean velocity uveg 0 at x 0 cm can significantly impact the predictions in the vegetated region and bare channel near the upstream edge of the patch x b 4 to 4 fig 10c for x b 4 to 0 a small uveg 0 0 5u0 the black line leads to a longer upstream adjustment region lu 4b relative to the measured lu b this phenomenon occurs because in eq 11 which is rewritten as l d 2 u v e g f u 0 u veg f u veg 0 1 l d 1 when ld 1 u0 and uveg f are fixed and an underestimated uveg 0 produces a greater ld 2 leading to a longer lu 4b which does not agree with the measured lu b however when uveg 0 0 8u0 is used the predicted velocity profile provides lu b which is the same as the measured lu b based on these findings we reiterate the importance of choosing an appropriate value for uveg 0 a measured uveg 0 at the upstream edge of a patch is the first choice otherwise eq 3 can be used to predict uveg 0 for the patch with 0 cdab 9 0 005 ϕ 0 72 7 3 model limitations the proposed model has been verified in cases with emergent arrays of cylinders and natural rice stems o sativa over a channel blockage of b b 0 3 to 0 5 and a solid volume fraction of ϕ 0 015 to 0 1 however the model needs to be further verified beyond these ranges second o sativa has high flexural rigidity devi et al 2019 and is similar to rigid cylinders therefore in the channel with an o sativa patch the proposed model can accurately predict the longitudinal profiles of mean velocities uveg u0 and ubare u0 in the vegetated region and bare channel however if the plants in a patch have higher flexibility and more complex shapes e g shrubs yang et al 2007 the spatial heterogeneity of the flow inside the patch may be more pronounced which increases the difficulty of velocity prediction for example inside a patch more than two velocity measurements are needed in a characteristic region at each x and y position fig 1 to further eliminate flow heterogeneity moreover the mid depth velocities are no longer equal to the depth averaged velocities within a patch consisting of plants with leaves e g caroppi et al 2019 therefore the vertical profiles of velocities must be measured to calculate the depth averaged velocities third for the model patches constructed of rigid cylinders velocities over the penetration distance do not change considerably so velocities inside the patch are laterally constant see fig 2 this fact has been confirmed by previous physical experiments e g figure 3a in white and nepf 2008 and numerical simulations e g see figure 5 in huai et al 2015 we note that this fact is valid for model patches or the patches constructed of stem like plants e g natural rice stems however for the patch constructed of vegetation with a complex shape the penetration distance is determined by vegetation morphology density and flexibility e g caroppi et al 2019 and the width of the penetration distance may be different from that of a rigid cylinder array in this case the velocity in the vegetated region may no longer be constant in the lateral direction and consequently eq 8 may not be an appropriate estimator for the mean velocity of the vegetated region based on this the lateral distribution of velocity should be used to calculate the mean velocity of the vegetated region finally in this study we considered only the in line plant distribution inside a patch and did not consider patches in which plants were randomly distributed that is in each case in this study the cylinders were arranged in a staggered in line distribution see fig 1b and the distances between neighboring cylinders were fixed however in the field plants grow randomly inside a patch thus the distances between neighboring plants change randomly consequently the depth averaged velocities inside a patch with randomly distributed plants may be not laterally uniform ricardo et al 2014 shan et al 2019 contrasting with the laterally uniform velocities inside a patch with in line plant distribution e g fig 2 therefore the proposed model cannot be directly applied to patches with randomly distributed plants 8 conclusions this study characterized the longitudinal variations in velocities inside and outside a patch of emergent vegetation and proposed an exponential decay based model to predict the longitudinal profiles of the velocities inside and outside the patch based on the measured velocity profile the longitudinal transect was divided into two regions upstream of and inside the patch see section 3 3 and separate predictive equations were presented for these two regions eqs 6a and 6b in each region an e fold length scale exists in the equation the relationship between the two e fold length scales eq 11 in two regions was established based on the continuity of the velocity gradient at the upstream edge of a patch the experimental data from thirteen cases with model patches this study white and nepf 2008 zong and nepf 2011 and one case with natural rice stems devi et al 2019 were used to verify the model the predicted longitudinal velocity profiles agree well with the measurements inside and outside the patches indicating that this model is capable of accurately predicting velocity profiles in an open channel with an emergent vegetation patch credit authorship contribution statement chao liu conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing

5794,in an open channel a vegetation patch increases local flow resistances which impacts velocity fields inside and outside the patch a series of experiments was performed to investigate the longitudinal evolution of velocities in a channel with an emergent vegetation patch near the upstream edge of a patch lateral flow adjustments led to decreased velocity inside the patch and increased velocity in the adjacent bare channel a model based on exponential decay was proposed to predict the longitudinal profiles of streamwise velocities upstream of and inside a patch and in the bare channel the longitudinal transect across a patch was divided into two regions in each region the e fold decay parameter was determined fourteen groups of velocity data from cases of model and natural rice patches were used to verify the proposed model the predicted velocity profiles agreed well with the measurements in both the vegetated region and the bare channel indicating that the proposed

landscapes and they influence local flow patterns and bed morphologies bouma et al 2007 sand jensen and pedersen 2008 widdows et al 2008 vandenbruwaene et al 2011 liu et al 2013 2016 yan et al 2016 shan et al 2017 yang et al 2007 for example vegetation can cover the entire floodplains of natural rivers e g yang et al 2007 or can be of finite width and length in intertidal landscapes e g vandenbruwaene et al 2011 in the field the patch width d and length l can range from 0 5 to 5 m and the patch width is generally smaller than patch length i e d l 0 17 to 0 74 sand jensen and pedersen 2008 cornacchia et al 2018 this ratio d l may be attributable to the interaction between flow vegetation patch and bed morphology the interactions are different inside and outside a patch inside a patch flow velocity is reduced but turbulence increases due to the presence of stem scale vortices induced by individual plants resulting in local bed erosion near the upstream edge of a patch gu et al 2019 kim et al 2015 the presence of stem scale turbulence is related to the stem reynolds number red ul d ν where ul is the local time averaged velocity d is the stem diameter and ν is the kinematic viscosity within a patch of rigid cylinders stem scale turbulent mixing is present when red 120 and absent when red 120 liu and nepf 2016 outside a patch the velocities lateral to a patch are increased due to the lateral flow deflection resulting in bed erosion at the two side edges of the patch bouma et al 2007 chen et al 2012a in the wake of a patch the velocities and turbulence kinetic energy tke are both diminished chen et al 2012b li et al 2018 resulting in an enhanced deposition region in the patch wake follett and nepf 2012 kang 2013 the length of the deposition region has been linked to that of the wake region for emergent dense patches cdad 4 the deposition region is determined by the patch width whereas for submerged dense patches ahv 0 1 the deposition region is determined by the smaller scales of both patch width and height liu et al 2018 where a nd with the stem density n is the frontal area per patch volume and hv is the canopy height suspended fine sediment containing nutrients and organic matter favors deposition in the wake of a patch which may promote patch extension in the longitudinal direction in contrast the bed erosion at the two sides of a patch restrict patch extensions in the lateral direction these two feedback mechanisms may explain why patch widths are often smaller than patch lengths in natural rivers in laboratory experiments a large number of studies have constructed model vegetation patches using rigid cylinders to facilitate detailed measurements within and around the model patches follett and nepf 2012 liu and nepf 2016 hu et al 2018 wang et al 2018 2019 yu et al 2019 fig 1 shows a schematic of an open channel with a patch in which the vegetated region and open channel are divided the influence of a model patch on local flow patterns is similar to that of a real vegetation patch for example near the upstream edge of an emergent model patch the flow is deflected laterally from the patch to its adjacent bare channel resulting in decreasing velocities inside the patch and increasing velocities in the bare channel ortiz et al 2013 meftah and mossa 2016 inside a patch the distance associated with flow adjustments over which velocities decrease is dependent on the patch density cda and the half patch width b where cd is the drag coefficient beyond this distance the velocities become constant because the flow deep inside a patch is fully developed based on this understanding rominger and nepf 2011 defined the interior adjustment length li inside a patch over which streamwise velocities decrease to a minimum and then remain constant and proposed an equation to estimate li inside patches where a varies from 0 05 to 0 8 cm 1 and b varies from 4 to 40 cm as shown below 1 l i 5 5 0 4 2 c d a 2 b 2 because the velocities inside a patch decrease over li and the flow is deflected laterally to the bare channel the velocities in the bare channel should increase over the same distance li this study examines whether the longitudinal evolutions of velocities inside a patch and in the bare channel share the same flow adjustment distance see section 4 2 the difference between the velocities inside and outside a patch produces a mixing layer at the two sides of the patch that forms at the upstream patch edge x 0 cm the mixing layer develops quickly over the interior flow adjustment distance at 0 cm x li where the kelvin helmholtz kh vortex street has not yet formed huai et al 2015 beyond li x li the mixing layer along the patch edges becomes stable and kh vortices form when the shear between the inner and outer flows is sufficiently strong white and nepf 2008 the kh vortices penetrate through the edges into a patch the penetration distance δ is related to the drag of the vegetation cda 1 when cda 1 5 cm 1 and the diameter of the cylinder d when cda 1 5 cm 1 poggi et al 2004 nepf et al 2007 based on this finding white and nepf 2008 proposed the following equation to estimate δ 2 δ m a x 0 5 c d a 1 1 8 d the flow passing through an emergent model patch can be simulated by numerical models and the detailed velocity fields within and around a patch can be modeled well e g nicolle and eames 2011 huai et al 2015 kim et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 sonnenwald et al 2019 analytical models cannot present a detailed velocity field around a model patch but can predict velocities inside a patch for example eqs 4 and 5 in chen et al 2012b can predict velocities inside a patch shorter than the interior adjustment length l li and eq 4 10 in rominger and nepf 2011 can predict velocities at x li in the fully developed region deeply inside a patch an analytical model recently proposed by liu and shan 2019 can predict the longitudinal profile of streamwise velocities upstream of and inside a model patch liu and shan s model has a dimensionless parameter determined by the depth averaged velocity ud 0 at the upstream edge of the patch x 0 cm when ud 0 cannot be measured liu and shan proposed eq 3 to estimate ud 0 for 0 cdab 9 when cd 1 corresponding to 0 005 ϕ 0 72 with the solid volume fraction ϕ π 4 n d 2 3 u d 0 u 0 1 0 15 0 02 c d a b where u0 is the mean channel velocity the disadvantage of the three analytical models listed above chen et al 2012b rominger and nepf 2011 liu and shan 2019 is that they can predict velocities only inside a patch to overcome this disadvantage this study proposes a model that can predict the mean velocities of both the vegetated region inside patches and of the bare channel outside patches previous studies have illustrated that the streamwise velocity of air flow inside forest canopies decays exponentially within a canopy lee 2000 belcher et al 2003 similarly chen et al 2013 investigated the longitudinal evolution of water flow near the upstream edge of submerged model patches and reported that depth averaged velocities over the canopy height inside patches decrease exponentially see figure 15 in chen et al 2013 in this study we focus on emergent vegetation patches although lateral flow adjustment occurs on the x y plane near the upstream edge of an emergent patch with a finite width in this study which is different from the vertical flow adjustment on the x z plane near the upstream edge of a channel spanning submerged patch lee 2000 belcher et al 2003 chen et al 2013 the flow adjustment on the x y plane should exhibit a similar two dimensional tendency as that on the x z plane hence the depth averaged streamwise velocities inside emergent patches decrease exponentially the main goal of this study is to propose a model for predicting the longitudinal profile of velocities based on exponential decay the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the experimental setup is introduced in section 2 and the experimental results are presented in section 3 the model theory is introduced in section 4 section 5 summarizes the published data for the model validation section 6 reports the model validation and section 7 further discusses the model 2 experimental methods the experiments were performed under uniform flow conditions in a 23 m long and 2 m wide flume with a horizontal bed the test section in the flume was 15 m long the water entered the flume through a flow straightener forming uniform velocities along the lateral direction a flow depth of h 17 8 0 2 cm and a mean channel velocity of u 0 18 0 0 5 cm s were used in the six cases shown in table 1 the flow depth was measured using water level gauges along the flume and was adjusted by manually modifying the tailgate downstream of the flume the slope of the water surface was s 1 10 4 producing a variation of 0 8 in flow depth and streamwise velocity over the test section the mean channel velocity u0 was measured 5 m upstream from model patches using a sontek acoustic doppler velocimeter adv across all the cases the flow was fully turbulent the channel reynolds number re u 0 r ν 27 000 and the flow was subcritical with the froude number fr u 0 gh 0 14 where r is the hydraulic radius and g is the local gravitational acceleration model vegetation patches were constructed using rigid cylinders and placed 7 m downstream from the entrance of the test section the cylinders were fixed into 1 cm thick polyvinyl chloride pvc boards with a staggered hole arrangement the board with and without holes was examined and found to have a negligible influence on the vertical profiles of the velocities inside and outside the model patches the pvc boards covered the entire channel bed producing a bed friction coefficient of cf 0 006 0 001 see the determination of cf in liu and shan 2019 the model patches were designed to be longer than the interior adjustment length i e l li the half patch width was b 30 40 cm and the half channel width was b 1 m along two sides of the patches the penetration distance δ was estimated using eq 2 across all the cases δ 4 to 20 cm constituting 13 to 47 of b rigid cylinder arrays were constructed to mimic vegetation patches see the images in fig 1b cylinders do not represent a specific macrophyte but can be used to represent cattails and reeds two cylinder diameters d 0 4 and 0 8 cm were chosen based on the observed range of marsh and floodplain vegetation d 0 1 to 1 cm sand jensen 1998 lightbody and nepf 2006 liu et al 2013 in this study cases a1 to a3 used cylinders with d 0 4 whereas cases b1 to b3 used cylinders with d 0 8 the model patches in the two case series had the same solid volume fraction range ϕ 0 015 to 0 045 which matched the observed range of cattails in the field ϕ 0 001 to 0 04 grace et al 1986 coon et al 2000 the drag coefficient cd was determined from the equation proposed by white 1991 as

study coordinates in the channel with an emergent patch of finite width and length are shown in fig 1 where x y and z are the longitudinal lateral and vertical directions respectively x 0 cm indicates the upstream edge of the patch y 0 cm indicates the centerline of the patch and z 0 cm indicates the bed surface of the channel instantaneous velocities streamwise velocity u t lateral velocity v t and vertical velocity w t were recorded with the adv the adv which had a downward looking probe was placed on a measurement bridge above the flume that could move along the x y and z directions at each point the adv recordings had a period of 150 s and a frequency of 50 hz the unfiltered data were despiked using the method of goring and nikora 2002 code in matlab version r2018b was used to decompose the unfiltered velocities into time averaged velocities denoted as u v and w the 150 s records were compared to a 5 min record and the difference between the time averaged velocities was 0 8 thus the 150 s records were sufficient to obtain stable time averaged statistics the noise in the velocity measurements 0 4 cm s was determined in still water this study considers a patch of emergent vegetation thus the velocities at the mid depth z h 2 ud can be considered the same as the depth averaged velocities ud both inside and outside the patch in fact ud differed by 6 from ud in all six cases ϕ 0 015 to 0 045 therefore to facilitate more measurements per trial the velocities were measured only at the mid depth inside a vegetation patch a characteristic region in which velocities were measured at y 0 and dy 4 was considered at each measurement position to eliminate flow heterogeneity see fig 1 where dy is the lateral distance between in line neighboring cylinders the mean of two velocities in a characteristic region was defined as u d for each measurement the adv was placed in the same orientation and at the same relative position to neighboring cylinders to minimize the measurement error induced by spatial flow heterogeneity inside the cylinder arrays the detailed lateral profile of ud was recorded in a characteristic region in which the mean velocity of the two positions y 0 and dy 4 was within 12 of the spatial averaged velocity outside a patch the mid depth velocity ud is considered ud i e ud ud for the six cases the lateral profiles of velocity were measured at different x positions specifically in series a the lateral profiles of velocities were measured at x 180 and 420 cm for case a1 and at x 180 and 300 cm for cases a2 and a3 in series b the lateral profiles of velocities were measured at x 100 150 200 250 300 400 and 420 cm for the b1 cases and at x 0 50 100 150 200 and 300 cm for the b2 and b3 cases at a lateral transect the mean velocities of the vegetated region and of the bare channel are defined as uveg 1 b 0 b u d d y and ubare 1 b b b b u d d y respectively to verify the proposed model in the vegetated region b y b detailed longitudinal profiles of the velocities were measured only at the patch centerline because the mean velocity of the vegetated region uveg is the same as the velocity u d at the patch centerline see section 3 1 in the bare channel b y b detailed longitudinal profile of velocities were measured at y 60 cm y b 1 5 with b 40 cm in cases a1 and b1 and at the centerline of the bare channel y 65 cm y b 2 2 with b 30 cm in cases a2 and a3 in cases b2 and b3 ubare was determined from the lateral profiles of ud to quantitatively compare the differences between the predicted and measured velocities we adopted the root mean square error rmse which is defined as follows 5 r m s e 1 n i 1 n x m x p 2 where n is the number of measurements and predictions and x m and x p represent the measured and predicted uveg and ubare values respectively 3 experimental results and discussion 3 1 lateral profile of the velocities the experimental data from case a1 ϕ 0 015 and d 0 4 cm were taken as an example to show the lateral profile of the velocities across a partially vegetated channel fig 2 where velocity inside the patch u d the mean velocity of the vegetated region uveg and the mean velocity of the bare channel ubare were normalized by the mean channel velocity u0 the velocity profile was measured at the lateral transect of x 420 cm li where the flow was fully developed the velocity measurements confirm that the flow was symmetric across the centerline x b 0 of the patch and flume fig 2 thus we focused on the velocities over only half the channel 0 y b 2 5 next we discuss the velocities in the vegetated region 0 y b 1 across a transect the normalized mean velocity of the vegetated region uveg u0 0 13 0 02 the blue dashed line in fig 2 is the same as the normalized velocity at the centerline y b 0 of the vegetated region u d u 0 0 12 0 02 within uncertainty in the bare channel 1 y b 2 5 the normalized mean velocity of the bare channel is ubare u0 1 66 0 07 the red dashed line in fig 2 which is the same as the velocity ud u0 1 73 0 03 at y 60 cm y b 1 5 in all the six cases table 1 we compared ubare and ud at different transects and the difference between ubare and ud was 9 fig 3 overall it is reasonable to use u d at the centerline of the vegetated region as uveg and to use the ud near or at the centerline of the bare channel y b 1 5 for cases a1 and b1 and y b 2 2 for cases a2 and a3 as ubare 3 2 longitudinal profile of the velocities the longitudinal profiles of the mean velocities uveg in the vegetated region black circles and ubare in the bare channel red triangles normalized by the mean channel velocity u0 are plotted in fig 4 based on the data from case a1 both profiles share the same adjustment distances lu and li upstream of and inside the patch where lu is the adjustment length upstream of a patch but uveg u0 and ubare u0 have different tendencies we use the longitudinal profile of uveg u0 the black circles in fig 4 to explain the two flow adjustment distances the velocity far upstream from the patch is not influenced by the patch induced lateral flow deflection in this region x lu uveg u0 1 as the x position approaches the upstream edge of the patch uveg decreases over the upstream adjustment region lu x 0 cm the length of the upstream adjustment region is defined as the distance over which 90 of the velocity change δu u0 uveg 0 occurs where uveg 0 is the mean velocity of the vegetated region at the upstream edge of a patch in fig 4 lu 40 20 cm is the same as the half patch width b 40 cm within uncertainty across the six cases lu b see the red circles in fig 6 this result matches the finding of rominger and nepf 2011 who reported the beginning flow divergence upstream of a model patch over a length scale lu proportional to the patch width specifically rominger and nepf found that for canopies the pressure and inertial terms in the equations of continuity and momentum balance only when lu b because the flow can move both through and around a porous patch the patch density determines how much of the flow moves through versus around the patch and thus determines the flow divergence and the length scale lu for patches with ϕ 0 028 0 04 similar to this study where ϕ 0 015 0 045 chen et al 2012b also reported that lu b see figure 4 in their paper after the flow enters the patch the flow velocities continue to decrease over the interior flow adjustment length li due to the additional drag force from the cylinders but become constant beyond li to determine the constancy of velocity the measured velocities between x 0 and 490 cm were compared with the velocity farthest from the patch leading edge x 490 cm this comparison indicated that the velocities between x 350 and 480 cm are the same as the velocity at x 490 cm within uncertainty thus the region between x 350 cm and the patch trailing edge x 500 cm is defined as a fully developed flow region in which the velocities remain constant the interior adjustment region is defined as the distance 0 cm x li between the upstream edge of the patch and the position at which the velocities become constant thus x li is the position of the leading edge of the fully developed flow region for case a1 li 350 10 cm fig 4 which is close to the predicted li 320 cm by eq 1 the method of rominger and nepf 2011 across the six cases the average difference between the measured li and the values predicted by eq 1 is 15 thus eq 1 is a good estimator for li 3 3 region dividing method based on the longitudinal profile of uveg u0 inside a patch fig 4 the decrease in uveg u0 obeys an exponential decay near the upstream edge of the patch because the flow is deflected from the vegetated region to the bare channel recall that the longitudinal profiles of the velocities uveg u0 and ubare u0 in the vegetated region and bare channel have the same adjustment distances lu and li see the example in fig 4 the longitudinal transect in either the vegetated region or the bare channel is divided into two regions to predict the velocities see fig 1 specifically region 1 indicates 0 x l inside the vegetation patch and region 2 indicates x 0 upstream of the patch this region dividing method is applied not only in our cases table 1 but also in the cases in three other published studies table 2 for velocity prediction 4 theory 4 1 velocity prediction in the vegetated region based on the exponential decay we propose the equations in eqs 6a and 6b to predict the mean velocities for uveg 1 and uveg 2 in region 1 inside a patch and region 2 upstream of a patch in the vegetated region respectively 6a r e g i o n 1 u veg 1 u veg f u veg 0 u veg f e x l d 1 6b r e g i o n 2 u veg 2 u 0 u veg 0 u 0 e x l d 2 where u veg f is the mean velocity in the fully developed flow region x li and ld 1 and ld 2 are the e folding decay lengths for u veg 1 in region 1 and for u veg 2 in region 2 respectively at the interface of regions 1 and 2 x 0 cm eqs 6a and 6b must meet the velocity continuity i e u veg 1 u veg 2 u v e g 0 to apply eqs 6a and 6b three velocities u 0 u veg f and u veg 0 and two e folding decay lengths ld 1 and ld 2 must be known we next introduce their determinations first we introduce the determinations of the three velocities u0 uveg f and uveg 0 the mean channel velocity u0 is generally reported if u0 is not reported it can be estimated as follows 7 u 0 ghs c f 1 2 inside a patch the mean velocity u veg f in the fully developed flow region x li can be estimated by eq 8 as proposed by liu and shan 2019 8 u veg f ghs c f 1 2 c d a h 1 ϕ 1 2 note that u 0 and u veg f are the velocities far upstream of a patch and deep inside the patch respectively thus u 0 and u veg f are constant because neither are influenced by the lateral flow adjustments near the upstream patch edge fig 4 in eq 8 it is reasonable to use cd 1 for prediction although cd might be underestimated deep inside a patch however the velocity predictions of eqs 6a and 6b have been shown to be insensitive to cd see section 7 2 for the velocity uveg 0 at the upstream edge of a patch x 0 cm a measured uveg 0 is the best choice however it might not be possible to measure uveg 0 in some cases particularly in the field inside a patch the depth averaged velocity at the centerline of the vegetated region has been demonstrated to be the same as the mean velocity of the vegetated region section 3 1 therefore cdab can be used to estimate ud 0 uveg 0 through the relation proposed by liu and shan 2019 in eq 3 in the introduction second the determinations of the two e folding decay lengths ld 1 and ld 2 are introduced the relationship between ld 1 and ld 2 is established based on the continuity of the velocity gradients at the upstream edge of a patch x 0 cm specifically the velocities estimated by eqs 6a and 6b must meet the velocity gradient continuity constraint at x 0 cm as shown below 9 u veg 1 x u veg 2 x by combining eqs 6a and 6b we obtain the following expression 10 1 l d 1 u veg 0 u veg f e x l d 1 1 l d 2 u veg 0 u 0 e x l d 2 therefore the relationship between ld 1 and ld 2 is as follows 11 l d 2 u veg 0 u 0 u veg f u veg 0 l d 1 using eq 11 ld 2 will be known when ld 1 is determined thus eqs 6a and 6b can be used to predict the longitudinal profiles of the mean velocities in regions 1 and 2 we next introduce how to determine ld 1 eq 6a can be rewritten as eq 12 for the local e fold decay length ld 1 x at each x position in region 1 12 l d 1 x x l n u veg x u veg f u veg 0 u veg f where uveg x indicates the local velocity at each x position in region 1 x 0 cm the velocities measured inside patches are used to calculate l d 1 x at each x position with eq 12 in each case the mean of l d 1 x is defined as l d 1 i e l d 1 1 m i 1 m l d 1 x where m is the number of velocity measurements inside a patch first the measurements in this study are used to estimate ld 1 which is normalized by li as reported in table 1 yielding ld 1 li 0 27 to 0 49 for the frontal area of vegetation patch ad 0 019 to 0 057 to further examine ld 1 li over a wider range of ad 0 004 to 0 48 we used the experimental data from zong and nepf 2011 rominger and nepf 2011 and meftah and mossa 2016 to calculate ld 1 and li was estimated by eq 1 producing ld 1 li 0 23 to 0 37 all the ld 1 li values are plotted in fig 5 where ld 1 li can be considered constant within uncertainty at ad 0 004 to 0 48 if the number of ld 1 li is m the weighted mean of ld 1 li eq 13a and the uncertainty in the weighted mean eq 13b can be calculated by the method of julien 2010 13a t h e w e i g h t e d m e a n o f l d 1 l i y wm j 1 m ω j y j j 1 m ω j 13b t h e u n c e r t a i n t y i n y wm σ wm 1 j 1 m ω j where y j indicates individual ld 1 li and σ j indicates the uncertainty in individual ld 1 li and ω j 1 σ j 2 because the weight ω j eq 13b associated with each y j ld 1 li in this study involves the square of the corresponding uncertainty σ j any ld 1 li that is much less precise possesses greater uncertainty than the others contributes considerably less to the final weighted mean across all cases the weighted mean of ld 1 li is 14 l d 1 l i 0 30 0 01 eq 14 is substituted into eq 6a to predict the mean velocity uveg at the end of the interior adjustment length x li remember that inside a patch the interior adjustment region x 0 to li is defined as the distance over which the mean velocity decreases and it becomes constant beyond x li based on the prediction of eq 6a for the six cases in this study the decrease in velocity over the interior adjustment region x 0 to li is approximately 97 of the total velocity change u veg 0 u veg f inside a patch this result is consistent with the definition of the interior adjustment length and further verifies that eq 14 is reasonable for submerged canopies ϕ 0 012 to 0 098 chen et al 2013 reported a similar ratio 0 33 between the e fold decay length and the interior adjustment length although the flow near the upstream edge of submerged canopies was adjusted in the vertical direction therefore ld 1 0 3li is used to determine ld 2 where li can be predicted by rominger and nepf 2011 eq 1 in the introduction when li is not reported after the three velocities and two e fold length scales have been determined eqs 6a and 6b is able to predict the longitudinal profiles of the mean velocities of the vegetated region 4 2 velocity prediction in the bare channel based on the patch width 2b and channel width 2b the mean velocities in the vegetated region uveg and in the bare channel ubare meet the flow continuity condition shown below 15 u bare b b u veg b u 0 b the longitudinal profile of the mean velocities uveg in the vegetated region can be estimated by eqs 6a and 6b thus the longitudinal profile of the mean velocities in the bare channel ubare can be predicted as follows 16 u bare u 0 b u veg b b b based on eq 16 the mean velocity ubare in the bare channel depends on the channel blockage b b when b b is sufficiently small 0 ubare is approximately the same as the mean channel velocity u0 5 published data for model validation the experimental data from white and nepf 2008 zong and nepf 2011 and devi et al 2019 were used to verify the proposed model because they reported the mean velocities of the vegetated region uveg and the mean velocities of the bare channel ubare the details of the experimental setup were reported in those three studies for convenience we summarize the experimental parameters in table 2 and briefly introduce those experiments first white and nepf 2008 and zong and nepf 2011 performed experiments in the same recirculating flume 13 m long and 1 2 m wide with a horizontal bed a 40 cm wide emergent model vegetation patch was constructed using rigid cylinders with a diameter of d 0 6 cm the model patches were longer than the interior adjustment length li therefore a fully developed flow region was created inside the patch the penetration distance δ was 2 4 to 12 5 cm which is 6 to 30 of the half patch width b 40 cm pvc baseboards placed on the entire channel bed produced a bed friction coefficient of cf 0 006 however in these two studies the flow and patch conditions were different specifically white and nepf 2008 constructed a patch with a 0 1 cm 1 and ϕ 0 045 and performed experiments with h 6 6 cm and u0 11 cm s the lateral profiles of the streamwise velocities were measured at transects at x 33 66 132 195 386 513 and 577 cm see figure 3 in their paper to calculate uveg and ubare in contrast zong and nepf 2011 considered a wider range of u0 5 to 11 6 cm s and higher flow depths h 12 to 14 cm they used two cylinder densities a 0 04 and 0 21 cm 1 corresponding to ϕ 0 02 and 0 1 respectively the longitudinal profiles of ud which have been reported as being the same as uveg were measured along the centerlines of the patches figure 6 in their paper and the lateral profiles of ud were measured at transects from x 675 to 800 cm figure 7 in their paper therefore ubare was calculated in those two studies red 0 180 to 570 based on eq 4 cd 1 1 to 1 3 thus for simplicity we assume cd 1 for calculation second devi et al 2019 measured the velocities in a 20 m long and 1 m wide flume with s 0 0015 and u0 27 cm s a case with no seepage on the channel bed was chosen sand with d50 0 4 mm was placed on the channel bed and the flow depth was h 12 cm resulting in a cf of 0 006 based on the darcy weisbach friction relation in julien 2010 they constructed a 50 cm wide and 5 m long emergent patch using natural rice stems o sativa see figure 2 in their paper the stem density was n 0 26 0 07 cm 2 and the stem diameter was d 0 1 to 0 3 cm yielding a 0 06 0 04 cm 1 and ϕ 0 009 0 005 cd 1 is used for calculation because red 0 240 to 730 based on eq 4 the interior adjustment length was li 3 3 m estimated by eq 1 which was shorter than the patch length 5 m they measured the vertical profiles of the streamwise velocities along the centerlines of the o sativa patch y 25 cm and y b 0 25 and the bare channel y 75 cm and y b 0 75 at x 0 2 5 and 5 m the velocity data were extracted from figure 3 in their paper based on the velocity profiles depth averaged velocities ud were calculated at the centerlines of the patch and bare channel which were then considered as uveg and ubare respectively 6 model validations we used the experimental data from our study and the studies of white and nepf 2008 zong and nepf 2011 and devi et al 2019 to verify the proposed model first we applied our experimental data with ϕ 0 015 to 0 045 to verify the model for both cases a1 to a3 d 0 4 cm in fig 6a c and cases b1 to b3 d 0 8 cm in fig 6d f the predicted longitudinal profiles of uveg and ubare solid lines agree well with the measurements points in the vegetated region and bare channel second we applied the data from white and nepf 2008 and zong and nepf 2011 to verify the model over a wider range of ϕ 0 02 to 0 1 for the white and nepf 2008 data when ϕ 0 045 fig 7a the longitudinal profiles of uveg and ubare solid lines predicted by this model match well with the measured velocities points similarly in fig 7b d when ϕ 0 02 and 0 1 the predicted longitudinal profiles agree well with the measured uveg and ubare values in the vegetated region and bare channel respectively based on the data from zong and nepf 2011 third we compared the velocity measurements from the o sativa patch ϕ 0 009 with the predicted velocities of the proposed model fig 8 and found that the predicted longitudinal profiles of uveg and ubare solid lines are close to the measured velocities points across the four cases our study white and nepf 2008 zong and nepf 2011 and devi et al 2019 the rmse between the measured and predicted velocities in the vegetated region and bare channel ranges between 0 3 and 1 7 cm s corresponding to 2 8 to 9 8 of the mean channel velocity u0 see tables 1 and 2 this finding indicates that the proposed model is capable of accurately estimating the longitudinal profiles of streamwise velocities inside the vegetated region and bare channel 7 model discussion 7 1 comparison of the proposed model to a previous model liu and shan 2019 proposed an analytical model for predicting the longitudinal profile of streamwise velocities in the vegetated region the predicted profile captures the longitudinal evolution of velocitites upstream of and inside a model vegetation patch in contrast two previous models rominger and nepf 2011 chen et al 2012b have distinct limitations specifically chen s model can be applied only to a patch shorter than the interior adjustment length i e l li and rominger and nepf s model can estimate velocities only in the fully developed flow region inside a patch see the discussion in section 8 1 in liu and shan 2019 therefore we compare the proposed model only to liu and shan s model in this section we calculate the rmse values from the measured and predicted velocities in the vegetated region only we take case a1 as an example to show the model comparison the proposed model predicts the longitudinal profiles of velocities in both the vegetated region and bare channel which is advantageous in contrast the model of liu and shan 2019 can predict the longitudinal profile of velocities only in the vegetated region based on this restriction we compared the predictions of the proposed model and liu and shan s model only in the vegetated region fig 9 the two models yield the same velocity predictions upstream of the patch region 2 where x b 0 however inside the patch region 1 where x b 0 the predictions of the proposed model are closer to the real measurements than are those of liu and shan s model particularly over the interior adjustment length li b 8 8 0 3 specifically the rmse of the proposed model is 38 smaller than that of liu and shan s model similarly in cases a2 and a3 the average rmses of the proposed model are 28 smaller than are those of liu and shan s model indicating that the current model has better predictive accuracy than the previous model 7 2 sensitivity analysis the different impacts of the drag coefficient cd the e fold decay length for uveg 1 inside a patch ld 1 and the streamwise velocity at the upstream edge of the patch uveg 0 on the predictions of the proposed model are discussed below case a3 ϕ 0 045 is taken as an example when the target parameter is adjusted the other parameters are fixed as shown in table 1 first in the fully developed flow region x li inside the patch the measured velocity is uveg f 0 9 cm s yielding red uveg f d ν 36 which corresponds to cd 2 estimated by eq 4 thus we consider a wider range of cd 1 to 5 to examine the proposed model s sensitivity fig 10 a cd can impact the prediction only inside a patch region 1 x b 0 because only eqs 6a and 8 include cd however the impact of cd on the predicted velocities is negligible to further explain this result we provide a calculation example below based on eq 8 the fixed parameters in case a3 i e h 17 8 cm s 0 0001 cf 0 006 a 0 144 cm 1 and ϕ 0 045 and cd 1 lead to a uveg f of 1 2 cm s when cd increases to 2 the predicted uveg f decreases to 0 9 cm s the difference between the two predictions is 0 3 cm s which is smaller than the measurement noise 0 4 cm s indicating that the model is insensitive to cd therefore it is reasonable to use cd 1 for predictions as is generally done second the velocity predictions in the vegetated region and bare channel are sensitive to the e fold decay length ld 1 fig 10b in eq 11 u veg 0 u 0 u veg f u veg 0 is constant because uveg 0 u0 and uveg f are fixed therefore the change in ld 1 corresponds to the change in ld 2 to examine the parameter sensitivity we selected a wider range of ld 1 0 1li to 0 5li because across all cases ld 1 li ranges between approximately 0 2 and 0 5 fig 5 the predicted velocities are sensitive to ld 1 only between lu b x b li b i e 1 x b 7 between the two black dashed lines we take two values of ld 1 0 1li and 0 3li as examples in the upstream adjustment region lu a small ld 1 0 1li the blue line produces higher velocities relative to a large ld 1 0 3li the orange line in contrast in the interior adjustment region li a small ld 1 0 1li the blue line corresponds to lower velocities compared to a large ld 1 0 3li the orange line moreover inside a patch a small ld 1 e g ld 1 0 1li the blue line produces a shorter interior adjustment length li 2b that does not match the measured li 7b in contrast a large ld 1 e g ld 1 0 3li the orange line produces a longer interior adjustment length li 7 7b that is close to the measurement 7b based on the predicted velocities the length of the interior adjustment region li can be predicted and used to evaluate whether the selected ratio ld 1 li is appropriate for example in fig 10b the predicted velocity profile presents li 5b at ld 1 0 2li the green line which was shorter than the measured one 7b but presents li 9 3b at ld 1 0 4li the red line which was longer than 7b these results indicate that ld 1 0 2li and 0 4li are not appropriate values for this case because the predicted li does not match the measurement therefore the most appropriate li is between 0 2li and 0 4li we note that ld 1 li may not be a fixed number fig 5 when performing predictions a starting value of ld 1 li 0 3 is suggested subsequently this ratio can be adjusted until the predicted li matches the measured value third the mean velocity uveg 0 at x 0 cm can significantly impact the predictions in the vegetated region and bare channel near the upstream edge of the patch x b 4 to 4 fig 10c for x b 4 to 0 a small uveg 0 0 5u0 the black line leads to a longer upstream adjustment region lu 4b relative to the measured lu b this phenomenon occurs because in eq 11 which is rewritten as l d 2 u v e g f u 0 u veg f u veg 0 1 l d 1 when ld 1 u0 and uveg f are fixed and an underestimated uveg 0 produces a greater ld 2 leading to a longer lu 4b which does not agree with the measured lu b however when uveg 0 0 8u0 is used the predicted velocity profile provides lu b which is the same as the measured lu b based on these findings we reiterate the importance of choosing an appropriate value for uveg 0 a measured uveg 0 at the upstream edge of a patch is the first choice otherwise eq 3 can be used to predict uveg 0 for the patch with 0 cdab 9 0 005 ϕ 0 72 7 3 model limitations the proposed model has been verified in cases with emergent arrays of cylinders and natural rice stems o sativa over a channel blockage of b b 0 3 to 0 5 and a solid volume fraction of ϕ 0 015 to 0 1 however the model needs to be further verified beyond these ranges second o sativa has high flexural rigidity devi et al 2019 and is similar to rigid cylinders therefore in the channel with an o sativa patch the proposed model can accurately predict the longitudinal profiles of mean velocities uveg u0 and ubare u0 in the vegetated region and bare channel however if the plants in a patch have higher flexibility and more complex shapes e g shrubs yang et al 2007 the spatial heterogeneity of the flow inside the patch may be more pronounced which increases the difficulty of velocity prediction for example inside a patch more than two velocity measurements are needed in a characteristic region at each x and y position fig 1 to further eliminate flow heterogeneity moreover the mid depth velocities are no longer equal to the depth averaged velocities within a patch consisting of plants with leaves e g caroppi et al 2019 therefore the vertical profiles of velocities must be measured to calculate the depth averaged velocities third for the model patches constructed of rigid cylinders velocities over the penetration distance do not change considerably so velocities inside the patch are laterally constant see fig 2 this fact has been confirmed by previous physical experiments e g figure 3a in white and nepf 2008 and numerical simulations e g see figure 5 in huai et al 2015 we note that this fact is valid for model patches or the patches constructed of stem like plants e g natural rice stems however for the patch constructed of vegetation with a complex shape the penetration distance is determined by vegetation morphology density and flexibility e g caroppi et al 2019 and the width of the penetration distance may be different from that of a rigid cylinder array in this case the velocity in the vegetated region may no longer be constant in the lateral direction and consequently eq 8 may not be an appropriate estimator for the mean velocity of the vegetated region based on this the lateral distribution of velocity should be used to calculate the mean velocity of the vegetated region finally in this study we considered only the in line plant distribution inside a patch and did not consider patches in which plants were randomly distributed that is in each case in this study the cylinders were arranged in a staggered in line distribution see fig 1b and the distances between neighboring cylinders were fixed however in the field plants grow randomly inside a patch thus the distances between neighboring plants change randomly consequently the depth averaged velocities inside a patch with randomly distributed plants may be not laterally uniform ricardo et al 2014 shan et al 2019 contrasting with the laterally uniform velocities inside a patch with in line plant distribution e g fig 2 therefore the proposed model cannot be directly applied to patches with randomly distributed plants 8 conclusions this study characterized the longitudinal variations in velocities inside and outside a patch of emergent vegetation and proposed an exponential decay based model to predict the longitudinal profiles of the velocities inside and outside the patch based on the measured velocity profile the longitudinal transect was divided into two regions upstream of and inside the patch see section 3 3 and separate predictive equations were presented for these two regions eqs 6a and 6b in each region an e fold length scale exists in the equation the relationship between the two e fold length scales eq 11 in two regions was established based on the continuity of the velocity gradient at the upstream edge of a patch the experimental data from thirteen cases with model patches this study white and nepf 2008 zong and nepf 2011 and one case with natural rice stems devi et al 2019 were used to verify the model the predicted longitudinal velocity profiles agree well with the measurements inside and outside the patches indicating that this model is capable of accurately predicting velocity profiles in an open channel with an emergent vegetation patch credit authorship contribution statement chao liu conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing
