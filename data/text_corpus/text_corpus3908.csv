characteristics resulting in discharge of antibiotic residues into the aquatic environemt antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole tetracycline and trimethoprim have been detected with concentrations of few hundred ppb levels in municipal wwtps effluent and few hundred ppt levels in surface water and ground water chang et al 2008 gobel et al 2004 2005 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 xu et al 2015b the rise of antibiotic resistance is considered to be closely linked with the widespread use and emission of antibiotics the direct selective pressure that antibiotics exert on microorganisms promotes the development of antibiotics resistance via various mechanisms the transfer of args has long been recognized as a serious threat since it reduces our therapeutic potential against pathogens levy and marshall 2004 sefton 2002 it is suggested that the transport pathways of antibiotic resistant bacteria and the args that they carry are similar to the pathways of antibiotics and the possibility of reducing antibiotic resistance depends on the ability of humans to control the flow of active antibiotics baquero et al 2008 pruden et al 2006 a study conducted by fan and he 2011 suggests that continuous input of trace antibiotics is capable to promote args development in the initial args free activated sludge hospital wastewater is identified as an important point source for antibiotics emission into the environment and wwtps provided an optimal environment for args transfer baquero et al 2008 giuliani et al 1996 guardabassi et al 1998 hartmann et al 1998 on site removal of active antibiotics in the hospital wastewater stream before its merging into wwtps seems to be crucial for stopping the widespread of antibiotic resistance the average antibiotics level in hospital wastewater is 200 500 ppb diwan et al 2010 pena et al 2010 uv tio2 photocatalysis is reported to achieve satisfactory removal of antibiotics at these occurrence levels while one major drawback is the partial mineralization of the target antibiotics resulting in generation of intermediates during the oxidation process abellán et al 2009 amalraj appavoo et al 2014 cai and hu 2017 sirtori et al 2009 xiong and hu 2012 some follow up studies reported that there was no antibacterial activity associated with those intermediates giraldo et al 2010 xekoukoulotakis et al 2010 zuorro et al 2014 while antibacterial activity may not be the only factor triggering args development and biological process normally has a favorable condition for args transfer effective elimination of antibacterial activity in the photocatalytic process does not necessarily result in zero args development in the subsequent biological process many researchers have not addressed this point yet and to our best knowledge limited researches have ever been conducted for a long term monitoring of args development in a biological treatment unit which receives photocatalysis treated antibiotics containing wastewater sulfamethoxazole smx and trimethoprim tmp are selected as the target antibiotics due to their frequent occurrence in wwtps effluents and surface waters chang et al 2008 gobel et al 2004 2005 and detection of their corresponding args in wastewaters surface waters and wwtps phuong hoa et al 2008 szczepanowski et al 2009 xu et al 2015a furthermore it is reported in kim s study kim et al 2014 that arg transfer efficiency could be promoted at ppb levels of smx exposure the objective of the present study is to firstly access the influence of uva led tio2 photocatalysis treated antibiotics wastewater on carbon and nitrogen removal in sequencing batch reactors sbrs during a long term operation subsequently over one year monitoring of args development in sbrs microbial consortia that have been acclimated to treated and untreated antibiotics wastewater was carried out finally the present study aims to investigate the correlation between two important genetic elements class 1 integrons and plasmids and smx resistance genes suli and sulii findings of the present study provide valuable insights into effects of photocatalysis treated antibiotics wastewater on args development in biological treatment process 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents antibiotics stock solutions were prepared by using high purity smx and tmp fluka purchased from sigma aldrich non porous titanium dioxide tio2 p25 degusa ag germany was used as the photocatalyst purified water used for sample preparation was obtained from milli q water purification system millipore synergy 185 usa 2 2 photocatalysis setup photocatalytic treatments of smx and tmp solutions were conducted in a continuous photoreactor fig s1 illustrates the detail design of the photoreactor the antibiotics

a control reactor r control 2 5 l r control was seeded with activated sludge collected from a local wwtp before being inoculated to the four sbrs sludge was stabilized in r control with pure synthetic wastewater for over one year to minimize the residue antibiotic resistance existing in the wwtp the synthetic wastewater was prepared according to the composition described in a previous study fan et al 2009 during the sludge stabilization period the control reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater with half concentration to mimic the activated sludge process condition in wwtp for starting the other four sbrs synthetic wastewater with full concentration was used to represent the wastewater with relative high cod loading among the four sbrs reactors named r smx and r tmp were fed with synthetic wastewater spiked with 100 ppb smx and 100 ppb tmp respectively the other two sbrs namely r tsmx and r ttmp were fed with synthetic wastewater mixed with uva led tio2 photocatalysis treated smx and tmp solutions respectively in a 1 to 1 vol ratio influents of the five sbrs all consisted of 600 mg l cod 60 mg l nh4 n and 15 mg l po4 3 p considering the toc and tn contributed by 100 ppb smx tmp were not significant 0 047 mg l toc and 0 016 mg l from smx 0 058 mg l toc and 0 019 mg l tn from tmp with a programmable logic controller five sbrs were operated with the same condition of 7

collected from sbrs were filtered through a glass microfiber filter whatman ge for carbon and nitrogen analysis dissolved toc and tn were measured by toc analyzer with a tn measuring unit shimadzu japan nitrogen measurements in forms of no3 n no2 n nh4 n were analyzed with the ion chromatography lc20 chromatography enclosure dionex for cation analysis and the ion chromatography ics 1600 dionex

resistance genes dfrii dfrv dfr13 in five sbrs were quantified with sybr green method by real time qpcr system icycler bio rad usa text s2 in the supporting information depicts the qpcr protocol and its reaction mixture composition in the present study the described qpcr method was adopted in quantification of all type of genes to perform data normalization and confirm correct dna extraction 16s rrna gene in each dna sample was also quantified all standard curves of qpcr were constructed from serial dilutions of amplified sequences which were synthesized by integrated dna technologies singapore qpcr was performed in triplicate with a negative control in each run detail information and primers used for detected genes are presented in the supporting infrmation table s1 2 6 class 1 integrons and plasmid transfer study to monitor the transfer of class 1 integrons gene intl1 in previously extracted dna samples was quantified with the same qpcr protocol and normalized to the gene copies of 16s rrna gene table s1 summarizes the used primers for intl1 detection for plasmid transfer study laboratory strain e coli dh5α pb10 schluter 2003 was selected as the donor bacteria and its associated multidrug resistance plasmid pb10 represents the model plasmid cultivation of this e coli strain was conducted in tsb medium supplemented with 10 ppm tetracycline for 20 h at 37 c under agitation 160 rpm the overnight culture was washed twice with 10 mm mgso4 and diluted with di water to 17 108 cfu ml followed by being inoculated to five sbrs with 17 106 cfu of donor cells per ml of mixed liquid first batch of samples were collected 5 min after inoculation 1 5 ml of mixed liquid were sampled from five sbrs every 24 h for the next five days total dna extraction was performed right after each sampling dna samples were stored in 20 c before quantification of plasmid pb10 and dh5α genome in total dna by qpcr pb10 and dh5α chromosomal dna quantification were achieved with the primers described in bonot and merlin 2010 except that quantification processes were conducted with sybr green method instead of tapman method data of pb10 and dh5α were also presented in normalized form to 16s rrna gene in each set of qpcr analysis dna of non inoculated activated sludge was systematically run in parallel to act as the negative control 3 results and discussions 3 1 removal of smx and tmp by uva led tio2 photocatalysis without any ph adjustment antibiotics influents containing 100 ppb of smx and tmp were continuously pumped into the photoreactor with a tio2 loading of 0 1 g l and a constant flow rate of 24 ml min fig 1 demonstrates the photoreactor s performance in terms of smx and tmp removal at the operation time of 10 min the concentrations of smx and tmp in effluent were reduced by more than 90 during the subsequent 30 min operation the photoreactor achieved stable removal of smx and tmp and the final residual concentrations of smx and tmp were 2 3 ppb uv photocatalysis is an efficient pre treatment technology for antibiotics removal the effluent smx and tmp levels 2 3 ppb could be considered as acceptable since complete removal of the target antibiotics requires much higher energy input it is frequently reported that the residual antibacterial activity associated with the oxidation intermediates may trigger antibiotic resistance development in the biological treatment processes michael et al 2012 oh et al 2016 paul et al 2010 considering the final effluents are mixture of antibiotics residues and oxidation intermediates and the feasibility of applying uva led tio2 photocatalysis as the pre treatment process for antibiotics control treated antibiotics solutions were mixed with synthetic wastewater and fed into sbr systems r tsmx and r ttmp for monitoring its potential effects on sbr performance and args development 3 2 sbr performance with different feed waters after over one year sludge stabilization r smx 100 ppb smx and r tmp 100 ppb tmp were started with the same seeding from r control and they were all fed with 112 5 mg l toc and 30 mg l nh4 n for the first 30 days to mimic the activated sludge process condition in the local wwtp fig 2 shows toc and tn values in daily effluents of five sbrs during the first 30 day operation the average effluent toc and tn concentrations were around 3 mg l and 15 mg l respectively after doubling the loading of toc and tn on day 34 r control r smx and r tmp reached steady states on day 46 during the next 100 day operation r control r smx and r tmp shared similar and stable toc and tn removal profiles t test p 0 05 r tsmx treated smx wastewater and r ttmp treated tmp wastewater were seeded with the sludge from r control and started on day 148 their feed water was prepared by mixing corresponding photocatalysis treated antibiotics smx tmp solution with synthetic wastewater in a 1 to 1 vol ratio which resulted in two times dilution of the residue antibiotics and intermediates the influent toc and tn levels of r tsmx and r ttmp remained the same with the other three sbrs according to fig 2 during the last 60 day operation r tsmx and r ttmp obtained similar effluent toc 2 6 mg l and tn 15 30 mg l levels compared to the other three sbrs t test p 0 05 to take a more close observation carbon and nitrogen concentration dynamics within one sbr operation cycle during steady states are presented in fig 3 during the feeding step due to dilution of the influent with sbr sludge the detected initial concentrations of nh4 n 60 ppm and toc 225 ppm in all sbr systems were below the influent levels nh4 n concentrations in five sbrs all decreased rapidly during the first 2 h of sbr operation and afterwards constantly remained undetectable as an intermediate during nitrification and denitrification processes no2 n retained negligible concentration along the sbr operation and did not accumulate in the effluents of the five sbrs influent toc was mostly removed within the first 2 h residual toc levels in five sbrs were all below 10 ppm for the next 5 h of sbr operation similar 100 day toc and tn removal profiles shared by r control r smx and r tmp indicated that addition of 100 ppb smx tmp did not inhibit toc and tn removal collado et al 2013 also reported that 2 month operation with additional 50 ppb smx did not adversely affect cod and nitrogen removals in sbr system during the last 60 days operation r tsmx and r ttmp were able to deliver satisfactory toc and tn removals of the photocatalysis treated smx tmp containing wastewater similar results were also reported in other studies chan et al 2004 elmolla and chaudhuri 2011 where photocatalytic decomposed antibiotics did not inhibit nutrient removals in sbr systems the one cycle nitrogen and carbon dynamics of the five sbrs further confirmed that neither 100 ppb smx tmp nor degraded smx tmp inhibited the sbr performance it was noted that tn and no3 n levels in five sbrs tended to be stable after 3 h of sbr operation which indicated that denitrification process did not occur due to lack of anoxic condition during the sbr operation 3 3 args development in five sbrs smx suli sulii suliii and tmp dfrii dfrv dfr13 resistance genes were firstly screened in freshly collected activated sludge samples on feb 2013 all target genes were detected and suli gene possessed the highest abundance after one year sludge stabilization in r control without any antibiotics input suliii dfrii and dfr13 genes disappeared while the other three args remained detectable with reduced level in the stabilized sludge suli and sulii genes were constantly detected in the control reactor and suli gene always obtained higher abundance dfrv gene had extremely low abundance in the stabilized sludge and it disappeared from r control sludge in the eighth month operation after the one year sludge stabilization table 1 and fig 4 wwtp is considered as one main hotspot for args dissemination czekalski et al 2012 xu et al 2015a the purpose of sludge stabilization is to minimize the levels and interference of existing args in order to easily assess influence of the additional 100 ppb smx tmp and degraded smx tmp the args data collected during the sludge stabilization period suggest that for different types of developed args their required disappearing period under zero selective pressure condition could vary and the persistence of the six args in sbr microbial consortia could be proposed in an order of suli sulii dfrv suliii dfrii and dfr13 r smx and r tmp were started after sludge stabilization on apr 2014 r tsmx and r ttmp were started five months later on sep 2014 after 8 month continuous addition of 100 ppb smx tmp and 3 month feeding of photocatalysis treated smx tmp containing wastewater args screening in the five sbrs was conducted for six times spreading over jan 2015 and the six data sets demonstrated similar args expression profiles table 1 suli and sulii genes were detected in all sbrs microbial consortia dfrv gene was only detectable in r tmp suliii dfrii and dfr13 genes did not recover in any sbr systems regardless of continuous addition of 100 ppb smx tmp args monitoring in the five sbrs was conducted for six times in a month until june 2015 for easy comparison of suli sulii and dfrv genes absolute abundance quantified args copies in january march april may and jun were normalized to 16s rrna gene copies and presented in logarithmic form fig 5 in all data sets suli gene was constantly observed as the most abundant arg and its absolute amount in five sbrs was not significantly different sulii gene exhibited different occurrence in the five sbrs it was constantly quantified with highest level in r smx compared to the other four sbrs the average amount of sulii gene in r smx was more than 40 and 6 times higher than that in r control and r tsmx respectively in jan 2015 r tsmx obtained higher levels of sulii gene than r control while the next 4 month args data demonstrated relatively lower levels of sulii gene in r tsmx comparing to r control during the half year args monitoring dfrv gene was only detectable in r tmp and it was always the least abundant one significant antibiotic resistance generation in a biological treatment unit typically requires an average period of one year aydin et al 2015 fan and he 2011 thus in the present study long term monitoring of args development in the sbr systems is a crucial step for confirming the feasibility of applying uv photocatalysis a pre treatment process for antibiotics control during the six month args monitoring selective pressure exerted by 100 ppb smx did not exhibit significant enhancement of suli generation in r smx and controlling of smx input was not able to achieve satisfactory reduction of suli gene in r tsmx this phenomenon could be due to the reported persistency of suli gene bean et al 2005 with 97 reduction in usage of sulphonamide drugs in 1991 suli resistance percentage in 2004 21 2 were still comparable to that in 1991 16 4 this fact could be explained as the suli gene is typically associated with class 1 integrons located in mobilized broad host range plasmids that can disseminate very efficiently in the microbial consortia gao et al 2012 sköld 2000 continuous addition of 100 ppb smx significantly promoted sulii gene development in r smx and controlling of smx input successfully reduced the level of sulii gene in r tsmx by more than 83 r control was continuously operated with zero selective pressure slightly promoted generation of sulii gene in r tsmx in jan 2015 could be due to the retained selective pressure from the degraded smx however data sets in next four months all demonstrated lower levels of sulii gene in r tsmx comparing to r control which further suggested that photocatalytic degraded smx did not promote sulii gene expression in r tsmx controlling of tmp input achieved 100 removal of dfrv gene in r ttmp and photocatalytic degraded tmp did not trigger any development of tmp resistance in r ttmp antibiotics have long been recognized as a driving force for args development in microbial communities either by exerting selective pressure or by stimulating the transfer of mobile elements which are responsible for corresponding args dissemination beaber et al 2004 showsh and andrews 1992 with continuous exposure to 100 ppb smx for over one year sulii gene obtained more significant development in r smx microbial consortia when comparing to suli gene similar situation occurred in r tsmx treated smx wastewater with reduced selective pressure achieved much higher removal efficiency of sulii gene than suli gene it was reported that suli and sulii genes may associate with different mobile genetic elements for their transfer purpose and this could be the reason why these two args responded differently under the same selective pressure suli gene was typically associated with class 1 integrons aminov and mackie 2007 and sulii genes was often found on a broad host range of plasmids smalla et al 2000 variation of selective pressure may affect the expression of these two genetic elements to different extent resulting in distinct behavior of suli and sulii genes in terms of their development and reduction 3 4 presence of class 1 integrons gene intl1 in five sbrs and its correlation with sul genes the class 1 integrons gene intl1 was monitored in five sbr systems during january of 2015 the normalized gene copies of suli sulii and intl1 are shown in fig 6 selective pressure exerted by 100 ppb smx achieved more significant promotion of intl1 gene than 100 ppb tmp as intl1 gene obtained much larger amount in r smx comparing to r tmp meanwhile controlling of smx and tmp input achieved around 3 log and 1 log unit removal of intl1 gene in r tsmx and r ttmp respectively the quantity of suli and intl1 genes in r smx was both approximately 3 times above the average level in the other four reactors while sulii gene exhibited much greater difference of 40 times higher in r smx comparing to the average level in the other four reactors regression analysis of 21 data sets was conducted between intl1 and individual sul genes suli and sulii in terms of their quantities in five sbrs fig 7 suggests a significant correlation between intl1 and suli genes at the level of p 0 01 r 0 94 and sulii associated with intl1 in a poorer correlation r 0 44 p 0 045 previous studies chen et al 2015 ma et al 2011 also reported significant correlation between intl1 and suli genes in terms of their environmental presence this is expected since both intl1 and suli genes are found in the conserved region of class 1 integrons and the whole integron gene cassettes system acts as an important carrier for suli dissemination in the environment bennett 2008 the class 1 integrons play an important role in horizontal gene transfer it is reported to carry one or more gene cassettes that may encode with multiple antibiotics resistance hall and collis 1998 the present study demonstrated that development of intl1 gene was positively related with the exerted selective pressure and controlling of active antibiotics was able to inhibit intl1 gene generation in addition selective pressure exerted by different antibiotics may trigger various responses from intl1 gene as the present study shown that 100 ppb smx promoted intl1 generation more significantly than 100 ppb tmp good correlation between suli and intl1 genes suggests that dissemination of suli gene in the environment may closely associate with intl1 gene and suli will consistently become more abundant with the enrichment of intl1 sulii gene has not been reported in the sequence of class 1 integrons while they may both imbed in the same mobile genetic elements e g plasmids cain et al 2010 thus sulii gene may partially correlate with intl1 gene in the environment the behavior of intl1 gene would provide valuable insight into certain args dissemination potential and controlling of the right or right groups of active antibiotics would be crucial for preventing args development 3 5 plasmid transfer efficiency in five sbrs and its correlation with sul genes the dissemination and or the persistence of pb10 and its carrier e coli dh5α in five sbrs were investigated qpcr quantifications of their corresponding sequence fragments were conducted for five days after the inoculation according to fig 8 in all sbr systems the amount of dh5α dna firstly increased to maximum in 48 h followed by a decline in 72 h and became undetectable afterwards plasmid pb10 seemed to keep the same variation pace with dh5α dna expect for its presence in r smx during the whole testing period after inoculation pb10 acquired the highest abundance in r smx and it still remained detectable after 96 h when e coli dh5α totally disappeared from r smx plasmids are considered as a major player in args dissemination hawkey and jones 2009 the transfer efficiency of a certain plasmid could be affected by numerous environmental factors such as temperature ph nutrient conditions agitation and presence of suspended matter inoue et al 2005 soda et al 2008 incp 1β plasmid pb10 was selected as the model due to its reported adaptability in the activated sludge environment and high conjugation efficiency droge et al 2000 considering conjugation happen intercellularly any conjugative transfer shall be reflected by increasing ratio between plasmid and carrier bacteria conversely without any conjugation event the ratio between plasmid and donor should remain stable in the microbial consortia of r smx the relative abundance of pb10 to dh5α dna kept increasing until 72 h during the following 2 days pb10 was still detectable in absence of dh5α chromosomal dna indicating pb10 s invasion to the indigenous population in the other four sbr systems pb10 either persisted in stable ratio with dh5α dna r ttmp or disappeared together with the donor bacteria strain the results suggested that transfer of plasmid pb10 was only successfully enhanced in r smx a previous study kim et al 2014 reported enhanced pb10 plasmid transfer rates in activated sludge with presence of 10 1000 ppb smx according to another study salcedo et al 2015 ppb levels of antibiotics induced biofilm formation in the mixed cultures of e coli and p aeruginosa and promoted pb10 plasmid transfer rates after inoculation of e coli dh5α into five sbrs amounts of suli and sulii genes were also quantified during the testing period fig 8 expressions of suli gene in five sbrs along the inoculation time did not obviously match with the expression pattern of pb10 in most of the time r smx acquired relatively higher amount of suli gene that was stable along the inoculation time suli levels in r control r tsmx r tmp and r ttmp were not significantly reduced even though there were no enhanced plasmid transfer activities in their microbial consortia unlike suli gene sulii gene expressed similar pattern with pb10 in terms of their absolute abundance in r smx after the inoculation time in absence of effective plasmid transfer the expressions of sulii gene in r control r tmp r tsmx and r ttmp were significantly inhibited conversely due to effective plasmid transfer in r smx sulii gene constantly obtained highest abundance in its microbial consortia during the five days testing by conducting regression analysis of 31 data sets fig 9 suggests that sulii gene correlated well with pb10 r 0 87 p 2 442e 10 in terms of their presence in the sbr systems and suli gene associated with pb10 in a poorer correlation r 0 26 p 0 15 both suli and sulii genes are plasmid borne sulfonamide resistance genes plasmid transfer study demonstrated that enhanced plasmid transfer did not result in promoted development of suli gene and inhibited plasmid transfer was not able to achieve significant removal of suli gene as previously mentioned suli located at the converse region of class 1 integrons and integrons are common in various dna materials including chromosomes plasmids and transposons hall and collis 1995 partridge et al 2009 being one major mobilizable genetic element for bacterial conjugation transposon may also play a role for suli dissemination salyers et al 1995 thus even the plasmid transfer was inhibited by controlling of smx and tmp input suli gene was not effectively removed from the microbial consortia due to its inherent persistence and alternative transfer mechanism among the five sbrs r smx constantly acquired highest level of sulii gene and it was also the only reactor that had effective plasmid transfer in its microbial consortia positive correlation between sulii gene and pb10 revealed that effective plasmid transfer might be the reason for dramatic promotion of sulii generation based on the data collected from the other four sbr systems controlling of smx input was able to effectively slow down the plasmid transfer efficiency concomitantly inhibited the expression of sulii gene in the microbial consortia 4 conclusions the developed uva led tio2 continuous photoreactor was able to achieve more than 90 removal of smx and tmp constantly effluent quality data revealed that toc and tn removal in the sbrs were not adversely affected by the residual antibiotics and intermediates in the aspect of args dissemination the treated smx and tmp wastewaters did not promote any generation of their corresponding resistance genes furthermore an over one year monitoring demonstrated that controlling of smx and tmp input achieved significant removal of sulii and dfrv genes from the sbr systems different args may possess distinct persistence and in the present study suli was identified as the most persistent arg existing in the sbr microbial consortia last part of this study proved that controlling of smx and tmp input effectively inhibited the expression of class 1 integrons and plasmid transfer class 1 integrons and plasmid transfer efficiency correlated well with suli and sulii genes respectively due to the strong persistence controlling of smx input was not able to achieve sufficient removal of suli gene while sulii gene was significantly removed in r tsmx considering as a whole the present study suggests that uv photocatalysis might be a feasible pre treatment technology for antibiotics control acknowledgement the authors would like to thank for the financial support provided by environment

rise of antibiotic resistance is considered to be closely linked with the widespread use and emission of antibiotics the direct selective pressure that antibiotics exert on microorganisms promotes the development of antibiotics resistance via various mechanisms the transfer of args has long been recognized as a serious threat since it reduces our therapeutic potential against pathogens levy and marshall 2004 sefton 2002 it is suggested that the transport pathways of antibiotic resistant bacteria and the args that they carry are similar to the pathways of antibiotics and the possibility of reducing antibiotic resistance depends on the ability of humans to control the flow of active antibiotics baquero et al 2008 pruden et al 2006 a study conducted by fan and he 2011 suggests that continuous input of trace antibiotics is capable to promote args development in the initial args free activated sludge hospital wastewater is identified as an important point source for antibiotics emission into the environment and wwtps provided an optimal environment for args transfer baquero et al 2008 giuliani et al 1996 guardabassi et al 1998 hartmann et al 1998 on site removal of active antibiotics in the hospital wastewater stream before its merging into wwtps seems to be crucial for stopping the widespread of antibiotic resistance the average antibiotics level in hospital wastewater is 200 500 ppb diwan et al 2010 pena et al 2010 uv tio2 photocatalysis is reported to achieve satisfactory removal of antibiotics at these occurrence levels while one major drawback is the partial mineralization of the target antibiotics resulting in generation of intermediates during the oxidation process abellán et al 2009 amalraj appavoo et al 2014 cai and hu 2017 sirtori et al 2009 xiong and hu 2012 some follow up studies reported that there was no antibacterial activity associated with those intermediates giraldo et al 2010 xekoukoulotakis et al 2010 zuorro et al 2014 while antibacterial activity may not be the only factor triggering args development and biological process normally has a favorable condition for args transfer effective elimination of antibacterial activity in the photocatalytic process does not necessarily result in zero args development in the subsequent biological process many researchers have not addressed this point yet and to our best knowledge limited researches have ever been conducted for a long term monitoring of args development in a biological treatment unit which receives photocatalysis treated antibiotics containing wastewater sulfamethoxazole smx and trimethoprim tmp are selected as the target antibiotics due to their frequent occurrence in wwtps effluents and surface waters chang et al 2008 gobel et al 2004 2005 and detection of their corresponding args in wastewaters surface waters and wwtps phuong hoa et al 2008 szczepanowski et al 2009 xu et al 2015a furthermore it is reported in kim s study kim et al 2014 that arg transfer efficiency could be promoted at ppb levels of smx exposure the objective of the present study is to firstly access the influence of uva led tio2 photocatalysis treated antibiotics wastewater on carbon and nitrogen removal in sequencing batch reactors sbrs during a long term operation subsequently over one year monitoring of args development in sbrs microbial consortia that have been acclimated to treated and untreated antibiotics wastewater was carried out finally the present study aims to investigate the correlation between two important genetic elements class 1 integrons and plasmids and smx resistance genes suli and sulii findings of the present study provide valuable insights into effects of photocatalysis treated antibiotics wastewater on args development in biological treatment process 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents antibiotics stock solutions were prepared by using high purity smx and tmp fluka purchased from sigma aldrich non porous titanium dioxide tio2 p25 degusa ag germany was used as the photocatalyst purified water used for sample preparation was obtained from milli q water purification system millipore synergy 185 usa 2 2 photocatalysis setup photocatalytic treatments of smx and tmp solutions were conducted in a continuous photoreactor fig s1 illustrates the detail design of the photoreactor the antibiotics influents were prepared by mixing antibiotics solutions with tio2 in dark condition for 30 min antibiotics influents were firstly pumped into the photoreactor with air purging for one hydraulic retention time hrt until effluents reached the outlet side uva led lamps were subsequently turned on to initiate the photocatalytic reaction the system flow rate was 24 ml min operation temperature

a control reactor r control 2 5 l r control was seeded with activated sludge collected from a local wwtp before being inoculated to the four sbrs sludge was stabilized in r control with pure synthetic wastewater for over one year to minimize the residue antibiotic resistance existing in the wwtp the synthetic wastewater was prepared according to the composition described in a previous study fan et al 2009 during the sludge stabilization period the control reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater with half concentration to mimic the activated sludge process condition in wwtp for starting the other four sbrs synthetic wastewater with full concentration was used to represent the wastewater with relative high cod loading among the four sbrs reactors named r smx and r tmp were fed with synthetic wastewater spiked with 100 ppb smx and 100 ppb tmp respectively the other two sbrs namely r tsmx and r ttmp were fed with synthetic wastewater mixed with uva led tio2 photocatalysis treated smx and tmp solutions respectively in a 1 to 1 vol ratio influents of the five sbrs all consisted of 600 mg l cod 60 mg l nh4 n and 15 mg l po4 3 p considering the toc and tn contributed by 100 ppb smx tmp were not significant 0 047 mg l toc and 0 016 mg l from smx 0 058 mg l toc and 0 019 mg l tn from tmp with a programmable logic controller five sbrs were operated with the same condition of 7

collected from sbrs were filtered through a glass microfiber filter whatman ge for carbon and nitrogen analysis dissolved toc and tn were measured by toc analyzer with a tn measuring unit shimadzu japan nitrogen measurements in forms of no3 n no2 n nh4 n were analyzed with the ion chromatography lc20 chromatography enclosure dionex for cation analysis and the ion chromatography ics 1600 dionex

resistance genes dfrii dfrv dfr13 in five sbrs were quantified with sybr green method by real time qpcr system icycler bio rad usa text s2 in the supporting information depicts the qpcr protocol and its reaction mixture composition in the present study the described qpcr method was adopted in quantification of all type of genes to perform data normalization and confirm correct dna extraction 16s rrna gene in each dna sample was also quantified all standard curves of qpcr were constructed from serial dilutions of amplified sequences which were synthesized by integrated dna technologies singapore qpcr was performed in triplicate with a negative control in each run detail information and primers used for detected genes are presented in the supporting infrmation table s1 2 6 class 1 integrons and plasmid transfer study to monitor the transfer of class 1 integrons gene intl1 in previously extracted dna samples was quantified with the same qpcr protocol and normalized to the gene copies of 16s rrna gene table s1 summarizes the used primers for intl1 detection for plasmid transfer study laboratory strain e coli dh5α pb10 schluter 2003 was selected as the donor bacteria and its associated multidrug resistance plasmid pb10 represents the model plasmid cultivation of this e coli strain was conducted in tsb medium supplemented with 10 ppm tetracycline for 20 h at 37 c under agitation 160 rpm the overnight culture was washed twice with 10 mm mgso4 and diluted with di water to 17 108 cfu ml followed by being inoculated to five sbrs with 17 106 cfu of donor cells per ml of mixed liquid first batch of samples were collected 5 min after inoculation 1 5 ml of mixed liquid were sampled from five sbrs every 24 h for the next five days total dna extraction was performed right after each sampling dna samples were stored in 20 c before quantification of plasmid pb10 and dh5α genome in total dna by qpcr pb10 and dh5α chromosomal dna quantification were achieved with the primers described in bonot and merlin 2010 except that quantification processes were conducted with sybr green method instead of tapman method data of pb10 and dh5α were also presented in normalized form to 16s rrna gene in each set of qpcr analysis dna of non inoculated activated sludge was systematically run in parallel to act as the negative control 3 results and discussions 3 1 removal of smx and tmp by uva led tio2 photocatalysis without any ph adjustment antibiotics influents containing 100 ppb of smx and tmp were continuously pumped into the photoreactor with a tio2 loading of 0 1 g l and a constant flow rate of 24 ml min fig 1 demonstrates the photoreactor s performance in terms of smx and tmp removal at the operation time of 10 min the concentrations of smx and tmp in effluent were reduced by more than 90 during the subsequent 30 min operation the photoreactor achieved stable removal of smx and tmp and the final residual concentrations of smx and tmp were 2 3 ppb uv photocatalysis is an efficient pre treatment technology for antibiotics removal the effluent smx and tmp levels 2 3 ppb could be considered as acceptable since complete removal of the target antibiotics requires much higher energy input it is frequently reported that the residual antibacterial activity associated with the oxidation intermediates may trigger antibiotic resistance development in the biological treatment processes michael et al 2012 oh et al 2016 paul et al 2010 considering the final effluents are mixture of antibiotics residues and oxidation intermediates and the feasibility of applying uva led tio2 photocatalysis as the pre treatment process for antibiotics control treated antibiotics solutions were mixed with synthetic wastewater and fed into sbr systems r tsmx and r ttmp for monitoring its potential effects on sbr performance and args development 3 2 sbr performance with different feed waters after over one year sludge stabilization r smx 100 ppb smx and r tmp 100 ppb tmp were started with the same seeding from r control and they were all fed with 112 5 mg l toc and 30 mg l nh4 n for the first 30 days to mimic the activated sludge process condition in the local wwtp fig 2 shows toc and tn values in daily effluents of five sbrs during the first 30 day operation the average effluent toc and tn concentrations were around 3 mg l and 15 mg l respectively after doubling the loading of toc and tn on day 34 r control r smx and r tmp reached steady states on day 46 during the next 100 day operation r control r smx and r tmp shared similar and stable toc and tn removal profiles t test p 0 05 r tsmx treated smx wastewater and r ttmp treated tmp wastewater were seeded with the sludge from r control and started on day 148 their feed water was prepared by mixing corresponding photocatalysis treated antibiotics smx tmp solution with synthetic wastewater in a 1 to 1 vol ratio which resulted in two times dilution of the residue antibiotics and intermediates the influent toc and tn levels of r tsmx and r ttmp remained the same with the other three sbrs according to fig 2 during the last 60 day operation r tsmx and r ttmp obtained similar effluent toc 2 6 mg l and tn 15 30 mg l levels compared to the other three sbrs t test p 0 05 to take a more close observation carbon and nitrogen concentration dynamics within one sbr operation cycle during steady states are presented in fig 3 during the feeding step due to dilution of the influent with sbr sludge the detected initial concentrations of nh4 n 60 ppm and toc 225 ppm in all sbr systems were below the influent levels nh4 n concentrations in five sbrs all decreased rapidly during the first 2 h of sbr operation and afterwards constantly remained undetectable as an intermediate during nitrification and denitrification processes no2 n retained negligible concentration along the sbr operation and did not accumulate in the effluents of the five sbrs influent toc was mostly removed within the first 2 h residual toc levels in five sbrs were all below 10 ppm for the next 5 h of sbr operation similar 100 day toc and tn removal profiles shared by r control r smx and r tmp indicated that addition of 100 ppb smx tmp did not inhibit toc and tn removal collado et al 2013 also reported that 2 month operation with additional 50 ppb smx did not adversely affect cod and nitrogen removals in sbr system during the last 60 days operation r tsmx and r ttmp were able to deliver satisfactory toc and tn removals of the photocatalysis treated smx tmp containing wastewater similar results were also reported in other studies chan et al 2004 elmolla and chaudhuri 2011 where photocatalytic decomposed antibiotics did not inhibit nutrient removals in sbr systems the one cycle nitrogen and carbon dynamics of the five sbrs further confirmed that neither 100 ppb smx tmp nor degraded smx tmp inhibited the sbr performance it was noted that tn and no3 n levels in five sbrs tended to be stable after 3 h of sbr operation which indicated that denitrification process did not occur due to lack of anoxic condition during the sbr operation 3 3 args development in five sbrs smx suli sulii suliii and tmp dfrii dfrv dfr13 resistance genes were firstly screened in freshly collected activated sludge samples on feb 2013 all target genes were detected and suli gene possessed the highest abundance after one year sludge stabilization in r control without any antibiotics input suliii dfrii and dfr13 genes disappeared while the other three args remained detectable with reduced level in the stabilized sludge suli and sulii genes were constantly detected in the control reactor and suli gene always obtained higher abundance dfrv gene had extremely low abundance in the stabilized sludge and it disappeared from r control sludge in the eighth month operation after the one year sludge stabilization table 1 and fig 4 wwtp is considered as one main hotspot for args dissemination czekalski et al 2012 xu et al 2015a the purpose of sludge stabilization is to minimize the levels and interference of existing args in order to easily assess influence of the additional 100 ppb smx tmp and degraded smx tmp the args data collected during the sludge stabilization period suggest that for different types of developed args their required disappearing period under zero selective pressure condition could vary and the persistence of the six args in sbr microbial consortia could be proposed in an order of suli sulii dfrv suliii dfrii and dfr13 r smx and r tmp were started after sludge stabilization on apr 2014 r tsmx and r ttmp were started five months later on sep 2014 after 8 month continuous addition of 100 ppb smx tmp and 3 month feeding of photocatalysis treated smx tmp containing wastewater args screening in the five sbrs was conducted for six times spreading over jan 2015 and the six data sets demonstrated similar args expression profiles table 1 suli and sulii genes were detected in all sbrs microbial consortia dfrv gene was only detectable in r tmp suliii dfrii and dfr13 genes did not recover in any sbr systems regardless of continuous addition of 100 ppb smx tmp args monitoring in the five sbrs was conducted for six times in a month until june 2015 for easy comparison of suli sulii and dfrv genes absolute abundance quantified args copies in january march april may and jun were normalized to 16s rrna gene copies and presented in logarithmic form fig 5 in all data sets suli gene was constantly observed as the most abundant arg and its absolute amount in five sbrs was not significantly different sulii gene exhibited different occurrence in the five sbrs it was constantly quantified with highest level in r smx compared to the other four sbrs the average amount of sulii gene in r smx was more than 40 and 6 times higher than that in r control and r tsmx respectively in jan 2015 r tsmx obtained higher levels of sulii gene than r control while the next 4 month args data demonstrated relatively lower levels of sulii gene in r tsmx comparing to r control during the half year args monitoring dfrv gene was only detectable in r tmp and it was always the least abundant one significant antibiotic resistance generation in a biological treatment unit typically requires an average period of one year aydin et al 2015 fan and he 2011 thus in the present study long term monitoring of args development in the sbr systems is a crucial step for confirming the feasibility of applying uv photocatalysis a pre treatment process for antibiotics control during the six month args monitoring selective pressure exerted by 100 ppb smx did not exhibit significant enhancement of suli generation in r smx and controlling of smx input was not able to achieve satisfactory reduction of suli gene in r tsmx this phenomenon could be due to the reported persistency of suli gene bean et al 2005 with 97 reduction in usage of sulphonamide drugs in 1991 suli resistance percentage in 2004 21 2 were still comparable to that in 1991 16 4 this fact could be explained as the suli gene is typically associated with class 1 integrons located in mobilized broad host range plasmids that can disseminate very efficiently in the microbial consortia gao et al 2012 sköld 2000 continuous addition of 100 ppb smx significantly promoted sulii gene development in r smx and controlling of smx input successfully reduced the level of sulii gene in r tsmx by more than 83 r control was continuously operated with zero selective pressure slightly promoted generation of sulii gene in r tsmx in jan 2015 could be due to the retained selective pressure from the degraded smx however data sets in next four months all demonstrated lower levels of sulii gene in r tsmx comparing to r control which further suggested that photocatalytic degraded smx did not promote sulii gene expression in r tsmx controlling of tmp input achieved 100 removal of dfrv gene in r ttmp and photocatalytic degraded tmp did not trigger any development of tmp resistance in r ttmp antibiotics have long been recognized as a driving force for args development in microbial communities either by exerting selective pressure or by stimulating the transfer of mobile elements which are responsible for corresponding args dissemination beaber et al 2004 showsh and andrews 1992 with continuous exposure to 100 ppb smx for over one year sulii gene obtained more significant development in r smx microbial consortia when comparing to suli gene similar situation occurred in r tsmx treated smx wastewater with reduced selective pressure achieved much higher removal efficiency of sulii gene than suli gene it was reported that suli and sulii genes may associate with different mobile genetic elements for their transfer purpose and this could be the reason why these two args responded differently under the same selective pressure suli gene was typically associated with class 1 integrons aminov and mackie 2007 and sulii genes was often found on a broad host range of plasmids smalla et al 2000 variation of selective pressure may affect the expression of these two genetic elements to different extent resulting in distinct behavior of suli and sulii genes in terms of their development and reduction 3 4 presence of class 1 integrons gene intl1 in five sbrs and its correlation with sul genes the class 1 integrons gene intl1 was monitored in five sbr systems during january of 2015 the normalized gene copies of suli sulii and intl1 are shown in fig 6 selective pressure exerted by 100 ppb smx achieved more significant promotion of intl1 gene than 100 ppb tmp as intl1 gene obtained much larger amount in r smx comparing to r tmp meanwhile controlling of smx and tmp input achieved around 3 log and 1 log unit removal of intl1 gene in r tsmx and r ttmp respectively the quantity of suli and intl1 genes in r smx was both approximately 3 times above the average level in the other four reactors while sulii gene exhibited much greater difference of 40 times higher in r smx comparing to the average level in the other four reactors regression analysis of 21 data sets was conducted between intl1 and individual sul genes suli and sulii in terms of their quantities in five sbrs fig 7 suggests a significant correlation between intl1 and suli genes at the level of p 0 01 r 0 94 and sulii associated with intl1 in a poorer correlation r 0 44 p 0 045 previous studies chen et al 2015 ma et al 2011 also reported significant correlation between intl1 and suli genes in terms of their environmental presence this is expected since both intl1 and suli genes are found in the conserved region of class 1 integrons and the whole integron gene cassettes system acts as an important carrier for suli dissemination in the environment bennett 2008 the class 1 integrons play an important role in horizontal gene transfer it is reported to carry one or more gene cassettes that may encode with multiple antibiotics resistance hall and collis 1998 the present study demonstrated that development of intl1 gene was positively related with the exerted selective pressure and controlling of active antibiotics was able to inhibit intl1 gene generation in addition selective pressure exerted by different antibiotics may trigger various responses from intl1 gene as the present study shown that 100 ppb smx promoted intl1 generation more significantly than 100 ppb tmp good correlation between suli and intl1 genes suggests that dissemination of suli gene in the environment may closely associate with intl1 gene and suli will consistently become more abundant with the enrichment of intl1 sulii gene has not been reported in the sequence of class 1 integrons while they may both imbed in the same mobile genetic elements e g plasmids cain et al 2010 thus sulii gene may partially correlate with intl1 gene in the environment the behavior of intl1 gene would provide valuable insight into certain args dissemination potential and controlling of the right or right groups of active antibiotics would be crucial for preventing args development 3 5 plasmid transfer efficiency in five sbrs and its correlation with sul genes the dissemination and or the persistence of pb10 and its carrier e coli dh5α in five sbrs were investigated qpcr quantifications of their corresponding sequence fragments were conducted for five days after the inoculation according to fig 8 in all sbr systems the amount of dh5α dna firstly increased to maximum in 48 h followed by a decline in 72 h and became undetectable afterwards plasmid pb10 seemed to keep the same variation pace with dh5α dna expect for its presence in r smx during the whole testing period after inoculation pb10 acquired the highest abundance in r smx and it still remained detectable after 96 h when e coli dh5α totally disappeared from r smx plasmids are considered as a major player in args dissemination hawkey and jones 2009 the transfer efficiency of a certain plasmid could be affected by numerous environmental factors such as temperature ph nutrient conditions agitation and presence of suspended matter inoue et al 2005 soda et al 2008 incp 1β plasmid pb10 was selected as the model due to its reported adaptability in the activated sludge environment and high conjugation efficiency droge et al 2000 considering conjugation happen intercellularly any conjugative transfer shall be reflected by increasing ratio between plasmid and carrier bacteria conversely without any conjugation event the ratio between plasmid and donor should remain stable in the microbial consortia of r smx the relative abundance of pb10 to dh5α dna kept increasing until 72 h during the following 2 days pb10 was still detectable in absence of dh5α chromosomal dna indicating pb10 s invasion to the indigenous population in the other four sbr systems pb10 either persisted in stable ratio with dh5α dna r ttmp or disappeared together with the donor bacteria strain the results suggested that transfer of plasmid pb10 was only successfully enhanced in r smx a previous study kim et al 2014 reported enhanced pb10 plasmid transfer rates in activated sludge with presence of 10 1000 ppb smx according to another study salcedo et al 2015 ppb levels of antibiotics induced biofilm formation in the mixed cultures of e coli and p aeruginosa and promoted pb10 plasmid transfer rates after inoculation of e coli dh5α into five sbrs amounts of suli and sulii genes were also quantified during the testing period fig 8 expressions of suli gene in five sbrs along the inoculation time did not obviously match with the expression pattern of pb10 in most of the time r smx acquired relatively higher amount of suli gene that was stable along the inoculation time suli levels in r control r tsmx r tmp and r ttmp were not significantly reduced even though there were no enhanced plasmid transfer activities in their microbial consortia unlike suli gene sulii gene expressed similar pattern with pb10 in terms of their absolute abundance in r smx after the inoculation time in absence of effective plasmid transfer the expressions of sulii gene in r control r tmp r tsmx and r ttmp were significantly inhibited conversely due to effective plasmid transfer in r smx sulii gene constantly obtained highest abundance in its microbial consortia during the five days testing by conducting regression analysis of 31 data sets fig 9 suggests that sulii gene correlated well with pb10 r 0 87 p 2 442e 10 in terms of their presence in the sbr systems and suli gene associated with pb10 in a poorer correlation r 0 26 p 0 15 both suli and sulii genes are plasmid borne sulfonamide resistance genes plasmid transfer study demonstrated that enhanced plasmid transfer did not result in promoted development of suli gene and inhibited plasmid transfer was not able to achieve significant removal of suli gene as previously mentioned suli located at the converse region of class 1 integrons and integrons are common in various dna materials including chromosomes plasmids and transposons hall and collis 1995 partridge et al 2009 being one major mobilizable genetic element for bacterial conjugation transposon may also play a role for suli dissemination salyers et al 1995 thus even the plasmid transfer was inhibited by controlling of smx and tmp input suli gene was not effectively removed from the microbial consortia due to its inherent persistence and alternative transfer mechanism among the five sbrs r smx constantly acquired highest level of sulii gene and it was also the only reactor that had effective plasmid transfer in its microbial consortia positive correlation between sulii gene and pb10 revealed that effective plasmid transfer might be the reason for dramatic promotion of sulii generation based on the data collected from the other four sbr systems controlling of smx input was able to effectively slow down the plasmid transfer efficiency concomitantly inhibited the expression of sulii gene in the microbial consortia 4 conclusions the developed uva led tio2 continuous photoreactor was able to achieve more than 90 removal of smx and tmp constantly effluent quality data revealed that toc and tn removal in the sbrs were not adversely affected by the residual antibiotics and intermediates in the aspect of args dissemination the treated smx and tmp wastewaters did not promote any generation of their corresponding resistance genes furthermore an over one year monitoring demonstrated that controlling of smx and tmp input achieved significant removal of sulii and dfrv genes from the sbr systems different args may possess distinct persistence and in the present study suli was identified as the most persistent arg existing in the sbr microbial consortia last part of this study proved that controlling of smx and tmp input effectively inhibited the expression of class 1 integrons and plasmid transfer class 1 integrons and plasmid transfer efficiency correlated well with suli and sulii genes respectively due to the strong persistence controlling of smx input was not able to achieve sufficient removal of suli gene while sulii gene was significantly removed in r tsmx considering as a whole the present study suggests that uv photocatalysis might be a feasible pre treatment technology for antibiotics control acknowledgement the authors would like to thank for the financial support provided by environment

19541,mine drainage contaminated with metals is a major environmental threat since it is a source of water pollution with devastating effects on aquatic ecosystems conventional active treatment technologies are prohibitively expensive and so there is increasing demand to develop reliable cost effective and sustainable passive or semi passive treatment these are promising alternatives since they leverage the metabolism of microorganisms native to the disturbed site at in situ or close to in situ conditions since this is a biological approach it is not clear if semi passive treatment would be effective in remote locations with extremely cold weather such as at mines in the subarctic in this study we tested the hypothesis that sulfate reducing bacteria which are microorganisms that promote metal precipitation exist in subarctic mine environments and their activity can be stimulated by adding a readily available carbon source an experiment was setup at a closed mine in the yukon territory canada where leaching of zn and cd occurs to test if semi passive treatment could precipitate these metals and prevent further leaching from waste rock molasses as a carbon source was added to anaerobic bioreactors mimicking the belowground in situ conditions microbial community analysis confirmed that sulfate reducing bacteria became enriched in the bioreactors upon addition of molasses the population composition remained fairly stable over the 14 month operating period despite temperature shifts from 17 to 5 c sulfate reduction functionality was confirmed by quantification of the gene for dissimilatory sulfite reductase metals were removed from underground mine drainage fed into the bioreactors with zn removal efficiency varying between 20 9 in winter and 89 3 in summer and cd removal efficiency between 39 in winter and 90 5 in summer this study demonstrated that stimulation of native srb in miw was possible and that in situ semi passive treatment can be effective in removing metals despite the cold climate graphical abstract image 1 keywords semi passive treatment bioremediation subarctic zinc cadmium sulfate reducing bacteria 1 introduction on both operating and abandoned mines waste material containing sulfide minerals can under certain environmental conditions oxidize resulting in increased sulfate concentrations and mobilization metals in mine drainage baker and banfield 2003 furthermore natural sources of water seepage such as infiltration of snowmelt and rain into waste rock piles or tailings might result in metal leaching and subsequent contamination of downstream aquatic environments willow and cohen 2003 mine impacted waters miw can be acidic acid mine drainage amd or have a circum neutral ph values ranging between 6 and 9 referred to as neutral mine drainage nmd nordstrom et al 2015 nmd occurs where the waste material contains sufficient amounts of minerals capable of neutralizing any acid generated such that the ph is maintained near neutral younger et al 2002 however nmd can also contain dissolved constituents such as sulfates and metals derived from mineral sulfide oxidation nordstrom et al 2015 if the concentrations of metals and other constituents in amd and nmd remain at concentrations high enough to have an impact on aquatic environments they must be removed before release of the miw to the receiving environment currently active chemical water treatment systems are preferred technologies that are widely used for treatment of miw at operating mines pouw et al 2014 however passive and semi passive treatment systems are proposed as being more economically and environmentally favorable for implementation during mine closure passive treatment relies on natural chemical and biological processes and therefore they require little or no maintenance and energy once in operation younger et al 2002 johnson and hallberg 2005 however in practice many passive treatment systems require some periodic active management such as carbon source addition and or temperature control to sustain desired conditions and processes under these conditions they are referred to as semi passive martin et

et al 2011 sulfate reduction by srb results in the production of sulfide which in turn reacts with metal cations to form metal sulfide precipitates that lead to a decrease in dissolved metal concentrations since metal sulfides are highly insoluble and less bio available compared with other metal species such as carbonates or hydroxides that are produced in active chemical treatment metal sulfide precipitation mediated by srb is a promising approach for metal removal sheoran et al 2010 moreover many studies have demonstrated that sulfate reducing bacteria passive bioreactor treatment systems are effective at the bench and pilot scale gandy and jarvis 2012 drennan et al 2017 semi passive treatment of miw within the abandoned mine workings was being considered for implementation upon mine closure at a mine in the yukon territory due to its remote location the mine is located 354 km north of whitehorse at 63 55on and 135 23ow within the subarctic where temperatures are greater than 10 c for only one to three months of the year major concerns common to many mines in remote cold climate regions included whether native microorganisms capable of reducing sulfate and mediating the precipitation of metals would be present and whether the kinetic performance of biological water treatment at low temperatures would achieve metal removal low temperatures typically reduce the growth rate and metabolism of bacteria even those that are considered psychrophilic price and sowers 2004 in this study we report on an experiment mimicking environmental conditions of the subsurface mine workings where metal leaching was occurring to test if semi passive treatment could be implemented in the subarctic climate the study was carried out at the historic keno hill silver district where the silver king mine groundwater was contaminated with heavy metals such as zinc and cadmium based on historical measurements the miw temperature in the subsurface mine workings rarely exceeded 5 c previous static bench scale tests demonstrated that cd and zn could be removed from the miw at these temperatures upon addition of an appropriate carbon source such a molasses nielsen et al 2017 it was postulated that this was due to the activity of sulfate reducing bacteria nielsen et al 2017 therefore in order to treat the underground mine impacted water miw the operators of the mine were considering implementation of in situ semi passive biological treatment to achieve permanent closure of the mine and meet the discharge limits of their water use license the hypothesis was that introduction of a suitable carbon source into the miw would stimulate growth of microorganisms especially sulfate reducing bacteria if they were present within the native communities that would result in metal precipitation and decrease in dissolved metal concentrations to test this hypothesis two duplicate experimental semi passive 200 l bioreactors were installed at the surface on the silver king mine site to replicate the underground geologic composition by incorporating waste rocks taken from the underground tunnels and operating at the same hydraulic retention time as that for the groundwater flowing through the subsurface workings no inoculum was added and in order to stimulate bacterial growth and metabolism molasses was continuously fed into the bioreactors as the carbon source the experiment tested the feasibility of passive treatment of the miw and measured the effect of seasonal temperature changes on the extents of metal and sulfate removal additionally we performed high throughput sequencing of the phylogenetic biomarker 16s rrna gene to characterize the development of the bacterial community composition in the feed water and within the bioreactors during their operation to estimate changes in the levels of srbs during the operation of the bioreactors we used quantitative polymerase chain reaction q pcr to quantify the dissimilatory sulfite reductase gene dsrab which is a functional biomarker for sulfate reduction 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup two duplicate experimental bioreactors were installed above ground on the silver king mine site see the graphical abstract for a depiction of the experimental setup these consisted of sealed 200 l polyethylene drums the outlet pipe was installed in the top cover of the bioreactor in order to minimize headspace and keep the system anoxic water exiting the bioreactors was collected in two open top 200 l polyethylene drums respectively each bioreactor was filled with 40 l of waste rocks collected in equal amounts from two piles of material previously excavated from the silver king tunnels which corresponded to 20 v v previous laboratory tests revealed that these waste rocks had the potential for metal leaching and acid generation nielsen et al 2017 influent miw was pumped to fill up a 1000 l feed tank every two weeks from a 110 m deep borehole connected to one historically mined vein within a network of old flooded tunnels the feed tank was emptied each time before refilling miw was pumped from this feed tank into the bottom of the bioreactors and upwards through the bed of waste rock flow rate was set such that the hydraulic retention time hrt in each bioreactor was 2 weeks to reflect the hrt in the underground tunnels as estimated by the mine operator in this study molasses was chosen as the carbon source since it is inexpensive and widely available crosby s 100 natural fancy molasses crosby molasses company limited st john nb canada molasses was reported to promote srb growth by metabolism of sugars muyzer and stams 2008 and indirectly through fermentation to other carbon sources favoured by srb in several previous batch and bioreactor studies teclu et al 2009 annachhatre and suktrakoolvait 2001 zhao et al 2010 in one laboratory study molasses was found to support a diverse bacterial community zhao et al 2010 diversity in bacterial communities increases their resilience to environmental perturbations allison and martiny 2008 which is important for the reliability of bioremediation at remote minimally managed open systems such as the one used in this study molasses was fed into the bottom of the bioreactors from a continuously stirred 10 l glass bottle a timer was set to pump the molasses solution for 51 6 min every day set with a flow rate of 6 ml min in order to reach to the desired carbon concentration in the bioreactor influent the total organic carbon toc content in the molasses used in this study was

the entire apparatus was installed in an insulated shed located on the mine site adjacent to the borehole that was heated to maintain the temperature at 5 c during winter time to represent the average temperature of the underground water typical for that same period of time 2 2 bioreactor monitoring and chemical analysis samples were collected weekly from the 200 l effluent drums after stirring the

sieved to 412 μm prior to analysis the instrument was calibrated using oxalic acid dihydrate standards acs reagent sigma aldrich canada in order to predict the dominant chemical species of zn and cd formed in the bioreactors a geochemical simulation was carried out using mineql 4 6 environmental research software hallowell me u s a and the usepa thermodynamic database with input of the composition of the bioreactor effluent samples from july 7th 2016 which was the date with the highest reductions of cd and zn concentrations 2 3 biological sample collection passive samplers were used for the collection of microorganisms growing inside the bioreactors these microorganisms were assumed to represent those in biofilms attached to the actual waste rocks inside the bioreactors and that were responsible for water treatment twenty bags made with light cotton cheesecloth were filled with few grams of the same waste rock types at the same ratio as in each bioreactor these bags were suspended in the middle of each bioreactor with fish line for ease of removal at sample collection time once per month one passive sampler was collected from each bioreactor for bacterial identification immediately after collection passive samplers were frozen by immersion into liquid nitrogen in a thermo flask container 2122 thermo scientific and transported from the field to the laboratory for storage at 80 c until dna extraction after removal of passive samplers the bioreactor lids were replaced and resealed with silicone to maintain anaerobic conditions 2 4 dna extraction

diversity estimations gihring et al 2012 oksanen et al 2016 expected number of otus was estimated using the nonparametric richness estimator chao 1 chao and shen 2003 library coverage was estimated by calculating the ratio of observed to expected otu numbers observed otus chao1 coverage for all samples was above 50 of the expected otu richness which indicates adequate sequencing depth table s1 differences between the compositions of the communities beta diversity in each of the samples were performed using the metamds function from the vegan package with weighted bray curtis dissimilarity index bray and curtis 1957 oksanen et al 2016 in order to prevent biases of the beta diversity estimation due to highly abundant otus the samples were log transformed prior to the generation of the distance matrix costea et al 2014 non metric multidimensional scaling nmds ordination was used to visualize the distances between the communities based on the matrix generated with the metamds k means clustering was used to assess the number of clusters to which samples group to and analysis of molecular variance amova was used to test for the statistical significance of the grouping excoffier et al 1992 martin 2002 using the adonis function from the vegan package oksanen et al 2016 the function envfit from the package vegan was used to test for genus level groups significantly correlated with the grouping of the samples based on the nmds oksanen et al 2016 in order to study the overall bacterial community and putative associations with sulfate reducing bacteria an association network analysis on bacterial communities from the bioreactors was done using r s netassoc package version 0 6 3 with default settings morueta holme et al 2016 prior to the analysis otus not represented in at least 20 of the samples were removed to reduce noise the network was visualized and analyzed using the tidygraph and ggraph packages pedersen 2018 2 5 quantitative polymerase chain reaction quantitative pcr was performed on one sample for each month of sampling from the bioreactors and the miw regions of both the 16s rrna gene and the dsra gene were amplified using sso fast evergreen supermix qpcr kit bio rad ontario ca following the manufacturer s guidelines and 1ng ul of gdna as template amplification was done using bio rad cfx connect real time system using cfx manager version

post hoc mann whitney u test were used to determine statistical significance between copy numbers of the 16s rrna and dsra genes 3 results 3 1 chemistry of the mine impacted water during operation of the bioreactors from july 2015 to august 2016 ph of the miw influent was circum neutral varying between 6 5 and 7 1 with an average of 6 8 0 5 table 1 sulfate concentrations in the miw influent averaged 417 6 130 6 mg l over the 14 month experiment table 1 the carbon source dosing was calculated based on 426 mg l sulfate in the miw for the most part there was sufficient carbon for complete reduction of sulfate except for the month of november when the monthly average sulfate concentrations increased to 508 and 506 mg l in november and december 2015 respectively at the beginning of the experiment zn and cd concentrations in the influent were 640 4 μg l and 10 5 μg l respectively fig 1 which were within the ranges of historical values personal communication with mine personnel subsequently their concentrations fluctuated and generally diminished due to changes in the underground water balance resulting from discontinuous pumping of the water from the borehole changing water levels and seasonal changes in precipitation zinc concentration in the miw remained relatively stable until early september 2015 when it increased up to a maximum of 915 1 μg l then it decreased to a minimum concentration of 207 5 μg l in may 2016 increasing again to a new maximum concentration of 531 3 μg l in august 2016 similarly cd concentrations reached maxima of 14 6 μg l and 12 6 μg l in mid august 2015 and at the onset of summer 2016 respectively while decreasing below 4 1 μg l during the winter and spring months the miw had an average ca concentration of 152 3 42 7 mg l which was unlikely to contribute to removal of sulfate under the conditions in the bioreactors fajtl et al 2002 the miw temperature remained fairly stable over the experimental period with an average of 3 1 0 9 c and was only slightly warmer during summer than winter temperatures within the bioreactors were higher than in the miw since they were subjected to warming from the air during their two week hrt and ranged between 4 c and 17 5 c depending on season fig 2 3 2 sulfate removal sulfate reduction in both bioreactors appeared to be correlated with temperature fig 2 the highest sulfate reduction rates 50 were observed during the months of july and august 2015 and during june to august of 2016 when the internal temperatures of the bioreactors were greater than 15 c fig 2 one notable exception was for bioreactor 1 in september 2015 when greater than 70 sulfate reduction was achieved despite a temperature lower than 7 c bioreactor 1 achieved the highest sulfate removal extent of 91 9 during august 2016 when temperatures in both bioreactors decreased the percent of sulfate removed decreased as well this was especially apparent during the fall and winter months between october 2015 and february 2016 when the average monthly temperatures inside the bioreactors ranged between 3 5 1 4 c and 8 0 c respectively and the measured percent of sulfate reduced fluctuated between 0 and 37 5 fig 2 a statistically significant positive correlation between sulfate reduction and temperature was detected using monthly averaged sulfate concentrations in bioreactor 2 rs 0 64 p value 0 05 orp measured during february 2016 when temperatures were 5 3 1 0 c in br1 and 5 5 0 9 c in br2 was 28 mv and 46 mv respectively in br1 and br2 when temperatures increased during springtime and summer to 12 3 c may 2016 in br1 and 15 6 1 7 c july 2016 in br2 the orp decreased to 162 8 56 9 mv for br1 and 199 74 mv optimal orp values for srb to catabolize sulfates and release sulfides is in the range of 100 to 300 mv gloyna 1971 gibert et al 2002 harerimana et al 2010 hence decreased orp results observed in summer may be attributed to an increase in srb activity geochemical modeling with mineql predicted that under these conditions 97 of the cd precipitates as cd hs 4 2 and 87 of the zn precipitates in the form zns sphalerite table s2 this suggests that these metals were precipitated mainly in the form of sulfides in the bioreactors 3 3 carbon source consumption carbon consumption within the bioreactors was detected since the very early stages of the bioreactors operation and the extents were very similar for both bioreactors at approximately 79 by the end of july 2015 fig 3 although carbon consumption was initially high during the warmer months of 2015 during fall and winter residual carbon concentrations increased and carbon consumption decreased fig 3 interestingly there were occasions during the cold periods when carbon consumption was high for e g in november and december of 2015 and in january and april of 2016 fig 3 very little dissolved carbon entered with the miw with the exception from may to june 2016 when carbon concentrations in the miw increased from 0 12 mmol l to 2 33 mmol l fig 3 due to molasses injections into the groundwater done by the mine operators at this time personal communication despite increased carbon concentrations in the feed into the bioreactors during summer 2016 and increasing residual concentrations in the effluent of the bioreactors the carbon removal efficiency remained high in both bioreactors at 82 0 01 in july 2016 this carbon consumption observed during the summer 2016 was similar to the consumption observed in summer 2015 3 4 zinc and cadmium removal remarkably zn and cd removal were achieved in the bioreactors right after their start up fig 1 in the of summer 2015 zn and cd removal extents were 80 6 2 1 and 90 5 0 6 on average respectively for both bioreactors during which time the temperatures ranged between 10 c and 17 c fig 2 by the end of winter 2015 both bioreactors were operating at their lowest zn removal efficiency of 20 9 7 3 and cd removal efficiency of 39 9 8 zinc and cd removal extent started to increase after spring 2016 reaching 89 3 3 55 for zn and 85 5 2 2 for cd in july 2016 which were similar to the extents observed in summer 2015 3 5 characterization of the bacterial community in the mine influenced water influent and bioreactors to determine whether the semi passive treatment methodology was capable of stimulating the right functional groups of microorganisms for sustainable metal removal such as sulfate reducing bacteria all bacteria attached to the passive samplers removed from the bioreactors were identified and their relative abundance determined using high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene 3 5 1 dominant taxonomic groups present in the bioreactors since many different otus operational taxonomic units representing putative bacterial species were found in the miw and bioreactors 1173 otus comparisons were first made at the higher taxonomic level of class both bioreactors had very similar compositions of dominant class level taxonomic groups fig 4 both were dominated by members of the classes clostridia deltaproteobacteria bacterioidia and actinobacteria the miw contained bacteria also classified in these classes although members of the classes gammaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria were more relatively abundant in the miw samples than in the bioreactors furthermore members of the classes sphingobacteria and bacilli were found at relative abundances of greater than 1 of total number of sequences per sample in most of the miw samples but were very rare less than 0 1 in the bioreactors fig 4 3 5 2 putative sulfate reducers of the classes dominating the bioreactors both classes clostridia and deltaproteobacteria are the most likely to contain members capable of sulfate reduction campbell and postgate 1965 druschel et al 2004 meyer and kuever 2007 pruden et al 2007 sallam and steinbuchel 2009 lefticariu et al 2015 thus we focused further taxonomic analysis on high relative abundance otus i e those greater than 1 of the averaged total number of sequences per month per sample type that were classified as members of these class level taxonomic groups fig 5 for the entire span of the bioreactors operation putative srbs belonging to these classes ranged from 50 to 80 of the total number of sequences per month fig 5 this is with the exception of the may 2016 sample from bioreactor 1 where putative srb from these classes had relative abundance of only 15 of the total number of sequences this can be attributed to the fact that most of the sequences classified as belonging to class clostridia in that sample could not be classified beyond the order clostridiales while this order does contain members capable of reducing sulfate muyzer and stams 2008 this level of taxonomy classification is too broad to allow for any confident assertion within the deltaproteobacteria two of the high relative abundance otus otu 33 and otu 186 were classified as members of families with the potential for sulfate reduction an unclassified genus of the family desulfobacteraceae and a member of the genus desulfobulbus respectively fig 5 both of these putative sulfate reducing bacteria muyzer and stams 2008 were present in the bioreactor samples but were not detected not in the miw samples furthermore both otu 33 and 186 were present in both bioreactors throughout their operation and accounted for 2 5 30 of the total number of sequences fig 5 a desulfocapsa related otu another genus that contains potential sulfate reducers janssen et al 1996 kuever 2014 was also present only in the bioreactors and not in miw however its relative abundance was lower than 1 of the total number of sequences several otus belonging to genera within the class clostridia were detected either exclusively or in greater relative abundance in both of the bioreactors samples than in the miw fig 5 of those both otus classified as members of the genus clostridium clostridium sensu stricto and those classified as members of the genus desulfosporosinus genera with potential sulfur reducers fig 5 with the genus clostridium also containing member capable of sulfide reduction muyzer and stams 2008 takahashi et al 2010 notably two desulfosporosinus otus were present also in the miw as well as in the bioreactors fig 5 much like the otus belonging to the class deltaproteobacteria these otus accounted for a large proportion of the averaged number of sequences per month per sample within the bioreactors and they accounted for 40 of the sequences mainly during the initial period of operation of the reactors fig 5 with the exception of the aforementioned clades otus belonging to the family lachnospiraceae were also abundant in the bioreactors while members of this family were not reported as having the sulfate reduction potential they are known methanol fermenters and were reported to live in close association with sulfate reducers cotta and forster 2006 a network analysis performed on all genera or lowest classification possible identified in the bioreactors found four clusters of positively associated genera fig s1a apart from members of the lachnospiracae family there were other putative fermenters present that were also positively associated with the srb fig s1b these clustered into one sub network with the srb fig s1b and were members of genera acetanaerobacterium anaerovorax leucobacter opitutus paludibacter pelosinus saccharofermentans matthies et al 2000 chin and janssen 2002 chen and dong 2004 ueki et al 2006 shelobolina et al 2007 chen et al 2010 shin et al 2011 as well as to the families anaerolineaceae and canditatus sacharobacteria mcilroy et al 2017 cabrol et al 2017 3 5 3 quantification of the 16s rrna and dsra genes in the miw and bioreactors another way of detecting the presence and relative importance of pertinent microorganisms in the bioreactors and miw was to target the gene for a key enzyme in the sulfate reduction pathway the dissimilatory sulfite reductase gene sub unit a or dsra the copies of this gene relative to the numbers of 16s rrna genes present in all bacteria gives a measure of the representation of sulfate reducing bacteria in the community detection of the dsra gene infers the potential for sulfate reduction which could include organisms other than those detected through taxonomic analysis due to horizontal gene transfer between species and since some otus were not classified to genus or family level amplification of the dsra and 16s rrna genes from the dna obtained from the passive samplers using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction method demonstrated that there were no statistically significant differences between bioreactors and the miw samples in 16s rrna gene copy number or in total bacteria numbers copies of the dsra gene were found in all samples including those from the miw as well as the bioreactors however they were enriched in each of the bioreactors compared to the miw fig 6 p 0 01 furthermore in both bioreactors the variability in copy numbers of the dsra gene between samples was smaller than that observed in the miw 3 5 4 otu level composition examining the composition of the communities from the bioreactors and miw at a finer scale i e at the total otu level which is analogous to species level revealed striking differences between the microbial communities from the bioreactors and miw this is apparent by examining the grouping of samples based on their microbial community structure differences as measured using bray curtis dissimilarity distances represented with a non metric multidimensional scaling or nmds ordination plot fig 7 the nmds shows two distinct groups separated along nmds axis 1 where one group on the right hand side contained all the miw samples and another group on the left hand side contained all the samples from both bioreactors fig 7 furthermore it is apparent that within each group the structure is homogenous as there were no trends with respect to seasonality or bioreactor fig 7 supervised k means clustering confirmed that two was the minimal number of clusters required to explain the grouping of the microbial communities based on bray curtis distances and the miw and bioreactor samples were split into these two groups the clustering of the samples based on sample type i e bioreactor miw was statistically significantly based on amova analysis fs 1 56 45 13 p 0 001 fig 7 genera significantly correlated with the separation of these two clusters fig 7 included mostly those with members potentially capable of sulfate reduction desulfobulbus of the class deltaproteobacteria clostridium and desulfosporosinus of the class clostridia as well as leucobacter a metal reducer of the class actinobacteria tahri joutey et al 2016 significantly correlated with nmds axis 1 in the trajectory of the bioreactors while the genus bacillus of the class bacilli significantly correlated with the trajectory of the miw fig s2 the ordination plot also showed that while belonging to the same group the april and may samples from the bioreactors and the may and july samples from the miw were most distant from other samples of their respective groups fig 7 therefore the samples from miw and bioreactors groups were analyzed by sample type to identify which genera within these particular samples correlated positively with the difference in community composition supplementary fig s1 the genera which positively correlated with the difference between the later samples and the rest were not the same for the miw and bioreactors fig s3 for miw samples low abundance genera indicated by the others category on fig s3 along with members of the genus rhizobium were positively correlated with this difference in the bioreactor samples it was members of the genera leucobacter and clostridium this suggests that the change in the later samples from the bioreactors was not dependent on the change in the later samples of the miw community and might stem from a factor not measured by us 4 discussion in this study we tested the feasibility of using a semi passive water treatment approach for in situ removal of cd and zn from miw under subarctic climatic conditions our results demonstrated that the semi passive approach was capable of reducing both zn and cd concentrations in miw in that both were removed to some degree throughout the entire operation time even during the cold months of fall winter and spring additionally the mine waste rocks submerged in the bioreactors were prevented from oxidation and leaching most probably due to the anaerobic conditions created by microbial activity within the bioreactors this supports the semi passive biological system as an effective method for nmd prevention and removal of sulfate and metals however the results demonstrated a strong dependency on temperature highest removal rates were measured during summer in both 2016 and 2017 coincident with sulfate reduction and carbon consumption signally that biological mechanisms were responsible for metal removal in common with the previous bench scale batch study nielsen et al 2017 the in situ continuous flow system demonstrated that metal removal can occur at temperatures as low as 5 c the bioreactors used in this study were designed to mimic below ground conditions in order to explore the feasibility of using direct carbon injections at seepage points as means of stimulating sulfate reducers below ground if such an approach were to be successful this would allow for metal removal to occur below ground eliminating the need for the establishment of treatment facilities at the surface however the temperatures of the miw in the below ground mine workings were consistently lower than 5 c despite the time of year although metal removal was successful on the surface with minimal heating to keep the process temperatures above 5 c it is still unknown if metal removal can be accomplished by injecting a carbon sources into the mine workings it might be that the warmer periods result in growth of srb to increase their numbers which continue to support sulfate reduction and metal removal in the colder months allbeit at reduced rates without these spurts in growth the number of srb within the colder miw might not reach significant numbers to enable metal removal more work needs to be done to monitor the microbial community composition and sulfate reduction kinetics within the mine workings during carbon source addition another passive treatment system designed to stimulate sulfate reducing bacteria through organic carbon amendment and maintenance of anaerobic conditions also experiencing large temperature variations was also successful at removing metals such as zn and cd at temperatures as low as 7 c baldwin et al 2015 but this was in a more temperate region just north of the canada u s a boarder in british columbia formation of zinc sulfides within this semi passive reactive matrix was verified through mineralogical assessment of residues khoshnoodi et al 2013 cadmium removal by a sulfate reduction process was assessed by wang et al 2000 who demonstrated that the sulfide secreted by some bacteria could be used to precipitate cd in a complex of cd and sulfur most likely cd sulfide cds there were strong indications that in the case of the semi passive treatment system in our study cd and zn removal were performed biologically as the removal of metals was accompanied by simultaneous sulfate reduction and carbon consumption furthermore a strong hydrogen sulfide smell and black precipitates characteristic of iron sulfide were observed which are indicators of srb metabolism according to the literature postgate 1983 muyzer and stams 2008 luptakova and macingova 2012 the removal of zn and cd as sulfides was further confirmed by the results of the mineql simulation this is a preferred method for metal removal since metal sulfides are less soluble and more stable than metal hydroxides the genomic characterization performed in this study verified the suggested mechanism of sulfate reduction for metal removal by revealing the presence of srb that were members of the classes deltaproteobacteria and clostridia muyzer and stams 2008 takahashi et al 2010 janssen et al 1996 kuever 2014 therefore this demonstrates that the semi passive treatment configuration and carbon source addition successfully selected for the desired functional groups since no external inoculum was provided we hypothesised that these sulfate reducing bacteria were enriched from the native source population coming in with the miw influent since most of the otus belonging to deltaproteobacteria were not observed in the miw except for otus belonging to the genus bacteriovorax a predatory non sulfate reducing bacteria williams and baer 2015 sulfate reducers were most likely enriched from the rare biosphere furthermore our network analysis showed associations between sugar fermenters and srb the fermenters reported in our study have been demonstrated to ferment sugars with acetate as an end product and pyruvate and butyrate were also reported as possible byproducts of the fermentation process matthies et al 2000 chin and janssen 2002 chen and dong 2004 ueki et al 2006 shelobolina et al 2007 chen et al 2010 shin et al 2011 all of the above can be utilized as electron donors by srb liamleam and annachhatre 2007 muyzer and stams 2008 this sort of interaction has been reported previously and was demonstrated to support srb growth and sulfate reduction dar et al 2008 thus while the polysaccharides in molasses were demonstrated as adequate carbon sources to promote srb growth in several studies e g annachhatre and suktrakoolvait 2001 teclu et al 2009 it is possible that the fermentation of these sugars to acetate and other short chain acids promoted srb growth even further or increased their taxonomic diversity detection of the dissimilatory sulfite reductase gene dsra with qpcr confirmed successful enrichment of bacteria with genes for the dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway in the bioreactors given that the majority of the otus in all samples came from similar class level taxonomic groups the 16s rrna gene can be used albeit with caution as a proxy for the number of genomes found in our samples větrovský and baldrian 2013 the fact that there were no significant differences in copy numbers among the different sample types suggests that the significantly higher dsra copy numbers in the bioreactor samples as compared to the miw show an enrichment of sulfite reduction genes in the bioreactor samples contrary to the 16s rrna gene sequencing which did not detect putative srb in the miw the qpcr method did detect the dsra gene and the potential for sulfate reduction in all of the miw samples this might have been the case because qpcr is a more selective and sensitive technique for detecting sulfate reducing bacteria than 16s rrna gene sequencing since horizontal gene transfer is possible among bacteria the dsra genes detected in the miw may have come from taxa other than those highlighted as putative srb müller et al 2015 zverlov et al 2005 apart from the difference in copy number there was also a difference in the distribution of dsra copy numbers around the median value between miw and the bioreactors the distribution of copies was more compact in the bioreactor samples compared to those of the miw this indicates that seasonality or temperature did not play a role in the levels of srbs in the bioreactors and that the srb population was much less variable in abundance than that found in the miw this is also reflected in the 16s rrna gene sequences where there was almost no seasonal or temperature related variability in the relative abundance of srbs the same is also true for the bacterial community of the bioreactors as a whole while there was variability in the composition of the bacterial communities from both bioreactors as evident by the distances along axis 2 of the nmds fig 5 those were not associated with temperature or month of sampling there might have been other factors that correlated with this variability that were not measured in this study the lack of temperature or seasonality related variability in the composition of the bacterial community or the srb population in the bioreactors indicates that the reduction in carbon oxidation sulfate reduction and metal removal were more a result of a physiological adaptation of the community to cold temperatures rather than an adaptation at the community composition level similar observations were made in another study where they found consistency in the types of taxa present in a semi passive treatment throughout the year including cold seasons with cyclical variations in relative abundance of some taxa driven by their metabolic interdependence baldwin et al 2016 however while there were no temperature or seasonality associated differences in the relative abundance of srb or dsra gene copies over all we did notice a change in the composition of srb taxa over time our data does suggest an increase in the relative abundance of deltaproteobacteria and a decrease in the relative abundance of members of class clostridia towards the end of the operation of the bioreactors thus our data do show that over time there are shifts in the composition of srb in the reactor however further study is needed in order to discern whether there is an overtime replacement of class clostridia with members of class deltaproteobacteria the results in our study are somewhat contradictory to the work done by van den brand et al 2014 which also studied the reduction of sulfate by srbs as means for metal removal under cold conditions similarly to our study van den brand and colleagues reported a temperature dependent reduction in the rates of acetate and propionate oxidation as well as in the rates of sulfate reduction measured at 10 c as compared to those measured at 20 c van den brand et al 2014 but these authors reported that there were temperature dependent shifts in the composition of their communities and that samples from both temperatures were up to 44 different in their composition one possible explanation for the difference between the two studies is that the bioreactors operated in our study were constantly seeded with cold adapted bacteria entering with the miw feed whereas the bench scale bioreactors in the study by van den brand and colleagues were only seeded once furthermore the highest temperature in the bioreactors was for the most part within the growth range of psychrophiles whereas van den brand et al might have enriched for psychrophiles when operating the bench scale reactor at 10 c and for psychrotrophs when operating it at 20 c moyer and morita 2007 examples of enriched psychrophilic sulfate reducing bacteria that occurred in the bioreactors of this study were members of the genus desulfosporosinus these are known sulfate reducers which have been found in acid and neutral mine drainage but also in cryo environments such as subglacial lake waters spring and rosenzweig 2006 gaidos et al 2008 marteinsson et al 2013 thus these results strongly support that pilot bioreactors implemented at the silver king mine site are an environment conducive to the colonization of sulfate reducing bacteria the complex and stable microbial community characterized in this study benefited the system indeed with a complex carbon source such as molasses a more diverse community of microorganisms performed both carbon hydrolysis and fermentation as well as sulfate reduction on several suitable electron donors sheoran et al 2010 5 conclusions in this study we demonstrated that a semi passive treatment of miw is a feasible option for the removal of metals from miw in cold climates the bioreactors required minimal attendance as only carbon source addition and minimal heating during the winter to prevent freezing were provided zn and cd concentrations in the treated water were continuously below the discharge limits imposed by the water use license of 500 μg l of zn and 50 μg l of cd throughout the duration of the study treatment was successful since the bioreactors offered a conducive environment for the selection of native srbs from the feed water and a stable population of these was maintained throughout the study furthermore there were indications that these bacteria were active year round as even in the winter sulfate reduction and metal removal occurred however our results do demonstrate a dependence on temperature as under winter conditions metal removal rates in the bioreactor slowed down thus we conclude that this pilot scale study demonstrates the potential for a more cost effective treatment of miw in northern territories however since below ground conditions present temperatures around or even below 5 c year round further study is needed to examine the feasibility of in situ point of seepage below ground treatment or treatment in cold areas that would require higher minimal winter time efficiency of metal removal acknowledgements alexco resource corporation and the natural science and engineering research council of canada nserc are acknowledged

19541,mine drainage contaminated with metals is a major environmental threat since it is a source of water pollution with devastating effects on aquatic ecosystems conventional active treatment technologies are prohibitively expensive and so there is increasing demand to develop reliable cost effective and sustainable passive or semi passive treatment these are promising alternatives since they leverage the metabolism of microorganisms native to the disturbed site at in situ or close to in situ conditions since this is a biological approach it is not clear if semi passive treatment would be effective in remote locations with extremely cold weather such as at mines in the subarctic in this study we tested the hypothesis that sulfate reducing bacteria which are microorganisms that promote metal precipitation exist in subarctic mine environments and their activity can be stimulated by adding a readily available carbon source an experiment was setup at a closed mine in the yukon territory canada where leaching of zn and cd occurs to test if semi passive treatment could precipitate these metals and prevent further leaching from waste rock molasses as a carbon source was added to anaerobic bioreactors mimicking the belowground in situ conditions microbial community analysis confirmed that sulfate reducing bacteria became enriched in the bioreactors upon addition of molasses the population composition remained fairly stable over the 14 month operating period despite temperature shifts from 17 to 5 c sulfate reduction functionality was confirmed by quantification of the gene for dissimilatory sulfite reductase metals were removed from underground mine drainage fed into the bioreactors with zn removal efficiency varying between 20 9 in winter and 89 3 in summer and cd removal efficiency between 39 in winter and 90 5 in summer this study demonstrated that stimulation of native srb in miw was possible and that in situ semi passive treatment can be effective in removing metals despite the cold climate graphical abstract image 1 keywords semi passive treatment bioremediation subarctic zinc cadmium sulfate reducing bacteria 1 introduction on both operating and abandoned mines waste material containing sulfide minerals can under certain environmental conditions oxidize resulting in increased sulfate concentrations and mobilization metals in mine drainage baker and banfield 2003 furthermore natural sources of water seepage such as infiltration of snowmelt and rain into waste rock piles or tailings might result in metal leaching and subsequent contamination of downstream aquatic environments willow and cohen 2003 mine impacted waters miw can be acidic acid mine drainage amd or have a circum neutral ph values ranging between 6 and 9 referred to as neutral mine drainage nmd nordstrom et al 2015 nmd occurs where the waste material contains sufficient amounts of minerals capable of neutralizing any acid generated such that the ph is maintained near neutral younger et al 2002 however nmd can also contain dissolved constituents such as sulfates and metals derived from mineral sulfide oxidation nordstrom et al 2015 if the concentrations of metals and other constituents in amd and nmd remain at concentrations high enough to have an impact on aquatic environments they must be removed before release of the miw to the receiving environment currently active chemical water treatment systems are preferred technologies that are widely used for treatment of miw at operating mines pouw et al 2014 however passive and semi passive treatment systems are proposed as being more economically and environmentally favorable for implementation during mine closure passive treatment relies on natural chemical and biological processes and therefore they require little or no maintenance and energy once in operation younger et al 2002 johnson and hallberg 2005 however in practice many passive treatment systems require some periodic active management such as carbon source addition and or temperature control to sustain desired conditions and processes under these conditions they are referred to as semi passive martin et al 2009 for the removal of metals from miw biological treatment using sulfate reducing bacteria srb has been shown to be effective johnson and hallberg 2005 neculita et al 2007 mayes et al 2011 hashim et al 2011 sulfate reduction by srb results in the production of sulfide which in turn reacts with metal cations to form metal sulfide precipitates that lead to a decrease in dissolved metal concentrations since metal sulfides are highly insoluble and less bio available compared with other metal species such as carbonates or hydroxides that are produced in active chemical treatment metal sulfide precipitation mediated by srb is a promising approach for metal removal sheoran et al 2010 moreover many studies have demonstrated that sulfate reducing bacteria passive bioreactor treatment systems are effective at the bench and pilot scale gandy and jarvis 2012 drennan et al 2017 semi passive treatment of miw within the abandoned mine workings was being considered for implementation upon mine closure at a mine in the yukon territory due to its remote location the mine is located 354 km north of whitehorse at 63 55on and 135 23ow within the subarctic where temperatures are greater than 10 c for only one to three months of the year major concerns common to many mines in remote cold climate regions included whether native microorganisms capable of reducing sulfate and mediating the precipitation of metals would be present and whether the kinetic performance of biological water treatment at low temperatures would achieve metal removal low temperatures typically reduce the growth rate and metabolism of bacteria even those that are considered psychrophilic price and sowers 2004 in this study we report on an experiment mimicking environmental conditions of the subsurface mine workings where metal leaching was occurring to test if semi passive treatment could be implemented in the subarctic climate the study was carried out at the historic keno hill silver district where the silver king mine groundwater was contaminated with heavy metals such as zinc and cadmium based on historical measurements the miw temperature in the subsurface mine workings rarely exceeded 5 c previous static bench scale tests demonstrated that cd and zn could be removed from the miw at these temperatures upon addition of an appropriate carbon source such a molasses nielsen et al 2017 it was postulated that this was due to the activity of sulfate reducing bacteria nielsen et al 2017 therefore in order to treat the underground mine impacted water miw the operators of the mine were considering implementation of in situ semi passive biological treatment to achieve permanent closure of the mine and meet the discharge limits of their water use license the hypothesis was that introduction of a suitable carbon source into the miw would stimulate growth of microorganisms especially sulfate reducing bacteria if they were present within the native communities that would result in metal precipitation and decrease in dissolved metal concentrations to test this hypothesis two duplicate experimental semi passive 200 l bioreactors were installed at the surface on the silver king mine site to replicate the underground geologic composition by incorporating waste rocks taken from the underground tunnels and operating at the same hydraulic retention time as that for the groundwater flowing through the subsurface workings no inoculum was added and in order to stimulate bacterial growth and metabolism molasses was continuously fed into the bioreactors as the carbon source the experiment tested the feasibility of passive treatment of the miw and measured the effect of seasonal temperature changes on the extents of metal and sulfate removal additionally we performed high throughput sequencing of the phylogenetic biomarker 16s rrna gene to characterize the development of the bacterial community composition in the feed water and within the bioreactors during their operation to estimate changes in the levels of srbs during the operation of the bioreactors we used quantitative polymerase chain reaction q pcr to quantify the dissimilatory sulfite reductase gene dsrab which is a functional biomarker for sulfate reduction 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup two duplicate experimental bioreactors were installed above ground on the silver king mine site see the graphical abstract for a depiction of the experimental setup these consisted of sealed 200 l polyethylene drums the outlet pipe was installed in the top cover of the bioreactor in order to minimize headspace and keep the system anoxic water exiting the bioreactors was collected in two open top 200 l polyethylene drums respectively each bioreactor was filled with 40 l of waste rocks collected in equal amounts from two piles of material previously excavated from the silver king tunnels which corresponded to 20 v v previous laboratory tests revealed that these waste rocks had the potential for metal leaching and acid generation nielsen et al 2017 influent miw was pumped to fill up a 1000 l feed tank every two weeks from a 110 m deep borehole connected to one historically mined vein within a network of old flooded tunnels the feed tank was emptied each time before refilling miw was pumped from this feed tank into the bottom of the bioreactors and upwards through the bed of waste rock flow rate was set such that the hydraulic retention time hrt in each bioreactor was 2 weeks to reflect the hrt in the underground tunnels as estimated by the mine operator in this study molasses was chosen as the carbon source since it is inexpensive and widely available crosby s 100 natural fancy molasses crosby molasses company limited st john nb canada molasses was reported to promote srb growth by metabolism of sugars muyzer and stams 2008 and indirectly through fermentation to other carbon sources favoured by srb in several previous batch and bioreactor studies teclu et al 2009 annachhatre and suktrakoolvait 2001 zhao et al 2010 in one laboratory study molasses was found to support a diverse bacterial community zhao et al 2010 diversity in bacterial communities increases their resilience to environmental perturbations allison and martiny 2008 which is important for the reliability of bioremediation at remote minimally managed open systems such as the one used in this study molasses was fed into the bottom of the bioreactors from a continuously stirred 10 l glass bottle a timer was set to pump the molasses solution for 51 6 min

sieved to 412 μm prior to analysis the instrument was calibrated using oxalic acid dihydrate standards acs reagent sigma aldrich canada in order to predict the dominant chemical species of zn and cd formed in the bioreactors a geochemical simulation was carried out using mineql 4 6 environmental research software hallowell me u s a and the usepa thermodynamic database with input of the composition of the bioreactor effluent samples from july 7th 2016 which was the date with the highest reductions of cd and zn concentrations 2 3 biological sample collection passive samplers were used for the collection of microorganisms growing inside the bioreactors these microorganisms were assumed to represent those in biofilms attached to the actual waste rocks inside the bioreactors and that were responsible for water treatment twenty bags made with light cotton cheesecloth were filled with few grams of the same waste rock types at the same ratio as in each bioreactor these bags were suspended in the middle of each bioreactor with fish line for ease of removal at sample collection time once per month one passive sampler was collected from each bioreactor for bacterial identification immediately after collection passive samplers were frozen by immersion into liquid nitrogen in a thermo flask container 2122 thermo scientific and transported from the field to the

the grouping of the samples based on the nmds oksanen et al 2016 in order to study the overall bacterial community and putative associations with sulfate reducing bacteria an association network

quantitative pcr was performed on one sample for each month of sampling from the bioreactors and the miw regions of both the 16s rrna gene and the dsra gene were amplified using sso fast evergreen

the bioreactors from july 2015 to august 2016 ph of the miw influent was circum neutral varying between 6 5 and 7 1 with an average of 6 8 0 5 table 1 sulfate concentrations in the miw influent averaged 417 6 130 6 mg l over the 14 month experiment table 1 the carbon source dosing was calculated based on 426 mg l sulfate in the miw for the most part there was sufficient carbon for complete reduction of sulfate except for the month of november when the monthly average sulfate concentrations increased to 508 and 506 mg l in november and december 2015 respectively at the beginning of the experiment zn and cd concentrations in the influent were 640 4 μg l and 10 5 μg l respectively fig 1 which were within the ranges of historical values personal communication with mine personnel subsequently their concentrations fluctuated and generally diminished due to changes in the underground water balance resulting from discontinuous pumping of the water from the borehole changing water levels and seasonal changes in precipitation zinc concentration in the miw remained relatively stable until early september 2015 when it increased up to a maximum of 915 1 μg l then it decreased to a minimum concentration of 207 5 μg l in may 2016 increasing again to a new maximum concentration of 531 3 μg l in august 2016 similarly cd concentrations reached maxima of 14 6 μg l and 12 6 μg l in mid august 2015 and at the onset of summer 2016 respectively while decreasing below 4 1 μg l during the winter and spring months the miw had an average ca concentration of 152 3 42 7 mg l which was unlikely to contribute to removal of sulfate under the conditions in the bioreactors fajtl et al 2002 the miw temperature remained fairly stable over the experimental period with an average of 3 1 0 9 c and was only slightly warmer during summer than winter temperatures within the bioreactors were higher than in the miw since they were subjected to warming from the air during their two week hrt and ranged between 4 c and 17 5 c depending on season fig 2 3 2 sulfate removal sulfate reduction in both bioreactors appeared to be correlated with temperature fig 2 the highest sulfate reduction rates 50 were observed during the months of july and august 2015 and during june to august of 2016 when the internal temperatures of the bioreactors were greater than 15 c fig 2 one notable exception was for bioreactor 1 in september 2015 when greater than 70 sulfate reduction was achieved despite a temperature lower than 7 c bioreactor 1 achieved the highest sulfate removal extent of 91 9 during august 2016 when temperatures in both bioreactors decreased the percent of sulfate removed decreased as well this was especially apparent during the fall and winter months between october 2015 and february 2016 when the average monthly temperatures inside the bioreactors ranged between 3 5 1 4 c and 8 0 c respectively and the measured percent of sulfate reduced fluctuated between 0 and 37 5 fig 2 a statistically significant positive correlation between sulfate reduction and temperature was detected using monthly averaged sulfate concentrations in bioreactor 2 rs 0 64 p value 0 05 orp measured during february 2016 when temperatures were 5 3 1 0 c in br1 and 5 5 0 9 c in br2 was 28 mv and 46 mv respectively in br1 and br2 when temperatures increased during springtime and summer to 12 3 c may 2016 in br1 and 15 6 1 7 c july 2016 in br2 the orp decreased to 162 8 56 9 mv for br1 and 199 74 mv optimal orp values for srb to catabolize sulfates and release sulfides is in the range of 100 to 300 mv gloyna 1971 gibert et al 2002 harerimana et al 2010 hence decreased orp results observed in summer may be attributed to an increase in srb activity geochemical modeling with mineql predicted that under these conditions 97 of the cd precipitates as cd hs 4 2 and 87 of the zn precipitates in the form zns sphalerite table s2 this suggests that these metals were precipitated mainly in the form of sulfides in the bioreactors 3 3 carbon source consumption carbon consumption within the bioreactors was detected since the very early stages of the bioreactors operation and the extents were very similar for both bioreactors at approximately 79 by the end of july 2015 fig 3 although carbon consumption was initially high during the warmer months of 2015 during fall and winter residual carbon concentrations increased and carbon consumption decreased fig 3 interestingly there were occasions during the cold periods when carbon consumption was high for e g in november and december of 2015 and in january and april of 2016 fig 3 very little dissolved carbon entered with the miw with the exception from may to june 2016 when carbon concentrations in the miw increased from 0 12 mmol l to 2 33 mmol l fig 3 due to molasses injections into the groundwater done by the mine operators at this time personal communication despite increased carbon concentrations in the feed into the bioreactors during summer 2016 and increasing residual concentrations in the effluent of the bioreactors the carbon removal efficiency remained high in both bioreactors at 82 0 01 in july 2016 this carbon consumption observed during the summer 2016 was similar to the consumption observed in summer 2015 3 4 zinc and cadmium removal remarkably zn and cd removal were achieved in the bioreactors right after their start up fig 1 in the of summer 2015 zn and cd removal extents were 80 6 2 1 and 90 5 0 6 on average respectively for both bioreactors during which time the temperatures ranged between 10 c and 17 c fig 2 by the end of winter 2015 both bioreactors were operating at their lowest zn removal efficiency of 20 9 7 3 and cd removal efficiency of 39 9 8 zinc and cd removal extent started to increase after spring 2016 reaching 89 3 3 55 for zn and 85 5 2 2 for cd in july 2016 which were similar to the extents observed in summer 2015 3 5 characterization of the bacterial community in the mine influenced water influent and bioreactors to determine whether the semi passive treatment methodology was capable of stimulating the right functional groups of microorganisms for sustainable metal removal such as sulfate reducing bacteria all bacteria attached to the passive samplers removed from the bioreactors were identified and their relative abundance determined using high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene 3 5 1 dominant taxonomic groups present in the bioreactors since many different otus operational taxonomic units representing putative bacterial species were found in the miw and bioreactors 1173 otus comparisons were first made at the higher taxonomic level of class both bioreactors had very similar compositions of dominant class level taxonomic groups fig 4 both were dominated by members of the classes clostridia deltaproteobacteria bacterioidia and actinobacteria the miw contained bacteria also classified in these classes although members of the classes gammaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria were more relatively abundant in the miw samples than in the bioreactors furthermore members of the classes sphingobacteria and bacilli were found at relative abundances of greater than 1 of total number of sequences per sample in most of the miw samples but were very rare less than 0 1 in the bioreactors fig 4 3 5 2 putative sulfate reducers of the classes dominating the bioreactors both classes clostridia and deltaproteobacteria are the most likely to contain members capable of sulfate reduction campbell and postgate 1965 druschel et al 2004 meyer and kuever 2007 pruden et al 2007 sallam and steinbuchel 2009 lefticariu et al 2015 thus we focused further taxonomic analysis on high relative abundance otus i e those greater than 1 of the averaged total number of sequences per month per sample type that were classified as members of these class level taxonomic groups fig 5 for the entire span of the bioreactors operation putative srbs belonging to these classes ranged from 50 to 80 of the total number of sequences per month fig 5 this is with the exception of the may 2016 sample from bioreactor 1 where putative srb from these classes had relative abundance of only 15 of the total number of sequences this can be attributed to the fact that most of the sequences classified as belonging to class clostridia in that sample could not be classified beyond the order clostridiales while this order does contain members capable of reducing sulfate muyzer and stams 2008 this level of taxonomy classification is too broad to allow for any confident assertion within the deltaproteobacteria two of the high relative abundance otus otu 33 and otu 186 were classified as members of families with the potential for sulfate reduction an unclassified genus of the family desulfobacteraceae and a member of the genus desulfobulbus respectively fig 5 both of these putative sulfate reducing bacteria muyzer and stams 2008 were present in the bioreactor samples but were not detected not in the miw samples furthermore both otu 33 and 186 were present in both bioreactors throughout their operation and accounted for 2 5 30 of the total number of sequences fig 5 a desulfocapsa related otu another genus that contains potential sulfate reducers janssen et al 1996 kuever 2014 was also present only in the bioreactors and not in miw however its relative abundance was lower than 1 of the total number of sequences several otus belonging to genera within the class clostridia were detected either exclusively or in greater relative abundance in both of the bioreactors samples than in the miw fig 5 of those both otus classified as members of the genus clostridium clostridium sensu stricto and those classified as members of the genus desulfosporosinus genera with potential sulfur reducers fig 5 with the genus clostridium also containing member capable of sulfide reduction muyzer and stams 2008 takahashi et al 2010 notably two desulfosporosinus otus were present also in the miw as well as in the bioreactors fig 5 much like the otus belonging to the class deltaproteobacteria these otus accounted for a large proportion of the averaged number of sequences per month per sample within the bioreactors and they accounted for 40 of the sequences mainly during the initial period of operation of the reactors fig 5 with the exception of the aforementioned clades otus belonging to the family lachnospiraceae were also abundant in the bioreactors while members of this family were not reported as having the sulfate reduction potential they are known methanol fermenters and were reported to live in close association with sulfate reducers cotta and forster 2006 a network analysis performed on all genera or lowest classification possible identified in the bioreactors found four clusters of positively associated genera fig s1a apart from members of the lachnospiracae family there were other putative fermenters present that were also positively associated with the srb fig s1b these clustered into one sub network with the srb fig s1b and were members of genera acetanaerobacterium anaerovorax leucobacter opitutus paludibacter pelosinus saccharofermentans matthies et al 2000 chin and janssen 2002 chen and dong 2004 ueki et al 2006 shelobolina et al 2007 chen et al 2010 shin et al 2011 as well as to the families anaerolineaceae and canditatus sacharobacteria mcilroy et al 2017 cabrol et al 2017 3 5 3 quantification of the 16s rrna and dsra genes in the miw and bioreactors another way of detecting the presence and relative importance of pertinent microorganisms in the bioreactors and miw was to target the gene for a key enzyme in the sulfate reduction pathway the dissimilatory sulfite reductase gene sub unit a or dsra the copies of this gene relative to the numbers of 16s rrna genes present in all bacteria gives a measure of the representation of sulfate reducing bacteria in the community detection of the dsra gene infers the potential for sulfate reduction which could include organisms other than those detected through taxonomic analysis due to horizontal gene transfer between species and since some otus were not classified to genus or family level amplification of the dsra and 16s rrna genes from the dna obtained from the passive samplers using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction method demonstrated that there were no statistically significant differences between bioreactors and the miw samples in 16s rrna gene copy number or in total bacteria numbers copies of the dsra gene were found in all samples including those from the miw as well as the bioreactors however they were enriched in each of the bioreactors compared to the miw fig 6 p 0 01 furthermore in both bioreactors the variability in copy numbers of the dsra gene between samples was smaller than that observed in the miw 3 5 4 otu level composition examining the composition of the communities from the bioreactors and miw at a finer scale i e at the total otu level which is analogous to species level revealed striking differences between the microbial communities from the bioreactors and miw this is apparent by examining the grouping of samples based on their microbial community structure differences as measured using bray curtis dissimilarity distances represented with a non metric multidimensional scaling or nmds ordination plot fig 7 the nmds shows two distinct groups separated along nmds axis 1 where one group on the right hand side contained all the miw samples and another group on the left hand side contained all the samples from both bioreactors fig 7 furthermore it is apparent that within each group the structure is homogenous as there were no trends with respect to seasonality or bioreactor fig 7 supervised k means clustering confirmed that two was the minimal number of clusters required to explain the grouping of the microbial communities based on bray curtis distances and the miw and bioreactor samples were split into these two groups the clustering of the samples based on sample type i e bioreactor miw was statistically significantly based on amova analysis fs 1 56 45 13 p 0 001 fig 7 genera significantly correlated with the separation of these two clusters fig 7 included mostly those with members potentially capable of sulfate reduction desulfobulbus of the class deltaproteobacteria clostridium and desulfosporosinus of the class clostridia as well as leucobacter a metal reducer of the class actinobacteria tahri joutey et al 2016 significantly correlated with nmds axis 1 in the trajectory of the bioreactors while the genus bacillus of the class bacilli significantly correlated with the trajectory of the miw fig s2 the ordination plot also showed that while belonging to the same group the april and may samples from the bioreactors and the may and july samples from the miw were most distant from other samples of their respective groups fig 7 therefore the samples from miw and bioreactors groups were analyzed by sample type to identify which genera within these particular samples correlated positively with the difference in community composition supplementary fig s1 the genera which positively correlated with the difference between the later samples and the rest were not the same for the miw and bioreactors fig s3 for miw samples low abundance genera indicated by the others category on fig s3 along with members of the genus rhizobium were positively correlated with this difference in the bioreactor samples it was members of the genera leucobacter and clostridium this suggests that the change in the later samples from the bioreactors was not dependent on the change in the later samples of the miw community and might stem from a factor not measured by us 4 discussion in this study we tested the feasibility of using a semi passive water treatment approach for in situ removal of cd and zn from miw under subarctic climatic conditions our results demonstrated that the semi passive approach was capable of reducing both zn and cd concentrations in miw in that both were removed to some degree throughout the entire operation time even during the cold months of fall winter and spring additionally the mine waste rocks submerged in the bioreactors were prevented from oxidation and leaching most probably due to the anaerobic conditions created by microbial activity within the bioreactors this supports the semi passive biological system as an effective method for nmd prevention and removal of sulfate and metals however the results demonstrated a strong dependency on temperature highest removal rates were measured during summer in both 2016 and 2017 coincident with sulfate reduction and carbon consumption signally that biological mechanisms were responsible for metal removal in common with the previous bench scale batch study nielsen et al 2017 the in situ continuous flow system demonstrated that metal removal can occur at temperatures as low as 5 c the bioreactors used in this study were designed to mimic below ground conditions in order to explore the feasibility of using direct carbon injections at seepage points as means of stimulating sulfate reducers below ground if such an approach were to be successful this would allow for metal removal to occur below ground eliminating the need for the establishment of treatment facilities at the surface however the temperatures of the miw in the below ground mine workings were consistently lower than 5 c despite the time of year although metal removal was successful on the surface with minimal heating to keep the process temperatures above 5 c it is still unknown if metal removal can be accomplished by injecting a carbon sources into the mine workings it might be that the warmer periods result in growth of srb to increase their numbers which continue to support sulfate reduction and metal removal in the colder months allbeit at reduced rates without these spurts in growth the number of srb within the colder miw might not reach significant numbers to enable metal removal more work needs to be done to monitor the microbial community composition and sulfate reduction kinetics within the mine workings during carbon source addition another passive treatment system designed to stimulate sulfate reducing bacteria through organic carbon amendment and maintenance of anaerobic conditions also experiencing large temperature variations was also successful at removing metals such as zn and cd at temperatures as low as 7 c baldwin et al 2015 but this was in a more temperate region just north of the canada u s a boarder in british columbia formation of zinc sulfides within this semi passive reactive matrix was verified through mineralogical assessment of residues khoshnoodi et al 2013 cadmium removal by a sulfate reduction process was assessed by wang et al 2000 who demonstrated that the sulfide secreted by some bacteria could be used to precipitate cd in a complex of cd and sulfur most likely cd sulfide cds there were strong indications that in the case of the semi passive treatment system in our study cd and zn removal were performed biologically as the removal of metals was accompanied by simultaneous sulfate reduction and carbon consumption furthermore a strong hydrogen sulfide smell and black precipitates characteristic of iron sulfide were observed which are indicators of srb metabolism according to the literature postgate 1983 muyzer and stams 2008 luptakova and macingova 2012 the removal of zn and cd as sulfides was further confirmed by the results of the mineql simulation this is a preferred method for metal removal since metal sulfides are less soluble and more stable than metal hydroxides the genomic characterization performed in this study verified the suggested mechanism of sulfate reduction for metal removal by revealing the presence of srb that were members of the classes deltaproteobacteria and clostridia muyzer and stams 2008 takahashi et al 2010 janssen et al 1996 kuever 2014 therefore this demonstrates that the semi passive treatment configuration and carbon source addition successfully selected for the desired functional groups since no external inoculum was provided we hypothesised that these sulfate reducing bacteria were enriched from the native source population coming in with the miw influent since most of the otus belonging to deltaproteobacteria were not observed in the miw except for otus belonging to the genus bacteriovorax a predatory non sulfate reducing bacteria williams and baer 2015 sulfate reducers were most likely enriched from the rare biosphere furthermore our network analysis showed associations between sugar fermenters and srb the fermenters reported in our study have been demonstrated to ferment sugars with acetate as an end product and pyruvate and butyrate were also reported as possible byproducts of the fermentation process matthies et al 2000 chin and janssen 2002 chen and dong 2004 ueki et al 2006 shelobolina et al 2007 chen et al 2010 shin et al 2011 all of the above can be utilized as electron donors by srb liamleam and annachhatre 2007 muyzer and stams 2008 this sort of interaction has been reported previously and was demonstrated to support srb growth and sulfate reduction dar et al 2008 thus while the polysaccharides in molasses were demonstrated as adequate carbon sources to promote srb growth in several studies e g annachhatre and suktrakoolvait 2001 teclu et al 2009 it is possible that the fermentation of these sugars to acetate and other short chain acids promoted srb growth even further or increased their taxonomic diversity detection of the dissimilatory sulfite reductase gene dsra with qpcr confirmed successful enrichment of bacteria with genes for the dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway in the bioreactors given that the majority of the otus in all samples came from similar class level taxonomic groups the 16s rrna gene can be used albeit with caution as a proxy for the number of genomes found in our samples větrovský and baldrian 2013 the fact that there were no significant differences in copy numbers among the different sample types suggests that the significantly higher dsra copy numbers in the bioreactor samples as compared to the miw show an enrichment of sulfite reduction genes in the bioreactor samples contrary to the 16s rrna gene sequencing which did not detect putative srb in the miw the qpcr method did detect the dsra gene and the potential for sulfate reduction in all of the miw samples this might have been the case because qpcr is a more selective and sensitive technique for detecting sulfate reducing bacteria than 16s rrna gene sequencing since horizontal gene transfer is possible among bacteria the dsra genes detected in the miw may have come from taxa other than those highlighted as putative srb müller et al 2015 zverlov et al 2005 apart from the difference in copy number there was also a difference in the distribution of dsra copy numbers around the median value between miw and the bioreactors the distribution of copies was more compact in the bioreactor samples compared to those of the miw this indicates that seasonality or temperature did not play a role in the levels of srbs in the bioreactors and that the srb population was much less variable in abundance than that found in the miw this is also reflected in the 16s rrna gene sequences where there was almost no seasonal or temperature related variability in the relative abundance of srbs the same is also true for the bacterial community of the bioreactors as a whole while there was variability in the composition of the bacterial communities from both bioreactors as evident by the distances along axis 2 of the nmds fig 5 those were not associated with temperature or month of sampling there might have been other factors that correlated with this variability that were not measured in this study the lack of temperature or seasonality related variability in the composition of the bacterial community or the srb population in the bioreactors indicates that the reduction in carbon oxidation sulfate reduction and metal removal were more a result of a physiological adaptation of the community to cold temperatures rather than an adaptation at the community composition level similar observations were made in another study where they found consistency in the types of taxa present in a semi passive treatment throughout the year including cold seasons with cyclical variations in relative abundance of some taxa driven by their metabolic interdependence baldwin et al 2016 however while there were no temperature or seasonality associated differences in the relative abundance of srb or dsra gene copies over all we did notice a change in the composition of srb taxa over time our data does suggest an increase in the relative abundance of deltaproteobacteria and a decrease in the relative abundance of members of class clostridia towards the end of the operation of the bioreactors thus our data do show that over time there are shifts in the composition of srb in the reactor however further study is needed in order to discern whether there is an overtime replacement of class clostridia with members of class deltaproteobacteria the results in our study are somewhat contradictory to the work done by van den brand et al 2014 which also studied the reduction of sulfate by srbs as means for metal removal under cold conditions similarly to our study van den brand and colleagues reported a temperature dependent reduction in the rates of acetate and propionate oxidation as well as in the rates of sulfate reduction measured at 10 c as compared to those measured at 20 c van den brand et al 2014 but these authors reported that there were temperature dependent shifts in the composition of their communities and that samples from both temperatures were up to 44 different in their composition one possible explanation for the difference between the two studies is that the bioreactors operated in our study were constantly seeded with cold adapted bacteria entering with the miw feed whereas the bench scale bioreactors in the study by van den brand and colleagues were only seeded once furthermore the highest temperature in the bioreactors was for the most part within the growth range of psychrophiles whereas van den brand et al might have enriched for psychrophiles when operating the bench scale reactor at 10 c and for psychrotrophs when operating it at 20 c moyer and morita 2007 examples of enriched psychrophilic sulfate reducing bacteria that occurred in the bioreactors of this study were members of the genus desulfosporosinus these are known sulfate reducers which have been found in acid and neutral mine drainage but also in cryo environments such as subglacial lake waters spring and rosenzweig 2006 gaidos et al 2008 marteinsson et al 2013 thus these results strongly support that pilot bioreactors implemented at the silver king mine site are an environment conducive to the colonization of sulfate reducing bacteria the complex and stable microbial community characterized in this study benefited the system indeed with a complex carbon source such as molasses a more diverse community of microorganisms performed both carbon hydrolysis and fermentation as well as sulfate reduction on several suitable electron donors sheoran et al 2010 5 conclusions in this study we demonstrated that a semi passive treatment of miw is a feasible option for the removal of metals from miw in cold climates the bioreactors required minimal attendance as only carbon source addition and minimal heating during the winter to prevent freezing were provided zn and cd concentrations in the treated water were continuously below the discharge limits imposed by the water use license of 500 μg l of zn and 50 μg l of cd throughout the duration of the study treatment was successful since the bioreactors offered a conducive environment for the selection of native srbs from the feed water and a stable population of these was maintained throughout the study furthermore there were indications that these bacteria were active year round as even in the winter sulfate reduction and metal removal occurred however our results do demonstrate a dependence on temperature as under winter conditions metal removal rates in the bioreactor slowed down thus we conclude that this pilot scale study demonstrates the potential for a more cost effective treatment of miw in northern territories however since below ground conditions present temperatures around or even below 5 c year round further study is needed to examine the feasibility of in situ point of seepage below ground treatment or treatment in cold areas that would require higher minimal winter time efficiency of metal removal acknowledgements alexco resource corporation and the natural science and engineering research council of canada nserc are acknowledged

19542,freshwater cyanobacterial blooms are becoming increasingly problematic in regions that rely on surface waters for drinking water production microcystins mcs are toxic peptides produced by multiple cyanobacterial genera with a global occurrence cyanobacteria also produce a variety of other toxic and or otherwise bioactive peptides tbps that have gained less attention including cyanopeptolins cpts anabaenopeptins apts and microginins mgn in this study we compared temporal and spatial trends of four mcs mclr mcrr mcyr mcla three cpts cpt1020 cpt1041 cpt1007 two apts aptf aptb and mgn690 in raw drinking water and at six surface water locations above these drinking water intakes in a eutrophic lake all four mc congeners and five of six tbps were detected in lake and raw drinking water across all samples mclr was the most frequently detected metabolite 100 of samples followed by mcrr 97 cpt1007 74 mcyr 69 aptf 67 mcla 61 aptb 54 mgn690 29 and cpt1041 15 mean concentrations of mcs apts and cpts into two drinking water intakes were 3 9 4 7 0 14 0 21 and 0 38 0 92 respectively mean concentrations in surface water were significantly higher p 0 05 than in drinking water intakes for mcs but not for cpts and apts temporal trends in mcs cpts and apts in the two raw drinking water intakes were significantly correlated p 0 05 with measures of cell abundance chlorophyll a microcystis cell density uv absorbance and turbidity in surface water this study expands current information about cyanobacterial tbps that occur in lakes and that enter drinking water treatment plants and underscores the need to determine the fate of less studied cyanobacterial metabolites during drinking water treatment that may exacerbate toxicity of more well known cyanobacterial toxins graphical abstract image 1 keywords microcystis dolichospermum aphanizomenon microcystin cyanopeptolin anabaenopeptin 1 introduction increased occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms commonly known as blue green algae has created growing concerns over global freshwater sustainability cyanobacterial blooms negatively affect fisheries recreational angling boating and swimming property values and animal and human health recent evidence indicates that an increasing number of lakes and rivers in the united states are becoming hypereutrophic and thus capable of supporting dense and or frequent cyanobacterial blooms dodds et al 2009 furthermore climate and land use change predictions suggest increased intensity and occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater resources worldwide balbus et al 2013 paerl and huisman 2009 bloom forming cyanobacteria produce a number of linear and circular peptides with varying degrees of potential toxicity in animals and humans microcystins mcs are cyclic heptapeptides that inhibit eukaryotic serine threonine protein phosphatases 1 and 2a mackintosh et al 1990 primarily in the liver but also in other tissues feurstein et al 2009 fischer et al 2005 at oral doses above 40 μg kg 1 body weight mcs induce cellular lysis of liver cells and tissue necrosis fawell et al 1999 in addition some evidence suggests that mcs can cross the blood brain barrier acting as a neurotoxin affecting learning and memory feurstein et al 2009 fischer et al 2005 li et al 2014 in repeat oral dose rodent studies mcs display toxicity to male reproductive organs chen et al 2011 ultimately the tissue types affected by mcs are dictated by the distribution of organic anion transporting polypeptides responsible for mc uptake into eukaryotic cells feurstein et al 2009 hagenbuch and gui 2008 meier abt et al 2007 in addition to their acute effects mcs are tumor promoters and possible carcinogens as defined by the international agency for research on cancer agudo et al 2010 in chronic exposure studies mcs have produced tumors in mice and rats andrew r humpage 2000 falconer and humpage 1996 nishiwaki matsushima et al 1992 and an increasing number of human epidemiological studies have suggested that chronic low dose exposure to mc may contribute to the burden of liver and colorectal cancers in some populations fleming et al 2002 li et al 2011 lun et al 2002 svircev et al 2009 zhou et al 2002 mechanistic studies of phosphatase inhibitors have shown that tumor production is due to a disruption in cellular signaling pathways leading to unbalanced cell growth reviewed in gehringer 2004 cyanobacteria that form blooms in lakes also produce hundreds of other peptides with molecular targets in eukaryotic cells that may or may not be considered toxic sivonen et al 2010 welker and von dohren 2006 for purposes of this study we call these toxic or otherwise bioactive peptides or tbps approximately 90 of the currently known tbps can be classified as anabaenopeptins aeruginosins cryptophycins cyanopeptolins cyclamides microginins and microviridins chlipala et al 2011 many of these tbps inhibit one or more proteases in eukaryotes and have been explored as potential sources of new drugs for example aeruginosins have been shown to inhibit trypsin thrombin and plasmin and therefore may be useful in treating myocardial infarction and stroke ersmark et al 2008 radau et al 2003 the linear pentapeptide microginin 690 mgn690 has been shown to inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme okino et al 1993 and thus may be useful in treating high blood pressure in humans bagchi et al 2015 anabaenopeptins have been found to inhibit carboxypeptidase a and like mcs also inhibit protein phosphatases but with ten fold lower potency namikoshi and rinehart 1996 sano et al 2001 the cyanopeptolins cpt inhibit serine proteases such as human kallikrein and chymotrypsin which may be useful in treating certain cancers borgono and diamandis 2004 or as anti viral agents singh et al 2011 while some of these tbps may be promising sources of new drugs their occurrence in surface waters is potentially problematic for ecological and human health for example one of the most prevalent bloom forming genera are microcystis species which possesses at least 15 genetic loci coding for non ribosomal peptide synthetases and polyketides kaneko et al 2007 as such in addition to mcs a variety of other tbp classes of potential importance to human health have been isolated from microcystis species for example recently cyanopeptolin 1020 cpt1020 isolated from m aeruginosa uv 006 was shown to affect chitin synthesis in freshwater fairy shrimp gademann et al 2010 and displayed neurotoxicity in a zebra fish study at levels similar to other acutely acting cyanotoxins e g mcs faltermann et al 2014 similarly two new cyclamides isolated from microcystis species display toxicity against the freshwater crustacean thamnocephalus platyurus with a potency approximately an order of magnitude lower than that of mcs portmann et al 2008 while anabaenopeptins inhibit protein phosphatases at lower potencies in recent studies they have been shown to co occur with mcs at equal or higher levels beversdorf et al 2017 thus multiple tbps may be produced by bloom forming microcystis species in addition to the well described mcs and some of these tbps may be considered emerging cyanotoxins the temporal and spatial distribution of tbps other than mcs in lakes has not been well described many studies to date have used non targeted mass spectrometry approaches e g maldi tof to characterize peptide diversity in cultures single samples of bloom material or cyanobacterial colonies welker et al 2004a welker and erhard 2007 welker et al 2002 welker and von dohren 2006 fastner et al 2001 these studies have revealed that cyanobacteria produce a great diversity of bioactive peptides among those studies providing some spatial or temporal data in a study of 165 individual colonies from seven lakes on two dates in germany welker et al identified 46 different cyanobacterial peptides the majority of which were mcs apts cpts microginins and aeruginosins including some novel peptides welker et al 2004b gkelis et al surveyed mcs and apts in 36 lakes using hplc on either multiple dates or one date and found that in addition to mc rr and mc lr apt b and apt a were dominant in some lakes but relative to mcs occurred more sporadically gkelis et al 2015 in a previous study of six eutrophic lakes using tandem mass spectrometry we showed that the production of apts and cpts in lakes is highly variable over time and do not necessarily follow the same temporal trajectory and spatial distribution as mcs beversdorf et al 2017 in this study we describe the concentration and co occurrence of mcs and a suite of tbps at drinking water intakes and at six surface water locations in eutrophic lake winnebago wisconsin with two of the locations sampled at depths above the drinking water treatment plant dwtp intake pipes fig 1 we simultaneously monitored these mcs and tbps in raw intake water prior to any chemical addition from the two dwtps along with seventeen water quality parameters that are typically already measured by dwtps our goal was to 1 compare lake water and raw intake drinking water concentrations of mcs and tbps 2 determine the rate of co occurrence between mcs and tbps in lake and intake water and 3 identify any water quality parameters indicative of the occurrence of mcs and tbps in raw intake water using multiple regression analysis indicators of particularly mcs in raw intake water may be useful given recent health advisories for these particular cyanotoxins in finished drinking water d anglada and strong 2016 our data suggest that multiple tbps co occur with mcs in lake and intake water in this location some standard water quality parameters were indicative of mcs and tbp

both plants permanganate is added at the intake to raw drinking water at both plants to inhibit the growth of dreissenids in the crib and intake pipes water samples were collected at the intakes of dwtp a and dwtp b herein referred to as raw water on the same dates lake samples were collected samples at the intake were taken using the low lift pumps used to transfer water to the plant samples

magnification was needed to identify cyanobacteria which were identified to genus focusing on the dominant groups dolichospermum aphanizomenon and microcystis 2 5 statistical analysis all analyses were conducted in matlab site comparisons were analyzed using the kruskal wallis test and analysis of variance anova and comparisons explicitly between raw water and drinking water were compared using the wilcoxon test pearson correlations were used to compare temporal variability of cyanotoxins to tbps and to environmental variables prior to the analysis anon detects were set to one half of the estimated detection limit and all variables log transformed 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variation in lake surface water characteristics all six surface water sites were located at the north end of lake winnebago fig 1 some sites were pelagic with others near shore and water depths ranged from 1 0 to 4 5 m despite these differences little spatial variability was observed in the 18 environmental parameters and nine mcs tbps detected and quantified between the six sites sampled fig 2 tables s1 and s2 only manganese and e coli concentrations had significant differences between the six sites p 0 05 kruskal wallis table s1 similarity between sites could likely be due to the lake being shallow and polymictic i e well mixed water temperature was above 20 c at all sites for the duration of the study with the exception of the last date sampled september 25th fig 2 over the same time period chlorophyll a increased to 135 μg l 1 on august 21st and then declined which significantly correlated with trends in aphanizomenon r2 0 58 p 0 01 microcystis r2 0 23 p 0 05 and total cyanobacterial abundance r2 0 72 p 0 001 surprisingly ammonium concentrations were relatively high despite high biomass and ranged from 0 22 to 1 25 mg l 1 suggesting phytoplankton growth was most likely p limited absorbance 254 nm turbidity and water color trended with cyanobacterial abundance while other water quality indicators such as alkalinity conductivity hardness and ph were highly variable throughout the study fig 2 similarly no obvious trends existed for total coliforms measured or e coli concentrations at surface water sites at least one mc congener was detected on all dates with mean and max total mc concentrations of 10 2 and 107 μg l 1 respectively across all sites on average total mc was greater than the united states environmental protection agency s epa draft recreational water quality criteria guideline level of 4 μg l 1 d anglada and strong 2016 on 57 of sampling dates based on these criteria lake winnebago should have been closed for recreation for nearly half the summer mclr was the most abundant mc congener with mean and max levels ranging from 7 3 to 10 2 and 42 103 μg l 1 respectively depending on surface water location fig 3 table s2 mclr was detected in 100 of all samples from all sites mcrr was also detected in 100 of all samples except in a few samples at one site and average concentrations 0 73 μg l 1 were approximately ten fold lower than mclr mcyr and mcla were detected less frequently and at average concentrations approximately 100 fold lower than mclr all tbps except cpt1020 were detected in at least one surface water sample in some cases at relatively high maximum concentrations compared to mc congeners for example while mean levels of cpt1007 0 84 μg l 1 were low and nearly the same as mcrr the maximum concentration of cpt1007 detected 14 4 μg l 1 was higher than all mc congeners except for mclr in addition the maximum concentration of cpt1041 at site 1 was similar to that of mcrr or over three times that of mcla and mcyr average concentrations of apts f and b were similar to mcla and mcyr however on average across all surface water sites aptf was the third most frequently detected cyanobacterial metabolite thus apts persisted at a low but constant background level mgn960 was detected infrequently and never exceeded 0 5 μg l 1 with a mean of 0 04 μg l 1 across all sites no significant differences existed between the six sites with regard to abundance of mcs or tbps using anova however some obvious temporal differences did exist for total mc apt and cpt fig s5 for example on day 191 july 10th lake water at site 1 had approximately three times the concentration of observed mc apt and cpt than any of the other lake water sites conversely on days 254 september 11th and 261 september 18th site 4 lake water contained the maximum amount of mc apt and cpt concentrations observed of any site thus while no statistically significant differences were observed between sites over the course of the entire sampling season it was clear that some days at the beginning and end of the season experienced major daily differences 3 2 mcs and tbps in raw dwtp water of the four mc variants measured mclr was the most prominent in the dwtp raw water followed by mcrr mcyr and mcla at both intakes fig 4 in total 74 of all raw dwtp samples had mc concentrations above 0 3 μg l 1 d anglada and strong 2016 there were 11 sample dates 79 of samples at dwtp a where the total mc concentration in raw water was higher than 0 3 μg l 1 similarly mc concentrations were greater than 0 3 μg l 1 on 9 dates 69 of samples at dwtp b no regulations or preliminary guideline values currently exist for mgn690 apts and cpts however cpt1007 concentrations did average above 1 μg l 1 at both dwtps table s2 fig 4 cpt1007 was the most abundant and commonly detected tbp in the dwtps raw water occurring in 62 and 92 of samples collected from dwtp a and b respectively aptb was the next most abundant tbp which was observed in 62 and 54 of samples from dwtp a and b respectively mgn690 was only detected once in dwtp b at 0 06 μg l 1 but interestingly it was not detected in the lake surface water above this intake on the same day we examined differences in mc and tbp concentrations between raw water and surface water sites 1 and 3 above these intakes on average total mc was significantly higher in lake water compared to raw water at both dwtp a p 0 03 and dwtp b p 0 04 with average concentration differences of 7 89 31 5 and 6 29 30 4 μg l 1 respectively fig 5 on one day mc in raw water at dwtp a was 7 5 μg l 1 higher in raw water than lake surface water concentrations at site 1 july 10th and mc in raw water at dwtp b was 1 1 μg l 1 higher than surface water concentrations at site 3 august 7th on average total apt was higher in lake water than raw water at dwtps a and b by concentrations of 0 25 52 7 and 0 27 45 μg l 1 respectively the average total cpt was higher in lake water than raw water at dwtp a 0 83 μg l 1 50 3 but not at dwtp b 0 38 μg l 1 142 neither of those relationships with cpt was significant p 0 05 following a wilcoxon test 3 3 environmental indicators of mcs and tbps at two dwtp intake sites we compared all surface water and meteorological parameters to total mc apt and cpt concentrations at the two dwtps using a pearson correlation coefficient and a significance cutoff of p 0 05 table s5 not surprisingly the majority but not all of the parameters that were correlates of mcs and tbps are indicators of algal biomass at both drinking water intakes total mc was significantly correlated with the largest number of parameters compared to total cpt and apt fig 6 aphanizomenon microcystis chlorophyll a uv absorbance water color silica odor turbidity and manganese all significantly correlated with total mc at dwtp a except in a few cases variables significantly correlating with total mcs at dwtp b overlapped with variables that significantly correlated with total mc at dwtp a total apt had similar but less correlating variables than total mc and at dwtp b only microcystis cell counts were significantly correlated to total apt total cpt was significantly correlated to microcystis absorbance odor coliforms and wind at dwtp b whereas at dwtp a total cpt was significantly correlated with only absorbance color and turbidity 4 discussion to our knowledge this is the first study to investigate individual mc congeners plus multiple tbps in dwtp raw water and surface water some tbps display toxicity in animal models or as in the case of apts also inhibit protein phosphatases like mcs albeit at lower toxicity much attention has been paid to the occurrence of mcs in lakes and drinking water for good reason but by comparison tbps have been largely ignored with respect to drinking water treatment results presented here show that cyanobacterial blooms produce a mixture of peptide classes that enter dwtps the combined toxicity of this mixture is unknown furthermore we have likely only measured a small percentage of the diversity of this peptide mixture more research is needed to delineate the range of tbps produced by cyanobacterial blooms their combined toxicity thresholds and removal efficiency by dwtp processes one of the goals of this study was to survey several sites along northern lake winnebago for future drinking water intake locations currently dwtp a has an intake in the pelagic area of lake winnebago where the max depth is around 4 m and the intake sits about 2 m above the lake bottom dwtp b has an intake pipe at the surface of a baffled embayment of the lower fox river basin to our surprise very little spatial variability was observed at these sites despite having different lake depths and physical characteristics more concerning may be that each surface water site had mc concentrations greater than the epa draft water quality advisory for recreational usage for half the season all mc and tbp concentrations were highly temporally variable both in the lake surface water locations and especially in the raw drinking water for example a sample taken at dwtp a on day 184 july 3rd was 1 μg l 1 for total mc measured in raw water but was 20 μg l 1 only a week later fig 5 total mc dropped to near detection days after thus in order to determine public health risk and respond appropriately daily measurements would be needed putting a huge economic and energetic cost on the dwtp for example the extraction and quantification of even a single cyanotoxin can be extremely costly e g 200 a sample using lc ms ms and take several hours to analyze appropriately for this reason several studies have identified environmental parameters that are indicative of toxin concentrations reviewed in neilan et al 2013 the concentration of mcs reported here are comparable or higher than those reported in other similar lakes in this region in this study the average concentration of mc across all surface water sites and in raw drinking water was 11 19 μg l 1 and 3 2 4 7 μg l 1 studies of lake erie green bay and various sites in ohio show that the concentration of mcs varies from 1 to 3 μg l 1 on average in surface water with large outliers of 1000 μg l 1 common under heavy bloom scenarios and 0 1 6 μg l 1 in raw drinking water as reviewed by miller et al 2017 it is not clear how concentrations of the other tbps reported here compare to other lakes most studies of cyanobacterial peptide diversity have used semi quantitative approaches with exact mass instruments or have quantified peptides in biomass alone whereas in this study we quantified the total peptide concentration in both the biomass and dissolved phase in this study we describe temporal variability in mcs and tbps in surface lake water at dwtp intake sites and simultaneously in dwtp raw water on the same day it should be noted that these measurements include total or bulk water concentrations representing the sum total of both dissolved and particulate tbp few studies to our knowledge have conducted this type of analysis targeting individual congeners of mcs plus multiple other tbps the concentration of mcs in raw water was almost always less than that of lake surface water on the same day fig 5 this might be expected since cyanobacteria typically present positive buoyancy until late autumn when the rate of carbon ballast metabolism slows resulting in cells sinking to the benthos this could be one factor driving higher total mc in surface water compared to raw drinking water at the same location physical forces e g wind waves pushing cells toward the surface could be another factor in addition a higher rate of mc catabolism by heterotrophic bacteria might also occur in the benthos however complicating these explanations is the fact that the intake at dwtp b was close to the lake surface and yet total mc was consistently lower in the raw water thus other factors at the intake may alter the loading of toxin into the dwtp both dwtp intakes were sampled prior to permanganate addition but mechanical screens may alter the type and or amount of cyanobacterial biomass and perhaps the amount of mc entering the intake pipe in contrast cpt and apt concentrations were not significantly lower in raw water compared to lake surface water on the same date fig 5 which might be related to differences in species responsible for producing these compounds while microcystis is the most obvious producer identified in this study dolichospermum has also been shown to produce cpt and apt repka et al 2004 in addition while it is generally understood that the majority of mcs remain inside the cell less is known about whether apt and cpt are actively released from the cells producing them or remain in the intact cell similar to mcs to our knowledge no studies have investigated the removal of tbps from raw drinking water this study shows that the amount of tbp entering drinking water plants is comparable to mcs table 1 for example based on average intake flow rates for the summer mean loadings per day for total mc are 2 75 3 62 g day 1 whereas those for total cpt and apt are only about two fold less and 6 10 fold less respectively thus a significant amount of tbps are entering these dwtps in a previous study of these plants mc was removed to below 0 3 μg l 1 in finished drinking water karner et al 2001 however at that time mean concentrations in raw water was less than 1 μg l 1 whereas mean concentrations reported here are approximately 3 μg l 1 still it is likely that treatment strategies in both plants are able to remove mcs both dwtp a and dwtp b use powdered activated carbon pac which has been shown to adsorb microcystins in an exponential manner over time he et al 2016 for example ho et al show that 22 μg l mc was removed within 30 min when at least 100 mg l 1 of pac was used both plants also use gac which has been shown to remove mc by biodegradative and absorption processes at loading concentrations higher than reported here wang et al 2007 finally ozone and membrane filtration which are implemented at plants a and b respectively have also been shown to remove residual mcs as tertiary treatment processes chang et al 2014 the degree to which these processes are effective in practice may vary with characteristics of the raw water including organic carbon load and ph which has been reviewed extensively elsewhere he et al 2016 hitzfeld et al 2000 hoeger et al 2005 it is not clear if cpts and apts would be removed by these same processes given that they are also circular peptides like mc it may be that they have similar fate and transport pathways both in the environment as well as during drinking water treatment on the other hand some cyanopeptolins like cpt 1041 are chlorinated which may make them more recalcitrant to oxidative processes e g chlorination ozonation future research is needed in this regard a great deal of research has been conducted on cyanobacterial metabolites such as mc anatoxin a atx saxitoxin and cylindrospermopsin cyl but recently much has been learned about the numerous bioactive compounds that accompany the more well known toxins briand et al 2015 elkobi peer and carmeli 2015 gademann et al 2010 gkelis et al 2015 pereira and giani 2014 sadler et al 2014 there are no case studies of human toxicity caused by these compounds but all three are protease inhibitors of eukaryotic enzymes that may alter human physiology silva stenico et al 2012 in addition like mcs some apts also inhibit protein phosphatases sano et al 2001 likewise it has been shown that mc toxicity is not always accounted for by mc concentrations alone chorus 2001 suggesting these additional bioactive compounds could act synergistically with mc to affect human health to what extent apt cpt and or mgn concentrations would have to reach to affect human health is not known nor do any regulations or advisories exist for these compounds in recreational or drinking waters this study highlights the need for more information about dwtp processes that may be effective at removing the diversity of bioactive secondary cyanobacteria metabolites from drinking water mcs and other tbps quantified were not always correlated with each other suggesting that mcs are not necessarily indicators for the presence of other potentially harmful tbps it should be noted that while the tbps targeted in this study have been found to be readily detectable in natural populations gkelis et al 2006 2015 welker et al 2004a these represent only a small portion of the number of tbps that cyanobacteria are capable of producing reviewed in chlipala et al 2011 in this study we asked whether any surface water characteristics correlated to total mc cpt and or apt concentrations in raw drinking water fig 6 many of the parameters that were significantly correlated with tbps may be considered indicators of biomass cell density chlorophyll a absorbance turbidity and or dissolved organic carbon other studies have shown correlations between measures of cyanobacterial biomass and cyanotoxins francy et al 2015 rinta kanto et al 2009 wicks and thiel 1990 it has even been suggested that monitoring algal pigments at dwtp intakes in lake erie may serve as early warning signals for the presence of toxins using biomass as a direct indicator of toxin concentration is complicated by a number of interacting factors the concentration of mc and tbps in aquatic systems is under the control of at least four factors including the rate of synthesis e g transcription translation enzymatic rates the rate of destruction or half life of each compound the proportion of cells that contain mc or tbp biosynthetic genes as well as cyanobacterial abundance among others e g predation accordingly our previous studies as well as those of others in other lakes have shown little to no significant correlations between cell density chlorophyll or even toxin gene abundance and actual mc concentration likely due to these interacting factors e g transcriptional regulation and percent toxicogenic cells beversdorf et al 2015 ye et al 2009 more likely the correlating variables found here are indicators of a bloom and while they were indicators of mc and tbps in this particular study it remains to be determined whether these could serve as reliable indicators from season to season 5 conclusions in this study june through september 2013 all but one sample date was conducted when the temperature was 20 c microcystis and dolichospermum were the most abundant cyanobacteria measured every date had an mc detect and 74 of raw drinking water samples had mc concentrations above the new epa health advisory of 0 3 μg l 1 d anglada and strong 2016 while 57 of surface waters were over the epa draft recreational water quality criteria of 4 μg l 1 all tbps were detected at least once except cpt1020 and loadings into drinking water treatment intakes of cpts and apts were comparable to that of mcs these results suggest that removal efficiency of tbps by drinking water treatment processes should be investigated surface water quality characteristics that significantly correlated with mcs and tbps in raw water

19542,freshwater cyanobacterial blooms are becoming increasingly problematic in regions that rely on surface waters for drinking water production microcystins mcs are toxic peptides produced by multiple cyanobacterial genera with a global occurrence cyanobacteria also produce a variety of other toxic and or otherwise bioactive peptides tbps that have gained less attention including cyanopeptolins cpts anabaenopeptins apts and microginins mgn in this study we compared temporal and spatial trends of four mcs mclr mcrr mcyr mcla three cpts cpt1020 cpt1041 cpt1007 two apts aptf aptb and mgn690 in raw drinking water and at six surface water locations above these drinking water intakes in a eutrophic lake all four mc congeners and five of six tbps were detected in lake and raw drinking water across all samples mclr was the most frequently detected metabolite 100 of samples followed by mcrr 97 cpt1007 74 mcyr 69 aptf 67 mcla 61 aptb 54 mgn690 29 and cpt1041 15 mean concentrations of mcs apts and cpts into two drinking water intakes were 3 9 4 7 0 14 0 21 and 0 38 0 92 respectively mean concentrations in surface water were significantly higher p 0 05 than in drinking water intakes for mcs but not for cpts and apts temporal trends in mcs cpts and apts in the two raw drinking water intakes were significantly correlated p 0 05 with measures of cell abundance chlorophyll a microcystis cell density uv absorbance and turbidity in surface water this study expands current information about cyanobacterial tbps that occur in lakes and that enter drinking water treatment plants and underscores the need to determine the fate of less studied cyanobacterial metabolites during drinking water treatment that may exacerbate toxicity of more well known cyanobacterial toxins graphical abstract image 1 keywords microcystis dolichospermum aphanizomenon microcystin cyanopeptolin anabaenopeptin 1 introduction increased occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms commonly known as blue green algae has created growing concerns over global freshwater sustainability cyanobacterial blooms negatively affect fisheries recreational angling boating and swimming property values and animal and human health recent evidence indicates that an increasing number of lakes and rivers in the united states are becoming hypereutrophic and thus capable of supporting dense and or frequent cyanobacterial blooms dodds et al 2009 furthermore climate and land use change predictions suggest increased intensity and occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater resources worldwide balbus et al 2013 paerl and huisman 2009 bloom forming cyanobacteria produce a number of linear and circular peptides with varying degrees of potential toxicity in animals and humans microcystins mcs are cyclic heptapeptides that inhibit eukaryotic serine threonine protein phosphatases 1 and 2a mackintosh et al 1990 primarily in the liver but also in other tissues feurstein et al 2009 fischer et al 2005 at oral doses above 40 μg kg 1 body weight mcs induce cellular lysis of liver cells and tissue necrosis fawell et al 1999 in addition some evidence suggests that mcs can cross the blood brain barrier acting as a neurotoxin affecting learning and memory feurstein et al 2009 fischer et al 2005 li et al 2014 in repeat oral dose rodent studies mcs display toxicity to male reproductive organs chen et al 2011 ultimately the tissue types affected by mcs are dictated by the distribution of organic anion transporting polypeptides responsible for mc uptake into eukaryotic cells feurstein et al 2009 hagenbuch and gui 2008 meier abt et al 2007 in addition to their acute effects mcs are tumor promoters and possible carcinogens as defined by the international agency for research on cancer agudo et al 2010 in chronic exposure studies mcs have produced tumors in mice and rats andrew r humpage 2000 falconer and humpage 1996 nishiwaki matsushima et al 1992 and an increasing number of human epidemiological studies have suggested that chronic low dose exposure to mc may contribute to the burden of liver and colorectal cancers in some populations fleming et al 2002 li et al 2011 lun et al 2002 svircev et al 2009 zhou et al 2002 mechanistic studies of phosphatase inhibitors have shown that tumor production is due to a disruption in cellular signaling pathways leading to unbalanced cell growth reviewed in gehringer 2004 cyanobacteria that form blooms in lakes also produce hundreds of other peptides with molecular targets in eukaryotic cells that may or may not be considered toxic sivonen et al 2010 welker and von dohren 2006 for purposes of this study we call these toxic or otherwise bioactive peptides or tbps approximately 90 of the currently known tbps can be classified as anabaenopeptins aeruginosins cryptophycins cyanopeptolins cyclamides microginins and microviridins chlipala et al 2011 many of these tbps inhibit one or more proteases in eukaryotes and have been explored as potential sources of new drugs for example aeruginosins have been shown to inhibit trypsin thrombin and plasmin and therefore may be useful in treating myocardial infarction and stroke ersmark et al 2008 radau et al 2003 the linear pentapeptide microginin 690 mgn690 has been shown to inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme okino et al 1993 and thus may be useful in treating high blood pressure in humans bagchi et al 2015 anabaenopeptins have been found to inhibit carboxypeptidase a and like mcs also inhibit protein phosphatases but with ten fold lower potency namikoshi and rinehart 1996 sano et al 2001 the cyanopeptolins cpt inhibit serine proteases such as human kallikrein and chymotrypsin which may be useful in treating certain cancers borgono and diamandis 2004 or as anti viral agents singh et al 2011 while some of these tbps may be promising sources of new drugs their occurrence in surface waters is potentially problematic for ecological and human health for example one of the most prevalent bloom forming genera are microcystis species which possesses at least 15 genetic loci coding for non ribosomal peptide synthetases and polyketides kaneko et al 2007 as such in addition to mcs a variety of other tbp classes of potential importance to human health have been isolated from microcystis species for example recently cyanopeptolin 1020 cpt1020 isolated from m aeruginosa uv 006 was shown to affect chitin synthesis in freshwater fairy shrimp gademann et al 2010 and displayed neurotoxicity in a zebra fish study at levels similar to other acutely acting cyanotoxins e g mcs faltermann et al 2014 similarly two new cyclamides isolated from microcystis species display toxicity against the freshwater crustacean thamnocephalus platyurus with a potency approximately an order of magnitude lower than that of mcs portmann et al 2008 while anabaenopeptins inhibit protein phosphatases at lower potencies in recent studies they have been shown to co occur with mcs at equal or higher levels beversdorf et al 2017 thus multiple tbps may be produced by bloom forming microcystis species in addition to the well described mcs and some of these tbps may be considered emerging cyanotoxins the temporal and spatial distribution of tbps other than mcs in lakes has not been well described many studies to date have used non targeted mass spectrometry approaches e g maldi tof to characterize peptide diversity in cultures single samples of bloom material or cyanobacterial colonies welker et al 2004a welker and erhard 2007 welker et al 2002 welker and von dohren 2006 fastner et al 2001 these studies have revealed that cyanobacteria produce a great diversity of bioactive peptides among those studies providing some spatial or temporal data in a study of 165 individual colonies from seven lakes on two dates in germany welker et al identified 46 different cyanobacterial peptides the majority of which were mcs apts cpts microginins and aeruginosins including some novel peptides welker et al 2004b gkelis et al surveyed mcs and apts in 36 lakes using hplc on either multiple dates or one date and found that in addition to mc rr and mc lr apt b and apt a were dominant in some lakes but relative to mcs occurred more sporadically gkelis et al 2015 in a previous study of six eutrophic lakes using tandem mass spectrometry we showed that the production of apts and cpts in lakes is highly variable over time and do not necessarily follow the same temporal trajectory and spatial distribution as mcs beversdorf et al 2017 in this study we describe the concentration and co occurrence of mcs and a suite of tbps at drinking water intakes and at six surface water locations in eutrophic lake winnebago wisconsin with two of the locations sampled at depths above the drinking water treatment plant dwtp intake pipes fig 1 we simultaneously monitored these mcs and tbps in raw intake water prior to any chemical addition from the two dwtps along with seventeen water quality parameters that are typically already measured by dwtps our goal was to 1 compare lake water and raw intake drinking water concentrations of mcs and tbps 2 determine the rate of co occurrence between mcs and tbps in lake and intake water and 3 identify any water quality parameters indicative of the occurrence of mcs and tbps in raw intake water using multiple regression analysis indicators of particularly mcs in raw intake water may be useful given recent health advisories for these particular cyanotoxins in finished drinking water d anglada and strong 2016 our data suggest that multiple tbps co occur with mcs in lake and intake water in this location some standard water quality parameters were indicative of mcs and tbp concentration in raw intake water 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sample collection lake winnebago is a eutrophic lake located in eastern wisconsin it is the largest freshwater lake within wisconsin at 557 3 km2 6 4 m mean depth and is primarily fed by the upper fox and wolf river basins through lakes poygan winneconne and butte des morts lake winnebago suffers from chronic noxious cyanobacterial blooms due to nonpoint source pollution and also contributes approximately 20 of lake michigan s annual phosphorus loading via the green bay and lower fox river klump et al 1997

water source for over a quarter million people in the oshkosh neenah menasha appleton metropolitan areas weekly surface lake water samples were collected at 0 5 m depth from six lake winnebago sites near the cities of neenah menasha and appleton between june 26th and september 25th 2013 fig 1 two of the six surface lake water sites were sampled at depths above the intakes for two different dwtps labeled dwtp a and dwtp b the intake for dwtp a is close to the surface while dwtp b intake is approximately 2 m from the lake bottom the mean intake rate in the summer for dwtp a and dwtp b is 75 7

both plants permanganate is added at the intake to raw drinking water at both plants to inhibit the growth of dreissenids in the crib and intake pipes water samples were collected at the intakes of dwtp a and dwtp b herein referred to as raw water on the same dates lake samples were collected samples at the intake were taken using the low lift pumps used to transfer water to the plant samples

magnification was needed to identify cyanobacteria which were identified to genus focusing on the dominant groups dolichospermum aphanizomenon and microcystis 2 5 statistical analysis all analyses were conducted in matlab site comparisons were analyzed using the kruskal wallis test and analysis of variance anova and comparisons explicitly between raw water and drinking water were compared using the wilcoxon test pearson correlations were used to compare temporal variability of cyanotoxins to tbps and to environmental variables prior to the analysis anon detects were set to one half of the estimated detection limit and all variables log transformed 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variation in lake surface water characteristics all six surface water sites were located at the north end of lake winnebago fig 1 some sites were pelagic with others near shore and water depths ranged from 1 0 to 4 5 m despite these differences little spatial variability was observed in the 18 environmental parameters and nine mcs tbps detected and quantified between the six sites sampled fig 2 tables s1 and s2 only manganese and e coli concentrations had significant differences between the six sites p 0 05 kruskal wallis table s1 similarity between sites could likely be due to the lake being shallow and polymictic i e well mixed water temperature was above 20 c at all sites for the duration of the study with the exception of the last date sampled september 25th fig 2 over the same time period chlorophyll a increased to 135 μg l 1 on august 21st and then declined which significantly correlated with trends in aphanizomenon r2 0 58 p 0 01 microcystis r2 0 23 p 0 05 and total cyanobacterial abundance r2 0 72 p 0 001 surprisingly ammonium concentrations were relatively high despite high biomass and ranged from 0 22 to 1 25 mg l 1 suggesting phytoplankton growth was most likely p limited absorbance 254 nm turbidity and water color trended with cyanobacterial abundance while other water quality indicators such as alkalinity conductivity hardness and ph were highly variable throughout the study fig 2 similarly no obvious trends existed for total coliforms measured or e coli concentrations at surface water sites at least one mc congener was detected on all dates with mean and max total mc concentrations of 10 2 and 107 μg l 1 respectively across all sites on average total mc was greater than the united states environmental protection agency s epa draft recreational water quality criteria guideline level of 4 μg l 1 d anglada and strong 2016 on 57 of sampling dates based on these criteria lake winnebago should have been closed for recreation for nearly half the summer mclr was the most abundant mc congener with mean and max levels ranging from 7 3 to 10 2 and 42 103 μg l 1 respectively depending on surface water location fig 3 table s2 mclr was detected in 100 of all samples from all sites mcrr was also detected in 100 of all samples except in a few samples at one site and average concentrations 0 73 μg l 1 were approximately ten fold lower than mclr mcyr and mcla were detected less frequently and at average concentrations approximately 100 fold lower than mclr all tbps except cpt1020 were detected in at least one surface water sample in some cases at relatively high maximum concentrations compared to mc congeners for example while mean levels of cpt1007 0 84 μg l 1 were low and nearly the same as mcrr the maximum concentration of cpt1007 detected 14 4 μg l 1 was higher than all mc congeners except for mclr in addition the maximum concentration of cpt1041 at site 1 was similar to that of mcrr or over three times that of mcla and mcyr average concentrations of apts f and b were similar to mcla and mcyr however on average across all surface water sites aptf was the third most frequently detected cyanobacterial metabolite thus apts persisted at a low but constant background level mgn960 was detected infrequently and never exceeded 0 5 μg l 1 with a mean of 0 04 μg l 1 across all sites no significant differences existed between the six sites with regard to abundance of mcs or tbps using anova however some obvious temporal differences did exist for total mc apt and cpt fig s5 for example on day 191 july 10th lake water at site 1 had approximately three times the concentration of observed mc apt and cpt than any of the other lake water sites conversely on days 254 september 11th and 261 september 18th site 4 lake water contained the maximum amount of mc apt and cpt concentrations observed of any site thus while no statistically significant differences were observed between sites over the course of the entire sampling season it was clear that some days at the beginning and end of the season experienced major daily differences 3 2 mcs and tbps in raw dwtp water of the four mc variants measured mclr was the most prominent in the dwtp raw water followed by mcrr mcyr and mcla at both intakes fig 4 in total 74 of all raw dwtp samples had mc concentrations above 0 3 μg l 1 d anglada and strong 2016 there were 11 sample dates 79 of samples at dwtp a where the total mc concentration in raw water was higher than 0 3 μg l 1 similarly mc concentrations were greater than 0 3 μg l 1 on 9 dates 69 of samples at dwtp b no regulations or preliminary guideline values currently exist for mgn690 apts and cpts however cpt1007 concentrations did average above 1 μg l 1 at both dwtps table s2 fig 4 cpt1007 was the most abundant and commonly detected tbp in the dwtps raw water occurring in 62 and 92 of samples collected from dwtp a and b respectively aptb was the next most abundant tbp which was observed in 62 and 54 of samples from dwtp a and b respectively mgn690 was only detected once in dwtp b at 0 06 μg l 1 but interestingly it was not detected in the lake surface water above this intake on the same day we examined differences in mc and tbp concentrations between raw water and surface water sites 1 and 3 above these intakes on average total mc was significantly higher in lake water compared to raw water at both dwtp a p 0 03 and dwtp b p 0 04 with average concentration differences of 7 89 31 5 and 6 29 30 4 μg l 1 respectively fig 5 on one day mc in raw water at dwtp a was 7 5 μg l 1 higher in raw water than lake surface water concentrations at site 1 july 10th and mc in raw water at dwtp b was 1 1 μg l 1 higher than surface water concentrations at site 3 august 7th on average total apt was higher in lake water than raw water at dwtps a and b by concentrations of 0 25 52 7 and 0 27 45 μg l 1 respectively the average total cpt was higher in lake water than raw water at dwtp a 0 83 μg l 1 50 3 but not at dwtp b 0 38 μg l 1 142 neither of those relationships with cpt was significant p 0 05 following a wilcoxon test 3 3 environmental indicators of mcs and tbps at two dwtp intake sites we compared all surface water and meteorological parameters to total mc apt and cpt concentrations at the two dwtps using a pearson correlation coefficient and a significance cutoff of p 0 05 table s5 not surprisingly the majority but not all of the parameters that were correlates of mcs and tbps are indicators of algal biomass at both drinking water intakes total mc was significantly correlated with the largest number of parameters compared to total cpt and apt fig 6 aphanizomenon microcystis chlorophyll a uv absorbance water color silica odor turbidity and manganese all significantly correlated with total mc at dwtp a except in a few cases variables significantly correlating with total mcs at dwtp b overlapped with variables that significantly correlated with total mc at dwtp a total apt had similar but less correlating variables than total mc and at dwtp b only microcystis cell counts were significantly correlated to total apt total cpt was significantly correlated to microcystis absorbance odor coliforms and wind at dwtp b whereas at dwtp a total cpt was significantly correlated with only absorbance color and turbidity 4 discussion to our knowledge this is the first study to investigate individual mc congeners plus multiple tbps in dwtp raw water and surface water some tbps display toxicity in animal models or as in the case of apts also inhibit protein phosphatases like mcs albeit at lower toxicity much attention has been paid to the occurrence of mcs in lakes and drinking water for good reason but by comparison tbps have been largely ignored with respect to drinking water treatment results presented here show that cyanobacterial blooms produce a mixture of peptide classes that enter dwtps the combined toxicity of this mixture is unknown furthermore we have likely only measured a small percentage of the diversity of this peptide mixture more research is needed to delineate the range of tbps produced by cyanobacterial blooms their combined toxicity thresholds and removal efficiency by dwtp processes one of the goals of this study was to survey several sites along northern lake winnebago for future drinking water intake locations currently dwtp a has an intake in the pelagic area of lake winnebago where the max depth is around 4 m and the intake sits about 2 m above the lake bottom dwtp b has an intake pipe at the surface of a baffled embayment of the lower fox river basin to our surprise very little spatial variability was observed at these sites despite having different lake depths and physical characteristics more concerning may be that each surface water site had mc concentrations greater than the epa draft water quality advisory for recreational usage for half the season all mc and tbp concentrations were highly temporally variable both in the lake surface water locations and especially in the raw drinking water for example a sample taken at dwtp a on day 184 july 3rd was 1 μg l 1 for total mc measured in raw water but was 20 μg l 1 only a week later fig 5 total mc dropped to near detection days after thus in order to determine public health risk and respond appropriately daily measurements would be needed putting a huge economic and energetic cost on the dwtp for example the extraction and quantification of even a single cyanotoxin can be extremely costly e g 200 a sample using lc ms ms and take several hours to analyze appropriately for this reason several studies have identified environmental parameters that are indicative of toxin concentrations reviewed in neilan et al 2013 the concentration of mcs reported here are comparable or higher than those reported in other similar lakes in this region in this study the average concentration of mc across all surface water sites and in raw drinking water was 11 19 μg l 1 and 3 2 4 7 μg l 1 studies of lake erie green bay and various sites in ohio show that the concentration of mcs varies from 1 to 3 μg l 1 on average in surface water with large outliers of 1000 μg l 1 common under heavy bloom scenarios and 0 1 6 μg l 1 in raw drinking water as reviewed by miller et al 2017 it is not clear how concentrations of the other tbps reported here compare to other lakes most studies of cyanobacterial peptide diversity have used semi quantitative approaches with exact mass instruments or have quantified peptides in biomass alone whereas in this study we quantified the total peptide concentration in both the biomass and dissolved phase in this study we describe temporal variability in mcs and tbps in surface lake water at dwtp intake sites and simultaneously in dwtp raw water on the same day it should be noted that these measurements include total or bulk water concentrations representing the sum total of both dissolved and particulate tbp few studies to our knowledge have conducted this type of analysis targeting individual congeners of mcs plus multiple other tbps the concentration of mcs in raw water was almost always less than that of lake surface water on the same day fig 5 this might be expected since cyanobacteria typically present positive buoyancy until late autumn when the rate of carbon ballast metabolism slows resulting in cells sinking to the benthos this could be one factor driving higher total mc in surface water compared to raw drinking water at the same location physical forces e g wind waves pushing cells toward the surface could be another factor in addition a higher rate of mc catabolism by heterotrophic bacteria might also occur in the benthos however complicating these explanations is the fact that the intake at dwtp b was close to the lake surface and yet total mc was consistently lower in the raw water thus other factors at the intake may alter the loading of toxin into the dwtp both dwtp intakes were sampled prior to permanganate addition but mechanical screens may alter the type and or amount of cyanobacterial biomass and perhaps the amount of mc entering the intake pipe in contrast cpt and apt concentrations were not significantly lower in raw water compared to lake surface water on the same date fig 5 which might be related to differences in species responsible for producing these compounds while microcystis is the most obvious producer identified in this study dolichospermum has also been shown to produce cpt and apt repka et al 2004 in addition while it is generally understood that the majority of mcs remain inside the cell less is known about whether apt and cpt are actively released from the cells producing them or remain in the intact cell similar to mcs to our knowledge no studies have investigated the removal of tbps from raw drinking water this study shows that the amount of tbp entering drinking water plants is comparable to mcs table 1 for example based on average intake flow rates for the summer mean loadings per day for total mc are 2 75 3 62 g day 1 whereas those for total cpt and apt are only about two fold less and 6 10 fold less respectively thus a significant amount of tbps are entering these dwtps in a previous study of these plants mc was removed to below 0 3 μg l 1 in finished drinking water karner et al 2001 however at that time mean concentrations in raw water was less than 1 μg l 1 whereas mean concentrations reported here are approximately 3 μg l 1 still it is likely that treatment strategies in both plants are able to remove mcs both dwtp a and dwtp b use powdered activated carbon pac which has been shown to adsorb microcystins in an exponential manner over time he et al 2016 for example ho et al show that 22 μg l mc was removed within 30 min when at least 100 mg l 1 of pac was used both plants also use gac which has been shown to remove mc by biodegradative and absorption processes at loading concentrations higher than reported here wang et al 2007 finally ozone and membrane filtration which are implemented at plants a and b respectively have also been shown to remove residual mcs as tertiary treatment processes chang et al 2014 the degree to which these processes are effective in practice may vary with characteristics of the raw water including organic carbon load and ph which has been reviewed extensively elsewhere he et al 2016 hitzfeld et al 2000 hoeger et al 2005 it is not clear if cpts and apts would be removed by these same processes given that they are also circular peptides like mc it may be that they have similar fate and transport pathways both in the environment as well as during drinking water treatment on the other hand some cyanopeptolins like cpt 1041 are chlorinated which may make them more recalcitrant to oxidative processes e g chlorination ozonation future research is needed in this regard a great deal of research has been conducted on cyanobacterial metabolites such as mc anatoxin a atx saxitoxin and cylindrospermopsin cyl but recently much has been learned about the numerous bioactive compounds that accompany the more well known toxins briand et al 2015 elkobi peer and carmeli 2015 gademann et al 2010 gkelis et al 2015 pereira and giani 2014 sadler et al 2014 there are no case studies of human toxicity caused by these compounds but all three are protease inhibitors of eukaryotic enzymes that may alter human physiology silva stenico et al 2012 in addition like mcs some apts also inhibit protein phosphatases sano et al 2001 likewise it has been shown that mc toxicity is not always accounted for by mc concentrations alone chorus 2001 suggesting these additional bioactive compounds could act synergistically with mc to affect human health to what extent apt cpt and or mgn concentrations would have to reach to affect human health is not known nor do any regulations or advisories exist for these compounds in recreational or drinking waters this study highlights the need for more information about dwtp processes that may be effective at removing the diversity of bioactive secondary cyanobacteria metabolites from drinking water mcs and other tbps quantified were not always correlated with each other suggesting that mcs are not necessarily indicators for the presence of other potentially harmful tbps it should be noted that while the tbps targeted in this study have been found to be readily detectable in natural populations gkelis et al 2006 2015 welker et al 2004a these represent only a small portion of the number of tbps that cyanobacteria are capable of producing reviewed in chlipala et al 2011 in this study we asked whether any surface water characteristics correlated to total mc cpt and or apt concentrations in raw drinking water fig 6 many of the parameters that were significantly correlated with tbps may be considered indicators of biomass cell density chlorophyll a absorbance turbidity and or dissolved organic carbon other studies have shown correlations between measures of cyanobacterial biomass and cyanotoxins francy et al 2015 rinta kanto et al 2009 wicks and thiel 1990 it has even been suggested that monitoring algal pigments at dwtp intakes in lake erie may serve as early warning signals for the presence of toxins using biomass as a direct indicator of toxin concentration is complicated by a number of interacting factors the concentration of mc and tbps in aquatic systems is under the control of at least four factors including the rate of synthesis e g transcription translation enzymatic rates the rate of destruction or half life of each compound the proportion of cells that contain mc or tbp biosynthetic genes as well as cyanobacterial abundance among others e g predation accordingly our previous studies as well as those of others in other lakes have shown little to no significant correlations between cell density chlorophyll or even toxin gene abundance and actual mc concentration likely due to these interacting factors e g transcriptional regulation and percent toxicogenic cells beversdorf et al 2015 ye et al 2009 more likely the correlating variables found here are indicators of a bloom and while they were indicators of mc and tbps in this particular study it remains to be determined whether these could serve as reliable indicators from season to season 5 conclusions in this study june through september 2013 all but one sample date was conducted when the temperature was 20 c microcystis and dolichospermum were the most abundant cyanobacteria measured every date had an mc detect and 74 of raw drinking water samples had mc concentrations above the new epa health advisory of 0 3 μg l 1 d anglada and strong 2016 while 57 of surface waters were over the epa draft recreational water quality criteria of 4 μg l 1 all tbps were detected at least once except cpt1020 and loadings into drinking water treatment intakes of cpts and apts were comparable to that of mcs these results suggest that removal efficiency of tbps by drinking water treatment processes should be investigated surface water quality characteristics that significantly correlated with mcs and tbps in raw water

19543,pharmaceutically active compounds phacs are recognized as one of the most serious emerging micropollutants wastewater treatment plants are the major way through which such contaminants enter the environment therefore an appropriate management of phacs in these facilities can reduce their release into the environment in particular a proper sampling methodology is necessary to identify and quantify micropollutants in wastewater in this study 37 pharmaceuticals including 23 antibiotics are investigated in eight major wastewater treatment plants in beijing an optimized sampling methodology is successfully implemented to monitor bihourly variation of the contaminants thus averting uncertainties derived from conventional sampling methods in this way more accurate pharmaceutical load patterns are determined and discussed thanks to the synchronous data on pharmaceutical concentration and wastewater flow we also compare performances of various treatment processes and optimize different calculation methods for removal efficiency graphical abstract image 1 keywords pharmaceuticals wwtp intraday load hydraulic retention time removal efficiency source marker 1 introduction pharmaceutically active compounds phacs including antibiotics psychiatric drugs beta blocker anti inflammatory lipid regulators etc are widely used in the world de jesus gaffney et al 2015 tiwari et al 2017 these compounds present dissimilar physicochemical properties such as volatility hydrophobicity absorbability and complex structures hence they tend to have different fates in the environment varying from relatively rapid physicochemical and biological transformations to high persistence daughton and ternes 1999 tiwari et al 2017 due to production and use increase in recent decades phacs have been ubiquitously detected in abiotic and biotic media often in very low concentrations although such chemicals are referred to as micro pollutants they can enter the food chain from surface ground water and sediments and through aquatic organisms accumulate even in human tissues ellis 2006 collier 2007 khetan and collins 2007 lapworth et al 2012 wang and chu 2016 moreover in spite of their low concentrations evidence of their post therapeutic effects on non target organisms in aquatic environment is building up jones et al 2005 fent et al 2006 these facts together with a lack of complete understanding on phacs environmental impact make these micro pollutants one of the most challenging environmental issues nowadays excessive consumption and improper disposal of unused pharmaceuticals lead to pharmaceuticals buildup in municipal sewage wastewater treatment plants wwtps are the final receptors of such emerging organic pollutants which are expected to remove them from the wastewater however the removal efficiencies can vary greatly depending not only on physiochemical properties of the compounds but also on the employed technologies for the treatment batt et al 2007 xu et al 2007 tran et al 2016 a major consequence of insufficient treatment is that considerable amounts of pharmaceuticals are discharged into waterbodies causing diffusion in almost all aquatic environments and even in drinking water sources wilkinson et al 2017 yang et al 2017 china is now the largest producer and consumer of pharmaceuticals bu et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 report that the total use of 36 major antibiotics surpassed 90 000 tons in 2013 and 53 800 tons entered the environment nearly half of them were brought into receiving waters passing through wwtps thus inevitably leading to serious contamination reliable information on antibiotic mass load variation and removal efficiencies in wwtps are necessary even more so in large metropolises it is fundamental to improve pharmaceutical containing wastewater treatment and management for example beijing is one of the most densely populated regions in the world and its population might be exposed to risks caused by various contaminants ma et al 2017 a large number of studies have investigated analytical methods temporal occurrences removal efficiencies treatment technologies and subsequent environmental impact of antibiotics in wwtps among them uncertainty of sampling methodologies has long been considered a dominant source of uncertainty in many applications and far greater than the uncertainty due to chemical analysis ort et al 2010a b on one hand grab sampling protocol the most frequently utilized one is proven to bring about significant uncertainties on the other hand 24 h composite sampling commonly reported as a complementary methodology ashfaq et al 2017 produces results that are not representative enough to describe short term variations ternes and joss 2007 both methodologies could be unsuitable to achieve a clear and complete picture of micropollution in wastewater as well as their fate in wwtps in order to address this problem we aimed to design a bihourly averaged composite sampling methodology for pharmaceutical analysis in major wwtps in beijing such a protocol would allow a more accurate evaluation of temporal variations than grab sampling which could facilitate the study of dynamic changes through hydraulic retention time hrt at both ends of wwtps also the complete information obtained by the proposed sampling facilitates evaluating the performance of the various treatment processes under study and to compare different methodologies for the calculation of wwtp removal efficiencies this work could provide more accurate information concerning pharmaceuticals in wwtps in china and help future researches on micropollutants by reducing uncertainties in sampling and analysis procedures 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards reagents and other materials 37 target compounds including 23 antibiotics and 14 other non antibiotic pharmaceuticals were selected on the basis of previously reported priority lists of phacs removal performance in

taken to be one half of the detection limit antweiler and taylor 2008 the hrt information was directly acquired from wwtps and detailed information is given in si 1 2 4 the surface water data were acquired from our previous study ma et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and impact 3 1 1 occurrence and concentration a first glimpse is given to the pharmaceuticals and then a more specific discussion on antibiotics is done pharmaceuticals were determined at levels from a few to hundreds of ng l 1 table s7 in some cases ketoprofen kp and acetaminophen atp can be observed at concentrations of several μg l 1 in the influent as often detected in previous studies caffeine cf is the most abundant in influents sui et al 2010 ma et al 2017 which reached 60 μg l 1 in all effluents metoprolol mtp kp n n diethyl meta toluamide deet and carbamazepine cbz are the most abundant pharmaceuticals figure s4 such data demonstrate that most analytes are effectively removed especially the highly concentrated ones i e cf kp and atp on contrary sulpiride sp mtp cbz and mefenamic acid ma are relatively recalcitrant concentration heat map fig 2 shows spatial inter plants and temporal intraday variations of target pharmaceuticals therefore comparison among compounds is not suitable which is shown in figure s4 in the influent the higher concentrations red color of individual drugs are mainly found in wwtp c d e f and g revealing that corresponding compounds may be largely consumed in those catchment areas concentration hot spots in wwtp a 19 00 21 00 and in wwtp d 17 00 19 00 are extremely noteworthy because they might be due to one time event of direct disposal petrie et al 2016 in the effluents high concentrations are observed in wwtp g and c suggesting poor pharmaceutical removal efficiencies a closer look at time variation indicates complex use pattern for each drug and a generic trend is difficult to identify figure s8 this is very likely due to different uses of the various investigated drugs hence the large class of antibiotics is investigated in the present study with greater detail because more significant data are obtained about such compounds in the influents of 7 out of 8 wwtps 21 out of 23 commonly used antibiotics table 1 were detected in wwtp h the large majority of antibiotic concentrations are below detection limits so such data are not considered for discussion most antibiotics except for tyrosin tartrate ts sulfisomidine sim sulfamethoxypyridazine smp sulfaquinoxaline sqx sulfamethizole smz and sulfamonomethoxine sm are determined in more than half of the samples notably ts and sm are observed only in wwtp g with quite high concentrations other minor sulfonamides are mainly found in wwtp d e and f with concentrations of several ng l 1 although the compositional profiles of influents varied among wwtps clarithromycin cam sulfamethoxazole smx roxithromycin rxm lincomycin lcm and erythromycin em tend to be the most abundant antibiotics figure s4 with average concentration of each compound over 300 ng l 1 among them cam had the highest concentration with an average concentration of 521 ng l 1 levels of most sulfonamides except smx range from 1 5 to 80 of ng l 1 which could be the result of their less consumption in beijing smx concentration is high 459 ng l 1 consistent with its frequent use for both human and livestock ma et al 2017 wwtp b was found to be the most heavily loaded plant with a total antibiotic concentration of 4248 ng l 1 which is twice as much as the value in the other wwtps according to the concentration heat map fig 3 sulfonamides are found in higher amounts in wwtp e and f highlighted by dashed red box while most of the other antibiotics showed high concentrations in the influent of wwtp c in the effluents chlortetracycline ctc sulfamerazine smr and sulfisoxazole six were greatly reduced to be below their detection limits in the majority of samples those antibiotics with very low inflent concentration viz ts sim smp sqx smz and sm were also not observed in the effluents however sulfamethoxypyridazine smp and six can still be found in wwtp a and b with concentrations ranging from 1 2 to 100 ng l 1 smx lcm and cam are the most concentrated antibiotics in the effluents figure s4 with average concentrations of 125 107 and 105 ng l 1 respectively most sulfonamides were below detection limit after treatment but sulfadiazine sd was found to be 30 ng l 1 on average in wwtp a b and g as only observed in wwtp g fig 3 ts was reduced to 71 ng l 1 on the contrary sm was almost removed from wastewater after treatment few kinds of antibiotics can be detected but removal efficiencies strongly depend on treatment technologies for instance in wwtp a and b employing the treatment process i table 2 just 3 antibiotics were removed to be below their detection limits in the effluent while for the plants utilizing the treatment process ii 7 antibiotics were removed to be undetectable in the effluent in fact after treatment wwtp c was still the one with most abundant antibiotics 2693 ng l 1 followed by wwtp a 1491 ng l 1 as highlighted by dashed blue box in fig 3 differently total concentrations were effectively lowered to hundreds of ng l 1 in the other plants such diversity in removal efficiencies will be discussed in paragraph 3 3 3 1 2 environmental impact in order to highlight the impact of wwtp emissions on surface water pollution phac concentrations in the water bodies that receive treated water discharge are compared fig 4 specifically the multi layer rose diagrams depict phac concentrations in receiving surface water top layer effluents middle layer and influents bottom layer it can be seen that surface water concentrations are roughly overlappable with those of effluents yet effluent emission of some micro pollutants e g gemfibrozil gf and propranolol ppn cannot explain the higher concentrations found in the river thus suggesting further sources indeed it was found that in beijing area untreated wastewater is one of the major sources of surface water pollution wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 especially it was reported that 238 million tons of wastewater entered natural surface water without proper treatment in 2015 zhang et al 2016 besides the diagrams highlight the suspect that the high level in surface water of some phacs e g cp compared to that in the corresponding effluent might be due to illegal discharge 3 2 load analysis in the last decade it has been highlighted the importance of emission behaviors and environmental load patterns of micro pollutants ort et al 2010a 2010b load is actually the rigorous way to express the amounts and variations of dissolved compounds in wwtp streams and its approximation to the concentrations is acceptable only for highly concentrated compounds in order to avoid the uncertainty caused by flow variation and thus achieve reliable data micro pollutant occurrence could be better expressed as load moreover load can directly show how and when the phacs are consumed or discharged petrie et al 2016 the load was calculated according to the following equation 1 l o a d i g c a v e t i ng l 1 q c i m 3 10 6 where load i is the cumulative pharmaceutical load in 2 h influents or effluents cave t i is 2 h average concentration of a kind of phacs and q c i is 2 h cumulative flow quantity 3 2 1 generic pharmaceuticals in order to obtain a clear portrait of the general situation of pharmaceuticals and avoid the disproportional influence of pharmaceutical groups 3 typical antibiotics tp na and cp were studied together with the other 14 non antibiotics as the group of generic pharmaceuticals heat map and cluster analyses detailed in si were applied to explore the load patterns fig 5 i clearly shows difference between diurnal and nocturnal load in influents especially compared with the effluents ii specifically high load occurs from 11 a m to 3 a m because of residence time delay in sewer system estimated to range from 1 to 6 h this is likely due to diurnal waking hour consumption in the catchment areas on the other hand load from 3 a m to 11 a m can be recognized as nocturnal discharge sleeping hour as shown by fig 5 ii load patterns in effluents seem to have no special trend but variation can be observed such a situation could be the results of multiple reasons for example initial concentration fluctuation water characteristics and operational conditions of treatment facilities joss et al 2006 batt et al 2007 gur reznik et al 2011 detailed in si 5 effluent load and variation thanks to the cluster analysis the load distribution could be divided into 3 fluctuating patterns fig 5 i the first group wwtp a b and h showed a unimodal model fig 5 iii the second group wwtp d e and f seemed to follow the pattern of the first group but shows an abrupt peak at the interval 23 1 fig 5 iv and the third group wwtp c and g displayed a multimodal distribution fig 5 v these trends should be direct consequences of drug discharge in corresponding catchments ternes and joss 2007 van nuijs et al 2011 petrie et al 2016 since all the studied wwtps are designed to receive and treat domestic wastewater the major source for the influents could be human discharge which is although after human metabolism a direct reflection of drug use habits ort et al 2010b zheng et al 2017 therefore these influents can be ideal target to study the human behaviors on the wwtps serving areas however because of the variety of the investigated pharmaceutical categories and complication of human metabolism and sewer behavior a clear explanation can be hardly presented nonetheless some primary evaluation can be made in the three patterns the daytime load was much greater than the nighttime one which well fits with the consumption habits yet the peak time and number varied significantly among the three load patterns this is most probably caused by diverse medical prescriptions for each pharmaceutical 3 2 2 antibiotics when the analysis is restricted to the sole antibiotics the patterns are more meaningful and evident the heat map is shown in fig 6 i again cluster analysis indicates that the seven wwtps can be categorized into three groups group 1 wwtp b and g group 2 wwtps a c d and e and group 3 wwtp f yet it is evident that group 1 and 3 have analogous trends with a time shift of 2 h that is group 1 is 2 h in advance compared to group 3 fig 6 ii this is probably caused by different residence time of sewage in sewer lines accordingly we aggregated them in a single group namely group 1 similar to generic pharmaceuticals highest loads are detected from 11 00am to 3 00pm fig 6 i this is again in good agreement with the fact that antibiotics are mainly used during daytime waking hours considering sewer residence time lag antibiotic load inputs derived from cluster analysis are clearer than those of generic pharmaceuticals a doubly peaked trend for group 1 and a singly peaked trend for group 2 fig 6 ii and 6 iii respectively specifically the input pattern of group 2 fig 6 iii has a more distinctive peak at 17 00 possibly indicating a prevalent antibiotic consumption in the middle of daytime this circumstance is a sign of regular human activities daughton 2004 petrie et al 2016 on the contrary group 1 load patterns fig 6 ii suggest a prevalent drug use during the early morning and evening hours complementary to that observed for group 2 from a geographical point of view fig 1 catchment areas of wwtp c f and g are located in the south and west which are essentially residential regions whereas located in the north and east part catchments of wwtps a b d and e are commercially developed areas therefore the mutual complementary patterns of group 1 and group 2 are likely caused by the commuting flows of citizens in the morning most of the people go to the northeast for work and then go back to the southwest in the evening such behavior corresponds to a major antibiotics consumption in the morning and night in the southwest while in the northeast it happens around noon however further studies are still needed to substantiate these drug consumption patterns time divergence from intake to excretion and the degradation during hrt in sewer 3 3 phacs removal analysis 3 3 1 removal efficiency re in the present study the eight wwtps are classified as four main categories according to their municipal treatment processes table 2 removal efficiencies of the pharmaceuticals calculated according to eq s3 in si achieved by each process category are shown in fig 7 process i is the least efficient easily degradable chemicals group c1 are removed in an acceptable manner but the majority of them is still present in the effluent processes ii iii and iv are more effective and on average result to be effective also with the most recalcitrant compounds group c3 concerning pharmaceuticals recalcitrance it seems that cf anti inflammatories and lipid regulators are more degradable while the other classes are more resistant to treatment processes analogous conclusions about removal efficiencies of the various treatment processes can be done for antibiotics figure s6 actually treatment process i is poorly effective r e c1 0 r e c2 0 50 figure s6 on contrary the other three plant types are capable of efficacious removal r e c1 0 68 r e c2 0 64 such results should be attributed to the diverse technologies employed for the clarification and disinfection steps mbr and ozonation are demonstrated to be potent pharmaceutical elimination techniques lange et al 2006 reif et al 2008 xia et al 2012 which are widely used as clarification and disinfection steps in wwtps respectively 3 3 2 uncertainty optimization of removal efficiency calculation in this study we occasionally achieved negative values for some res fig 7 such fact has been verified in other previous studies gobel et al 2007 gros et al 2010 where it was hypothesized that phacs might be converted from conjugated metabolites by enzymatic processes or released from sludge during the treatment here we propose another possible explanation for such a peculiar fact it could be the mismatch of influent and effluent flow leading to uncertainty on re calculation a method based on accurate quantification of water flow rate to estimate pharmaceutical load other than that based on concentration difference could produce more reliable results generally speaking there are four ways to determine removal efficiencies of wwtps calculation methods are detailed in si concentrational removal efficiency with or without hrt considered re c or re c hrt and cumulative removal efficiency of 24 h load or hrt adjusted cumulative load re l or re l hrt the results of four removal efficiency calculations are demonstrated in figure s9 in most of previous studies re c has been adopted when grab sampling was employed to collect data while re l has been usually utilized with 24 h cumulative sampling data table s8 shows a mini review on recent literature they are the most convenient approaches when neither flow rate variation nor synchronicity information is available however such information is critical to avoid excessive uncertainty on low concentration species oppositely calculation of re c hrt or re l hrt demands more efforts and data such as hrt adjusted synchronous influent effluent sampling campaign or corresponding flow rate data in some cases re cs of some pharmaceuticals e g tp smr kp and mtp suggested that their concentrations increased in the effluent by more than 100 by comparison the results of the two concentration based calculation methods found re c hrt larger than re c by averagely 0 04 as for the load based re they are significantly higher than concentration based ones p 0 05 figure s9 the largest absolute difference is between re l hrt and re c it averagely reaches 0 11 with a peak of 2 1 fig 8 this fact could be explained by sudden variation of concentration or flow rate in the influent for example at a certain instant input phacs concentration is diluted by a large flow meanwhile the output concentration is not simultaneously impacted therefore the concertation based measurements that does not take into account synchronicity are less than the actual values in sum re c and re l are affected by undesirable uncertainties re c hrt is larger than re c for all investigated phacs so it is very likely that the diversity is caused by the flow mismatch re l hrt measurement could reduce the negative values of removal efficiencies this implies that such calculation methodology might give a more reliable estimation of re because synchronicity and flow rate fluctuations are both taken into account therefore this study demonstrates the importance of accurate load calculation for the removal efficiency calculation of emerging contaminants in wwtps nonetheless since the removal results could be influenced by hrt improvement of the accuracy of hrt as well as sewer retention time still needs further study mccall et al 2017 additionally another possible approach to reduce the calculation uncertainty could be conducting a longer sampling campaign much longer than wwtp s hrt ternes and joss 2007 because in theory the long time composite sample is believed to make up for the instant concentration fluctuation which also possibly reduce negative removal efficiency values thus different sampling methods and corresponding removal efficiency calculations still need further study and comparison 3 3 3 removal efficiency discrepancy limitation of some phacs as source markers due to the large variety of chemical structures pharmaceuticals show a wide range of chemical and biological stability as explained in fig 7 we divide the investigated compounds into three classes c1c3 according to their recalcitrance to wastewater treatment processes non recalcitrant pharmaceuticals are generally significantly reduced in wwtps while concentration of recalcitrant one remains almost unchanged some previous studies have mentioned that the ratios of easily disposed pharmaceuticals to recalcitrant ones can be used as indices to identify treated or untreated water discharges in the water environment daneshvar et al 2012 lv et al 2014 ma et al 2017 however results of the present study highlights that pharmaceuticals are significantly removed in wwtps when adequate technologies are employed also recalcitrant pharmaceuticals group c3 in fig 7 undergo obvious degradation especially in plants with advanced technologies like ozonation oxidation or mbr i e processes ii iii and iv according to previous results lv et al 2014 cbz df ma and mtp could be used as source markers because they should be recalcitrant and hardly removed nevertheless 5 out of 8 wwtps in this study were able to effectively remove these compounds therefore the utilization of such compounds as conservative markers for the identification of contamination source type i e treated or untreated is not suitable in the specific case presented in this work with the wide application of advanced treatment technologies increasing categories of previously recalcitrant micropollutants are going to be effectively removed by wwtps hence more careful considerations and validations are needed to pinpoint appropriate micropollution markers and or other source identification parameters 4 conclusion in this work the bihourly averaged sampling methodology was adopted to identify and quantify phac pollution in eight large wwtps of beijing china moreover the sampling methodology provided short term information on pollutant concentration and wastewater flow rate facilitating a precise calculation of micro pollutant loads analysis of load exhibits different pharmaceutical input patterns however the patterns of antibiotics shows a very good consistency with the possible consumption timing and geo transition possibly caused by commuting flow analysis of pharmaceutical removal efficiency demonstrates that this value is dependent on wwtp technologies with advance of wastewater treatment technologies some conventionally recalcitrant chemicals can be efficaciously removed in wwtps therefore we should be more cautious when using these compounds as source markers moreover removal efficiency calculated by hrt adjusted cumulative load could reduce the number of negative values

19543,pharmaceutically active compounds phacs are recognized as one of the most serious emerging micropollutants wastewater treatment plants are the major way through which such contaminants enter the environment therefore an appropriate management of phacs in these facilities can reduce their release into the environment in particular a proper sampling methodology is necessary to identify and quantify micropollutants in wastewater in this study 37 pharmaceuticals including 23 antibiotics are investigated in eight major wastewater treatment plants in beijing an optimized sampling methodology is successfully implemented to monitor bihourly variation of the contaminants thus averting uncertainties derived from conventional sampling methods in this way more accurate pharmaceutical load patterns are determined and discussed thanks to the synchronous data on pharmaceutical concentration and wastewater flow we also compare performances of various treatment processes and optimize different calculation methods for removal efficiency graphical abstract image 1 keywords pharmaceuticals wwtp intraday load hydraulic retention time removal efficiency source marker 1 introduction pharmaceutically active compounds phacs including antibiotics psychiatric drugs beta blocker anti inflammatory lipid regulators etc are widely used in the world de jesus gaffney et al 2015 tiwari et al 2017 these compounds present dissimilar physicochemical properties such as volatility hydrophobicity absorbability and complex structures hence they tend to have different fates in the environment varying from relatively rapid physicochemical and biological transformations to high persistence daughton and ternes 1999 tiwari et al 2017 due to production and use increase in recent decades phacs have been ubiquitously detected in abiotic and biotic media often in very low concentrations although such chemicals are referred to as micro pollutants they can enter the food chain from surface ground water and sediments and through aquatic organisms accumulate even in human tissues ellis 2006 collier 2007 khetan and collins 2007 lapworth et al 2012 wang and chu 2016 moreover in spite of their low concentrations evidence of their post therapeutic effects on non target organisms in aquatic environment is building up jones et al 2005 fent et al 2006 these facts together with a lack of complete understanding on phacs environmental impact make these micro pollutants one of the most challenging environmental issues nowadays excessive consumption and improper disposal of unused pharmaceuticals lead to pharmaceuticals buildup in municipal sewage wastewater treatment plants wwtps are the final receptors of such emerging organic pollutants which are expected to remove them from the wastewater however the removal efficiencies can vary greatly depending not only on physiochemical properties of the compounds but also on the employed technologies for the treatment batt et al 2007 xu et al 2007 tran et al 2016 a major consequence of insufficient treatment is that considerable amounts of pharmaceuticals are discharged into waterbodies causing diffusion in almost all aquatic environments and even in drinking water sources wilkinson et al 2017 yang et al 2017 china is now the largest producer and consumer of pharmaceuticals bu et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 report that the total use of 36 major antibiotics surpassed 90 000 tons in 2013 and 53 800 tons entered the environment nearly half of them were brought into receiving waters passing through wwtps thus inevitably leading to serious contamination reliable information on antibiotic mass load variation and removal efficiencies in wwtps are necessary even more so in large metropolises it is fundamental to improve pharmaceutical containing wastewater treatment and management for example beijing is one of the most densely populated regions in the world and its population might be exposed to risks caused by various contaminants ma et al 2017 a large number of studies have investigated analytical methods temporal occurrences removal efficiencies treatment technologies and subsequent environmental impact of antibiotics in wwtps among them uncertainty of sampling methodologies has long been considered a dominant source of uncertainty in many applications and far greater than the uncertainty due to chemical analysis ort et al 2010a b on one hand grab sampling protocol the most frequently utilized one is proven to bring about significant uncertainties on the other hand 24 h composite sampling commonly reported as a complementary methodology ashfaq et al 2017 produces results that are not representative enough to describe short term variations ternes and joss 2007 both methodologies could be unsuitable to achieve a clear and complete picture of micropollution in wastewater as well as their fate in wwtps in order to address this problem we aimed to design a bihourly averaged composite sampling methodology for pharmaceutical analysis in major wwtps in beijing such a protocol would allow a more accurate evaluation of temporal variations than grab sampling which could facilitate the study of dynamic changes through hydraulic retention time hrt at both ends of wwtps also the complete information obtained by the proposed sampling facilitates evaluating the performance of the various treatment processes under study and to compare different methodologies for the calculation of wwtp removal efficiencies this work could provide more accurate information concerning pharmaceuticals in wwtps in china and help future researches on micropollutants by reducing uncertainties in sampling and analysis procedures 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards reagents and other

concentration of 521 ng l 1 levels of most sulfonamides except smx range from 1 5 to 80 of ng l 1 which could be the result of their less consumption in beijing smx concentration is high 459 ng l 1 consistent with its frequent use for both human and livestock ma et al 2017 wwtp b was found to be the most heavily loaded plant with a total antibiotic concentration of 4248 ng l 1 which is twice as much as the value in the other wwtps according to the concentration heat map fig 3 sulfonamides are found in higher amounts in wwtp e and f highlighted by dashed red box while most of the other antibiotics showed high concentrations in the influent of wwtp c in the effluents chlortetracycline ctc sulfamerazine smr and sulfisoxazole six were greatly reduced to be below their detection limits in the majority of samples those antibiotics with very low inflent concentration viz ts sim smp sqx smz and sm were also not observed in the effluents however sulfamethoxypyridazine smp and six can still be found in wwtp a and b with concentrations ranging from 1 2 to 100 ng l 1 smx lcm and cam are the most concentrated antibiotics in the effluents figure s4 with average concentrations of 125 107 and 105 ng l 1 respectively most sulfonamides were below detection limit after treatment but sulfadiazine sd was found to be 30 ng l 1 on average in wwtp a b and g as only observed in wwtp g fig 3 ts was reduced to 71 ng l 1 on the contrary sm was almost removed from wastewater after treatment few kinds of antibiotics can be detected but removal efficiencies strongly depend on treatment technologies for instance in wwtp a and b employing the treatment process i table 2 just 3 antibiotics were removed to be below their detection limits in the effluent while for the plants utilizing the treatment process ii 7 antibiotics were removed to be undetectable in the effluent in fact after treatment wwtp c was still the one with most abundant antibiotics 2693 ng l 1 followed by wwtp a 1491 ng l 1 as highlighted by dashed blue box in fig 3 differently total concentrations were effectively lowered to hundreds of ng l 1 in the other plants such diversity in removal efficiencies will be discussed in paragraph 3 3 3 1 2 environmental impact in order to highlight the impact of wwtp emissions on surface water pollution phac concentrations in the water bodies that receive treated water discharge are compared fig 4 specifically the multi layer rose diagrams depict phac concentrations in receiving surface water top layer effluents middle layer and influents bottom layer it can be seen that surface water concentrations are roughly overlappable with those of effluents yet effluent emission of some micro pollutants e g gemfibrozil gf and propranolol ppn cannot explain the higher concentrations found in the river thus suggesting further sources indeed it was found that in beijing area untreated wastewater is one of the major sources of surface water pollution wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 especially it was reported that 238 million tons of wastewater entered natural surface water without proper treatment in 2015 zhang et al 2016 besides the diagrams highlight the suspect that the high level in surface water of some phacs e g cp compared to that in the corresponding effluent might be due to illegal discharge 3 2 load analysis in the last decade it has been highlighted the importance of emission behaviors and environmental load patterns of micro pollutants ort et al 2010a 2010b load is actually the rigorous way to express the amounts and variations of dissolved compounds in wwtp streams and its approximation to the concentrations is acceptable only for highly concentrated compounds in order to avoid the uncertainty caused by flow variation and thus achieve reliable data micro pollutant occurrence could be better expressed as load moreover load can directly show how and when the phacs are consumed or discharged petrie et al 2016 the load was calculated according to the following equation 1 l o a d i g c a v e t i ng l 1 q c i m 3 10 6 where load i is the cumulative pharmaceutical load in 2 h influents or effluents cave t i is 2 h average concentration of a kind of phacs and q c i is 2 h cumulative flow quantity 3 2 1 generic pharmaceuticals in order to obtain a clear portrait of the general situation of pharmaceuticals and avoid the disproportional influence of pharmaceutical groups 3 typical antibiotics tp na and cp were studied together with the other 14 non antibiotics as the group of generic pharmaceuticals heat map and cluster analyses detailed in si were applied to explore the load patterns fig 5 i clearly shows difference between diurnal and nocturnal load in influents especially compared with the effluents ii specifically high load occurs from 11 a m to 3 a m because of residence time delay in sewer system estimated to range from 1 to 6 h this is likely due to diurnal waking hour consumption in the catchment areas on the other hand load from 3 a m to 11 a m can be recognized as nocturnal discharge sleeping hour as shown by fig 5 ii load patterns in effluents seem to have no special trend but variation can be observed such a situation could be the results of multiple reasons for example initial concentration fluctuation water characteristics and operational conditions of treatment facilities joss et al 2006 batt et al 2007 gur reznik et al 2011 detailed in si 5 effluent load and variation thanks to the cluster analysis the load distribution could be divided into 3 fluctuating patterns fig 5 i the first group wwtp a b and h showed a unimodal model fig 5 iii the second group wwtp d e and f seemed to follow the pattern of the first group but shows an abrupt peak at the interval 23 1 fig 5 iv and the third group wwtp c and g displayed a multimodal distribution fig 5 v these trends should be direct consequences of drug discharge in corresponding catchments ternes and joss 2007 van nuijs et al 2011 petrie et al 2016 since all the studied wwtps are designed to receive and treat domestic wastewater the major source for the influents could be human discharge which is although after human metabolism a direct reflection of drug use habits ort et al 2010b zheng et al 2017 therefore these influents can be ideal target to study the human behaviors on the wwtps serving areas however because of the variety of the investigated pharmaceutical categories and complication of human metabolism and sewer behavior a clear explanation can be hardly presented nonetheless some primary evaluation can be made in the three patterns the daytime load was much greater than the nighttime one which well fits with the consumption habits yet the peak time and number varied significantly among the three load patterns this is most probably caused by diverse medical prescriptions for each pharmaceutical 3 2 2 antibiotics when the analysis is restricted to the sole antibiotics the patterns are more meaningful and evident the heat map is shown in fig 6 i again cluster analysis indicates that the seven wwtps can be categorized into three groups group 1 wwtp b and g group 2 wwtps a c d and e and group 3 wwtp f yet it is evident that group 1 and 3 have analogous trends with a time shift of 2 h that is group 1 is 2 h in advance compared to group 3 fig 6 ii this is probably caused by different residence time of sewage in sewer lines accordingly we aggregated them in a single group namely group 1 similar to generic pharmaceuticals highest loads are detected from 11 00am to 3 00pm fig 6 i this is again in good agreement with the fact that antibiotics are mainly used during daytime waking hours considering sewer residence time lag antibiotic load inputs derived from cluster analysis are clearer than those of generic pharmaceuticals a doubly peaked trend for group 1 and a singly peaked trend for group 2 fig 6 ii and 6 iii respectively specifically the input pattern of group 2 fig 6 iii has a more distinctive peak at 17 00 possibly indicating a prevalent antibiotic consumption in the middle of daytime this circumstance is a sign of regular human activities daughton 2004 petrie et al 2016 on the contrary group 1 load patterns fig 6 ii suggest a prevalent drug use during the early morning and evening hours complementary to that observed for group 2 from a geographical point of view fig 1 catchment areas of wwtp c f and g are located in the south and west which are essentially residential regions whereas located in the north and east part catchments of wwtps a b d and e are commercially developed areas therefore the mutual complementary patterns of group 1 and group 2 are likely caused by the commuting flows of citizens in the morning most of the people go to the northeast for work and then go back to the southwest in the evening such behavior corresponds to a major antibiotics consumption in the morning and night in the southwest while in the northeast it happens around noon however further studies are still needed to substantiate these drug consumption patterns time divergence from intake to excretion and the degradation during hrt in sewer 3 3 phacs removal analysis 3 3 1 removal efficiency re in the present study the eight wwtps are classified as four main categories according to their municipal treatment processes table 2 removal efficiencies of the pharmaceuticals calculated according to eq s3 in si achieved by each process category are shown in fig 7 process i is the least efficient easily degradable chemicals group c1 are removed in an acceptable manner but the majority of them is still present in the effluent processes ii iii and iv are more effective and on average result to be effective also with the most recalcitrant compounds group c3 concerning pharmaceuticals recalcitrance it seems that cf anti inflammatories and lipid regulators are more degradable while the other classes are more resistant to treatment processes analogous conclusions about removal efficiencies of the various treatment processes can be done for antibiotics figure s6 actually treatment process i is poorly effective r e c1 0 r e c2 0 50 figure s6 on contrary the other three plant types are capable of efficacious removal r e c1 0 68 r e c2 0 64 such results should be attributed to the diverse technologies employed for the clarification and disinfection steps mbr and ozonation are demonstrated to be potent pharmaceutical elimination techniques lange et al 2006 reif et al 2008 xia et al 2012 which are widely used as clarification and disinfection steps in wwtps respectively 3 3 2 uncertainty optimization of removal efficiency calculation in this study we occasionally achieved negative values for some res fig 7 such fact has been verified in other previous studies gobel et al 2007 gros et al 2010 where it was hypothesized that phacs might be converted from conjugated metabolites by enzymatic processes or released from sludge during the treatment here we propose another possible explanation for such a peculiar fact it could be the mismatch of influent and effluent flow leading to uncertainty on re calculation a method based on accurate quantification of water flow rate to estimate pharmaceutical load other than that based on concentration difference could produce more reliable results generally speaking there are four ways to determine removal efficiencies of wwtps calculation methods are detailed in si concentrational removal efficiency with or without hrt considered re c or re c hrt and cumulative removal efficiency of 24 h load or hrt adjusted cumulative load re l or re l hrt the results of four removal efficiency calculations are demonstrated in figure s9 in most of previous studies re c has been adopted when grab sampling was employed to collect data while re l has been usually utilized with 24 h cumulative sampling data table s8 shows a mini review on recent literature they are the most convenient approaches when neither flow rate variation nor synchronicity information is available however such information is critical to avoid excessive uncertainty on low concentration species oppositely calculation of re c hrt or re l hrt demands more efforts and data such as hrt adjusted synchronous influent effluent sampling campaign or corresponding flow rate data in some cases re cs of some pharmaceuticals e g tp smr kp and mtp suggested that their concentrations increased in the effluent by more than 100 by comparison the results of the two concentration based calculation methods found re c hrt larger than re c by averagely 0 04 as for the load based re they are significantly higher than concentration based ones p 0 05 figure s9 the largest absolute difference is between re l hrt and re c it averagely reaches 0 11 with a peak of 2 1 fig 8 this fact could be explained by sudden variation of concentration or flow rate in the influent for example at a certain instant input phacs concentration is diluted by a large flow meanwhile the output concentration is not simultaneously impacted therefore the concertation based measurements that does not take into account synchronicity are less than the actual values in sum re c and re l are affected by undesirable uncertainties re c hrt is larger than re c for all investigated phacs so it is very likely that the diversity is caused by the flow mismatch re l hrt measurement could reduce the negative values of removal efficiencies this implies that such calculation methodology might give a more reliable estimation of re because synchronicity and flow rate fluctuations are both taken into account therefore this study demonstrates the importance of accurate load calculation for the removal efficiency calculation of emerging contaminants in wwtps nonetheless since the removal results could be influenced by hrt improvement of the accuracy of hrt as well as sewer retention time still needs further study mccall et al 2017 additionally another possible approach to reduce the calculation uncertainty could be conducting a longer sampling campaign much longer than wwtp s hrt ternes and joss 2007 because in theory the long time composite sample is believed to make up for the instant concentration fluctuation which also possibly reduce negative removal efficiency values thus different sampling methods and corresponding removal efficiency calculations still need further study and comparison 3 3 3 removal efficiency discrepancy limitation of some phacs as source markers due to the large variety of chemical structures pharmaceuticals show a wide range of chemical and biological stability as explained in fig 7 we divide the investigated compounds into three classes c1c3 according to their recalcitrance to wastewater treatment processes non recalcitrant pharmaceuticals are generally significantly reduced in wwtps while concentration of recalcitrant one remains almost unchanged some previous studies have mentioned that the ratios of easily disposed pharmaceuticals to recalcitrant ones can be used as indices to identify treated or untreated water discharges in the water environment daneshvar et al 2012 lv et al 2014 ma et al 2017 however results of the present study highlights that pharmaceuticals are significantly removed in wwtps when adequate technologies are employed also recalcitrant pharmaceuticals group c3 in fig 7 undergo obvious degradation especially in plants with advanced technologies like ozonation oxidation or mbr i e processes ii iii and iv according to previous results lv et al 2014 cbz df ma and mtp could be used as source markers because they should be recalcitrant and hardly removed nevertheless 5 out of 8 wwtps in this study were able to effectively remove these compounds therefore the utilization of such compounds as conservative markers for the identification of contamination source type i e treated or untreated is not suitable in the specific case presented in this work with the wide application of advanced treatment technologies increasing categories of previously recalcitrant micropollutants are going to be effectively removed by wwtps hence more careful considerations and validations are needed to pinpoint appropriate micropollution markers and or other source identification parameters 4 conclusion in this work the bihourly averaged sampling methodology was adopted to identify and quantify phac pollution in eight large wwtps of beijing china moreover the sampling methodology provided short term information on pollutant concentration and wastewater flow rate facilitating a precise calculation of micro pollutant loads analysis of load exhibits different pharmaceutical input patterns however the patterns of antibiotics shows a very good consistency with the possible consumption timing and geo transition possibly caused by commuting flow analysis of pharmaceutical removal efficiency demonstrates that this value is dependent on wwtp technologies with advance of wastewater treatment technologies some conventionally recalcitrant chemicals can be efficaciously removed in wwtps therefore we should be more cautious when using these compounds as source markers moreover removal efficiency calculated by hrt adjusted cumulative load could reduce the number of negative values

19544,electrochemical oxidation eco has shown good potential for disinfection of wastewater discharges but has not been tested for stormwater due to far lower salinity and chloride levels present in stormwater than in wastewaters the knowledge so far on the eco disinfection performance cannot simply be used for stormwater applications this paper presents the first study on the feasibility of eco technology for disinfection of pre treated stormwater disinfection performance of e coli was tested using a dimensional stable anode dsa in a series of batch experiments with synthetic stormwater of typical chemical and microbial composition the results showed that effective disinfection could be achieved with very low energy consumption e g the current density of 1 74 ma cm2 achieved total disinfection in 1 3 min using only 0 018 kwh per ton of stormwater treatment chlorination was found to be the key disinfection mechanism despite the synthetic stormwater containing only 9 mg l of chloride real stormwater collected from three stormwater treatment systems in melbourne was then used to validate the findings for indigenous microbe species disinfection below the detection limit was achieved for stormwater from the two sites where chloride levels were 9 and 200 mg l respectively but not for the third site where stormwater contained only 2 mg l chloride unfortunately deterioration of the dsa anode was observed after only 8 10 h of its cumulative operation time very likely due to high voltage that had to be applied to low saline stormwater to achieve the required current density in conclusion eco was found to be a very promising low energy disinfection technology for stormwater but far more work is needed to optimise the technology for unique stormwater conditions keywords stormwater harvesting disinfection electrochemical oxidation 1 introduction stormwater harvesting complying with the principles of water sensitive urban design wsud also known as low impact development lid fletcher et al 2015 is an emerging practice in urban areas that are experiencing water scarcity dietz 2007 wong and brown 2009 collected and treated stormwater using suitable wsud technologies such as stormwater biofilters bio retentions and raingardens or wetlands could be utilised for non potable purposes feng et al 2012 e g irrigation and toilet flushing nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 and in rare cases as a source for potable water supply page et al 2010 unfortunately these green wsud treatment systems are unable to remove pathogens from stormwater to the levels required for non potable uses requiring additional disinfection technologies for example a well designed stormwater biofilter can generally provide around one log removal of the e coli levels in stormwater chandrasena et al 2012 2014 making it safe only for restricted irrigation nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 this has become the major barrier to widespread adoption of wsud stormwater harvesting technologies since due to its distributed nature and often low capacity the systems need to be robust and of low running costs there is therefore an urgent need for low cost efficient and environmentally friendly technologies for disinfection of stormwater that is grounded in the proven wsud principles wong and brown 2009 electrochemical oxidation eco has been developed for wastewater treatment primarily organics and inorganics from heavily polluted industrial streams comninellis 1994 panizza and cerisola 2009 zhao et al 2011 and to some extent wastewater disinfection neocoat kraft 2008 martínez huitle and brillas 2009 compared to other cutting edge treatment technologies such as chlorination photo catalytic oxidation ozonation and ultraviolet uv irradiation eco can be operated without chemical addition and under lower capital and operational cost comninellis 1994 however eco has not been tested for stormwater treatment and due to the differences between stormwater and wastewater it is unclear how it will perform for this application e g stormwater has significantly lower concentrations of chloride and very low electrochemical conductivity ec while its microbial concentrations are usually several orders of magnitude lower than in wastewater chandrasena et al 2012 abd ellah et al 2013 stormwater is of intermittent nature blecken et al 2009 and with far larger variability in its quality mccarthy et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 than industry or municipal wastewaters this has caused considerable challenges for direct adoption of wastewater treatment technologies to stormwater applications wong et al 2013 depending on the type of anode selection the indirect eco treatment performance relies either on the chlorine evolution from oxidising presented chloride ions or hydroxyl radical production through water hydrolysis martínez huitle and brillas 2009 lacasa et al 2012 dimensional stable anode dsa the anodes with titanium substrate coated with titanium group metals or metals oxides such as iridium and ruthenium is one of the commonly used anodes due to their reasonable costs panizza and cerisola 2009 stormwater usually comes in high quantities over short time periods therefore requiring very low treatment costs per unit volume however due to their low chlorine evolution potential dsa has been mainly utilised to treat wastewaters that contain high levels of chloride ions 160 10 000 mg l malpass et al 2007 costa and olivi 2009 abd ellah et al 2013 in some cases when wastewater contained low chloride concentration additional sources of chloride had to be added into the water to achieve optimum treatment efficiency fang et al 2006 jeong et al 2009 cho et al 2014 the operational concentration of chloride ranged from 160 to 10 000 mg l depending on the targeted pollutants fang et al 2006 arevalo and calmano 2007 cong 2008 jeong et al 2009 this poses a direct challenge for eco s application to stormwater since chloride levels in stormwater are often very low e g a mean concentration of chloride was found to be around 11 mg l for a few urban catchments in australia nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 this paper presents the first feasibility study of eco technology for stormwater disinfection by considering its performance reliability energy efficiency anode durability and disinfection by product levels one hypothesis was initially formed based on aforementioned studies in wastewater treatment disinfection of harvested stormwater could be achieved by eco technology despite very low chloride levels usually present usually 10 mg l possibly due to direct anodic oxidation or production of reactive oxygen species specifically the objectives include quantify the disinfection performance with respect to different eco system configurations anode type and anode distance and operational conditions operational voltage and investigate the energy efficiency under different system configurations and operational conditions investigate the eco processes which govern the disinfection of stormwater test the durability of selected anodes after long term operation and validate the eco disinfection performance using real stormwater samples with different properties including the measurement of disinfection by products dbps in general this study provides implications for applying eco as a low energy consumption technology for stormwater disinfection with reliable treatment performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 the experimental set up a commercial dimensional stable anode dsa using iridium and ruthenium oxides titanium oxides ruo2 iro2 manufactured by suzhou fenggang titanium co ltd in china was used for this study because of its low cost and good past performance for wastewater treatment arevalo and calmano 2007 kraft 2008 abd ellah et al 2013 the anodes were manufactured into rectangular plates with dimensions of 2 5 cm by 5 cm pure titanium mesh with the same dimensions was used as the cathode anode and cathode were mounted onto a glass beaker at pre determined distances to create a single compartment electrolysis cell see supplementary data sf1 the beaker was placed on a magnetic stirrer platform with a rotating speed of 800 rpm during the experiment a direct current dc power supplier ex 375l2 0 60v 0 25a takasago ltd japan applied the same voltage to three electrolysis cells replicate at the same time system current of the electrolysis cell was measured continuously during the experiment 2 2 performance study using synthetic stormwater synthetic stormwater that had characteristics as typical stormwater treated by biofilters was used to ensure that the same conditions were kept for the large number of tests a similar approach was used in previous stormwater technology development studies bratieres et al 2008 hatt et al 2009b the synthetic pre treated stormwater chemistry is shown in table s1 and briefly discussed below the deionised water was mixed with natural sediment collected from a stormwater pond to achieve a total suspended solid concentration equivalent to a typical stormwater biofilter effluent s event mean concentration emcs after sampling this slurry to determine chemical properties of interest laboratory grade chemicals were added to top up and simulate chemical properties significant to electrochemical oxidation performance these include typical biofiltrated stormwater emcs of major cations c a 2 m g 2 k n a anions s o 4 2 h c o 3 p o 4 3 total organic nitrogen chloride was topped up 9 mg l to achieve the concentration of the lower 5th percentile in untreated urban stormwater based on australian stormwater harvesting and reuse guidelines nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 disinfection performance validated for the lower 5th percentile chloride concentration ensured a conservative understanding of its feasibility in real application the synthetic stormwater had electric conductivity of 105 μs cm and ph of 7 1 as is the case in field conditions nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 in this initial study e coli k1 strain atcc 11775 was used as an indicator for bacteria water contamination this strain is pathogenic to most birds and was originally isolated from the natural environment johnson et al 2007 it also has a stronger resilience to the harsh environment compared to other commonly used lab strains of e coli the initial e coli concentration used in this study was estimated based on the worst case scenario of e coli levels in effluents from stormwater biofilters since the 95th percentile e coli concentration of raw stormwater is 183 382mpn 100 ml duncan 1999 nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 and stormwater biofiltration systems could achieve on average of 1 2 log reduction li et al 2012 2016 chandrasena et al 2014 the e coli concentration in synthetic biofiltrated stormwater was adjusted to 10 000mpn 100 ml the prepared stormwater of 400 ml was placed in a beaker and the selected current density was applied three different operational voltages 4v 7v and 14v and three electrode distances 3 mm 10 mm and 20 mm were tested to assess the influence of system configuration on stormwater disinfection and energy consumption a control with no voltage supply was also tested under the same conditions each configuration was replicated three times it should be noted that the tested voltages were well above the anode s oxygen evolution voltage of 1 56v six 10 ml stormwater samples were taken for each test a sample before the test started and five during the test the sampling times varied from experiment to experiment to ensure that the entire disinfection process was captured these samples were then assayed for e coli concentration using the previously described colilert method idexx laboratories 2007 immediately after each test each 10 ml sample was diluted with 90 ml of deionised water to achieve a dilution factor of 10 the detection range of aforementioned sampling method was from 10 mpn 100 ml to 24 196 mpn 100 ml for dilution factor 1 10 2 3 disinfection mechanism study this part of the study investigated the eco processes which govern the disinfection firstly the effectiveness of possible chlorination from a limited amount of chloride present in the stormwater was examined by comparing the eco disinfection between the typical stormwater using the above synthetic receipt with chloride of 9 mg l and chloride free synthetic stormwater to prepare chloride free stormwater sodium nitrate that has minimum impact on electrochemical systems martínez huitle and brillas 2009 was used as a substitute for sodium chloride in the stormwater preparation to achieve water of the same electrical conductivity as the original 105 μs cm although most previous studies showed poor direct production of hydroxyl radical from titanium based metal oxides anodes due to their low oxygen evolution potential cong 2008 kraft 2008 martínez huitle and brillas 2009 it was speculated that hydroxyl radical production might be produced stormwater harvested using soil based biofilters usually have an excessive ferrous iron concentration 0 3 mg l feng et al 2012 and it was hypothesised that hydroxyl radicals may be produced as an intermediary through the interaction between ferrous ion and hydrogen peroxide zhang et al 2006 to verify the effectiveness of possible hydroxyl radical production excessive amounts 0 03m of tert butanol t buoh a well known hydroxyl radical scavenger comninellis 1994 were added into the synthetic stormwater disinfection performance of this hydroxyl radical free solution was then compared with the performance of the original synthetic stormwater an initial test of e coli survival was done showing no biocidal effect from either added sodium nitrate or 0 03m of t buoh the effectiveness of possible chlorination and possible hydroxyl radical production was tested under both low and high operational currents 0 75 ma cm2 4 2 ma cm2 three replicates were used following the same sampling procedure as in the above performance study the concentrations of free chlorine and total chlorine were tested using a dr 5000 spectrophotometer hach according to the usepa method apha awwa wpcf 2005 the detection range of free and total chlorine using the selected method method 8021 is from 0 02 mg l to 2 mg l a fluorescent study of the intactness of e coli cells was used to investigate the impact of eco on stormwater microbes three types of images were taken by an optical microscope om boulos et al 1999 i bright field image of e coli for general inspection ii fluorescent image of e coli stained by propidium iodide pi 1 μg ml to show all the e coli cells present in water iii fluorescent image of e coli stained by 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dapi 5 μg ml to show the cells with permeable or broken membrane only due to the low concentration of cell numbers in the tested stormwater a series of centrifugation 8000 rpm over 5 min was used to achieve a concentration of around 106 cells ml in suspended solution samples were stained in a mixture of 1 μg ml propidium iodide pi sigma aldrich and 5 μg ml 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dapi sigma aldrich for 10 min stained samples were then washed three times using sterilized pbs solution to remove excess dye prepared samples were examined using nikon c 1 confocal microscope under 600 magnification and fluorescent light source transmission electron microscope tem was also used to examine the morphological and structure change of e coli after eco disinfection live and eco disinfected e coli samples concentrated following the same method as describes in above fluorescent test were firstly fixed with 2 5 of glutaraldehyde for 2 h fixed cells were then dehydrated using acetone and resin embedded at 60 c for 48 h embedded samples were then cut into 70 nm layers and examined using tem h7500 hitachi 2 4 anode deterioration study a drop in the anode performance was observed after 8 10 h of its cumulative usage time so the experiments done after that time were not reported in this paper however after approximately 20 h of the active anode use the experiments with the currents of 0 75 ma cm2 and 1 75 ma cm2 were repeated to assess the level of deterioration scanning electron microscope sem images were done on samples 3 mm by 5 mm of both unused and used deteriorated anodes the anode samples were initially washed using 0 02m hydrochloric acid hcl and then by 97 ethanol within an ultrasonic bath each washing lasted 15 min the surface morphology and elements distribution were then obtained with fei magellan 400 fegsem fei america operated at 10 kv distribution of doping metals ti ru and ir was examined using energy dispersive x ray edx detector mapping velásquez et al 2000 2 5 performance validation study using real stormwater an attempt was made to validate the results obtained using synthetic stormwater by running a small subset of tests with actual stormwater the tests also included monitoring of disinfection by products dbps in the treated stormwater stormwater samples were collected at the monash carpark stormwater biofilter well tested in the past hatt et al 2009a zhang et al 2014 troup s creek stormwater constructed wetland and clifton hill stormwater biofilter all these wsud systems are located within the melbourne metropolitan region the selection of stormwater catchment sites aimed to capture variabilities in pre treated stormwater quality so as to test the eco for a wide range of possible field conditions monash carpark biofilter receives stormwater runoff from concrete surfaces with a relatively small catchment size biofiltrated stormwater collected from this site is relatively less polluted comparing to stormwater collected from residential catchments and has similar chemical properties to the tested synthetic stormwater troups creek wetland is a typical end of the catchment stormwater treatment system located in the outer suburbs of melbourne it receives raw stormwater from residential urban and non developed natural surfaces clifton hill biofilter is located in the inner melbourne area and mainly receives residential runoff one water sample was gathered at outflows of these systems during different rainfall events eco disinfection under 1 75 ma cm2 that was found to be effective for synthetic stormwater was then performed for 30 min using three replicates of these samples the sampling method applied in this study followed the same procedure as described in the performance study both indigenous e coli and total coliform were assayed using colilert method meanwhile collected stormwater samples were sent to a nata certified national association of testing authorities australia laboratory for testing of metals ph bicarbonate total organic carbon and chlorination related disinfection by products dbps all samples were analysed according to the standard methods apha awwa wpcf 2005 dbps such as total halogenated methanes thms halogenated acetic acids haas and halogenated volatile solids hvols were tested only in troup s creek water samples before and after eco treatment since this source water contained the highest concentrations of chloride and organic matter which possibly could lead to high levels of dbps 2 6 data analysis to assess the disinfection performance e coli concentration was plotted against the operational time for all the performed eco tests e coli decay rate was calculated for each test using a simple linear regression model between e coli concentration and elapsed time the average linear decay rate k was estimated for each configuration using the three replicates in this study the linear model showed better fitting to the observed data comparing to conventional exponential models possibly due to special stormwater characteristics however observed eco disinfection kinetic of the synthetic stormwater during the tests under operational voltage u of 7 v and current density id of 0 75 ma cm2 was also qualitatively examined in relation to the wastewater eco disinfection kinetic model proposed by lópez gálvez et al 2012 to illustrate the different eco disinfection kinetics between wastewater and stormwater this model assumes that there are two phases in the eco disinfection of e coli over time equation 1 phase 1 the shoulder where there is no or slow rate of disinfection due to time needed to achieve the cell damage and competition between microbe and organics for oxidants and phase 2 tail or exponential decay where the disinfection decay follows the simple first order

together with the controls for comparison images taken by optical microscope om transmission electron microscope tem scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive x ray edx detector were compared only qualitatively 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance study using synthetic stormwater the change of the e coli levels over operational time for all tested configurations was plotted in fig 1 a linear decay of disinfection was observed for most configurations e g fig 2 a shows an example of the observed decay kinetics for an applied current of 0 75 ma cm2 this was different from a traditional exponential decay kinetics reported in most wastewater eco disinfection studies dhar et al 1981 matsunaga et al 1992 fang et al 2006 the disinfection kinetics of synthetic stormwater did not follow the model proposed for wastewater by lópez gálvez et al 2012 equation 1 a typical shoulder kinetic described in this model was not observed in the measured results this may be due to the low level of total organic matter tom 3 mg l in pre treated stormwater where the oxidants produced from eco could be more efficiently used for deactivation of microorganisms than in the case of wastewaters that have much higher organic content there was no difference p 0 01 between the performance of 4v 3 mm and 7v 10 mm configurations fig 1 since both configurations had the same current density it is suggested that concentration polarisation does not have a significant effect even when the electrode distance was the smallest 3 mm due to the low electrical conductivity of stormwater minimum possible electrode distance is preferred in future practice to ensure energy efficiency when the current was very low 0 25 ma cm2 the linear decay rate k was only 28 cells 100 ml min almost the same as the decay rate of the control that had no current supplied under the highest testing current density of 4 2 ma cm2 total disinfection was achieved within the first 20 s corresponding to a rapid decay rate of 27 061 per 100 ml min a clear correlation was found between operational time to achieve a 3 log reduction and the operational current fig 2b the unit energy consumed to achieve a 3 log reduction of disinfection decreased with an increase of the current fig 2b this is a surprising finding since the results from published wastewater eco studies suggest a reverse trend i e the consumed unit energy increases with an increase in the current abd ellah et al 2013 this is probably due to some differences in disinfection mechanisms between wastewater and stormwater which is discussed further in the section below 3 2 the mechanism of eco disinfection of stormwater eco did not perform any disinfection in the chloride free synthetic stormwater during both low and high currents fig 3 a and b in contrast disinfection performance of the original synthetic stormwater that contained cl 9 mg l was good replicating the decay observed in the above synthetic stormwater performance study the results suggest that eco in stormwater is driven by chloride ions although the water contains chloride levels well below the previously tested concentrations of 160 10 000 mg l in wastewater and surface water applications fang et al 2006 arevalo and calmano 2007 jeong et al 2009 cho et al 2014 schaefer et al 2015 2016 the presence of hydroxyl radical scavenger t buoh did not influence the disinfection performance fig 3c and d this shows that production of hydroxyl radical is not a significant pathway in dsa configurations which has good agreement with the literature on dsa applications to wastewater lacasa et al 2012 it therefore indicates that the high levels of ferrous iron in the stormwater did not play any role in the eco disinfection performance of stormwater using dsa the above results suggest that for typical stormwater chlorination is the key mechanism of e coli disinfection i e the eco system can utilise very low concentrations of the present chloride for active chlorine production however we did not fully confirm this finding since we were not able to detect any form of chlorine at the end of the control tests where no e coli was added to stormwater e g free chlorine was always below the detection limit of 0 02 mg l at the end of control experiments with no spiked e coli even under the highest testing current of 4 2 ma cm2 t3 log 0 33min this was surprising since the calculation based on the chlorine contact time ct curve developed by white 1992 who suggested that the required active chlorine concentration as hypochlorous acid to achieve 2 log inactivation of e coli under the same condition t2 log 0 33 min ph 7 should be at least 1 2 mg l we can only hypothesise why this is the case it could be simply that white s ct curve cannot be applied to stormwater that has very low cl concentrations it appears that there may be some differences between eco disinfection mechanisms in stormwater in comparison to wastewater in a wastewater environment high concentrations of chlorine are usually generated due to high initial cl concentrations the disinfection reaction is then just restricted by the interaction between microorganism and free chlorine abd ellah et al 2013 in this case increase of the current although may produce more free chlorine will not efficiently reduce the reaction rate i e increase the disinfection rate abd ellah et al 2013 in contrast the chlorine production is limited in stormwater due to low cl levels so all the produced free chlorine will be rapidly taken up by microorganisms or organic compounds close to the anode before it dissolves into the bulk solution in this case the reaction rate is limited by the chlorine production rate only increasing the current facilitates chlorine production to achieve a high reaction efficiency this explains the finding previously discussed in fig 2b that shows the unit energy consumed to achieve 3 log reduction of disinfection decreased with an increase of the current from fig 4 that shows the tem image of e coli in untreated a and b and treated c and d synthetic stormwater the morphology of cell membranes changed significantly after eco treatment for example the outer membrane became rough and wrinkled after the treatment while cavities were formed inside some cells this indicates that cytoplasmic membrane of these gram negative bacteria were compromised zeng et al 2015 according to previous studies active chlorine can attack the phospholipid molecule existing in the bilayer system causing consequent increased membrane permeability rice et al 1999 further attack leads to a fully damaged cytoplasmic membrane in which the exchange between intracellular and extracellular material will occur martínez huitle and brillas 2009 however this was not directly seen from the tem images the cavities and fibrils formed on disinfected e coli cells indicate the possible damage of dna and intracellular material kim et al 2008 fig 5 a b and c showed the images of e coli from the untreated water sample it is clear that e coli was only stained by blue 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dapi fig 5b but not red propidium iodide pi fig 5c pi could only stain cells with damaged cytoplasmic membrane which means e coli were intact before the eco disinfection however after the treatment fig 5e and f showed the distribution of dapi and pi stained cells are identical meaning that the majority of present e coli were dead because of membrane damage this confirmed the findings from the tem images 3 3 durability of the anode during the first 8 10 h of cumulative operation i e total usage time no drop in the anode performance was observed however a rather sharp decrease of their performance was noticed with further usage e g t3 log that was initially equal to 15 and 2 min at the current densities of 0 75 ma cm2 and 1 75 ma cm2 respectively increased to 40 and 11 min respectively after approximately 20 h of the anode use it was also clear that the performance drop was more significant under lower current densities sem images of the new and used anodes explained this drop in performance fig 6 an image of a new anode showed a relatively even distribution of three functional doping elements titanium ti iridium ir and ruthenium ru across the surface fig 6a the surface morphology of the anode changed significantly after approximately 20 h of operation as indicated by non uniform electron reflection from the sample surface fig 6b and c e g bigger cracks were formed on the surface element composition results from edx detector revealed a considerable reduction of the relative percentage of iridium and ruthenium on the sample surface also some elements which were not present on unused samples were discovered on the used anode surface such as aluminium and silicon polarisation is one of the common reasons causing deterioration of dsa anodes which is reflected by an increase in cell voltage during its operation comninellis and vercesi 1991 however the increased cell voltage was not observed in this study suggesting that alternative mechanism may exist for the anode deterioration stormwater has a very low concentration of chloride which leads to an oxygen evolution dominated reaction across the anode surface fierro et al 2007 who performed an anode oxygen evolution study using isotope oxygen in metal oxide coating of anode surface detected the isotope oxygen from the oxygen gas produced from the anode surface i e they suggested that oxygen gas was produced through a replacement of oxygen elements of the metal oxides by oxygen from water molecules it is hypothesised that the dominant oxygen evolution process occurring on the anode in stormwater will cause more rapid damage on the surface compared to eco applications to wastewater where oxygen evolution is negligible 3 4 preliminary validation using real stormwater the collected stormwater samples from different sites had very different initial electrical conductivity so to achieve the same current density of 1 75 ma cm2 different voltage had to be applied to each water sample table 1 disinfection below the detection limit of both indigenous e coli and total coliform was achieved after 5 min for the monash university carpark biofilter sample while approximately 15 min was needed for the troup s creek wetland water there was a small drop in performance with an increase in cl levels troup s creek wetland outflow had chloride concentration of 200 mg l compared to the monash biofilter of only 9 mg l this could be attributed to the higher total organic carbon toc levels in troup s creek water in comparison to monash samples which could have caused competition with microorganism for the uptake of free chlorine for example high toc levels were the reason that cho et al 2014 cho et al 2014 who used dsa anode to treat domestic wastewater with extra addition of 1860 mg l chloride achieved 3 log reduction of faecal coliform after a very long time 3 h at the operational current density of 2 09 ma cm2 eco was not able to disinfect stormwater from the clifton hill biofilter which contained only 2 mg l of chloride it can only be speculated that this level of chloride was not enough to support the chlorination process as already outlined dbps including hvols thms and haas were only tested in the water originally collected from troup s creek as due to its high levels of chloride and organics it presented the worst case scenario out of the three sites the tested result showed the negligible concentration of hvols the concentration of thms and haas were 0 015 mg l and 0 024 mg l respectively the australian drinking water guidelines suggest that the health concentration limits for these two compounds should be 0 25 mg l and 0 25 mg l respectively nhmrc 2011 therefore it was found that the dbps in disinfected stormwater by eco were of no concern 4 conclusions this study investigated for the first time the feasibility study of eco technology for stormwater disinfection disinfection performance of e coli was tested using a dimensional stable anode dsa in a series of batch experiments with synthetic stormwater of typical chemical and microbial composition results show that all tested eco configurations were effective in disinfection of e coli except for the configuration with the lowest operational current density of 0 25 ma cm2 the disinfection performance was significantly increased with a higher operational current the energy efficiency for stormwater eco disinfection also increased with higher operational current oxidation of chloride was shown to be the key pathway in stormwater eco disinfection although the chloride concentration is only 9 mg l in the synthetic stormwater effective disinfection performance was achieved without any extra chemical addition it was found that dsa deteriorated after 8 10 h of accumulated operation very likely due to the high voltage that had to be applied to low saline stormwater to achieve the required current density validation study showed that total disinfection was achieved for the two sites where chloride levels of the real stormwater were 9 and 200 mg l respectively but not for the third site where stormwater contained only 2 mg l chloride dbps in eco disinfected stormwater were all below australia drinking water guideline values acknowledgement we thank rebekah henry christelle schang and richard williamson from our water research team at monash

19544,electrochemical oxidation eco has shown good potential for disinfection of wastewater discharges but has not been tested for stormwater due to far lower salinity and chloride levels present in stormwater than in wastewaters the knowledge so far on the eco disinfection performance cannot simply be used for stormwater applications this paper presents the first study on the feasibility of eco technology for disinfection of pre treated stormwater disinfection performance of e coli was tested using a dimensional stable anode dsa in a series of batch experiments with synthetic stormwater of typical chemical and microbial composition the results showed that effective disinfection could be achieved with very low energy consumption e g the current density of 1 74 ma cm2 achieved total disinfection in 1 3 min using only 0 018 kwh per ton of stormwater treatment chlorination was found to be the key disinfection mechanism despite the synthetic stormwater containing only 9 mg l of chloride real stormwater collected from three stormwater treatment systems in melbourne was then used to validate the findings for indigenous microbe species disinfection below the detection limit was achieved for stormwater from the two sites where chloride levels were 9 and 200 mg l respectively but not for the third site where stormwater contained only 2 mg l chloride unfortunately deterioration of the dsa anode was observed after only 8 10 h of its cumulative operation time very likely due to high voltage that had to be applied to low saline stormwater to achieve the required current density in conclusion eco was found to be a very promising low energy disinfection technology for stormwater but far more work is needed to optimise the technology for unique stormwater conditions keywords stormwater harvesting disinfection electrochemical oxidation 1 introduction stormwater harvesting complying with the principles of water sensitive urban design wsud also known as low impact development lid fletcher et al 2015 is an emerging practice in urban areas that are experiencing water scarcity dietz 2007 wong and brown 2009 collected and treated stormwater using suitable wsud technologies such as stormwater biofilters bio retentions and raingardens or wetlands could be utilised for non potable purposes feng et al 2012 e g irrigation and toilet flushing nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 and in rare cases as a source for potable water supply page et al 2010 unfortunately these green wsud treatment systems are unable to remove pathogens from stormwater to the levels required for non potable uses requiring additional disinfection technologies for example a well designed stormwater biofilter can generally provide around one log removal of the e coli levels in stormwater chandrasena et al 2012 2014 making it safe only for restricted irrigation nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 this has become the major barrier to widespread adoption of wsud stormwater harvesting technologies since due to its distributed nature and often low capacity the systems need to be robust and of low running costs there is therefore an urgent need for low cost efficient and environmentally friendly technologies for disinfection of stormwater that is grounded in the proven wsud principles wong and brown 2009 electrochemical oxidation eco has been developed for wastewater treatment primarily organics and inorganics from heavily polluted industrial streams comninellis 1994 panizza and cerisola 2009 zhao et al 2011 and to some extent wastewater disinfection neocoat kraft 2008 martínez huitle and brillas 2009 compared to other cutting edge treatment technologies such as chlorination photo catalytic oxidation ozonation and ultraviolet uv irradiation eco can be operated without chemical addition and under lower capital and operational cost comninellis 1994 however eco has not been tested for stormwater treatment and due to the differences between stormwater and wastewater it is unclear how it will perform for this application e g stormwater has significantly lower concentrations of chloride and very low electrochemical conductivity ec while its microbial concentrations are usually several orders of magnitude lower than in wastewater chandrasena et al 2012 abd ellah et al 2013 stormwater is of intermittent nature blecken et al 2009 and with far larger variability in its quality mccarthy et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 than industry or municipal wastewaters this has caused considerable challenges for direct adoption of wastewater treatment technologies to stormwater applications wong et al 2013 depending on the type of anode selection the indirect eco treatment performance relies either on the chlorine evolution from oxidising presented chloride ions or hydroxyl radical production through water hydrolysis martínez huitle and brillas 2009 lacasa et al 2012 dimensional stable anode dsa the anodes with titanium substrate coated with titanium group metals or metals oxides such as iridium and ruthenium is one of the commonly used anodes due to their reasonable costs panizza and cerisola 2009 stormwater usually comes in high quantities over short time periods therefore requiring very low treatment costs per unit volume however due to their low chlorine evolution potential dsa has been mainly utilised to treat wastewaters that contain high levels of chloride ions 160 10 000 mg l malpass et al 2007 costa and olivi 2009 abd ellah et al 2013 in some cases when wastewater contained low chloride concentration additional sources of chloride had to be added into the water to achieve optimum treatment efficiency fang et al 2006 jeong et al 2009 cho et al 2014 the operational concentration of chloride ranged from 160 to 10 000 mg l depending on the targeted pollutants fang et al 2006 arevalo and calmano 2007 cong 2008 jeong et al 2009 this poses a direct challenge for eco s application to stormwater since chloride levels in stormwater are often very low e g a mean concentration of chloride was found to be around 11 mg l for a few urban catchments in australia nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 this paper presents the first feasibility study of eco technology for stormwater disinfection by considering its performance reliability energy efficiency anode durability and disinfection by product levels one hypothesis was initially formed based on aforementioned studies in wastewater treatment disinfection of harvested stormwater could be achieved by eco technology despite very low chloride levels usually present usually 10 mg l possibly due to direct anodic oxidation or production of reactive oxygen species specifically the objectives include quantify the disinfection performance with respect to different eco system configurations anode type and anode distance and operational conditions operational voltage and investigate the energy efficiency under different system configurations and operational conditions investigate the eco processes which govern the disinfection of stormwater test the durability of selected anodes after long term operation and validate the eco disinfection performance using real stormwater samples with different properties including the measurement of disinfection by products dbps in general this study provides implications for applying eco as a low energy consumption technology for stormwater disinfection with reliable treatment performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 the experimental set up a commercial dimensional stable anode dsa using iridium and ruthenium oxides titanium oxides ruo2 iro2 manufactured by suzhou fenggang titanium co ltd in china was used for this study because of its low cost and good past performance for wastewater treatment arevalo and calmano 2007 kraft 2008 abd ellah et al 2013 the anodes were manufactured into rectangular plates with dimensions of 2 5 cm by 5 cm pure titanium mesh with the same dimensions was used as the cathode anode and cathode were mounted onto a glass beaker at pre determined distances to create a single compartment electrolysis cell see supplementary data sf1 the beaker was placed on a magnetic stirrer platform with a rotating speed of 800 rpm during the experiment a direct current dc power supplier ex 375l2 0 60v 0 25a takasago ltd japan applied the same voltage to three electrolysis cells replicate at the same time system current of the electrolysis cell was measured continuously during the experiment 2 2 performance study using synthetic stormwater synthetic stormwater that had characteristics as typical stormwater treated by biofilters was used to ensure that the same conditions were kept for the large number of tests a similar approach was used in previous stormwater technology development studies bratieres et al 2008 hatt et al 2009b the synthetic pre treated stormwater chemistry is shown in table s1 and briefly discussed below the deionised water was mixed with natural sediment collected from a stormwater pond to achieve a total suspended solid concentration equivalent to a typical stormwater biofilter effluent s event mean concentration emcs after sampling this slurry to determine chemical properties of interest laboratory grade chemicals were added to top up and simulate chemical properties significant to electrochemical oxidation performance these include typical biofiltrated stormwater emcs of major cations c a 2 m g 2 k n a anions s o 4 2 h c o 3 p o 4 3 total organic nitrogen chloride was topped up 9 mg l to achieve the concentration of the lower 5th percentile in untreated urban stormwater based on australian stormwater harvesting and reuse guidelines nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 disinfection performance validated for the lower 5th percentile chloride concentration ensured a conservative understanding of its feasibility in real application the synthetic stormwater had electric conductivity of 105 μs cm and ph of 7 1 as is the case in field conditions nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 in this initial study e coli k1 strain atcc 11775 was used as an indicator for bacteria water contamination this strain is pathogenic to most birds and was originally isolated from the natural environment johnson et al 2007 it also has a stronger resilience to the harsh environment compared to other commonly used lab strains of e coli the initial e coli concentration used in this study was estimated based on the worst case scenario of e coli levels in effluents from stormwater biofilters since the 95th percentile e coli concentration of raw stormwater is 183 382mpn 100 ml duncan 1999 nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 and stormwater biofiltration systems could achieve on average of 1 2 log reduction li et al 2012 2016 chandrasena et al 2014 the e coli concentration in synthetic biofiltrated stormwater was adjusted to 10 000mpn 100 ml the prepared stormwater of 400 ml was placed in a beaker and the selected current density was applied three different operational voltages 4v 7v and 14v and three electrode distances 3 mm 10 mm and 20 mm were tested to assess the influence of system configuration on stormwater disinfection and energy consumption a control with no voltage supply was also tested under the same conditions each configuration was replicated three times it should be noted that the tested voltages were well above the anode s oxygen evolution voltage of 1 56v six 10 ml stormwater samples were taken for each test a sample before the test started and five during the test the sampling times varied from experiment to experiment to ensure that the entire disinfection process was captured these samples were then assayed for e coli concentration using the previously described colilert method idexx laboratories 2007 immediately after each test each 10 ml sample was diluted with 90 ml of deionised water to achieve a dilution factor of 10 the detection range of aforementioned sampling method was from 10 mpn 100 ml to 24 196 mpn 100 ml for dilution factor 1 10 2 3 disinfection mechanism study this part of the study investigated the eco processes which govern the disinfection firstly the effectiveness of possible chlorination from a limited amount of chloride present in the stormwater was examined by comparing the eco disinfection between the typical stormwater using the above synthetic receipt with chloride of 9 mg l and chloride free synthetic stormwater to prepare chloride free stormwater sodium nitrate that has minimum impact on electrochemical systems martínez huitle and brillas 2009 was used as a substitute for sodium chloride in the stormwater preparation to achieve water of the same electrical conductivity as the original 105 μs cm although most previous studies showed poor direct production of hydroxyl radical from titanium based metal oxides anodes due to their low oxygen evolution potential cong 2008 kraft 2008 martínez huitle and brillas 2009 it was speculated that hydroxyl radical production might be produced stormwater harvested using soil based biofilters usually have an excessive ferrous iron concentration 0 3 mg l feng et al 2012 and it was hypothesised that hydroxyl radicals may be produced as an intermediary through the interaction between ferrous ion and hydrogen peroxide zhang et al 2006 to verify the effectiveness of possible hydroxyl radical production excessive amounts 0 03m of tert butanol t buoh a well known hydroxyl radical scavenger comninellis 1994 were added into the synthetic stormwater disinfection performance of this hydroxyl radical free solution was then compared with the performance of the original synthetic stormwater an initial test of e coli survival was done showing no biocidal effect from either added sodium nitrate or 0 03m of t buoh the effectiveness of possible chlorination and possible hydroxyl radical production was tested under both low and high operational currents 0 75 ma cm2 4 2 ma cm2 three replicates were used following the same sampling procedure as in the above performance study the concentrations of free chlorine and total chlorine were tested using a dr 5000 spectrophotometer hach according to the usepa method apha awwa wpcf 2005 the detection range of free and total chlorine using the selected method method 8021 is from 0 02 mg l to 2 mg l a fluorescent study of the intactness of e coli cells was used to investigate the impact of eco on stormwater microbes three types of images were taken by an optical microscope om boulos et al 1999 i bright field image of e coli for general inspection ii fluorescent image of e coli stained by propidium iodide pi 1 μg ml to show all the e coli cells present in water iii fluorescent image of e coli stained by 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dapi 5 μg ml to show the cells with permeable or broken membrane only due to the low concentration of cell numbers in the tested stormwater a series of centrifugation 8000 rpm over 5 min was used to achieve a concentration of around 106 cells ml in suspended solution samples were stained in a mixture of 1 μg ml propidium iodide pi sigma aldrich and 5 μg ml 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dapi sigma aldrich for 10 min stained samples were then washed three times using sterilized pbs solution to remove excess dye prepared samples were examined using nikon c 1 confocal microscope under 600 magnification and fluorescent light source transmission electron microscope tem was also used to examine the morphological and structure change of e coli after eco disinfection live and eco disinfected e coli samples concentrated following the same method as describes in above fluorescent test were firstly fixed with 2 5 of glutaraldehyde for 2 h fixed cells were then dehydrated using acetone and resin embedded at 60 c for 48 h embedded samples were then cut into 70 nm layers and examined using tem h7500 hitachi 2 4 anode deterioration study a drop in the anode performance was observed after 8 10 h of its cumulative usage time so the experiments done after that time were not reported in this paper however after approximately 20 h of the active anode use the experiments with the currents of 0 75 ma cm2 and 1 75 ma cm2 were repeated to assess the level of deterioration scanning electron microscope sem images were done on samples 3 mm by 5 mm of both unused and used deteriorated anodes the anode samples were initially washed using 0 02m hydrochloric acid hcl and then by 97 ethanol within an ultrasonic bath each washing lasted 15 min the surface morphology and elements distribution were then obtained with fei magellan 400 fegsem fei america operated at 10 kv distribution of doping metals ti ru and ir was examined using energy dispersive x ray edx detector mapping velásquez et al 2000 2 5 performance validation study using real stormwater an attempt was made to validate the results obtained using synthetic stormwater by running a small subset of tests with actual stormwater the tests also included monitoring of disinfection by products dbps in the treated stormwater stormwater samples were collected at the monash carpark stormwater biofilter well tested in the past hatt et al 2009a zhang et al 2014 troup s creek stormwater constructed wetland and clifton hill stormwater biofilter all these wsud systems are located within the melbourne metropolitan region the selection of stormwater catchment sites aimed to capture variabilities in pre treated stormwater quality so as to test the eco for a wide range of possible field conditions monash carpark biofilter receives stormwater runoff from concrete surfaces with a relatively small catchment size biofiltrated stormwater collected from this site is relatively less polluted comparing to stormwater collected from residential catchments and has similar chemical properties to the tested synthetic stormwater troups creek wetland is a typical end of the catchment stormwater treatment system located in the outer suburbs of melbourne it receives raw stormwater from residential urban and non developed natural surfaces clifton hill biofilter is located in the inner melbourne area and mainly receives residential runoff one water sample was gathered at outflows of these systems during different rainfall events eco disinfection under 1 75 ma cm2 that was found to be effective for synthetic stormwater was then performed for 30 min using three replicates of these samples the sampling method applied in this study followed the same procedure as described in the performance study both indigenous e coli and total coliform were assayed using colilert method meanwhile collected stormwater samples were sent to a nata certified national association of testing authorities australia laboratory for testing of metals ph bicarbonate total organic carbon and chlorination related disinfection by products dbps all samples were analysed according to the standard methods apha awwa wpcf 2005 dbps such as total halogenated methanes thms halogenated acetic acids haas and halogenated volatile solids hvols were tested only in troup s creek water samples before and after eco treatment since this source water contained the highest concentrations of chloride and organic matter which possibly could lead to high levels of dbps 2 6 data analysis to assess the disinfection performance e coli concentration was plotted against the operational time for all the performed eco tests e coli decay rate was calculated for each test using a simple linear regression model between e coli concentration and elapsed time the average linear decay rate k was estimated for each configuration using the three replicates in this study the linear model showed better fitting to the observed data comparing to conventional exponential models possibly due to special stormwater characteristics however observed eco disinfection kinetic of the synthetic stormwater during the tests under operational voltage u of 7 v and current density id of 0 75 ma cm2 was also qualitatively examined in relation to the wastewater eco disinfection kinetic model proposed by lópez gálvez et al 2012 to illustrate the different eco disinfection kinetics between wastewater and stormwater this model assumes that there are two phases in the eco disinfection of e coli over time equation 1 phase 1 the shoulder where there is no or slow rate of disinfection due to time needed to achieve the cell damage and competition between microbe and organics for oxidants and phase 2 tail or exponential decay where the disinfection decay follows the simple first order kinetics 1 n i n 0 n r e s e k t e k s l 1 e k s l 1 e k t where n i is e coli concentration at time i n 0 is the initial e coli concentration n r e s is the residual e coli concentration s l is the shoulder length k is the specific exponential inactivation rate to compare the efficiency of the tested eco configurations within the synthetic stormwater performance study the time and energy needed to achieve a three log reduction disinfection below the detection limit of e coli was used for each configuration t3 log defined as the time required achieving 3 log reduction hour was calculated using the average decay rate k unit energy consumption e u expressed in terms of kw h electricity consumed to achieve 3 log reduction in one tonne of stormwater was calculated as 2 e u u i t 3 l o g 1000 2500 where u is the applied voltage v i is the operational current a 1000 is the conversion from w to kw and 2500 is the volume conversion factor considering the volume increasing from 0 4l to 1000l to examine the key disinfection mechanisms the eco disinfection performance of four synthetic stormwater tests with without chloride and with without hydroxyl radical scavenger was plotted together with the controls for comparison images taken by optical microscope om transmission electron microscope tem scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive x ray edx detector were compared only qualitatively 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance study using synthetic stormwater the change of the e coli levels over operational time for all tested configurations was plotted in fig 1 a linear decay of disinfection was observed for most configurations e g fig 2 a shows an example of the observed decay kinetics for an applied current of 0 75 ma cm2 this was different from a traditional exponential decay kinetics reported in most wastewater eco disinfection studies dhar et al 1981 matsunaga et al 1992 fang et al 2006 the disinfection kinetics of synthetic stormwater did not follow the model proposed for wastewater by lópez gálvez et al 2012 equation 1 a typical shoulder kinetic described in this model was not observed in the measured results this may be due to the low level of total organic matter tom 3 mg l in pre treated stormwater where the oxidants produced from eco could be more efficiently used for deactivation of microorganisms than in the case of wastewaters that have much higher organic content there was no difference p 0 01 between the performance of 4v 3 mm and 7v 10 mm configurations fig 1 since both configurations had the same current density it is suggested that concentration polarisation does not have a significant effect even when the electrode distance was the smallest 3 mm due to the low electrical conductivity of stormwater minimum possible electrode distance is preferred in future practice to ensure energy efficiency when the current was very low 0 25 ma cm2 the linear decay rate k was only 28 cells 100 ml min almost the same as the decay rate of the control that had no current supplied under the highest testing current density of 4 2 ma cm2 total disinfection was achieved within the first 20 s corresponding to a rapid decay rate of 27 061 per 100 ml min a clear correlation was found between operational time to achieve a 3 log reduction and the operational current fig 2b the unit energy consumed to achieve a 3 log reduction of disinfection decreased with an increase of the current fig 2b this is a surprising finding since the results from published wastewater eco studies suggest a reverse trend i e the consumed unit energy increases with an increase in the current abd ellah et al 2013 this is probably due to some differences in disinfection mechanisms between wastewater and stormwater which is discussed further in the section below 3 2 the mechanism of eco disinfection of stormwater eco did not perform any disinfection in the chloride free synthetic stormwater during both low and high currents fig 3 a and b in contrast disinfection performance of the original synthetic stormwater that contained cl 9 mg l was good replicating the decay observed in the above synthetic stormwater performance study the results suggest that eco in stormwater is driven by chloride ions although the water contains chloride levels well below the previously tested concentrations of 160 10 000 mg l in wastewater and surface water applications fang et al 2006 arevalo and calmano 2007 jeong et al 2009 cho et al 2014 schaefer et al 2015 2016 the presence of hydroxyl radical scavenger t buoh did not influence the disinfection performance fig 3c and d this shows that production of hydroxyl radical is not a significant pathway in dsa configurations which has good agreement with the literature on dsa applications to wastewater lacasa et al 2012 it therefore indicates that the high levels of ferrous iron in the stormwater did not play any role in the eco disinfection performance of stormwater using dsa the above results suggest that for typical stormwater chlorination is the key mechanism of e coli disinfection i e the eco system can utilise very low concentrations of the present chloride for active chlorine production however we did not fully confirm this finding since we were not able to detect any form of chlorine at the end of the control tests where no e coli was added to stormwater e g free chlorine was always below the detection limit of 0 02 mg l at the end of control experiments with no spiked e coli even under the highest testing current of 4 2 ma cm2 t3 log 0 33min this was surprising since the calculation based on the chlorine contact time ct curve developed by white 1992 who suggested that the required active chlorine concentration as hypochlorous acid to achieve 2 log inactivation of e coli under the same condition t2 log 0 33 min ph 7 should be at least 1 2 mg l we can only hypothesise why this is the case it could be simply that white s ct curve cannot be applied to stormwater that has very low cl concentrations it appears that there may be some differences between eco disinfection mechanisms in stormwater in comparison to wastewater in a wastewater environment high concentrations of chlorine are usually generated due to high initial cl concentrations the disinfection reaction is then just restricted by the interaction between microorganism and free chlorine abd ellah et al 2013 in this case increase of the current although may produce more free chlorine will not efficiently reduce the reaction rate i e increase the disinfection rate abd ellah et al 2013 in contrast the chlorine production is limited in stormwater due to low cl levels so all the produced free chlorine will be rapidly taken up by microorganisms or organic compounds close to the anode before it dissolves into the bulk solution in this case the reaction rate is limited by the chlorine production rate only increasing the current facilitates chlorine production to achieve a high reaction efficiency this explains the finding previously discussed in fig 2b that shows the unit energy consumed to achieve 3 log reduction of disinfection decreased with an increase of the current from fig 4 that shows the tem image of e coli in untreated a and b and treated c and d synthetic stormwater the morphology of cell membranes changed significantly after eco treatment for example the outer membrane became rough and wrinkled after the treatment while cavities were formed inside some cells this indicates that cytoplasmic membrane of these gram negative bacteria were compromised zeng et al 2015 according to previous studies active chlorine can attack the phospholipid molecule existing in the bilayer system causing consequent increased membrane permeability rice et al 1999 further attack leads to a fully damaged cytoplasmic membrane in which the exchange between intracellular and extracellular material will occur martínez huitle and brillas 2009 however this was not directly seen from the tem images the cavities and fibrils formed on disinfected e coli cells indicate the possible damage of dna and intracellular material kim et al 2008 fig 5 a b and c showed the images of e coli from the untreated water sample it is clear that e coli was only stained by blue 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dapi fig 5b but not red propidium iodide pi fig 5c pi could only stain cells with damaged cytoplasmic membrane which means e coli were intact before the eco disinfection however after the treatment fig 5e and f showed the distribution of dapi and pi stained cells are identical meaning that the majority of present e coli were dead because of membrane damage this confirmed the findings from the tem images 3 3 durability of the anode during the first 8 10 h of cumulative operation i e total usage time no drop in the anode performance was observed however a rather sharp decrease of their performance was noticed with further usage e g t3 log that was initially equal to 15 and 2 min at the current densities of 0 75 ma cm2 and 1 75 ma cm2 respectively increased to 40 and 11 min respectively after approximately 20 h of the anode use it was also clear that the performance drop was more significant under lower current densities sem images of the new and used anodes explained this drop in performance fig 6 an image of a new anode showed a relatively even distribution of three functional doping elements titanium ti iridium ir and ruthenium ru across the surface fig 6a the surface morphology of the anode changed significantly after approximately 20 h of operation as indicated by non uniform electron reflection from the sample surface fig 6b and c e g bigger cracks were formed on the surface element composition results from edx detector revealed a considerable reduction of the relative percentage of iridium and ruthenium on the sample surface also some elements which were not present on unused samples were discovered on the used anode surface such as aluminium and silicon polarisation is one of the common reasons causing deterioration of dsa anodes which is reflected by an increase in cell voltage during its operation comninellis and vercesi 1991 however the increased cell voltage was not observed in this study suggesting that alternative mechanism may exist for the anode deterioration stormwater has a very low concentration of chloride which leads to an oxygen evolution dominated reaction across the anode surface fierro et al 2007 who performed an anode oxygen evolution study using isotope oxygen in metal oxide coating of anode surface detected the isotope oxygen from the oxygen gas produced from the anode surface i e they suggested that oxygen gas was produced through a replacement of oxygen elements of the metal oxides by oxygen from water molecules it is hypothesised that the dominant oxygen evolution process occurring on the anode in stormwater will cause more rapid damage on the surface compared to eco applications to wastewater where oxygen evolution is negligible 3 4 preliminary validation using real stormwater the collected stormwater samples from different sites had very different initial electrical conductivity so to achieve the same current density of 1 75 ma cm2 different voltage had to be applied to each water sample table 1 disinfection below the detection limit of both indigenous e coli and total coliform was achieved after 5 min for the monash university carpark biofilter sample while approximately 15 min was needed for the troup s creek wetland water there was a small drop in performance with an increase in cl levels troup s creek wetland outflow had chloride concentration of 200 mg l compared to the monash biofilter of only 9 mg l this could be attributed to the higher total organic carbon toc levels in troup s creek water in comparison to monash samples which could have caused competition with microorganism for the uptake of free chlorine for example high toc levels were the reason that cho et al 2014 cho et al 2014 who used dsa anode to treat domestic wastewater with extra addition of 1860 mg l chloride achieved 3 log reduction of faecal coliform after a very long time 3 h at the operational current density of 2 09 ma cm2 eco was not able to disinfect stormwater from the clifton hill biofilter which contained only 2 mg l of chloride it can only be speculated that this level of chloride was not enough to support the chlorination process as already outlined dbps including hvols thms and haas were only tested in the water originally collected from troup s creek as due to its high levels of chloride and organics it presented the worst case scenario out of the three sites the tested result showed the negligible concentration of hvols the concentration of thms and haas were 0 015 mg l and 0 024 mg l respectively the australian drinking water guidelines suggest that the health concentration limits for these two compounds should be 0 25 mg l and 0 25 mg l respectively nhmrc 2011 therefore it was found that the dbps in disinfected stormwater by eco were of no concern 4 conclusions this study investigated for the first time the feasibility study of eco technology for stormwater disinfection disinfection performance of e coli was tested using a dimensional stable anode dsa in a series of batch experiments with synthetic stormwater of typical chemical and microbial composition results show that all tested eco configurations were effective in disinfection of e coli except for the configuration with the lowest operational current density of 0 25 ma cm2 the disinfection performance was significantly increased with a higher operational current the energy efficiency for stormwater eco disinfection also increased with higher operational current oxidation of chloride was shown to be the key pathway in stormwater eco disinfection although the chloride concentration is only 9 mg l in the synthetic stormwater effective disinfection performance was achieved without any extra chemical addition it was found that dsa deteriorated after 8 10 h of accumulated operation very likely due to the high voltage that had to be applied to low saline stormwater to achieve the required current density validation study showed that total disinfection was achieved for the two sites where chloride levels of the real stormwater were 9 and 200 mg l respectively but not for the third site where stormwater contained only 2 mg l chloride dbps in eco disinfected stormwater were all below australia drinking water guideline values acknowledgement we thank rebekah henry christelle schang and richard williamson from our water research team at monash
