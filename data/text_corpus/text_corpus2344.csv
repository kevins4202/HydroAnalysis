11720,groundwater remains a vital natural resource and its security should be the top priority for everyone continuous indiscriminate waste dumping and unruly human behaviour towards environmental management and strategies require a holistic approach to guarantee environmental security this study assesses the impacts of dumpsite leachate on soil and groundwater quality using geophysical and physicochemical water analysis approaches data were collected at dumpsites and a sample station using geo electrical resistivity the impact of the dumpsite s leachate plumes on the soil and groundwater quality was investigated the resistivity values distributed within the dumpsites and the sample station indicate that the dumpsite leachate plumes have impacted the ground both vertically and horizontally the physicochemical water analysis was carried out on four hand dug wells within the radius of 61 m of the open dumpsites the results indicate the presence of heavy metals physical drilling depicts soft subsoil while the geophysical result is characterized by low resistivity values which show a good match the soft soil heavy metal presence and low resistivity values suggest that the soil and the aquifer systems within and around dumpsites have been compromised by the leachate plums which had seeped the ground down to the water table high ion concentrations associated with leachate plumes have critically influenced the conductivity of subsoil and the groundwater within and around dumpsites however unpolluted fresh water can be achieved below 23 m depth the combined geophysical investigation and physiochemical water analysis can give an account of dumpsite leachates activities on ground resources graphical abstract image 1 keywords dumpsite controlled station impact groundwater subsoil resistivity leachate plumes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater remains a vital natural resource that requires continuous and concerted efforts to protect it continuous indiscriminate waste dumping and unruly human behaviour towards environmental management and strategies require a holistic approach to environmental security studies show that open dumpsites remain the most popular source of water and environmental pollution divya et al 2020 laskar et al 2022 open dumpsites are the most common practice all over the world for municipal solid waste msw disposal and their environmental impacts have received much attention in the last decades el salam abu zuid 2015 mishra et al 2019 especially in developing countries where most solid wastes are carelessly disposed environmental impacts and public health risks of open dumpsites include subsoil contamination groundwater pollution generation of volatile organic compounds vocs and creation of greenhouse gas emissions remain issues of great concern charles et al 2013 samantar et al 2017 vaccari et al 2018 unlike developed countries most african countries rely on open dumpsites without a standardized sanitary landfill omeiza et al 2022 according to the international solid waste association iswa and the united nations environment programme unep the msw generation in developed countries is fast beginning to stable however unep expresses fear over the upsurge in waste generation in developing nations while economic activities continue to crawl across the world collivignarelli et al 2011 vaccari et al 2019 developing nations are the most affected by this necessary devil dumpsite fig 1 nigeria has been reported as taking the lead position among the 50 world s biggest active dumpsites from 30 countries because nigeria alone maintains 12 of the 50 world s biggest active dumpsites unep 2015 with the adverse effects of dumpsites on human health and the environment urgent attention is required to prevent the prevailing indiscriminate wastes disposal in developing nations because the situation has reached a critical point vaccari et al 2018 parvin and tareq 2021 recent studies show that the challenge of environmental pollution and waste management is one of the major concerns of researchers and geoscientists across the globe okpoli 2013 vaverková 2019 mahmoud et al 2022 however the environmental impacts of dumpsites are not limited to the groundwater resources it also affects ground soil as well as human health shen et al 2019 with the current increase of open dumpsites all over the world especially in africa the qualities of underground resources such as soil and water are under major threat ekeocha et al 2012 this is because all dumpsites large or small are usually associated with leachate plumes and odorous gas polluting the environment and water resources aljaradin and persson 2015 reports indicate that the degree of leachate impacts and emission gases of a landfill depends on the nature of landfills eggen et al 2010 arndt 2014 mojiri et al 2021 however pollution problems are particularly severe for waste dumped in abandoned gravel pits and sediment regions which may extend down to the groundwater table okpoli 2013 the solution to these challenges in our modern urban society demands fast and effective special geophysical techniques due to high ion concentrations associated with landfill leachates which in turn weaken the subsoil resistivity studies revealed that the leachates formed within the dumpsite rarely remained at the point of discharge abdullahi et al 2010 omeiza et al 2022 they are transported through the porous media within the subsurface this is because water pollution happens mostly through the percolation of fluvial water and the infiltration of contaminants via the soil in waste disposal sites alao et al 2022a therefore ground resistivity is related to various geological parameters such as the mineral and fluid content porosity and degree of water saturation in the rock alao et al 2022b consequently a vertical electrical resistivity technique was chosen as a suitable technique for delineating the resistivity distribution within and around the dumpsites to evaluate the extent of dumpsite leachate plumes because the geo electrical resistivity investigation provides excellent subsurface information with non destructive means of investigation for identifying the leachate plumes of landfills however the major environmental concern of this research is the impact of open dumpsite leachate on the subsoil and groundwater quality 2 site overview the investigated dumpsites are located within the kaduna metropolis all the dumpsites are mining open dumpsites without a standardized sanitary landfill as obtainable in most parts of the world dumpsite 1 is a mining open dumpsite located at goni gora kaduna on the geographical coordinate of latitude of 10 24 22 32 n and longitude of 7 20 20 76 e in the northern part of nigeria fig 2 the dumpsite according to the community leader has been in existence for the past 21 years the dumpsite covers a total landmass of 12 000 m square on an average height of 626 m kakuri ne sheet 144 1 50 000 above the level by estimation the volume of the dumpsite is about 36 400 m 3 that is it contains about 36 400 m 3 of msw it consists of heterogeneous refuse with a maximum difference in elevation between the top of the solid waste and the surrounding area of 5 m with an average height of 3 9 m fig 3 the dumpsite is surrounded by many residential areas with over 12 000 people living within a 2 km radius of the landfill dumpsite 2 is a mining open dumpsite located at anguwan dosa in kaduna city on the geographical coordinate of latitude of 10 2 22 32 n and longitude of 7 20 20 76 e in the northern part of nigeria fig 3 the dumpsite has been in operation for the past 38 years it covers a total landmass of 10 500 m square by estimation the volume of the dumpsite is about 47 250 m 3 with all kinds of garbage of a maximum height of on 5 9 between the top of the solid waste and the surrounding area dumpsite 3 is a mining open dumpsite located at anguwan dosa within kaduna city on the geographical coordinate of latitude of 10 24 18 02 n and longitude of 7 35 23 06 e the dumpsite has been in existence for the past 27 years it covers a total landmass of 12 000 m square with a maximum gradient of 5 m between the solid waste and the surrounding area and an average height of 3 2 m fig 3 by estimation the volume of the dumpsite is about 36 400 m 3 however the dumpsites accept all kinds of waste such as domestic sewage or wastes animal and human excretion medical wastes municipal wastes industrial wastes agricultural wastes and other hazardous wastes though more than two thirds of the investigated dumpsites contain biodegradable waste materials that can get rot decompose and release harmful gases into the environment there is no subsurface drainage system to collect the leachate around the investigated dumpsites therefore the dumpsite leachates may go directly seep the ground down to the water table it was also noted that there was no noticeable river or stream around the dumpsites which implies that the drainage system of the terrane is very poor as the terrain can only be drained by both surface water surface runoff and groundwater infiltration this could further ease the seeping of dumpsite leachates through the subsoil the storage capacity of the dumpsites is not limited to the given volume since they are uncontrollable open dumpsites and their increments depend on the rate of waste dumping 2 1 climatic conditions understanding the impacts of climate change on open dumpsites is a critical component of environmental management strategies predictions on climate impacts on open dumpsites are a difficult task that requires a technical and scientific approach sam and dettinger 2011 there may be little significant difference in the characteristics of the dumpsite leachate across the world due to inhomogeneous changes in climate from one country to another therefore the solid waste characteristics may depend on the nature of the nations concerned omeiza et al 2022 for instance african nations are generally hot particularly northern nigeria sitting near the equator studies revealed that the climatic variation and geological components such as soil nature soil electrical conductivity and temperature can trigger the rate at which solid wastes break down and seeping the ground arndt 2014 tejera et al 2019 bian 2020 tahiria et al 2022 a tropical country like nigeria where the yearly precipitation varies between 1000 and 1500 mm and the temperatures vary between 24 c and 38 c abdullahi et al 2010 omeiza and dary 2018 may reflect the impacts of dynamic open dumpsite leachates that is regional climatic conditions can control and influence the nature of leachate plumes from a dynamic dumpsite therefore it is expected that the decomposition rate and pollution rate should be high across tropical countries 2 2 regional geology the general geology of nigeria consists of two main lithological units which include the precambrian crystalline basement complex and cretaceous tertiary sedimentary rocks oyawoye 1970 the regional geology of kaduna is complex basement rock distribution however these lucid basement rocks have been subjected to various hardships and deformation of varying intensities over time resulting in the folding and fracturing of the rocks abdullahi et al 2010 the distinctive feature of this formation is its undulations in addition to fracturing and jointing of beds the district rocks are occasionally capped by combined laterites sandstones quartzites and silty soil exceptionally at the surface the laterites in the domain have existed and endured into lateritic nodules as opposed to ammophilous clays and silty soil over the period aboh et al 2016 studies have shown that the bioclimatic nature of the kaduna environment has been greatly affected by deep chemical weathering and fluvial erosion which has metamorphous into the high undulating plains consequently the aquifer unit of the regions consists of weathered fractured or clayey sand sand oyawoye 1970 ameyan and alabi 1987 olayinka 1992 there are no terrestrial geological formations outcropping at the dumpsite and its surroundings the topsoil is highly variable in composition texture and colour predominantly laterite and quartz grains deep brown or reddish brown soil in most places isaac et al 2010 2 3 hydrogeology the regional hydrogeology of any terrain is usually influenced and controlled by climatic factors and drainage systems leachate influx can be influenced by the drainage system of a terrain aljaradin and persson 2015 however there are no noticeable streams around the dumpsite other surface waters are directly drained by evaporation infiltration and run off the degree of surface water movement can enhance the extent of vertical leachate however there may be a slight change in the rate of leachate contaminants in some other studies across the world because the waste characteristics and the contaminant process usually depend on the nature of the countries concerned tejera et al 2019 vaccari et al 2019 roychoudhury and chakraborty 2021 for example in some parts of nigeria where the annual rainfall ranges from 1000 to 1500 mm omeiza and dogara 2018 may reflect the rate at which dumpsite leachates infiltrate the soil to contaminate groundwater most tropical regions like nigeria suffers severe rainstorm and heavy erosion which could increase the possibility of surface and groundwater contamination 3 active dumpsites in developing nations the management of msw has always been a serious challenge and threat to the people living in the cities especially in developing countries like nigeria due to the financial burden of waste management lack of technical capacity and the increasing stream of waste generated driven by industrialization urbanization and population growth park et al 2010 yusuf and abiye 2019 rowland and omonefe 2021 landfilling is the cheapest and simplest means of msw disposal msw ogungbe et al 2012 the indiscriminate disposal of liquid and solid wastes is not uncommon in many parts of the world and the impacts on ambient soil and groundwater resources especially in tropical regions and low income earned countries cannot be overemphasized the common ways of solid waste management in the world involve open dumping disposal into seas and sanitary landfills vaverková 2019 gupta et al 2020 unfortunately open dumping and disposal into seas are the most popular methods among low income earned nations because it is cheap and simple another popular msw management in the metropolis of developing countries commonly involves waste collection transportation and emptying into an open dumpsite or dumping it into the sea which is commonly done haphazardly rowland and omonefe 2021 and consequently puts human health on high risk these methods are highly discouraged and not quite satisfactory due to the high risk to public health arising from the breeding of mosquitoes flies obnoxious odours untidy environment and fire hazards involved aljaradin and persson 2015 despite its potentially hazardous impacts on the environment several nations continue to employ the service of open dumpsites for waste management ahmed et al 2019 bian 2020 this method of waste disposal dominates the entire land of nigeria due to its low cost of operation while sanitary landfills for waste management are not prominent in nigeria due to the high cost of construction and operation however leachate ordinarily forms when water seeps the solid waste into a dynamic open dumpsite which in turn is transported in form of pollutants mojiri et al 2021 dumpsite leachates are liquid that leaches from dumpsites and it normally contains some dissolved and suspended materials leachates are usually considered one of the common liquid that infiltrates subsoil down the water table to pollute it al tarazi et al 2008 mojiri et al 2017 vaccari et al 2019 when some solid wastes are dumped into a dynamic dumpsite for many years it naturally decomposes and sweats municipal dumpsite leachate contains contaminants which are classified into four 4 main groups this include heavy metals organic contaminants and substrates inorganic compounds dissolved solids and colour on the other hand dumpsite leachate s age can be classified into three 3 major groups the old the intermediate and the young the acid phase as shown in table 1 the leachates are usually dominated by low ph levels high volatile acids and highly degraded organic matter mojiri et al 2021 4 materials and methods the data collection was done with the help of the earth resistivity and its components field hammer electrodes magnetic compass measuring tape cutlass cables and reels thermometers and global positioning system gps was also used in the acquisition of the field data some bottled plastic rubbers were used to collect water samples from four hand dug wells hdw for physiochemical water analysis 4 1 physio chemical data physiochemical data was collected from four 4 different hand dug well hdw within a radius of 61 m from dumpsite 1 the first and second hdws are located 27 m 32 m away from dumpsite 1 while the third and fourth hdws are located about 47 m and 61 m the sample of water collected was kept in clean bottled plastic rubbers for analysis the parameters measured include biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand bod total dissolved solids tds cadmium c d 2 lead p b 2 the electrical conductivity σ the potential of hydrogen ph chromium cr in the month of april 2022 during the investigation an attempt was made to drill the soil to a depth of 1 0 m within the dumpsites and the sample station for a critical analysis 4 2 geophysical technique ohmega ω resistivity meter was used to collect geo electrical electrical resistivity data using schlumberger configuration a total of twenty seven 27 vertical electrical sounding ves points were established at different locations within the three dumpsites with a maximum spread ab 2 of 50 m fig 4 is an electrical resistivity schlumberger configuration using four electrodes while acquiring the field data schlumberger array works on the principle of ohm s law dogara et al 2017 alao et al 2019 that is 1 v i r the soil s resistive response to the flow of current through the ground can be expressed as 2 ρ a r k where r is resistivity ρ a represents apparent resistivity and k is a geometrical factor k factor evaluated from the arrangement of the four electrodes shown in fig 4 that is the k factor depends on the arrangement of the four electrodes telford et al 1990 and is expressed as 3 k 2 π 1 a c 1 c b 1 a d 1 b d 1 where ac ad bc and bd are the distances in metres between the respective electrodes from fig 4 central symmetric array a c b d a n d b c a d thus equation 3 can be simplified and reduced to equation 4 4 k π a c a d c d 5 data acquisition and processing an omega resistivity terrameter and its accessories were used to obtain all the electrical resistivity field data a total of twenty 27 ves points were investigated four 4 ves points at the sample station ten 10 ves points from dumpsite 1 eight 8 ves points at dumpsite 2 and five 5 ves points from dumpsite 3 were investigated the chosen sample station which is about 200 m away from dumpsite 1 is to serve as a controlled station for this work the subsurface resistivity data acquired were fed into computer software res id version 1 for interpretation fig 5 shows one of the resulting curves for ves station b3 along profile b however the resistivity measurement is based on the inhomogeneity of the subsurface resistivity values measured and calculated ground apparent resistivity of the model blocks with the fit accuracy which was expressed in terms of a root mean square rms error ekeocha et al 2012 5 1 evaluation of the dumpsite leachate leach the dumpsite leachate leach was estimated using percentage error or defect the subsurface layered resistivity obtained from the controlled station was considered to be an ideal true value while the subsurface layered resistivity obtained from the dumpsites was taken as the observed value thereafter the defect value which depends on the magnitude of the difference between the real and the observed values were calculated for each ves station so the drop out percentage degree of leached in percentage can be expressed by equation 5 5 d e f e c t v t v o v t 100 where v t resistivity value at the controlled station and v 0 resistivity value at the dumpsite 6 results and discussion after quantitative and qualitative analysis the model parameters were further processed to generate a geo electric profile of the terrain figs 6 9 this section describes the subsoil electrical conductive properties the geo electrical information and the subsoil profile of the layered rock sequence characterized by the values of layer resistivity loke 2000 okpoli 2013 dogara et al 2017 6 1 geoelectric depth section for the controlled station fig 6 indicates the geoelectric geologic profile of the controlled sample station the sample station is about 0 2 km 29 km and 28 km away from dumpsites 1 2 and 3 respectively the site was chosen to compare its results to that of the dumpsite and consequently was used to assess the degree of impact of the dumpsite leachates on the subsoil and the groundwater resources from the four 4 ves stations investigated the results indicate highly variable topsoil with mean resistivity and thickness values of 857 ωm and 1 8 m respectively the succeeding layer is consolidated by laterite sand with resistivity values varying between 2510 ωm and 5102 ωm the third layer constitutes the water bearing aquifer unit with resistivity and thickness ranging from 69 ωm to 103 ωm and 10 m 16 m respectively however alao et al 2022a an overburden thickness less than 12 m 12 m may likely contain excessive groundwater potential and be protective from near surface pollution the indurate resistive compacted lateritic topsoil and the impermeable clay layers overlying the aquifer unit may increase the protective capacity index of the groundwater the last layer is extremely resistive with resistivity values ranging from 4510 ωm to 10 510 ωm which may suggest a fresh basement the sample station resistivity values in comparison with previous work within the crystalline basement terrain of northern nigeria by isaac et al 2010 abdullahi et al 2010 olawuyi and abolarin 2013 bashir et al 2014 aboh et al 2016 kure et al 2017 dogara et al 2017 show that there is no action or impact of leachate plumes contamination on the basement rocks 6 2 geoelectric depth section of the dumpsites figs 7 9 show all the depth profiles taken in the dumpsite1 2 3 respectively the landfill impacts on the groundwater were evaluated from the resistivity depth profile of the three dumpsites fig 7 shows the subsoil profile of the 10 ves points investigated at dumpsite 1 the first topsoil layer second weathered laterite dry clay layer third weather layer and fourth fractured layer are highly conductive with resistivity values varying between 6 1 ωm and 67 ωm 66 ωm 455 ωm 2 6 ωm 8 5 ωm and 74 ωm 444 ωm respectively while the final infinite bedrock basement was found to be highly resistive these values when compared to the sample station and the previous works it suggests that the leachate plumes of the dumpsites may have impacted the subsoil and the groundwater resource however the aquifer unit observed in the controlled station has an average resistivity of 82 ωm with a mean thickness of 15 m while the resistivity values at the dumpsites were very low on an average of 17 ωm with a mean thickness of 14 m the last layers at the dumpsite are highly resistive with a mean resistivity value of 7550 ωm and it is believed to be fresh basement rock previous studies show that a highly resistive bedrock 2000 ωm is unfractured fresh basement rock omeiza and dogara 2018 alao et al 2022a this implies that the fresh basement rock has not been affected by the leachate plumes of the dumpsites fig 8 reveals the subsoil profile depth section of the investigated eight 8 ves points at dumpsite 2 three 3 out of the eight 8 ves points investigated at dumpsite 2 were extended beyond the dumpsite coverage to 30 m away this was done to examine the variation in subsoil resistivity values as the investigation extends from the dumpsite to adequately evaluate the dumpsite impact on the ground resources the off dumpsite ves points b6 b7 b8 were characterized with higher resistivity values than the ves point within the dumpsite b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 as the survey extends from the dumpsite the resistivity value increases which implies that the soil and groundwater resources of the areas near dumpsites between 0 and 50 m may have a greater possibility of contamination the first topsoil layer resistivity values vary between 4 2 ωm and 218 ωm while the weathered layer and fractured basement which constitute the aquifer unity of the terrain were found to vary between 3 7 ωm and 105 ωm and 357 ωm 911 ωm the increment noted in subsoil conductivity towards dumpsite 2 indicates that the dumpsite leachate has impacted the subsoil and groundwater resources the infinite layer encountered at the dumpsite with a mean resistivity value of 7555 ωm suggests fresh basement rock has not been affected by the leachate plumes of the dumpsite fig 9 represents the subsoil depth section of dumpsite 3 with five 5 ves points dumpsite 3 followed the same trend as dumpsites 1 2 with the top lay resistivity varying between 6 9 ωm and 14 ωm the weathered layer and the fractured basement which constitute the water bearing unit of the region were found with resistivity values varying between 3 7 ωm and 105 ωm and 6 9 ωm 14 ωm respectively while the last layer resistivity varies between 103 ωm and 24 376 ωm the fractured basement was not encountered at dumpsite 3 6 3 the impact of dumpsite leachate on subsoil and groundwater the subsoil resistivity values displayed in the geo electric depth section in figs 7 9 play a critical and central role in evaluating the impacts of the dumpsite leachate on the subsoil and groundwater quality soil electrical resistivity is an important indicator that determines indirectly the soil s chemical and physical properties including salinity moisture porosity soil texture bulk density and organic matter level bashir et al 2014 alao et al 2022b the weakling of the hard driven subsoil is a consequence of the heavy metals hms presence in the dumpsite leachate and a series of chemical reactions of the garbage at the dumpsites the low resistivity paved way for the leachate to seep down the subsoil to pollute the groundwater the low resistivity values noted at points b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 within dumpsite 3 and the gradual increase in the last 3 ves points b6 b7 b8 is an indication horizontal impact of dumpsite leachate may have migrated beyond 50 m in nigeria where there is heavy rainfall and powerful erosion the leachate plumes movement will be enhanced this implies that the leaching of dumpsite leachate plumes may be faster in a soft subsoil onyekwelu and aghamelu 2019 ohanu et al 2020 many parts of nigerian cities are dominated by open dumpsites without lining and monitoring systems to receive the dumpsite leachate ogungbe et al 2012 charles et al 2013 this implies that the chemical characteristics of leachate can be influenced by several factors such as the nature of the msw climate nature soil water content moisture content of subsurface soil and ambient temperature the physiochemical water analysis from the 4 hdws indicates a critical situation in groundwater systems within the radius of 60 m of the dumpsites groundwater pollution is generally irreversible once it is contaminated and it is difficult to restore the original quality of the groundwater aljaradin and persson 2015 ibrahim et al 2019 nocella et al 2022 pamudji et al 2022 because the water held in the surface soils by capillary action can infiltrate through the solid waste and the leachate migrated towards the water table beneath the dumpsite has contaminated the soil and the aquifer system in the region abdullahad et al 2020 bodrud dozaa et al 2020 chandrajitha et al 2020 aneesh et al 2022 previous studies identified two major aquifer types silty clay weathered unit and fractured unit abdullahi et al 2010 omeiza and dogara 2018 alao et al 2022a the area aquifer is highly vulnerable to surface contaminants due to the low resistivity values of the aquifers of the dumpsites the overburdened soil layer thickness overlying the water bearing unit of the entire study area indicates a poor aquifer protective capacity index the impermeable clays overlying the sample station have also been weakening and enhancing leachate movement within the subsoil in addition during the investigation an attempt was made to drill the soil to a depth of 1 0 m within the dumpsites and the sample station the soil was found softer with moisture like soil nature while the sample station was dry and hard the soft nature of the dumpsite subsoil confirmed leachate infiltration 6 4 geo electric comparison between the dumpsites and controlled station table 2 shows a comparative assessment between the active open dumpsite and sample stations from the estimation of percentage defect between the dumpsite and sample station the percentage defect expresses the drop out percentage or the degree of leached in percentage this was estimated using equation 5 to evaluate the environmental impact of dumpsites on subsoil and groundwater quality based on the geo electrical resistivity investigation at the sample station and dumpsites across the subsoil strata it was noted that there is a wide range defects of between the resistivity values obtained from the dumpsite and sample station table 2 this wide variation defect in the subsoil resistivity values of the dumpsites and sample stations confirms the impacts of leachate plume contamination on the ground resources with very little or no effect on the fresh basement rock a critical situation may occur at dumpsite 1 because it is located in a very shallow valley water lodge area when the water lodge is mixed with the dumpsite leachate the mixture is discharged down the soil because it cannot flow out of the dumpsite vicinity dumpsites 2 3 are located on plain ground and it drains easily either by infiltration or runoff to obtain clean and portable drinking water fresh and uncontaminated water around the dumpsites it is advisable to drill beyond 22 m 6 5 physicochemical analysis around the dumpsites table 3 shows the result of the physiochemical water analysis obtained from four hdws within the radius of 61 m of the dumpsite the chemical analysis was done at the water resources department ahmadu bello university and national research institute for chemical technology in zaria the eight 8 parameters were measured bod cod pb cd σ ph cr and tds the results indicate high concentrations of the physiochemical element fall out of the permissible limits of world standards who 2017 which suggests that the groundwater is contaminated however hdw 4 of 5 5 m depth which is about 61 m away from the dumpsite show moderate tds values the high content of bod and cod presence in the hdws water may be attributed to the breaking down of the biodegradable mass over time while the decomposition of the organic components of the solid wastes at the dumpsite by the action of microorganisms may also increase the level of organic matter especially during the wet season this high content of bod 459 561 mg l and cod 902 1017 mg l indicates high organic strength in the open dumpsite leachate high contents of detrimental substances such as chromium and lead pb were noted across the four hdws which demands urgent attention however observation from table 3 indicates a moderate ph value the high presence of hms influenced the high conductivity of the sample water which matches the geo electrical resistivity values the validation is highly expected the hdws within the ambient of the dumpsite within the radius of 61 m are of shallow depth varying from 4 5 m 8 0 m and have been heavily impacted that is to obtain portable drinking water boreholes should be sited beyond the depth of 22 m or 32 m into the second aquifer system the shallow nature of the 4 hdws around the dumpsites and the high presence of hms in the hdw water sample indicate a critical situation in drinking water within the region the hms indicate a threat to human health and the people living within a radius of 100 m of the dumpsites are on the high health risk index 7 conclusion and recommendation dc electrical resistivity was used to delineate the degree of leachate plume contamination within three mining dumpsites and ambient environments using the schlumberger configuration which provides robust vertical information on the subsurface geo electric subsoil profiles were designed to display subsoil resistivity values which were used to evaluate the degree of leachate plume contaminants seeping the soil down to the water table a total of twenty 27 ves points were investigated across the three dumpsites and a sample station with a maximum spread ab 2 of 50 m to serve as a controlled station this was done to enhance the comparative analysis of the sample station and dumpsites which in turn was used to assess the degree of impact of active open dumpsites on the subsoil and the groundwater resources four 4 ves points at the sample station ten 10 at dumpsite 1 eight 8 at dumpsite 2 and five 5 from dumpsite 3 were investigated the chosen sample station is about 0 2 km away from the dumpsite based on the geophysical investigation from the three dumpsites and sample stations the results of the soil resistivity delineated indicate a very low resistivity across all the layers of the investigated three dumpsites as compared to the subsurface resistivity of the sample stations these results were used to characterize the dumpsite subsurface parameters including the leachate plume contaminants and disposal trends at the dumpsite the wide variation between the dumpsite s subsurface resistivity values and the sample stations indicates high leachate ground infiltration the ecological and environmental impacts coupled with the health risks which invariably result from inadequate treatment of landfill leachate indicates high health risk therefore the soil and groundwater within and surroundings of the dumpsites must have migrated into the surrounding aquifer system thereby contaminating it it was observed that after many operational years of dumpsites the leachate plumes have seeped leached down the soil profile to at least an average depth of 15 m this implies a high impact rate of the dumpsite leachates the study also examine the horizontal impact at dumpsite 3 by extending ves points b6 b7 b8 about 30 m away from the dumpsite and it was discovered that as the investigation extended away from the dumpsite the subsoil resistivity increased significantly this implies that the dumpsite has not only impacted the ground resources vertically beyond 15 m depth but has also impacted the ground horizontally beyond 30 m away from its domain unfortunately the dug wells around the three dumpsites fall within a depth of 4 5 m 8 m which implies that all the dug wells close to the dumpsite between 0 m 50 must have been critically impacted and the groundwater resources should be declared unfit for consumption this horizontal expansion of the dumpsite leachate plumes may not be unconnected to the ability of groundwater to move horizontally under the ground however the physiochemical analysis of water obtained from four hdws within the radius of 61 m was examined and the results show that the dumpsite leachates have impacted the subsoil and groundwater resource off the dumpsite beyond 61 m the result also validates the geo electrical investigation and physical drill of 1 0 m depth within the dumpsite and sample station soil in conclusion about 90 of waste generated is offloaded into an open dumping ground thus dumpsites are most likely to remain a noticeable groundwater contamination source even in the foreseeable future based on the available data and the findings of this research the study therefore recommended the following active open and uncontrolled dumpsites should be avoided especially in developing nations uncontrolled and open dumpsites should be prohibited in the residential area a well constructed concreted and piped standard sanitary landfills should be encouraged existing open and uncontrolled dumpsites should be evacuated especially those in the cities waste management agencies should be constituted for proper and regular landfill treatment a sustainable drainage system should be encouraged within and around dumpsites to avoid flooding and water pollution there should be serious legislation against uncontrolled open dumpsites especially in the residential area by the government as much as possible funding information the author did not received financial assistance from any organizations or individuals declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11720,groundwater remains a vital natural resource and its security should be the top priority for everyone continuous indiscriminate waste dumping and unruly human behaviour towards environmental management and strategies require a holistic approach to guarantee environmental security this study assesses the impacts of dumpsite leachate on soil and groundwater quality using geophysical and physicochemical water analysis approaches data were collected at dumpsites and a sample station using geo electrical resistivity the impact of the dumpsite s leachate plumes on the soil and groundwater quality was investigated the resistivity values distributed within the dumpsites and the sample station indicate that the dumpsite leachate plumes have impacted the ground both vertically and horizontally the physicochemical water analysis was carried out on four hand dug wells within the radius of 61 m of the open dumpsites the results indicate the presence of heavy metals physical drilling depicts soft subsoil while the geophysical result is characterized by low resistivity values which show a good match the soft soil heavy metal presence and low resistivity values suggest that the soil and the aquifer systems within and around dumpsites have been compromised by the leachate plums which had seeped the ground down to the water table high ion concentrations associated with leachate plumes have critically influenced the conductivity of subsoil and the groundwater within and around dumpsites however unpolluted fresh water can be achieved below 23 m depth the combined geophysical investigation and physiochemical water analysis can give an account of dumpsite leachates activities on ground resources graphical abstract image 1 keywords dumpsite controlled station impact groundwater subsoil resistivity leachate plumes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater remains a vital natural resource that requires continuous and concerted efforts to protect it continuous indiscriminate waste dumping and unruly human behaviour towards environmental management and strategies require a holistic approach to environmental security studies show that open dumpsites remain the most popular source of water and environmental pollution divya et al 2020 laskar et al 2022 open dumpsites are the most common practice all over the world for municipal solid waste msw disposal and their environmental impacts have received much attention in the last decades el salam abu zuid 2015 mishra et al 2019 especially in developing countries where most solid wastes are carelessly disposed environmental impacts and public health risks of open dumpsites include subsoil contamination groundwater pollution generation of volatile organic compounds vocs and creation of greenhouse gas emissions remain issues of great concern charles et al 2013 samantar et al 2017 vaccari et al 2018 unlike developed countries most african countries rely on open dumpsites without a standardized sanitary landfill omeiza et al 2022 according to the international solid waste association iswa and the united nations environment programme unep the msw generation in developed countries is fast beginning to stable however unep expresses fear over the upsurge in waste generation in developing nations while economic activities continue to crawl across the world collivignarelli et al 2011 vaccari et al 2019 developing nations are the most affected by this necessary devil dumpsite fig 1 nigeria has been reported as taking the lead position among the 50 world s biggest active dumpsites from 30 countries because nigeria alone maintains 12 of the 50 world s biggest active dumpsites unep 2015 with the adverse effects of dumpsites on human health and the environment urgent attention is required to prevent the prevailing indiscriminate wastes disposal in developing nations because the situation has reached a critical point vaccari et al 2018 parvin and tareq 2021 recent studies show that the challenge of environmental pollution and waste management is one of the major concerns of researchers and geoscientists across the globe okpoli 2013 vaverková 2019 mahmoud et al 2022 however the environmental impacts of dumpsites are not limited to the groundwater resources it also affects ground soil as well as human health shen et al 2019 with the current increase of open dumpsites all over the world especially in africa the qualities of underground resources such as soil and water are under major threat ekeocha et al 2012 this is because all dumpsites large or small are usually associated with leachate plumes and odorous gas polluting the environment and water resources aljaradin and persson 2015 reports indicate that the degree of leachate impacts and emission gases of a landfill depends on the nature of landfills eggen et al 2010 arndt 2014 mojiri et al 2021 however pollution problems are particularly severe for waste dumped in abandoned gravel pits and sediment regions which may extend down to the groundwater table okpoli 2013 the solution to these challenges in our modern urban society demands fast and effective special geophysical techniques due to high ion concentrations associated with landfill leachates which in turn weaken the subsoil resistivity studies revealed that the leachates formed within the dumpsite rarely remained at the point of discharge abdullahi et al 2010 omeiza et al 2022 they are transported through the porous media within the subsurface this is because water pollution happens mostly through the percolation of fluvial water and the infiltration of contaminants via the soil in waste disposal sites alao et al 2022a therefore ground resistivity is related to various geological parameters such as the mineral and fluid content porosity and degree of water saturation in the rock alao et al 2022b consequently a vertical electrical resistivity technique was chosen as a suitable technique for delineating the resistivity distribution within and around the dumpsites to evaluate the extent of dumpsite leachate plumes because the geo electrical resistivity investigation provides excellent subsurface information with non destructive means of investigation for identifying the leachate plumes of landfills however the major environmental concern of this research is the impact of open dumpsite leachate on the subsoil and groundwater quality 2 site overview the investigated dumpsites are located within the kaduna metropolis all the dumpsites are mining open dumpsites without a standardized sanitary landfill as obtainable in most parts of the world dumpsite 1 is a mining open dumpsite located at goni gora kaduna on the geographical coordinate of latitude of 10 24 22 32 n and longitude of 7 20 20 76 e in the northern part of nigeria fig 2 the dumpsite according to the community leader has been in existence for the past 21 years the dumpsite covers a total landmass of 12 000 m square on an average height of 626 m kakuri ne sheet 144 1 50 000 above the level by estimation the volume of the dumpsite is about 36 400 m 3 that is it contains about 36 400 m 3 of msw it consists of heterogeneous refuse with a maximum difference in elevation between the top of the solid waste and the surrounding area of 5 m with an average height of 3 9 m fig 3 the dumpsite is surrounded by many residential areas with over 12 000 people living within a 2 km radius of the landfill dumpsite 2 is a mining open dumpsite located at anguwan dosa in kaduna city on the geographical coordinate of latitude of 10 2 22 32 n and longitude of 7 20 20 76 e in the northern part of nigeria fig 3 the dumpsite has been in operation for the past 38 years it covers a total landmass of 10 500 m square by estimation the volume of the dumpsite is about 47 250 m 3 with all kinds of garbage of a maximum height of on 5 9 between the top of the solid waste and the surrounding area dumpsite 3 is a mining open dumpsite located at anguwan dosa within kaduna city on the geographical coordinate of latitude of 10 24 18 02 n and longitude of 7 35 23 06 e the dumpsite has been in existence for the past 27 years it covers a total landmass of 12 000 m square with a maximum gradient of 5 m between the solid waste and the surrounding area and an average height of 3 2 m fig 3 by estimation the volume of the dumpsite is about 36 400 m 3 however the dumpsites accept all kinds of waste such as domestic sewage or wastes animal and human excretion medical wastes municipal wastes industrial wastes agricultural wastes and other hazardous wastes though more than two thirds of the investigated dumpsites contain biodegradable waste materials that can get rot decompose and release harmful gases into the environment there is no subsurface drainage system to collect the leachate around the investigated dumpsites therefore the dumpsite leachates may go directly seep the ground down to the water table it was also noted that there was no noticeable river or stream around the dumpsites which implies that the drainage system of the terrane is very poor as the terrain can only be drained by both surface water surface runoff and groundwater infiltration this could further ease the seeping of dumpsite leachates through the subsoil the storage capacity of the dumpsites is not limited to the given volume since they are uncontrollable open dumpsites and their increments depend on the rate of waste dumping 2 1 climatic conditions understanding the impacts of climate change on open dumpsites is a critical component of environmental management strategies predictions on climate impacts on open dumpsites are a difficult task that requires a technical and scientific approach sam and dettinger 2011 there may be little significant difference in the characteristics of the dumpsite leachate across the world due to inhomogeneous changes in climate from one country to another therefore the solid waste characteristics may depend on the nature of the nations concerned omeiza et al 2022 for instance african nations are generally hot particularly northern nigeria sitting near the equator studies revealed that the climatic variation and geological components such as soil nature soil electrical conductivity and temperature can trigger the rate at which solid wastes break down and seeping the ground arndt 2014 tejera et al 2019 bian 2020 tahiria et al 2022 a tropical country like nigeria where the yearly precipitation varies between 1000 and 1500 mm and the temperatures vary between 24 c and 38 c abdullahi et al 2010 omeiza and dary 2018 may reflect the impacts of dynamic open dumpsite leachates that is regional climatic conditions can control and influence the nature of leachate plumes from a dynamic dumpsite therefore it is expected that the decomposition rate and pollution rate should be high across tropical countries 2 2 regional geology the general geology of nigeria consists of two main lithological units which include the precambrian crystalline basement complex and cretaceous tertiary sedimentary rocks oyawoye 1970 the regional geology of kaduna is complex basement rock distribution however these lucid basement rocks have been subjected to various hardships and deformation of varying intensities over time resulting in the folding and fracturing of the rocks abdullahi et al 2010 the distinctive feature of this formation is its undulations in addition to fracturing and jointing of beds the district rocks are occasionally capped by combined laterites sandstones quartzites and silty soil exceptionally at the surface the laterites in the domain have existed and endured into lateritic nodules as opposed to ammophilous clays and silty soil over the period aboh et al 2016 studies have shown that the bioclimatic nature of the kaduna environment has been greatly affected by deep chemical weathering and fluvial erosion which has metamorphous into the high undulating plains consequently the aquifer unit of the regions consists of weathered fractured or clayey sand sand oyawoye 1970 ameyan and alabi 1987 olayinka 1992 there are no terrestrial geological formations outcropping at the dumpsite and its surroundings the topsoil is highly variable in composition texture and colour predominantly laterite and quartz grains deep brown or reddish brown soil in most places isaac et al 2010 2 3 hydrogeology the regional hydrogeology of any terrain is usually influenced and controlled by climatic factors and drainage systems leachate influx can be influenced by the drainage system of a terrain aljaradin and persson 2015 however there are no noticeable streams around the dumpsite other surface waters are directly drained by evaporation infiltration and run off the degree of surface water movement can enhance the extent of vertical leachate however there may be a slight change in the rate of leachate contaminants in some other studies across the world because the waste characteristics and the contaminant process usually depend on the nature of the countries concerned tejera et al 2019 vaccari et al 2019 roychoudhury and chakraborty 2021 for example in some parts of nigeria where the annual rainfall ranges from 1000 to 1500 mm omeiza and dogara 2018 may reflect the rate at which dumpsite leachates infiltrate the soil to contaminate groundwater most tropical regions like nigeria suffers severe rainstorm and heavy erosion which could increase the possibility of surface and groundwater contamination 3 active dumpsites in developing nations the management of msw has always been a serious challenge and threat to the people living in the cities especially in developing countries like nigeria due to the financial burden of waste management lack of technical capacity and the increasing stream of waste generated driven by industrialization urbanization and population growth park et al 2010 yusuf and abiye 2019 rowland and omonefe 2021 landfilling is the cheapest and simplest means of msw disposal msw ogungbe et al 2012 the indiscriminate disposal of liquid and solid wastes is not uncommon in many parts of the world and the impacts on ambient soil and groundwater resources especially in tropical regions and low income earned countries cannot be overemphasized the common ways of solid waste management in the world involve open dumping disposal into seas and sanitary landfills vaverková 2019 gupta et al 2020 unfortunately open dumping and disposal into seas are the most popular methods among low income earned nations because it is cheap and simple another popular msw management in the metropolis of developing countries commonly involves waste collection transportation and emptying into an open dumpsite or dumping it into the sea which is commonly done haphazardly rowland and omonefe 2021 and consequently puts human health on high risk these methods are highly discouraged and not quite satisfactory due to the high risk to public health arising from the breeding of mosquitoes flies obnoxious odours untidy environment and fire hazards involved aljaradin and persson 2015 despite its potentially hazardous impacts on the environment several nations continue to employ the service of open dumpsites for waste management ahmed et al 2019 bian 2020 this method of waste disposal dominates the entire land of nigeria due to its low cost of operation while sanitary landfills for waste management are not prominent in nigeria due to the high cost of construction and operation however leachate ordinarily forms when water seeps the solid waste into a dynamic open dumpsite which in turn is transported in form of pollutants mojiri et al 2021 dumpsite leachates are liquid that leaches from dumpsites and it normally contains some dissolved and suspended materials leachates are usually considered one of the common liquid that infiltrates subsoil down the water table to pollute it al tarazi et al 2008 mojiri et al 2017 vaccari et al 2019 when some solid wastes are dumped into a dynamic dumpsite for many years it naturally decomposes and sweats municipal dumpsite leachate contains contaminants which are classified into four 4 main groups this include heavy metals organic contaminants and substrates inorganic compounds dissolved solids and colour on the other hand dumpsite leachate s age can be classified into three 3 major groups the old the intermediate and the young the acid phase as shown in table 1 the leachates are usually dominated by low ph levels high volatile acids and highly degraded organic matter mojiri et al 2021 4 materials and methods the data collection was done with the help of the earth resistivity and its components field hammer electrodes magnetic compass measuring tape cutlass cables and reels thermometers and global positioning system gps was also used in the acquisition of the field data some bottled plastic rubbers were used to collect water samples from four hand dug wells hdw for physiochemical water analysis 4 1 physio chemical data physiochemical data was collected from four 4 different hand dug well hdw within a radius of 61 m from dumpsite 1 the first and second hdws are located 27 m 32 m away from dumpsite 1 while the third and fourth hdws are located about 47 m and 61 m the sample of water collected was kept in clean bottled plastic rubbers for analysis the parameters measured include biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand bod total dissolved solids tds cadmium c d 2 lead p b 2 the electrical conductivity σ the potential of hydrogen ph chromium cr in the month of april 2022 during the investigation an attempt was made to drill the soil to a depth of 1 0 m within the dumpsites and the sample station for a critical analysis 4 2 geophysical technique ohmega ω resistivity meter was used to collect geo electrical electrical resistivity data using schlumberger configuration a total of twenty seven 27 vertical electrical sounding ves points were established at different locations within the three dumpsites with a maximum spread ab 2 of 50 m fig 4 is an electrical resistivity schlumberger configuration using four electrodes while acquiring the field data schlumberger array works on the principle of ohm s law dogara et al 2017 alao et al 2019 that is 1 v i r the soil s resistive response to the flow of current through the ground can be expressed as 2 ρ a r k where r is resistivity ρ a represents apparent resistivity and k is a geometrical factor k factor evaluated from the arrangement of the four electrodes shown in fig 4 that is the k factor depends on the arrangement of the four electrodes telford et al 1990 and is expressed as 3 k 2 π 1 a c 1 c b 1 a d 1 b d 1 where ac ad bc and bd are the distances in metres between the respective electrodes from fig 4 central symmetric array a c b d a n d b c a d thus equation 3 can be simplified and reduced to equation 4 4 k π a c a d c d 5 data acquisition and processing an omega resistivity terrameter and its accessories were used to obtain all the electrical resistivity field data a total of twenty 27 ves points were investigated four 4 ves points at the sample station ten 10 ves points from dumpsite 1 eight 8 ves points at dumpsite 2 and five 5 ves points from dumpsite 3 were investigated the chosen sample station which is about 200 m away from dumpsite 1 is to serve as a controlled station for this work the subsurface resistivity data acquired were fed into computer software res id version 1 for interpretation fig 5 shows one of the resulting curves for ves station b3 along profile b however the resistivity measurement is based on the inhomogeneity of the subsurface resistivity values measured and calculated ground apparent resistivity of the model blocks with the fit accuracy which was expressed in terms of a root mean square rms error ekeocha et al 2012 5 1 evaluation of the dumpsite leachate leach the dumpsite leachate leach was estimated using percentage error or defect the subsurface layered resistivity obtained from the controlled station was considered to be an ideal true value while the subsurface layered resistivity obtained from the dumpsites was taken as the observed value thereafter the defect value which depends on the magnitude of the difference between the real and the observed values were calculated for each ves station so the drop out percentage degree of leached in percentage can be expressed by equation 5 5 d e f e c t v t v o v t 100 where v t resistivity value at the controlled station and v 0 resistivity value at the dumpsite 6 results and discussion after quantitative and qualitative analysis the model parameters were further processed to generate a geo electric profile of the terrain figs 6 9 this section describes the subsoil electrical conductive properties the geo electrical information and the subsoil profile of the layered rock sequence characterized by the values of layer resistivity loke 2000 okpoli 2013 dogara et al 2017 6 1 geoelectric depth section for the controlled station fig 6 indicates the geoelectric geologic profile of the controlled sample station the sample station is about 0 2 km 29 km and 28 km away from dumpsites 1 2 and 3 respectively the site was chosen to compare its results to that of the dumpsite and consequently was used to assess the degree of impact of the dumpsite leachates on the subsoil and the groundwater resources from the four 4 ves stations investigated the results indicate highly variable topsoil with mean resistivity and thickness values of 857 ωm and 1 8 m respectively the succeeding layer is consolidated by laterite sand with resistivity values varying between 2510 ωm and 5102 ωm the third layer constitutes the water bearing aquifer unit with resistivity and thickness ranging from 69 ωm to 103 ωm and 10 m 16 m respectively however alao et al 2022a an overburden thickness less than 12 m 12 m may likely contain excessive groundwater potential and be protective from near surface pollution the indurate resistive compacted lateritic topsoil and the impermeable clay layers overlying the aquifer unit may increase the protective capacity index of the groundwater the last layer is extremely resistive with resistivity values ranging from 4510 ωm to 10 510 ωm which may suggest a fresh basement the sample station resistivity values in comparison with previous work within the crystalline basement terrain of northern nigeria by isaac et al 2010 abdullahi et al 2010 olawuyi and abolarin 2013 bashir et al 2014 aboh et al 2016 kure et al 2017 dogara et al 2017 show that there is no action or impact of leachate plumes contamination on the basement rocks 6 2 geoelectric depth section of the dumpsites figs 7 9 show all the depth profiles taken in the dumpsite1 2 3 respectively the landfill impacts on the groundwater were evaluated from the resistivity depth profile of the three dumpsites fig 7 shows the subsoil profile of the 10 ves points investigated at dumpsite 1 the first topsoil layer second weathered laterite dry clay layer third weather layer and fourth fractured layer are highly conductive with resistivity values varying between 6 1 ωm and 67 ωm 66 ωm 455 ωm 2 6 ωm 8 5 ωm and 74 ωm 444 ωm respectively while the final infinite bedrock basement was found to be highly resistive these values when compared to the sample station and the previous works it suggests that the leachate plumes of the dumpsites may have impacted the subsoil and the groundwater resource however the aquifer unit observed in the controlled station has an average resistivity of 82 ωm with a mean thickness of 15 m while the resistivity values at the dumpsites were very low on an average of 17 ωm with a mean thickness of 14 m the last layers at the dumpsite are highly resistive with a mean resistivity value of 7550 ωm and it is believed to be fresh basement rock previous studies show that a highly resistive bedrock 2000 ωm is unfractured fresh basement rock omeiza and dogara 2018 alao et al 2022a this implies that the fresh basement rock has not been affected by the leachate plumes of the dumpsites fig 8 reveals the subsoil profile depth section of the investigated eight 8 ves points at dumpsite 2 three 3 out of the eight 8 ves points investigated at dumpsite 2 were extended beyond the dumpsite coverage to 30 m away this was done to examine the variation in subsoil resistivity values as the investigation extends from the dumpsite to adequately evaluate the dumpsite impact on the ground resources the off dumpsite ves points b6 b7 b8 were characterized with higher resistivity values than the ves point within the dumpsite b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 as the survey extends from the dumpsite the resistivity value increases which implies that the soil and groundwater resources of the areas near dumpsites between 0 and 50 m may have a greater possibility of contamination the first topsoil layer resistivity values vary between 4 2 ωm and 218 ωm while the weathered layer and fractured basement which constitute the aquifer unity of the terrain were found to vary between 3 7 ωm and 105 ωm and 357 ωm 911 ωm the increment noted in subsoil conductivity towards dumpsite 2 indicates that the dumpsite leachate has impacted the subsoil and groundwater resources the infinite layer encountered at the dumpsite with a mean resistivity value of 7555 ωm suggests fresh basement rock has not been affected by the leachate plumes of the dumpsite fig 9 represents the subsoil depth section of dumpsite 3 with five 5 ves points dumpsite 3 followed the same trend as dumpsites 1 2 with the top lay resistivity varying between 6 9 ωm and 14 ωm the weathered layer and the fractured basement which constitute the water bearing unit of the region were found with resistivity values varying between 3 7 ωm and 105 ωm and 6 9 ωm 14 ωm respectively while the last layer resistivity varies between 103 ωm and 24 376 ωm the fractured basement was not encountered at dumpsite 3 6 3 the impact of dumpsite leachate on subsoil and groundwater the subsoil resistivity values displayed in the geo electric depth section in figs 7 9 play a critical and central role in evaluating the impacts of the dumpsite leachate on the subsoil and groundwater quality soil electrical resistivity is an important indicator that determines indirectly the soil s chemical and physical properties including salinity moisture porosity soil texture bulk density and organic matter level bashir et al 2014 alao et al 2022b the weakling of the hard driven subsoil is a consequence of the heavy metals hms presence in the dumpsite leachate and a series of chemical reactions of the garbage at the dumpsites the low resistivity paved way for the leachate to seep down the subsoil to pollute the groundwater the low resistivity values noted at points b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 within dumpsite 3 and the gradual increase in the last 3 ves points b6 b7 b8 is an indication horizontal impact of dumpsite leachate may have migrated beyond 50 m in nigeria where there is heavy rainfall and powerful erosion the leachate plumes movement will be enhanced this implies that the leaching of dumpsite leachate plumes may be faster in a soft subsoil onyekwelu and aghamelu 2019 ohanu et al 2020 many parts of nigerian cities are dominated by open dumpsites without lining and monitoring systems to receive the dumpsite leachate ogungbe et al 2012 charles et al 2013 this implies that the chemical characteristics of leachate can be influenced by several factors such as the nature of the msw climate nature soil water content moisture content of subsurface soil and ambient temperature the physiochemical water analysis from the 4 hdws indicates a critical situation in groundwater systems within the radius of 60 m of the dumpsites groundwater pollution is generally irreversible once it is contaminated and it is difficult to restore the original quality of the groundwater aljaradin and persson 2015 ibrahim et al 2019 nocella et al 2022 pamudji et al 2022 because the water held in the surface soils by capillary action can infiltrate through the solid waste and the leachate migrated towards the water table beneath the dumpsite has contaminated the soil and the aquifer system in the region abdullahad et al 2020 bodrud dozaa et al 2020 chandrajitha et al 2020 aneesh et al 2022 previous studies identified two major aquifer types silty clay weathered unit and fractured unit abdullahi et al 2010 omeiza and dogara 2018 alao et al 2022a the area aquifer is highly vulnerable to surface contaminants due to the low resistivity values of the aquifers of the dumpsites the overburdened soil layer thickness overlying the water bearing unit of the entire study area indicates a poor aquifer protective capacity index the impermeable clays overlying the sample station have also been weakening and enhancing leachate movement within the subsoil in addition during the investigation an attempt was made to drill the soil to a depth of 1 0 m within the dumpsites and the sample station the soil was found softer with moisture like soil nature while the sample station was dry and hard the soft nature of the dumpsite subsoil confirmed leachate infiltration 6 4 geo electric comparison between the dumpsites and controlled station table 2 shows a comparative assessment between the active open dumpsite and sample stations from the estimation of percentage defect between the dumpsite and sample station the percentage defect expresses the drop out percentage or the degree of leached in percentage this was estimated using equation 5 to evaluate the environmental impact of dumpsites on subsoil and groundwater quality based on the geo electrical resistivity investigation at the sample station and dumpsites across the subsoil strata it was noted that there is a wide range defects of between the resistivity values obtained from the dumpsite and sample station table 2 this wide variation defect in the subsoil resistivity values of the dumpsites and sample stations confirms the impacts of leachate plume contamination on the ground resources with very little or no effect on the fresh basement rock a critical situation may occur at dumpsite 1 because it is located in a very shallow valley water lodge area when the water lodge is mixed with the dumpsite leachate the mixture is discharged down the soil because it cannot flow out of the dumpsite vicinity dumpsites 2 3 are located on plain ground and it drains easily either by infiltration or runoff to obtain clean and portable drinking water fresh and uncontaminated water around the dumpsites it is advisable to drill beyond 22 m 6 5 physicochemical analysis around the dumpsites table 3 shows the result of the physiochemical water analysis obtained from four hdws within the radius of 61 m of the dumpsite the chemical analysis was done at the water resources department ahmadu bello university and national research institute for chemical technology in zaria the eight 8 parameters were measured bod cod pb cd σ ph cr and tds the results indicate high concentrations of the physiochemical element fall out of the permissible limits of world standards who 2017 which suggests that the groundwater is contaminated however hdw 4 of 5 5 m depth which is about 61 m away from the dumpsite show moderate tds values the high content of bod and cod presence in the hdws water may be attributed to the breaking down of the biodegradable mass over time while the decomposition of the organic components of the solid wastes at the dumpsite by the action of microorganisms may also increase the level of organic matter especially during the wet season this high content of bod 459 561 mg l and cod 902 1017 mg l indicates high organic strength in the open dumpsite leachate high contents of detrimental substances such as chromium and lead pb were noted across the four hdws which demands urgent attention however observation from table 3 indicates a moderate ph value the high presence of hms influenced the high conductivity of the sample water which matches the geo electrical resistivity values the validation is highly expected the hdws within the ambient of the dumpsite within the radius of 61 m are of shallow depth varying from 4 5 m 8 0 m and have been heavily impacted that is to obtain portable drinking water boreholes should be sited beyond the depth of 22 m or 32 m into the second aquifer system the shallow nature of the 4 hdws around the dumpsites and the high presence of hms in the hdw water sample indicate a critical situation in drinking water within the region the hms indicate a threat to human health and the people living within a radius of 100 m of the dumpsites are on the high health risk index 7 conclusion and recommendation dc electrical resistivity was used to delineate the degree of leachate plume contamination within three mining dumpsites and ambient environments using the schlumberger configuration which provides robust vertical information on the subsurface geo electric subsoil profiles were designed to display subsoil resistivity values which were used to evaluate the degree of leachate plume contaminants seeping the soil down to the water table a total of twenty 27 ves points were investigated across the three dumpsites and a sample station with a maximum spread ab 2 of 50 m to serve as a controlled station this was done to enhance the comparative analysis of the sample station and dumpsites which in turn was used to assess the degree of impact of active open dumpsites on the subsoil and the groundwater resources four 4 ves points at the sample station ten 10 at dumpsite 1 eight 8 at dumpsite 2 and five 5 from dumpsite 3 were investigated the chosen sample station is about 0 2 km away from the dumpsite based on the geophysical investigation from the three dumpsites and sample stations the results of the soil resistivity delineated indicate a very low resistivity across all the layers of the investigated three dumpsites as compared to the subsurface resistivity of the sample stations these results were used to characterize the dumpsite subsurface parameters including the leachate plume contaminants and disposal trends at the dumpsite the wide variation between the dumpsite s subsurface resistivity values and the sample stations indicates high leachate ground infiltration the ecological and environmental impacts coupled with the health risks which invariably result from inadequate treatment of landfill leachate indicates high health risk therefore the soil and groundwater within and surroundings of the dumpsites must have migrated into the surrounding aquifer system thereby contaminating it it was observed that after many operational years of dumpsites the leachate plumes have seeped leached down the soil profile to at least an average depth of 15 m this implies a high impact rate of the dumpsite leachates the study also examine the horizontal impact at dumpsite 3 by extending ves points b6 b7 b8 about 30 m away from the dumpsite and it was discovered that as the investigation extended away from the dumpsite the subsoil resistivity increased significantly this implies that the dumpsite has not only impacted the ground resources vertically beyond 15 m depth but has also impacted the ground horizontally beyond 30 m away from its domain unfortunately the dug wells around the three dumpsites fall within a depth of 4 5 m 8 m which implies that all the dug wells close to the dumpsite between 0 m 50 must have been critically impacted and the groundwater resources should be declared unfit for consumption this horizontal expansion of the dumpsite leachate plumes may not be unconnected to the ability of groundwater to move horizontally under the ground however the physiochemical analysis of water obtained from four hdws within the radius of 61 m was examined and the results show that the dumpsite leachates have impacted the subsoil and groundwater resource off the dumpsite beyond 61 m the result also validates the geo electrical investigation and physical drill of 1 0 m depth within the dumpsite and sample station soil in conclusion about 90 of waste generated is offloaded into an open dumping ground thus dumpsites are most likely to remain a noticeable groundwater contamination source even in the foreseeable future based on the available data and the findings of this research the study therefore recommended the following active open and uncontrolled dumpsites should be avoided especially in developing nations uncontrolled and open dumpsites should be prohibited in the residential area a well constructed concreted and piped standard sanitary landfills should be encouraged existing open and uncontrolled dumpsites should be evacuated especially those in the cities waste management agencies should be constituted for proper and regular landfill treatment a sustainable drainage system should be encouraged within and around dumpsites to avoid flooding and water pollution there should be serious legislation against uncontrolled open dumpsites especially in the residential area by the government as much as possible funding information the author did not received financial assistance from any organizations or individuals declaration of competing interest

and 3 7 c would occur in the future with the most increment in summer 2041 2060 under ssp585 additionally precipitation fluctuate from 0 43 to 1 17 mm month with a probable rise in fall and most decline in winter 2041 2060 under ssp585 as regards the groundwater modeling considering that narx and anns were not able to simulate the aquifer altogether the meta heuristic approaches demonstrated high proficiencies with r 0 995 r2 0 989 mean absolute error mae 0 249 m and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 982 for the test data wsvr illustrated the greatest efficacy which disclosed that the groundwater level would face the utmost reduction from 5 4 to 10 9 m in observation wells especially in spring 2041 2060 indeed this decline in groundwater level is exclusively induced by climate change emphasizing on proposing groundwater adaptation strategies to address the groundwater issues like land subsidence in iran moreover it is proposed that different modeling approaches be evaluated

despite being complementary in some issues numerical and non numerical models have their own strengths and weaknesses in solving a specific difficulty pandey et al 2016 being able to simulate the physical processes of an aquifer yadav et al 2020 groundwater numerical models are typically preferred to non numerical models in many instances accurate groundwater level forecasting may be of greater significance than recognizing the actual physical relationships in the system smith and eli 1995 tokar and johnson 1999 daliakopoulos et al 2005 especially in reference to the aquifers with

modeling rajaee et al 2019 anns can effectively simulate and predict time series in different aquifers provided that they are properly developed rajaee et al 2019 anns provide excellent tools for solving different complex patterns and nonlinear systems in a black box manner guzman et al 2017 kim 2020 groundwater level fluctuations are nonlinear in nature and depend on factors such as precipitation evapotranspiration soil characteristics and topography suryanarayana et al 2014 anns have the ability to simulate rapid short term and continuous long term effects of groundwater time series both explicitly and non explicitly considering the inputs and the network s architecture respectively principe et al 2000 anns have been used for groundwater level prediction in a single well nayak et al 2006 uddameri 2007 trichakis et al 2011 shamsuddin et al 2017 liu et al 2018 and a set of wells mohanty et al 2015 interested reader may consult rajaee et al 2019 and zeydalinejad 2022 to

temperature precipitation and evaporation in which gcms are utilized hori and ueda 2006 model evaluation is performed using the cmip simulation protocols of which the latest version is currently cmip6 eyring et al 2016 compared to the previous version i e cmip5 in which the projections were conducted for rcps based on socioeconomic scenarios cmip6 uses a matrix framework not only of rcps but also of ssps song et al 2021 the latter scenarios include mitigation adaptation and future efforts on climate change based on socio economic changes such as population economic development ecosystems

remarkable feat in the modeling of time series cadenas et al 2016 narx as a specific type of anns has not frequently been applied to groundwater level predictions fabio et al 2022 guzman et al 2017 wunsch et al 2018 it has been used to predict groundwater level at different time scales including daily guzman et al 2017 2018 jeong and park 2019 zhang et al 2019 di nunno and granata 2020 weekly

than anns svms are among the ml techniques being progressively used in hydrologic predicting they can be divided into two groups of svc and svr contending the problems of classification and regression respectively belayneh et al 2014 gao et al 2001 in comparison with fl and neural network approaches the svr technique has the advantages of a shorter training time lower data dependence and easier implementation band et al 2021 the performance of the groundwater level simulation using svr may be enhanced by combining it to the meta heuristic approaches alizadeh et al 2017b ebrahimi and rajaee 2017 including wsvr and aig svr meta heuristic algorithms are optimization techniques ascertaining the optimal solutions in complex problems despite not ensuring a global optimal solution these algorithms are viable options in reaching optimal or near optimal solutions haddad et al 2013 wsvr has been used to simulate groundwater level in several studies e g ping et al 2013 suryanarayana et al 2014 sujay raghavendra and deka 2015 ebrahimi and rajaee 2017 yu et al 2018 and band et al 2021 on the other hand rarely does aig svr have been used in groundwater literature bwo svr wsvr and aig svr were compared in the simulation of groundwater level under climate change in khorramabad plain iran considering the time period 2000 2020 as the training time span wsvr had the best performance dehghani et al 2022 in a comparison study anns ffbp ann aig ann bwo and ann cso were evaluated in the groundwater modeling of selseleh plain in 2008 2018 as it was concluded not only ann aig showed the greatest efficiency but also all the hybrid models declined the modeling error compared to the standalone anns dehghani and torabi poudeh 2021 furthermore dehghani et al 2021 employed aig svr cso svr ssd svr and bwo svr to simulate the dissolved oxygen in the cumberland river the united states during the time period 2008 2018 the hybrid models performed better than the standalone svr and aig svr was the best model for the prediction of dissolved oxygen in river as it was proclaimed rarely do cmip6 simulation protocols have been evaluated for small scale regions and applied to groundwater impact studies e g ghazi et al 2022 in addition aig svr and as previously mentioned narx have been considered in little research in relation to groundwater in truth by searching aig svr groundwater in the google scholar academic search engine only three results are currently demonstrated furthermore most groundwater related climate change impact studies encompass the uncertainties of anthropogenic influences and pumping wells however such uncertainties do not occur in regard to the pali aquifer southwest iran not dissimilar to zeydalinejad et al 2020a b c and nassery et al 2021b this research spatially temporally underscores the influence of climate change on the pali aquifer indeed the objective of the current investigation is to determine the monthly and seasonal fluctuations in groundwater level of the aquifer under potential climate change considering the cmip6 simulations ergo the efficacy of the cmip6 protocols can be assessed for a small scale locality despite the fact that not sufficient climate data exist for the aquifer it is attempted to evaluate a predownscaled climate data set in the current research to overcome this difficulty in addition non numerical approaches are utilized in reference to groundwater modeling such that the application of anns narx aig svr and wsvr are appraised to the best knowledge of the authors the performance of these models have not previously been compared in the simulation of a specific groundwater system another purpose is to comprehend whether the state of the art ai approaches can predict the groundwater level in an observation well using the climatic variables of temperature and precipitation 2 material and methods 2 1 the study area located in the lali region the southwest of the zagros ranges iran the pali alluvial aquifer is a small scale groundwater system mainly composed of recent alluvial sediments and loose debris conglomerate fig 1 the latter just covers a small portion of the model domain the aquifer is primarily surrounded by the bakhtiari conglomerates as high elevation topographies the taraz harkesh stream passes through the aquifer and is the main drain of the groundwater system fig 1 there are eight observation wells w1 to w8 with appropriate scattering in the pali aquifer fig 1 the greral groundwater flow direction is from the east and northwest to the southwest of the aquifer which significantly correlates with the topographical elevation fig 1 the interested reader may refer to nassery et al 2021b in order to obtain more detailed data and information in reference to the pali alluvial aquifer not excluding the hydrogeological characteristics the average groundwater level and the lithological log of the observation wells 2 2 methods in brief the employed procedure takes account of the following steps fig 2 1 the observation data including minimum temperature maximum temperature precipitation and groundwater level were collected for the hydrological years 2007 2018 monthly time steps were considered for all the data 2 minimum temperature maximum temperature and precipitation were derived from the worldclim downscaled data set for the region in the base 1970 2000 and future 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 time periods under ssp245 and ssp585 the medium ssp245 and maximum ssp585 emission scenarios exceed other scenarios in significance in hydrological forecasting and policy perspectives nassery et al 2021b moreover these data were extracted for the time period 2007 2018 for the verification of the observation data as they are also available as historical monthly weather data from 1960 to 2018 3 worldclim outputs were verified using the observation data 4 for each observation well the hydrological model was trained using climate data as the inputs and groundwater level as the target 5 the hydrological model was verified if it was previously trained and the best model was selected for the simulation 6 for each observation well the groundwater level was computed in the base and future time periods under the emission scenarios the aquifer s temporal response 7 the groundwater levels in the observation wells were interpolated by arcmap and the spatial response of the aquifer was discerned 2 2 1 climate data and scenarios in this research the worldclim downscaled data set were applied in truth despite considering the new cmip6 gcms new emission scenarios i e ssps and the bis correction downscaling approach worldclimv2 1 fick and hijmans 2017 has not remarkably been used to predict the aquifers responses toward climate change primarily due to its novelty this data set has already been downscaled and is accessible globally such that it may be used in different hydrological studies without requiring considerable effort for downscaling of the climatic data moreover marksim and nex gddp climate data sets have previously been verified for the lali region zeydalinejad et al 2021 however they consider cmip5 gcms and rcps hence it may be also of great importance to evaluate the newer emission scenarios of cmip6 in the lali region using this data set this data set is available at https www worldclim org data index html for the base time period i e 1970 2000 different climatic data including minimum temperature mean temperature maximum temperature precipitation solar radiation wind speed water vapor pressure bioclimatic variables and elevation are available in geotiff format tif with monthly time steps and different spatial scales from 30 s 1 km2 to 10 min 340 km2 fick and hijmans 2017 on the other hand various climatic data i e monthly average minimum temperature monthly average maximum temperature monthly total precipitation and bioclimatic variables are available in geotiff tif format for the future time periods of 2021 2040 2041 2060 2061 2080 2081 2100 with the spatial resolutions of 2 5 min 4 5 km2 at the equator 5 min 9 km2 at the equator and 10 min 18 5 km2 at the equator this global downscaled climate data set involves nine climate models i e bcc csm2 mr cnrm cm6 1 cnrm esm2 1 canesm5 gfdl esm4 ipsl cm6a lr miroc es2l miroc6 mri esm2 0 besides four new scenarios of ssps have been considered in the data set viz ssp3 7 0 ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp5 8 5 fick and hijmans 2017 the ssp126 scenario may be taken into regard as an equivalent to rcp2 6 in the previous generation of rcps being comparable to rcp4 5 the ssp245 emission scenario locates in the middle of the ssps family pathway with a radiation forcing level of 4 5 w m2 by 2100 the ssp370 scenario is a medium high reference scenario which equals rcp6 0 in cmip5 to end with ssp585 with rcp8 5 as the counterpart is the end of the ssp scenario spectrum in a world with high fossil fuel development throughout the 21st century meinshausen et al 2020 the arithmetic average of the outputs of the gcms included in the data set was used with the exception of gfdl esm4 due to its data gap vis à vis 1970 2000 as the base time span and 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 as the future time intervals also the medium ssp245 and maximum ssp585 emission scenarios were considered which are generally of higher significance in hydrological studies in the forecasting and policy perspectives 2 2 2 hydrological modeling matlab software was applied to simulate the effect of climate change on the pali alluvial aquifer including monthly groundwater level in eight observation wells w1 w8 during the hydrological year 2007 2018 the observation data were divided into two groups training 80 and testing 20 both selected randomly by the model trichakis et al 2011 also divided the data into training 80 and testing 20 subgroups for karstic groundwater level simulation this division attained the best results considering the generalization ability of the network in order to simulate the groundwater level in the observation wells with the highest accuracy the network was run by considering time lags and numerous combinations of inputs among maximum temperature minimum temperature mean temperature and precipitation the output target was the groundwater level in an observation well in fact a specific network was run for every observation well to enhance the accuracy of the model four non numerical approaches were employed i e ann narx aig svr and wsvr after applying the statistical criteria the best model was selected for simulation in order for the spatial response of the aquifer to be quantified groundwater level interpolation methods must be utilized over the model domain after computing the hydraulic head in every observation well barnes 1964 thus the kriging approach in the arcmap environment was employed to spatially simulate the water table in the aquifer subsequent to calculating the response of each observation well using a non numerical approach 2 2 3 overview of the employed algorithms 2 2 3 1 anns containing input output and hidden layers anns may be trained by a number of back propagation algorithms alizadeh and kavianpour 2015 in this survey different algorithms were employed to train anns including the lm and br the objective of training is to acquire a set of weights by which the error ep is minimized for the all inclusive samples in the training data set t the performance function e w may be defined as a summation of the errors squares as the following ham and kostanic 2001 e w 1 2 p 1 p d p y p 2 1 2 p 1 p e p 2 where p mt and t m w yp and dp are the number of training samples the number of output layer neurons the vector encompassing all the weights in the network the network s output and the desired output respectively the number of neurons in the hidden layer along with the training iteration number are among the most significant factors when training the anns which are primarily selected by trial and error alizadeh and kavianpour 2015 as in the present study 2 2 3 2 narx initially introduced by leontaritis and billings 1985 narx belongs to a specific category of anns ghazi et al 2022 narx considers a particular dynamic form of rnns in solving a specific problem not only is of high efficiency in long span modeling but narx has also been approved of great efficacy in water table prediction chang et al 2013 ghazi et al 2022 guzman et al 2017 siegelmann et al 1997 the mathematical equation of an ordinary narx simulation may be expressed as ghazi et al 2022 y t f y t 1 y t 2 y t n y u t 1 u t 2 u t n u in which t y t u t ny nu and f are time output value at time t input data at time t output layer input layer and a non linear function respectively 2 2 3 3 svr introduced by vapnik in 1995 svm is a novel strategy in reference to ml and data driven techniques tikhamarine et al 2019 it is based on the statistical learning theory and the principle of structural risk minimization vapnik 1998 svr is a combination of regression method and svm smola and scholkopf 1998 the main goal of svr is to achieve a function with not more than ε deviation from the real target vectors considering all training data set not excluding the fact that it must be as linear as possible smola 1996 the svr function f x may be defined as follows tikhamarine et al 2019 f x w x b in which w ø and b represent weight vector transfer function and bias respectively the interested reader may consult tikhamarine et al 2019 to acquire detailed information regarding the svr approach and equations 2 2 3 4 wsvr and wt wt disintegrates input data set into approximation components kisi and cimen 2011 then these components are considered as the inputs of svr constituting a new hybrid model named wsvr it is a combination of wavelet decomposition and svr tikhamarine et al 2019 as a mathematical equation wt illustrates a signal using an ensemble of functions which are created by dilations and transformations of a function in order for scale decomposition ψ x also recognized as the mother wavelet to be computed as ψ a b t a 1 2 ψ t b a where ψa b t a and b are the successive wavelet dilation factor and translation factor respectively two types of wt occur cwt and dwt shoaib et al 2014 additional information regarding cwt and dwt is included in the study conducted by altunkaynak and ozger 2016 dwt is preferred in hydrological studies sang 2012 and its equation is as follows ψ m n t 1 a 0 m ψ t n b 0 a 0 m a 0 m where n controls the wavelet transformation and m as an integer controls the wavelet dilation as well a0 which is higher than 1 is a fined dilation step and b0 which is higher than 0 is related to the location parameter experiencing high pass and low pass filters the raw time series are disintegrated into a number of sub signals with details and approximations at diverse resolution levels mallat 1989 2 2 3 5 aig svr introduced by pijarski and kacejko 2019 aig svr is a new meta heuristic approach which may be used in various optimization problems with high efficiency in a time saving manner this procedure achieves the optimal solution and convergence by considering various heuristics in search domain and employing response vectors according to swarm methods it is highly unlikely for this algorithm to entrap in local optimal responses so that it has been asserted that this model is the most efficient algorithm among the swarm intelligence methods including ga particle swarm shrimp and grasshopper dehghani and torabi poudeh 2021 pijarski and kacejko 2019 different equations and modeling steps pertaining to aig are meticulously presented by pijarski and kacejko 2019 to which an interested reader may refer to 2 3 statistical criteria if a groundwater model is trained then the statistical criteria are regarded to choose the best model for simulation in this study the statistical criteria r r2 nse and mae were used to evaluate the performance of the models as criteria for performance evaluation r and r2 are widely used in hydrological modeling studies moriasi et al 2015 r expresses the accuracy of calculating dependent variables by independent variables for which the closer to one the values are the more accuracy the model has javadinejad et al 2020b delineating the proportion of the total variance in the observation data described by the model r2 is between zero and one in which the values closer to one depict higher efficacies legates and mccabe 1999 on the downside these two criteria are hypersensitive to outliers krause et al 2005 and impervious to additive and proportional differences between model predictions and observation data legates and mccabe 1999 nse is a quantitative performance evaluation criterion suitable for long term continuous simulations it can be used to detect the simulation accuracy of the desired output response process as a powerful criterion it can be used to evaluate the model performance by considering several output responses and different time spans the nse varies between zero and one and the latter is for the best accuracy of the model estimates song et al 2021 this criterion has frequently been used and as a result extensive information exists on its values for making comparisons in addition it can take into account the measurement uncertainty harmel and smith 2007 harmel et al 2010 however the criterion cannot satisfactorily define the bias of the model besides it is not capable of determining the variances in the time and magnitude of the peak flows and the shape of the loss curves furthermore it cannot be applied to single event simulations moriasi et al 2015 lastly mae was also selected as a performance criterion herein it is more reliable than me chin 2013 nassery et al 2021b as the positive and negative errors may neutralize each other in light of me mae may differ from zero to positive infinity in which the best result is zero dehghani and torabi poudeh 2021 3 results 3 1 climate change projection to begin with the worldclim downscaled data set was verified using the observation data for the studied area the trend of the outputs of the data set are in agreement with that of the observation precipitation however data set almost underestimates precipitation especially its peak values the data set is capable of simulating the minimum and maximum temperatures with high competences regarding both quantities and trends the statistical criterion r2 is 0 6862 0 9410 and 0 9540 for precipitation minimum temperature and maximum temperature respectively fig 3 the less value of r2 for precipitation is due to the difficulties in characterizing the precipitation characteristics in the lali region indeed considerable variabilities of precipitation occur in the southwestern portions of iran as it was maintained by zeydalinejad et al 2020a succeeding the verification of the data set the climate data was extracted for the region in the base and future time periods under emission scenarios ssp245 and ssp585 fig 4 tables 2 and 3 the trend of climatic variables is corresponding in monthly time steps for all time periods and emission scenarios i e the base time period 1970 2000 the future time period 2021 2040 under ssp245 the future time period 2041 2060 under ssp245 the future time period 2021 2040 under ssp585 and the future time period 2041 2060 under ssp585 fig 4 no precipitation happens in june july august and september and it is almost 3 mm in october most precipitation between 68 5 and 99 mm month occurs in january december february and march respectively from the greatest to lowest values additionally precipitation changes from 36 9 to 51 mm month in april and november and about 9 mm month in may table 2 it mostly belongs to winter and thence fall and is zero in summer the average precipitation is 35 83 36 78 36 28 37 00 and 35 41 mm month for the base time period 1970 2000 the future time period 2021 2040 under ssp245 the future time period 2041 2060 under ssp245 the future time period 2021 2040 under ssp585 and the future time period 2041 2060 under ssp585 respectively precipitation declines in 2041 2060 in compared to 2021 2040 for each emission scenario and its lowest quantity is for the future time period 2041 2060 under ssp585 in which precipitation decreases in comparison with the base time period it is mainly the winter precipitation that decreases in the future time period excluding the future time period 2021 2040 under ssp585 on the other hand most increment in pecipitation would occur in fall in the future time period considering both scenarios the least variation in precipitation is appertained to spring indubitably not considering summer with no precipitation table 3 the peak of minimum and maximum temperatures is in july the coldest month is january and february and december are the second and third cold months respectively table 2 the average minimum temperature is 16 36 18 36 19 15 18 51 and 19 95 c and the average maximum temperature is 31 56 33 49 34 33 33 65 and 35 27 c both for the base time period 1970 2000 the future time period 2021 2040 under ssp245 the future time period 2041 2060 under ssp245 the future time period 2021 2040 under ssp585 and the future time period 2041 2060 under ssp585 respectively table 3 the minimum and maximum temperatures would augment in the future time period as opposed to the base time period this augmentation is higher in the future time period 2041 2060 than 2021 2040 and under emission scenario ssp585 than ssp245 temperature would arise in summer maximally on the other hand its least accretion would be in spring and thence winter table 3 as a result the lali region is exposed to climate change in the future time period owing to the increase of temperature in all months and the shift of precipitation values and patterns in different seasons in a nutshell the outcomes of these fluctuations in precipitation and temperature may lead to groundwater level decline since precipitation increases in warmer months while temperature in all months leading to more evapotranspiration and hence less groundwater recharge however it is the hydrological models which must ascertain the aquifer s response toward climate change as it is discussed in the following section 3 2 groundwater level simulation following the verification of the climatic data set multifold combinations of inputs were considered to train the hydrological models in order to attain the best results table 4 shows 16 inputs derived from three main climate variables i e precipitation minimum temperature and maximum temperature by averaging summating and giving time lags to them the best results achieved considering all these 16 variables as the inputs for all hydrological models anns were not trained altogether using the climatic variables as inputs and regarding different training algorithms as it is depicted in fig 5 for w1 in which r 0 34 for the test data unlike the output layer which was the groundwater level in an observation well different number of neurons was selected in the input and hidden layers among the variables in table 4 different inputs from one variable to all 16 ones were considered plus from 1 to 48 neurons were considered for the hidden layer more than 48 neurons in the hidden layer did not produce the optimum results in regard to fig 5 a number of 16 and 48 neurons was considered in the input and hidden layers respectively as to table 4 the br algorithm was used because the iteration number was not sufficient in reference to the lm algorithm in order for the network to be trained the weights of the network were determined using the algorithm of gradient descent indeed the network had at most 20 iterations for the lm algorithm for which it trespasses the minimum permitted gradient however it permitted even 1000 iterations for the br algorithm nevertheless this model was disregarded so that modeling was not conducted by it the meta heuristic approaches of aig svr and wsvr were auspiciously trained utilizing the lm training algorithm as respects the statistical criteria of the training and test data sets figs 6 and 7 table 5 the statistical index r2 is 0 9997 for wsvr and 0 9985 for aig svr as to all observation data for all inclusive observation wells fig 6 the simulated data are entirely correspondent with the observation data for both models respecting all observation wells including observation well w1 as illustrated in fig 7 as to the average of all wells for the training data set the statistical indices are r 0 991 r2 0 982 mae 0 269 m and nse 0 976 for wsvr and r 0 986 r2 0 972 mae 0 298 m and nse 0 968 for aig svr table 5 on the other hand r 0 995 r2 0 989 mae 0 249 m and nse 0 982 for wsvr and r 0 991 r2 0 982 mae 0 275 m and nse 0 974 for aig svr with respect to the average of all wells for the test data set table 5 succinctly wsvr exhibits higher proficiency than aig svr for the simulation of groundwater in the pali aquifer thence narx network was applied which presented high ability in simulating the groundwater level with r 0 95 apropos of the test data set for w1 fig 8 comparable to the anns the training algorithm of br revealed greater capability than lm it may be speculated that this model is capable of simulating groundwater level with high competence however the difficulty is that narx considers the output of the previous time step as the input of the current time step even though this may be an accomplishment it is rather a downside in the long term predictions of climate change as a matter of fact the outputs are not accessible for the previous time steps to run the model for the future scenarios such that this is perhaps the greatest uncertainty of the model it may be conjectured that using a time series e g the observation groundwater level data as the hypothetical output data for the future simulation may resolve the issue however respecting different time series for this purpose engendered different model s outputs consequently narx is not reliable for long term groundwater level simulations as illustrated in fig 9 in which the observation data and the outputs of wsvr which is now the best model were taken into consideration and different results were obtained accordingly the meta heuristic approaches i e aig svr and wsvr perform better than ann and narx revealing the best results even better than aig svr based on the statistical criteria wsvr was chosen as the best model in contemplation of simulating the aquifer s response toward climate change as presented in tables 6 and 7 and fig 10 for the observation wells in different time periods under both emission scenarios moreover various wavelets exist including haar daubechies symlet gaussian morlet and mexican hat among which the mexican hat as the second derivative of the gaussian function showed the least error and therefore it was taken into consideration herein according to the simulation groundwater level is higher in the base time span than the future time period likewise it declines further in the future time period 2041 2060 than 2021 2040 fig 10 furthermore no interpretative fluctuation in groundwater level is observed for the observation wells as to the emission scenarios in the future time period fig 10 regarding the observation well w1 the highest groundwater level is related to the base time period and the lowest change in groundwater level would occur in the near future i e 2021 2040 under the intermediate i e ssp245 emission scenario the greatest reduction of the groundwater level is expected to occur in the far future i e 2041 2060 under ssp245 the groundwater level difference between the two future time periods under ssp245 scenario is rather big regarding the extreme emission scenario i e ssp585 in both near and far future there is not much different in groundwater level and it is lower than the base time period the largest and lowest difference in groundwater level between the future and base time periods considering both scenarios is associated with may and december respectively similar to w1 as regards well w2 the highest groundwater level is appertained to the base period the lowest difference in groundwater level in the future period in contrast to the base period is pertinent to the time period 2021 2040 under ssp245 which like the base period has a clear difference with the time period 2041 2060 under the same emission scenario comparable with w1 under the extreme scenario the groundwater level difference in both future periods is trivial and the lowest groundwater level is related to 2041 2060 the wells w3 and w4 are in the vicinity of each other and groundwater level trend in these wells is similar in the base and future periods under both scenarios in both wells the highest groundwater level is observed in the base period furthermore the lowest and highest decrease in groundwater level is predicted to occur in 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 respectively under the intermediate scenario considering the extreme scenario groundwater level in both wells is lower in 2041 2060 than 2021 2040 the highest and lowest difference of groundwater level between the future and base periods are observed in april and december respectively for w3 and in may and december respectively for w4 vis à vis the observation well w5 the groundwater level in the base time period is higher during the early months of the year and lower during the other months of the year in comparison with the future time period under ssp585 groundwater level in the future period under the intermediate scenario is lower than the future period under the extreme scenario it is lower in 2041 2060 than 2021 2040 under both scenarios the biggest difference of groundwater level in the future period contrasted to the base period is for the month of april in 2041 2060 under ssp245 the difference in groundwater level of this well in different months of the year is evident which is maybe due to the fact that this well is located in the elevated portion or the recharge area of the aquifer where vertical groundwater flow is probable the curves for the wells w6 and w7 are analogous in both wells the highest and lowest level of groundwater corresponds to the base time period and the future time period 2041 2060 under the extreme scenario respectively the biggest difference of the groundwater level in the future period versus the base period is related to may in 2041 2060 under the extreme scenario for both wells moreover groundwater level is lower in 2041 2060 than 2021 2040 under both scenarios for both wells in view of the observation well w8 the highest groundwater level is correlated to the base period and groundwater level would decrease in both future time periods under both scenarios compared to the base period the largest drop of groundwater level would happen in 2041 2060 under both scenarios in the early months of the year from january to july groundwater level would decrease even more in 2041 2060 than 2021 2040 under both emission scenarios in the time period 2021 2040 groundwater level is lower under ssp585 than ssp245 however groundwater level does not change significantly in 2041 2060 under both scenarios the annual groundwater level as the average of all wells is 431 6 m for the base time period 426 2 m for the future time period 2021 2040 under ssp245 420 7 m for the future time period 2041 2060 under ssp245 424 6 m for the future time period 2021 2040 under ssp585 and 423 m for the future time period 2041 2060 under ssp585 as regards the seasonal fluctuations based on the average of all wells the hydraulic head is in the lowest and highest position in the fall and spring respectively in view of each time period and emission scenario with the exception of ssp245 emission scenario in 2041 2060 in which water table ranges from 420 5 to 421 m moreover most plunges in groundwater level would occur in spring which is the season with the highest groundwater level in the future time period under both emission scenarios minimal changes in water table may be apropos of fall with an exception of ssp245 emission scenario in 2021 2040 during which the lowest groundwater level would happen in winter with 4 2 m decline however the decrease in groundwater level is 4 6 m in fall for this emission scenario and time period depicting minute differences table 7 in respect of monthly variations the highest and lowest hydraulic head is in may and december respectively for each time span and emission scenario table 6 ultimately the groundwater level of the observation wells was interpolated and the spatial distribution of the variable was illustrated fig 11 the recharge and discharge zones of the aquifer are virtually analogous for each time period and emission scenario such that groundwater flow direction is from the eastern and northwestern toward the southwestern portion of the aquifer comparable to the topographical elevation of the study area shown in fig 1 as represented in fig 11 the highest and lowest values of water table throughout the aquifer are 514 9 and 387 5 m in the base time period 512 9 and 384 6 m in 2021 2040 under ssp245 506 9 and 380 2 m in 2041 2060 under ssp245 506 4 and 384 1 m in 2021 2040 under ssp585 and 504 9 and 381 3 m in 2041 2060 under ssp585 all respectively hence it may be concluded that groundwater level declines from the base time period to the future time period 2021 2040 and finally to the future time period 2041 2060 in light of the emission scenarios this declination is more for ssp585 than ssp245 4 discussion in the present research cmip6 emission scenarios i e ssp245 and ssp585 for eight climatic models were extracted from the worldclim data set in the lali region in order to model the pali aquifer using ai non numerical approaches in the base 1970 2000 and future 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 time periods the precipitation and temperature values have been estimated to be higher for the region in the present study based on cmip6 than in the research carried out by nassery et al 2021b based on cmip5 outputs as in accordance with the research conducted in the yangtze river basin in china in which precipitation was accentuated to increase li et al 2021 and the study carried out in iran in which it was underlined that cmip6 models project more precipitation than cmip5 gcms zamani et al 2020 according to the statistical criteria for both the training data set 80 of the data selected randomly by model and the testing data set 20 of the data selected randomly by model table 5 wsvr as the selected hydrological approach in the current study has modeled the aquifer favorably considering the average of all observation wells in the time period 2007 2018 in the current study the average decline in the piezometric head of all observation wells were predicted to be 5 4 and 10 9 m in 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 time periods respectively under ssp245 and 7 and 8 6 m in 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 time periods respectively under ssp585 on the other hand regarding nassery et al 2021b the numerical model i e modflow was capable of modeling the pali aquifer response to climate change for which no significant changes in groundwater level were predicted over the model domain in an annual time scale in the future time period these differences in the response of the aquifer toward climate change are related to different climate data sets and hydrological modeling approaches being used in fact the statistical criteria are of great efficacies for both numerical and non numerical approaches so that the differences may primarily be related to the climate data sets with dissimilar emission scenarios rather than hydrological models based on the worldclim data set employed in this research a warmer future with more precipitation was forecasted in comparison with the nex gddp and marksim data set assessed by zeydalinejad et al 2021 due to further evapotranspiration rate warmer scenario may induce more depletion in the aquifer than increased precipitation recharge as to replenishment these interpretations have been put on the survey considering the fact that no human influences are presently affecting the aquifer in terms of the hydrological modeling as in accordance with the current study in which wsvr presented the highest efficacy in comparison with anns narx and aig svr models wsvr had the best performance among bwo svr wsvr and aig svr in the groundwater level forecasting in the analysis conducted by dehghani et al 2022 moreover yu et al 2018 used wann and wsvr for groundwater depth simulation in the northwestern portion of china and avowed that not only do these models have better performance than ann and svr but wsvr also perform better than wann also wsvr produced the best results in an attempt to simulate the groundwater depth in visakhapatnam in india compared to ann svr and arima suryanarayana et al 2014 this study proved the disability of narx in the simulation of the response of the aquifer toward climate change as the study conducted by guzman et al 2018 therein narx and svr were compared in the simulation of daily groundwater level in the southeastern usa and svr was highlighted as the better model however the results of the current study are not in agreement with ghazi et al 2022 in which narx showed the highest efficiency in groundwater modeling in comparison with other models i e arima and anfis furthermore jeihouni et al 2019b compared lssvm anfis and narx to predict the groundwater level in shabestar palin iran under climate change and selected the hybrid technique of w narx as the best method as a final point the groundwater related climate change studies have their own limitations firstly emission scenarios are one of the sources of uncertainty in each report the ipcc takes into consideration updated emission scenarios the latest of them are ssps which as previously mentioned are divided into four scenarios i e ssp126 ssp245 ssp370 ssp585 ergo not only do various emission series exist but each of which also includes a range of projections depending on which emission scenario is regarded different outputs may be achieved in this study the newest scenarios more specifically the medium and maximum ones i e the ssp245 and ssp585 were employed which are vitally important in hydrological projections and policy perspectives secondly each gcm may project the climate of a specific region dissimilarly even by considering a similar emission scenario hence an average of eight gcms were considered herein thirdly the drawbacks of hydrological models in simulating of an aquifer must be perceived different hydrological models including numerical and non numerical ones have their own specific advantages and disadvantages as it was deeply delved into by zeydalinejad 2022 four state of the art non numerical models were regarded in this context among which the best model was selected in order to decline this uncertainty among the limitations of the non numerical approaches used in the current study is that they are black box models and do not represent the hydrodynamic responses of the aquifer they use the climate data as the input and simulate the groundwater level as the output based on the weights and non linear relationships which have been determined between the inputs and outputs during the training the models were attempted to be trained based on the trial and error approach which was difficult and time consuming non numerical approaches have been frequently applied to predict short term responses of the groundwater systems however they were employed to simulate long term groundwater levels in this study it is assumed that the acquired relationships do not change in the future when longer and more accurate data may be accessible one of the difficulties with most aquifers in iran is data scarcity the pali aquifer also has this drawback including climatic hydrological and hydrogeological data paucity surface water data does not exist or include many data gaps the data related to the hydrodynamic properties of the aquifer are not sufficient and highly reliable groundwater level data are monthly and exist since 2007 as a matter of fact if longer groundwater level time series had existed the relationship between the inputs and outputs may have been more accurate so that even other approaches like conventional anns may have been able to simulate the aquifer in the current study wsvr was able to propitiously simulate the groundwater level just based on precipitation and temperature variables therefore there are relationships between these climate variables and groundwater levels and these non linear relationships were determined by the employed non numerical model after being trained the average of monthly temperature precipitation and groundwater level in the studied area for the observation time period i e 2007 2018 demonstrates that groundwater level increases by increasing precipitation and decreasing temperature and vice versa after a time lag fig 12 therefore the climate variables of the previous months were also taken into consideration for training the models which their best performance was for a 2 month time lag table 4 there is no pumping well in the pali aquifer therefore it is mainly the climate change that influences the groundwater level fluctuations hence by using the climatic variables i e precipitation and temperature there was possibility for the models to be accurately trained as aforementioned even these variables are not available in the study area for the considered time periods and they were attained using the global predownscaled climate data set on the topic of the acquired results it may be mentioned that since the model was trained based on temperature and precipitation the outputs of the model strongly depend on these climatic variables temperature was projected to be higher in the future time period than the base time period and this increment is even more in 2041 2060 than 2021 2040 moreover temperature s increment is more under ssp585 than ssp245 therefore it may be expected that groundwater level decreases in the future time period especially in 2041 2060 and under ssp585 however for some wells this assumption is not true fig 10 and that is because of precipitation and the relationships developed by the selected model precipitation is greater in the future time period than the base time period with the exception of the emission scenario ssp585 in 2041 2060 furthermore the calculated reationships are certainly not linear and therefore a specific result that a modeler may speculate may not be expected to be true 5 conclusions and recommendations even though climate change is declining the groundwater level in iran s aquifers few studies have evaluated its effects on groundwater systems one reason is data scarcity so that enough and accurate observations do not exist to conduct groundwater related climate change studies in the country however in the current study we showed how to overcome to this difficulty and modeled the response of an aquifer toward climate change even though long term climatic variables are not accessible for the pali aquifer we promisingly simulated its groundwater level under climate change using a global predownscaled climate data set i e worldclim this data set has rarely been considered in groundwater studies however it was found that it is of high accuracy for a small scale region to be utilized as a tool for groundwater related climate change studies taking into consideration that downscaling of the climate data for a specific region is demanding and time consuming zeydalinejad et al 2021 predownscaled climate data sets may be employed in the hydrological studies though after verification regarding the observations of a specific locality on the other hand we compared four cutting edge non numerical approaches herein viz ann narx aig svr and wsvr which have not previously been compared in the simulation of a specific groundwater system in order to simulate the groundwater level in the aquifer by only considering the climate variables as inputs in truth as a promising downscaled climatic data set worldclim may be used in climate change impact studies precipitation declines in the lali region in 2041 2060 compared to 2021 2040 under both emission scenarios and its lowest amount occurs in the future time period 2041 2060 under ssp585 being zero in summer precipitation mostly belongs to winter and then fall in addition it is the winter precipitation that mainly decreases in the future time period except for the time period 2021 2040 under ssp585 on the other hand precipitation shows the most increment in fall in the future time period considering both scenarios the lowest variations in precipitation are also related to spring the minimum and maximum temperatures show an increasing trend in the future time period especially in 2041 2060 and under ssp585 emission scenario most augmentation in temperature is related to the summer and least increase in it is in reference to spring and thence winter while the coldest month is january the peak of minimum and maximum temperatures corresponds to july anns were not able to simulate the groundwater level whatsoever using the climatic variables as the input even though narx had high efficacy in simulating the groundwater level with r 0 95 for the test data set it considers the output of the previous time step as the input of each time step and hence it was not able to simulate the groundwater level in this long term groundwater related climate change impact study it is proposed to consider narx hydrological model more meticulously in climate change impact studies on groundwater in which long simulations are taken into regard on the other hand meta heuristic ai approaches were capable of simulating groundwater level in the pali aquifer with high accuracy only by using a combination of climatic variables as the network s input among the meta heuristic algorithms wsvr showed better performance considering the statistical criteria and hence it was chosen as the model to simulate the aquifer s response toward climate change the annual groundwater level declines further from the base time period 1970 2000 to the future time period 2021 2040 and to the future time period 2041 2060 regarding the emission scenarios this declination would be more as regards the ssp585 emission scenario than the ssp245 emission scenario as the average of all wells the seasonal fluctuations almost show that the groundwater level is in its lowest position in the fall and in its highest place in spring considering the time periods and emission scenarios all in all considering the time periods and emission scenarios most decrement in groundwater level under potential climate change would occur in spring which is the season with the highest groundwater level in the region on the other hand the least variations in groundwater level would occur in fall lastly considering all time periods and emission scenarios the highest and the lowest groundwater level would be in may and december respectively in regard to the scope of future research it is recommended to evaluate the global predownscaled climate data sets for other localities and utilize them more frequently in hydrological studies as a way to address the data scarcity and the difficulty with climate data downscaling various data sets may be evaluated and the best one may be selected for a specific region additionally other emission scenarios may be regarded to discern the groundwater level in the future furthermore a variety of hydrological models exist that may be used to appraise an aquifer response toward stresses like climate change which may be used to have a better understanding of the system anyway the application of non numerical approaches is surpassing the numerical models in groundwater related studies zeydalinejad 2022 and they are continuously updated or new procedures of them are introduced therefore considering an ensemble of models is highly suggested as in this research it is proposed to use the meta heuristic approaches e g wsvr and aig svr in the hard rock aquifers to appraise their capabilities in dissimilar groundwater systems hard rock aquifers are complex heterogeneous and anisotropic to be modeled by numerical models and in most cases different approaches have been employed to simulate them zeydalinejad 2022 taking into account their potential disparate surface and subsurface characteristic nassery et al 2021a the groundwater level in the pali aquifer declines in the future despite the fact that this decline is solely induced by climate and no human induced depletion occurs in the aquifer ergo the adaptaion strategies must be considered in regard to the aquifer in order to manage it sustainably some of these strategies have been represented in the study conducted by zeydalinejad and nassery 2022 therein the climate induced depletion of iran s aquifers was accentuated as a final point in the current study only temperature and precipitation were employed to train the model however other climatic and hydrological variables may be available in the future by putting more emphasis on gathering data by the related authorities such that a specific model may be trained more accurately by utilizing more variables as the inputs funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors declaration of competing

article 
11721,climate change is one of the main sources of stress on the aquifers however few studies have appraised its impact on groundwater systems especially in iran with unprecedented groundwater depletion rates not influenced by anthropogenic influences pali aquifer southwest iran has climate data scarcity to determine the response of the aquifer one approach is to utilize a pre downscaled data set to this end worldclim data set under shared socioeconomic pathways ssps i e ssp245 and ssp585 was considered furthermore nonlinear autoregressive exogenous narx and artificial neural networks anns along with support vector regression svr combined with the meta heuristic algorithms of wavelet wsvr and innovative gunner aig svr were applied regarding 1970 2000 as the base time span and 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 as the future time periods among observational data 2007 2018 80 and 20 were considered for the network s training and testing respectively an increase in temperature between 1 93 and 3 7 c would occur in the future with the most increment in summer 2041 2060 under ssp585 additionally precipitation fluctuate from 0 43 to 1 17 mm month with a probable rise in fall and most decline in winter 2041 2060 under ssp585 as regards the groundwater modeling considering that narx and anns were not able to simulate the aquifer altogether the meta heuristic approaches demonstrated high proficiencies with r 0 995 r2 0 989 mean absolute error mae 0 249 m and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 982 for the test data wsvr illustrated the greatest efficacy which disclosed that the groundwater level would face the utmost reduction from 5 4 to 10 9 m in observation wells especially in spring 2041 2060 indeed this decline in groundwater level is exclusively induced by climate change emphasizing on proposing groundwater adaptation strategies to address the groundwater issues like land subsidence in iran moreover it is proposed that different modeling approaches be evaluated

have posed challenges on groundwater resources schmidt et al 2017 roshni et al 2020 in addition concerns about the effect of climate change and human activities on the quantity and quality of water

2018 zamanirad et al 2018 burri et al 2019 el asri et al 2019 houemenou et al 2020 indeed climate change affects groundwater though less than surface water and in an indirect way javadinejad et al

despite being complementary in some issues numerical and non numerical models have their own strengths and weaknesses in solving a specific difficulty pandey et al 2016 being able to simulate the physical processes of an aquifer yadav et al 2020 groundwater numerical models are typically preferred to non numerical models in many instances accurate groundwater level forecasting may be of greater significance than recognizing the actual physical relationships in the system smith and eli 1995 tokar and johnson 1999 daliakopoulos et al 2005 especially in reference to the aquifers with data paucity being employed to comprehend the nonlinear aquifer dynamic responses daliakopoulos et al 2005 adamowski and chan 2011 rinderer et al 2018 obergfell et al 2019 roshni et al 2019 data

complexities of the mathematical formulation of physical processes and data shortages especially over the last two decades natarajan and sudheer 2020 as one of the most recognized data driven models

modeling rajaee et al 2019 anns can effectively simulate and predict time series in different aquifers provided that they are properly developed rajaee et al 2019 anns provide excellent tools for solving different complex patterns and nonlinear systems in a black box manner guzman et al 2017 kim 2020 groundwater level fluctuations are nonlinear in nature and depend on factors such as precipitation evapotranspiration soil characteristics and topography suryanarayana et al 2014 anns have the ability to simulate rapid short term and continuous long term effects of groundwater time series both explicitly and non explicitly considering the inputs and the network s architecture respectively principe et al 2000 anns have been used for groundwater level prediction in a single well nayak et al 2006 uddameri 2007 trichakis et al 2011 shamsuddin et al 2017 liu et al 2018 and a set of wells mohanty et al 2015 interested reader may consult rajaee et al 2019 and zeydalinejad 2022 to attain information concerning the groundwater level simulation using anns anns have been used in order to determine the response of an aquifer to climate change in several studies tapoglou et al 2014

temperature precipitation and evaporation in which gcms are utilized hori and ueda 2006 model evaluation is performed using the cmip simulation protocols of which the latest version is currently cmip6 eyring et al 2016 compared to the previous version i e cmip5 in which the projections were conducted for rcps based on socioeconomic scenarios cmip6 uses a matrix framework not only of rcps but also of ssps song et al 2021 the latter scenarios include mitigation adaptation and future efforts on climate change based on socio economic changes such as population economic development ecosystems

remarkable feat in the modeling of time series cadenas et al 2016 narx as a specific type of anns has not frequently been applied to groundwater level predictions fabio et al 2022 guzman et al 2017 wunsch et al 2018 it has been used to predict groundwater level at different time scales including daily guzman et al 2017 2018 jeong and park 2019 zhang et al 2019 di nunno and granata 2020 weekly hasda et al 2020 monthly izady et al 2013 chang et al 2016 alsumaiei 2020 jami et al 2020 javadinejad et al 2020a jeihouni et al 2019b fabio et al 2022 and half yearly wunsch et al 2018 2021 other than anns svms are among the ml techniques being progressively used in hydrologic predicting they can be divided into two groups of svc and svr contending the problems of classification and regression respectively belayneh et al 2014 gao et al 2001 in comparison with fl and neural network approaches the svr technique has the advantages of a shorter training time lower data dependence and easier implementation band et al 2021 the performance of the groundwater level simulation using svr may be enhanced by combining it to the meta heuristic approaches alizadeh et al 2017b ebrahimi and rajaee 2017 including wsvr and aig svr meta heuristic algorithms are optimization techniques ascertaining the optimal solutions in complex problems despite not ensuring a global optimal solution these algorithms are viable options in reaching optimal or near optimal solutions haddad et al 2013 wsvr has been used to simulate groundwater level in several studies e g ping et al 2013 suryanarayana et al 2014 sujay raghavendra and deka 2015 ebrahimi and rajaee 2017 yu et al 2018 and band et al 2021 on the other hand rarely does aig svr have been used in groundwater literature bwo svr wsvr and aig svr were compared in the simulation of groundwater level under climate change in khorramabad plain iran considering the time period 2000 2020 as the training time span wsvr had the best performance dehghani et al 2022 in a comparison study anns ffbp ann aig ann bwo and ann cso were evaluated in the groundwater modeling of selseleh plain in 2008 2018 as it was concluded not only ann aig showed the greatest efficiency but also all the hybrid models declined the modeling error compared to the standalone anns dehghani and torabi poudeh 2021 furthermore dehghani et al 2021 employed aig svr cso svr ssd svr and bwo svr to simulate the dissolved oxygen in the cumberland river the united states during the time period 2008 2018 the hybrid models performed better than the standalone svr and aig svr was the best model for the prediction of dissolved oxygen in river as it was proclaimed rarely do cmip6 simulation protocols have been evaluated for small scale regions and applied to groundwater impact studies e g ghazi et al 2022 in addition aig svr and as previously mentioned narx have been considered in little research in relation to groundwater in truth by searching aig svr groundwater in the google scholar academic search engine only three results are currently demonstrated furthermore most groundwater related climate change impact studies encompass the uncertainties of anthropogenic influences and pumping wells however such uncertainties do not occur in regard to the pali aquifer southwest iran not dissimilar to zeydalinejad et al 2020a b c and nassery et al 2021b this research spatially temporally underscores the influence of climate change on the pali aquifer indeed the objective of the current investigation is to determine the monthly and seasonal fluctuations in groundwater level of the aquifer under potential climate change considering the cmip6 simulations ergo the efficacy of the cmip6 protocols can be assessed for a small scale locality despite the fact that not sufficient climate data exist for the aquifer it is attempted to evaluate a predownscaled climate data set in the current research to overcome this difficulty in addition non numerical approaches are utilized in reference to groundwater modeling such that the application of anns narx aig svr and wsvr are appraised to the best knowledge of the authors the performance of these models have not previously been compared in the simulation of a specific groundwater system another purpose is to comprehend whether the state of the art ai approaches can predict the groundwater level in an observation well using the climatic variables of temperature and precipitation 2 material and methods 2 1 the study area located in the lali region the southwest of the zagros ranges iran the pali alluvial aquifer is a small scale groundwater system mainly composed of recent alluvial sediments and loose debris conglomerate fig 1 the latter just covers a small portion of the model domain the aquifer is primarily surrounded by the bakhtiari conglomerates as high elevation topographies the taraz harkesh stream passes through the aquifer and is the main drain of the groundwater system fig 1 there are eight observation wells w1 to w8 with appropriate scattering in the pali aquifer fig 1 the greral groundwater flow direction is from the east and northwest to the southwest of the aquifer which significantly correlates with the topographical elevation fig 1 the interested reader may refer to nassery et al 2021b in order to obtain more detailed data and information in reference to the pali alluvial aquifer not excluding the hydrogeological characteristics the average groundwater level and the lithological log of the observation wells 2 2 methods in brief the employed procedure takes account of the following steps fig 2 1 the observation data including minimum temperature maximum temperature precipitation and groundwater level were collected for the hydrological years 2007 2018 monthly time steps were considered for all the data 2 minimum temperature maximum temperature and precipitation were derived from the worldclim downscaled data set for the region in the base 1970 2000 and future 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 time periods under ssp245 and ssp585 the medium ssp245 and maximum ssp585 emission scenarios exceed other scenarios in significance in hydrological forecasting and policy perspectives nassery et al 2021b moreover these data were extracted for the time period 2007 2018 for the verification of the observation data as they are also available as historical monthly weather data from 1960 to 2018 3 worldclim outputs were verified using the observation data 4 for each observation well the hydrological model was trained using climate data as the inputs and groundwater level as the target 5 the hydrological model was verified if it was previously trained and the best model was selected for the simulation 6 for each observation well the groundwater level was computed in the base and future time periods under the emission scenarios the aquifer s temporal response 7 the groundwater levels in the observation wells were interpolated by arcmap and the spatial response of the aquifer was discerned 2 2 1 climate data and scenarios in this research the worldclim downscaled data set were applied in truth despite considering the new cmip6 gcms new emission scenarios i e ssps and the bis correction downscaling approach worldclimv2 1 fick and hijmans 2017 has not remarkably been used to predict the aquifers responses toward climate change primarily due to its novelty this data set has already been downscaled and is accessible globally such that it may be used in different hydrological studies without requiring considerable effort for downscaling of the climatic data moreover marksim and nex gddp climate data sets have previously been verified for the lali region zeydalinejad et al 2021 however they consider cmip5 gcms and rcps hence it may be also of great importance to evaluate the newer emission scenarios of cmip6 in the lali region using this data set this data set is available at https www worldclim org data index html for the base time period i e 1970 2000 different climatic data including minimum temperature mean temperature maximum temperature precipitation solar radiation wind speed water vapor pressure bioclimatic variables and elevation are available in geotiff format tif with monthly time steps and different spatial scales from 30 s 1 km2 to 10 min 340 km2 fick and hijmans 2017 on the other hand various climatic data i e monthly average minimum temperature monthly average maximum temperature monthly total precipitation and bioclimatic variables are available in geotiff tif format for the future time periods of 2021 2040 2041 2060 2061 2080 2081 2100 with the spatial resolutions of 2 5 min 4 5 km2 at the equator 5 min 9 km2 at the equator and 10 min 18 5 km2 at the equator this global downscaled climate data set involves nine climate models i e bcc csm2 mr cnrm cm6 1 cnrm esm2 1 canesm5 gfdl esm4 ipsl cm6a lr miroc es2l miroc6 mri esm2 0 besides four new scenarios of ssps have been considered in the data set viz ssp3 7 0 ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp5 8 5 fick and hijmans 2017 the ssp126 scenario may be taken into regard as an equivalent to rcp2 6 in the previous generation of rcps being comparable to rcp4 5 the ssp245 emission scenario locates in the middle of the ssps family pathway with a radiation forcing level of 4 5 w m2 by 2100 the ssp370 scenario is a medium high reference scenario which equals rcp6 0 in cmip5 to end with ssp585 with rcp8 5 as the counterpart is the end of the ssp scenario spectrum in a world with high fossil fuel development throughout the 21st century meinshausen et al 2020 the arithmetic average of the outputs of the gcms included in the data set was used with the exception of gfdl esm4 due to its data gap vis à vis 1970 2000 as the base time span and 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 as the future time intervals also the medium ssp245 and maximum ssp585 emission scenarios were considered which are generally of higher significance in hydrological studies in the forecasting and policy perspectives 2 2 2 hydrological modeling matlab software was applied to simulate the effect of climate change on the pali alluvial aquifer including monthly groundwater level in eight observation wells w1 w8 during the hydrological year 2007 2018 the observation data were divided into two groups training 80 and testing 20 both selected randomly by the model trichakis et al 2011 also divided the data into training 80 and testing 20 subgroups for karstic groundwater level simulation this division attained the best results considering the generalization ability of the network in order to simulate the groundwater level in the observation wells with the highest accuracy the network was run by considering time lags and numerous combinations of inputs among maximum temperature minimum temperature mean temperature and precipitation the output target was the groundwater level in an observation well in fact a specific network was run for every observation well to enhance the accuracy of the model four non numerical approaches were employed i e ann narx aig svr and wsvr after applying the statistical criteria the best model was selected for simulation in order for the spatial response of the aquifer to be quantified groundwater level interpolation methods must be utilized over the model domain after computing the hydraulic head in every observation well barnes 1964 thus the kriging approach in the arcmap environment was employed to spatially simulate the water table in the aquifer subsequent to calculating the response of each observation well using a non numerical approach 2 2 3 overview of the employed algorithms 2 2 3 1 anns containing input output and hidden layers anns may be trained by a number of back propagation algorithms alizadeh and kavianpour 2015 in this survey different algorithms were employed to train anns including the lm and br the objective of training is to acquire a set of weights by which the error ep is minimized for the all inclusive samples in the training data set t the performance function e w may be defined as a summation of the errors squares as the following ham and kostanic 2001 e w 1 2 p 1 p d p y p 2 1 2 p 1 p e p 2 where p mt and t m w yp and dp are the number of training samples the number of output layer neurons the vector encompassing all the weights in the network the network s output and the desired output respectively the number of neurons in the hidden layer along with the training iteration number are among the most significant factors when training the anns which are primarily selected by trial and error alizadeh and kavianpour 2015 as in the present study 2 2 3 2 narx initially introduced by leontaritis and billings 1985 narx belongs to a specific category of anns ghazi et al 2022 narx considers a particular dynamic form of rnns in solving a specific problem not only is of high efficiency in long span modeling but narx has also been approved of great efficacy in water table prediction chang et al 2013 ghazi et al 2022 guzman et al 2017 siegelmann et al 1997 the mathematical equation of an ordinary narx simulation may be expressed as ghazi et al 2022 y t f y t 1 y t 2 y t n y u t 1 u t 2 u t n u in which t y t u t ny nu and f are time output value at time t input data at time t output layer input layer and a non linear function respectively 2 2 3 3 svr introduced by vapnik in 1995 svm is a novel strategy in reference to ml and data driven techniques tikhamarine et al 2019 it is based on the statistical learning theory and the principle of structural risk minimization vapnik 1998 svr is a combination of regression method and svm smola and scholkopf 1998 the main goal of svr is to achieve a function with not more than ε deviation from the real target vectors considering all training data set not excluding the fact that it must be as linear as possible smola 1996 the svr function f x may be defined as follows tikhamarine et al 2019 f x w x b in which w ø and b represent weight vector transfer function and bias respectively the interested reader may consult tikhamarine et al 2019 to acquire detailed information regarding the svr approach and equations 2 2 3 4 wsvr and wt wt disintegrates input data set into approximation components kisi and cimen 2011 then these components are considered as the inputs of svr constituting a new hybrid model named wsvr it is a combination of wavelet decomposition and svr tikhamarine et al 2019 as a mathematical equation wt illustrates a signal using an ensemble of functions which are created by dilations and transformations of a function in order for scale decomposition ψ x also recognized as the mother wavelet to be computed as ψ a b t a 1 2 ψ t b a where ψa b t a and b are the successive wavelet dilation factor and translation factor respectively two types of wt occur cwt and dwt shoaib et al 2014 additional information regarding cwt and dwt is included in the study conducted by altunkaynak and ozger 2016 dwt is preferred in hydrological studies sang 2012 and its equation is as follows ψ m n t 1 a 0 m ψ t n b 0 a 0 m a 0 m where n controls the wavelet transformation and m as an integer controls the wavelet dilation as well a0 which is higher than 1 is a fined dilation step and b0 which is higher than 0 is related to the location parameter experiencing high pass and low pass filters the raw time series are disintegrated into a number of sub signals with details and approximations at diverse resolution levels mallat 1989 2 2 3 5 aig svr introduced by pijarski and kacejko 2019 aig svr is a new meta heuristic approach which may be used in various optimization problems with high efficiency in a time saving manner this procedure achieves the optimal solution and convergence by considering various heuristics in search domain and employing response vectors according to swarm methods it is highly unlikely for this algorithm to entrap in local optimal responses so that it has been asserted that this model is the most efficient algorithm among the swarm intelligence methods including ga particle swarm shrimp and grasshopper dehghani and torabi poudeh 2021 pijarski and kacejko 2019 different equations and modeling steps pertaining to aig are meticulously presented by pijarski and kacejko 2019 to which an interested reader may refer to 2 3 statistical criteria if a groundwater model is trained then the statistical criteria are regarded to choose the best model for simulation in this study the statistical criteria r r2 nse and mae were used to evaluate the performance of the models as criteria for performance evaluation r and r2 are widely used in hydrological modeling studies moriasi et al 2015 r expresses the accuracy of calculating dependent variables by independent variables for which the closer to one the values are the more accuracy the model has javadinejad et al 2020b delineating the proportion of the total variance in the observation data described by the model r2 is between zero and one in which the values closer to one depict higher efficacies legates and mccabe 1999 on the downside these two criteria are hypersensitive to outliers krause et al 2005 and impervious to additive and proportional differences between model predictions and observation data legates and mccabe 1999 nse is a quantitative performance evaluation criterion suitable for long term continuous simulations it can be used to detect the simulation accuracy of the desired output response process as a powerful criterion it can be used to evaluate the model performance by considering several output responses and different time spans the nse varies between zero and one and the latter is for the best accuracy of the model estimates song et al 2021 this criterion has frequently been used and as a result extensive information exists on its values for making comparisons in addition it can take into account the measurement uncertainty harmel and smith 2007 harmel et al 2010 however the criterion cannot satisfactorily define the bias of the model besides it is not capable of determining the variances in the time and magnitude of the peak flows and the shape of the loss curves furthermore it cannot be applied to single event simulations moriasi et al 2015 lastly mae was also selected as a performance criterion herein it is more reliable than me chin 2013 nassery et al 2021b as the positive and negative errors may neutralize each other in light of me mae may differ from zero to positive infinity in which the best result is zero dehghani and torabi poudeh 2021 3 results 3 1 climate change projection to begin with the worldclim downscaled data set was verified using the observation data for the studied area the trend of the outputs of the data set are in agreement with that of the observation precipitation however data set almost underestimates precipitation especially its peak values the data set is capable of simulating the minimum and maximum temperatures with high competences regarding both quantities and trends the statistical criterion r2 is 0 6862 0 9410 and 0 9540 for precipitation minimum temperature and maximum temperature respectively fig 3 the less value of r2 for precipitation is due to the difficulties in characterizing the precipitation characteristics in the lali region indeed considerable variabilities of precipitation occur in the southwestern portions of iran as it was maintained by zeydalinejad et al 2020a succeeding the verification of the data set the climate data was extracted for the region in the base and future time periods under emission scenarios ssp245 and ssp585 fig 4 tables 2 and 3 the trend of climatic variables is corresponding in monthly time steps for all time periods and emission scenarios i e the base time period 1970 2000 the future time period 2021 2040 under ssp245 the future time period 2041 2060 under ssp245 the future time period 2021 2040 under ssp585 and the future time period 2041 2060 under ssp585 fig 4 no precipitation happens in june july august and september and it is almost 3 mm in october most precipitation between 68 5 and 99 mm month occurs in january december february and march respectively from the greatest to lowest values additionally precipitation changes from 36 9 to 51 mm month in april and november and about 9 mm month in may table 2 it mostly belongs to winter and thence fall and is zero in summer the average precipitation is 35 83 36 78 36 28 37 00 and 35 41 mm month for the base time period 1970 2000 the future time period 2021 2040 under ssp245 the future time period 2041 2060 under ssp245 the future time period 2021 2040 under ssp585 and the future time period 2041 2060 under ssp585 respectively precipitation declines in 2041 2060 in compared to 2021 2040 for each emission scenario and its lowest quantity is for the future time period 2041 2060 under ssp585 in which precipitation decreases in comparison with the base time period it is mainly the winter precipitation that decreases in the future time period excluding the future time period 2021 2040 under ssp585 on the other hand most increment in pecipitation would occur in fall in the future time period considering both scenarios the least variation in precipitation is appertained to spring indubitably not considering summer with no precipitation table 3 the peak of minimum and maximum temperatures is in july the coldest month is january and february and december are the second and third cold months respectively table 2 the average minimum temperature is 16 36 18 36 19 15 18 51 and 19 95 c and the average maximum temperature is 31 56 33 49 34 33 33 65 and 35 27 c both for the base time period 1970 2000 the future time period 2021 2040 under ssp245 the future time period 2041 2060 under ssp245 the future time period 2021 2040 under ssp585 and the future time period 2041 2060 under ssp585 respectively table 3 the minimum and maximum temperatures would augment in the future time period as opposed to the base time period this augmentation is higher in the future time period 2041 2060 than 2021 2040 and under emission scenario ssp585 than ssp245 temperature would arise in summer maximally on the other hand its least accretion would be in spring and thence winter table 3 as a result the lali region is exposed to climate change in the future time period owing to the increase of temperature in all months and the shift of precipitation values and patterns in different seasons in a nutshell the outcomes of these fluctuations in precipitation and temperature may lead to groundwater level decline since precipitation increases in warmer months while temperature in all months leading to more evapotranspiration and hence less groundwater recharge however it is the hydrological models which must ascertain the aquifer s response toward climate change as it is discussed in the following section 3 2 groundwater level simulation following the verification of the climatic data set multifold combinations of inputs were considered to train the hydrological models in order to attain the best results table 4 shows 16 inputs derived from three main climate variables i e precipitation minimum temperature and maximum temperature by averaging summating and giving time lags to them the best results achieved considering all these 16 variables as the inputs for all hydrological models anns were not trained altogether using the climatic variables as inputs and regarding different training algorithms as it is depicted in fig 5 for w1 in which r 0 34 for the test data unlike the output layer which was the groundwater level in an observation well different number of neurons was selected in the input and hidden layers among the variables in table 4 different inputs from one variable to all 16 ones were considered plus from 1 to 48 neurons were considered for the hidden layer more than 48 neurons in the hidden layer did not produce the optimum results in regard to fig 5 a number of 16 and 48 neurons was considered in the input and hidden layers respectively as to table 4 the br algorithm was used because the iteration number was not sufficient in reference to the lm algorithm in order for the network to be trained the weights of the network were determined using the algorithm of gradient descent indeed the network had at most 20 iterations for the lm algorithm for which it trespasses the minimum permitted gradient however it permitted even 1000 iterations for the br algorithm nevertheless this model was disregarded so that modeling was not conducted by it the meta heuristic approaches of aig svr and wsvr were auspiciously trained utilizing the lm training algorithm as respects the statistical criteria of the training and test data sets figs 6 and 7 table 5 the statistical index r2 is 0 9997 for wsvr and 0 9985 for aig svr as to all observation data for all inclusive observation wells fig 6 the simulated data are entirely correspondent with the observation data for both models respecting all observation wells including observation well w1 as illustrated in fig 7 as to the average of all wells for the training data set the statistical indices are r 0 991 r2 0 982 mae 0 269 m and nse 0 976 for wsvr and r 0 986 r2 0 972 mae 0 298 m and nse 0 968 for aig svr table 5 on the other hand r 0 995 r2 0 989 mae 0 249 m and nse 0 982 for wsvr and r 0 991 r2 0 982 mae 0 275 m and nse 0 974 for aig svr with respect to the average of all wells for the test data set table 5 succinctly wsvr exhibits higher proficiency than aig svr for the simulation of groundwater in the pali aquifer thence narx network was applied which presented high ability in simulating the groundwater level with r 0 95 apropos of the test data set for w1 fig 8 comparable to the anns the training algorithm of br revealed greater capability than lm it may be speculated that this model is capable of simulating groundwater level with high competence however the difficulty is that narx considers the output of the previous time step as the input of the current time step even though this may be an accomplishment it is rather a downside in the long term predictions of climate change as a matter of fact the outputs are not accessible for the previous time steps to run the model for the future scenarios such that this is perhaps the greatest uncertainty of the model it may be conjectured that using a time series e g the observation groundwater level data as the hypothetical output data for the future simulation may resolve the issue however respecting different time series for this purpose engendered different model s outputs consequently narx is not reliable for long term groundwater level simulations as illustrated in fig 9 in which the observation data and the outputs of wsvr which is now the best model were taken into consideration and different results were obtained accordingly the meta heuristic approaches i e aig svr and wsvr perform better than ann and narx revealing the best results even better than aig svr based on the statistical criteria wsvr was chosen as the best model in contemplation of simulating the aquifer s response toward climate change as presented in tables 6 and 7 and fig 10 for the observation wells in different time periods under both emission scenarios moreover various wavelets exist including haar daubechies symlet gaussian morlet and mexican hat among which the mexican hat as the second derivative of the gaussian function showed the least error and therefore it was taken into consideration herein according to the simulation groundwater level is higher in the base time span than the future time period likewise it declines further in the future time period 2041 2060 than 2021 2040 fig 10 furthermore no interpretative fluctuation in groundwater level is observed for the observation wells as to the emission scenarios in the future time period fig 10 regarding the observation well w1 the highest groundwater level is related to the base time period and the lowest change in groundwater level would occur in the near future i e 2021 2040 under the intermediate i e ssp245 emission scenario the greatest reduction of the groundwater level is expected to occur in the far future i e 2041 2060 under ssp245 the groundwater level difference between the two future time periods under ssp245 scenario is rather big regarding the extreme emission scenario i e ssp585 in both near and far future there is not much different in groundwater level and it is lower than the base time period the largest and lowest difference in groundwater level between the future and base time periods considering both scenarios is associated with may and december respectively similar to w1 as regards well w2 the highest groundwater level is appertained to the base period the lowest difference in groundwater level in the future period in contrast to the base period is pertinent to the time period 2021 2040 under ssp245 which like the base period has a clear difference with the time period 2041 2060 under the same emission scenario comparable with w1 under the extreme scenario the groundwater level difference in both future periods is trivial and the lowest groundwater level is related to 2041 2060 the wells w3 and w4 are in the vicinity of each other and groundwater level trend in these wells is similar in the base and future periods under both scenarios in both wells the highest groundwater level is observed in the base period furthermore the lowest and highest decrease in groundwater level is predicted to occur in 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 respectively under the intermediate scenario considering the extreme scenario groundwater level in both wells is lower in 2041 2060 than 2021 2040 the highest and lowest difference of groundwater level between the future and base periods are observed in april and december respectively for w3 and in may and december respectively for w4 vis à vis the observation well w5 the groundwater level in the base time period is higher during the early months of the year and lower during the other months of the year in comparison with the future time period under ssp585 groundwater level in the future period under the intermediate scenario is lower than the future period under the extreme scenario it is lower in 2041 2060 than 2021 2040 under both scenarios the biggest difference of groundwater level in the future period contrasted to the base period is for the month of april in 2041 2060 under ssp245 the difference in groundwater level of this well in different months of the year is evident which is maybe due to the fact that this well is located in the elevated portion or the recharge area of the aquifer where vertical groundwater flow is probable the curves for the wells w6 and w7 are analogous in both wells the highest and lowest level of groundwater corresponds to the base time period and the future time period 2041 2060 under the extreme scenario respectively the biggest difference of the groundwater level in the future period versus the base period is related to may in 2041 2060 under the extreme scenario for both wells moreover groundwater level is lower in 2041 2060 than 2021 2040 under both scenarios for both wells in view of the observation well w8 the highest groundwater level is correlated to the base period and groundwater level would decrease in both future time periods under both scenarios compared to the base period the largest drop of groundwater level would happen in 2041 2060 under both scenarios in the early months of the year from january to july groundwater level would decrease even more in 2041 2060 than 2021 2040 under both emission scenarios in the time period 2021 2040 groundwater level is lower under ssp585 than ssp245 however groundwater level does not change significantly in 2041 2060 under both scenarios the annual groundwater level as the average of all wells is 431 6 m for the base time period 426 2 m for the future time period 2021 2040 under ssp245 420 7 m for the future time period 2041 2060 under ssp245 424 6 m for the future time period 2021 2040 under ssp585 and 423 m for the future time period 2041 2060 under ssp585 as regards the seasonal fluctuations based on the average of all wells the hydraulic head is in the lowest and highest position in the fall and spring respectively in view of each time period and emission scenario with the exception of ssp245 emission scenario in 2041 2060 in which water table ranges from 420 5 to 421 m moreover most plunges in groundwater level would occur in spring which is the season with the highest groundwater level in the future time period under both emission scenarios minimal changes in water table may be apropos of fall with an exception of ssp245 emission scenario in 2021 2040 during which the lowest groundwater level would happen in winter with 4 2 m decline however the decrease in groundwater level is 4 6 m in fall for this emission scenario and time period depicting minute differences table 7 in respect of monthly variations the highest and lowest hydraulic head is in may and december respectively for each time span and emission scenario table 6 ultimately the groundwater level of the observation wells was interpolated and the spatial distribution of the variable was illustrated fig 11 the recharge and discharge zones of the aquifer are virtually analogous for each time period and emission scenario such that groundwater flow direction is from the eastern and northwestern toward the southwestern portion of the aquifer comparable to the topographical elevation of the study area shown in fig 1 as represented in fig 11 the highest and lowest values of water table throughout the aquifer are 514 9 and 387 5 m in the base time period 512 9 and 384 6 m in 2021 2040 under ssp245 506 9 and 380 2 m in 2041 2060 under ssp245 506 4 and 384 1 m in 2021 2040 under ssp585 and 504 9 and 381 3 m in 2041 2060 under ssp585 all respectively hence it may be concluded that groundwater level declines from the base time period to the future time period 2021 2040 and finally to the future time period 2041 2060 in light of the emission scenarios this declination is more for ssp585 than ssp245 4 discussion in the present research cmip6 emission scenarios i e ssp245 and ssp585 for eight climatic models were extracted from the worldclim data set in the lali region in order to model the pali aquifer using ai non numerical approaches in the base 1970 2000 and future 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 time periods the precipitation and temperature values have been estimated to be higher for the region in the present study based on cmip6 than in the research carried out by nassery et al 2021b based on cmip5 outputs as in accordance with the research conducted in the yangtze river basin in china in which precipitation was accentuated to increase li et al 2021 and the study carried out in iran in which it was underlined that cmip6 models project more precipitation than cmip5 gcms zamani et al 2020 according to the statistical criteria for both the training data set 80 of the data selected randomly by model and the testing data set 20 of the data selected randomly by model table 5 wsvr as the selected hydrological approach in the current study has modeled the aquifer favorably considering the average of all observation wells in the time period 2007 2018 in the current study the average decline in the piezometric head of all observation wells were predicted to be 5 4 and 10 9 m in 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 time periods respectively under ssp245 and 7 and 8 6 m in 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 time periods respectively under ssp585 on the other hand regarding nassery et al 2021b the numerical model i e modflow was capable of modeling the pali aquifer response to climate change for which no significant changes in groundwater level were predicted over the model domain in an annual time scale in the future time period these differences in the response of the aquifer toward climate change are related to different climate data sets and hydrological modeling approaches being used in fact the statistical criteria are of great efficacies for both numerical and non numerical approaches so that the differences may primarily be related to the climate data sets with dissimilar emission scenarios rather than hydrological models based on the worldclim data set employed in this research a warmer future with more precipitation was forecasted in comparison with the nex gddp and marksim data set assessed by zeydalinejad et al 2021 due to further evapotranspiration rate warmer scenario may induce more depletion in the aquifer than increased precipitation recharge as to replenishment these interpretations have been put on the survey considering the fact that no human influences are presently affecting the aquifer in terms of the hydrological modeling as in accordance with the current study in which wsvr presented the highest efficacy in comparison with anns narx and aig svr models wsvr had the best performance among bwo svr wsvr and aig svr in the groundwater level forecasting in the analysis conducted by dehghani et al 2022 moreover yu et al 2018 used wann and wsvr for groundwater depth simulation in the northwestern portion of china and avowed that not only do these models have better performance than ann and svr but wsvr also perform better than wann also wsvr produced the best results in an attempt to simulate the groundwater depth in visakhapatnam in india compared to ann svr and arima suryanarayana et al 2014 this study proved the disability of narx in the simulation of the response of the aquifer toward climate change as the study conducted by guzman et al 2018 therein narx and svr were compared in the simulation of daily groundwater level in the southeastern usa and svr was highlighted as the better model however the results of the current study are not in agreement with ghazi et al 2022 in which narx showed the highest efficiency in groundwater modeling in comparison with other models i e arima and anfis furthermore jeihouni et al 2019b compared lssvm anfis and narx to predict the groundwater level in shabestar palin iran under climate change and selected the hybrid technique of w narx as the best method as a final point the groundwater related climate change studies have their own limitations firstly emission scenarios are one of the sources of uncertainty in each report the ipcc takes into consideration updated emission scenarios the latest of them are ssps which as previously mentioned are divided into four scenarios i e ssp126 ssp245 ssp370 ssp585 ergo not only do various emission series exist but each of which also includes a range of projections depending on which emission scenario is regarded different outputs may be achieved in this study the newest scenarios more specifically the medium and maximum ones i e the ssp245 and ssp585 were employed which are vitally important in hydrological projections and policy perspectives secondly each gcm may project the climate of a specific region dissimilarly even by considering a similar emission scenario hence an average of eight gcms were considered herein thirdly the drawbacks of hydrological models in simulating of an aquifer must be perceived different hydrological models including numerical and non numerical ones have their own specific advantages and disadvantages as it was deeply delved into by zeydalinejad 2022 four state of the art non numerical models were regarded in this context among which the best model was selected in order to decline this uncertainty among the limitations of the non numerical approaches used in the current study is that they are black box models and do not represent the hydrodynamic responses of the aquifer they use the climate data as the input and simulate the groundwater level as the output based on the weights and non linear relationships which have been determined between the inputs and outputs during the training the models were attempted to be trained based on the trial and error approach which was difficult and time consuming non numerical approaches have been frequently applied to predict short term responses of the groundwater systems however they were employed to simulate long term groundwater levels in this study it is assumed that the acquired relationships do not change in the future when longer and more accurate data may be accessible one of the difficulties with most aquifers in iran is data scarcity the pali aquifer also has this drawback including climatic hydrological and hydrogeological data paucity surface water data does not exist or include many data gaps the data related to the hydrodynamic properties of the aquifer are not sufficient and highly reliable groundwater level data are monthly and exist since 2007 as a matter of fact if longer groundwater level time series had existed the relationship between the inputs and outputs may have been more accurate so that even other approaches like conventional anns may have been able to simulate the aquifer in the current study wsvr was able to propitiously simulate the groundwater level just based on precipitation and temperature variables therefore there are relationships between these climate variables and groundwater levels and these non linear relationships were determined by the employed non numerical model after being trained the average of monthly temperature precipitation and groundwater level in the studied area for the observation time period i e 2007 2018 demonstrates that groundwater level increases by increasing precipitation and decreasing temperature and vice versa after a time lag fig 12 therefore the climate variables of the previous months were also taken into consideration for training the models which their best performance was for a 2 month time lag table 4 there is no pumping well in the pali aquifer therefore it is mainly the climate change that influences the groundwater level fluctuations hence by using the climatic variables i e precipitation and temperature there was possibility for the models to be accurately trained as aforementioned even these variables are not available in the study area for the considered time periods and they were attained using the global predownscaled climate data set on the topic of the acquired results it may be mentioned that since the model was trained based on temperature and precipitation the outputs of the model strongly depend on these climatic variables temperature was projected to be higher in the future time period than the base time period and this increment is even more in 2041 2060 than 2021 2040 moreover temperature s increment is more under ssp585 than ssp245 therefore it may be expected that groundwater level decreases in the future time period especially in 2041 2060 and under ssp585 however for some wells this assumption is not true fig 10 and that is because of precipitation and the relationships developed by the selected model precipitation is greater in the future time period than the base time period with the exception of the emission scenario ssp585 in 2041 2060 furthermore the calculated reationships are certainly not linear and therefore a specific result that a modeler may speculate may not be expected to be true 5 conclusions and recommendations even though climate change is declining the groundwater level in iran s aquifers few studies have evaluated its effects on groundwater systems one reason is data scarcity so that enough and accurate observations do not exist to conduct groundwater related climate change studies in the country however in the current study we showed how to overcome to this difficulty and modeled the response of an aquifer toward climate change even though long term climatic variables are not accessible for the pali aquifer we promisingly simulated its groundwater level under climate change using a global predownscaled climate data set i e worldclim this data set has rarely been considered in groundwater studies however it was found that it is of high accuracy for a small scale region to be utilized as a tool for groundwater related climate change studies taking into consideration that downscaling of the climate data for a specific region is demanding and time consuming zeydalinejad et al 2021 predownscaled climate data sets may be employed in the hydrological studies though after verification regarding the observations of a specific locality on the other hand we compared four cutting edge non numerical approaches herein viz ann narx aig svr and wsvr which have not previously been compared in the simulation of a specific groundwater system in order to simulate the groundwater level in the aquifer by only considering the climate variables as inputs in truth as a promising downscaled climatic data set worldclim may be used in climate change impact studies precipitation declines in the lali region in 2041 2060 compared to 2021 2040 under both emission scenarios and its lowest amount occurs in the future time period 2041 2060 under ssp585 being zero in summer precipitation mostly belongs to winter and then fall in addition it is the winter precipitation that mainly decreases in the future time period except for the time period 2021 2040 under ssp585 on the other hand precipitation shows the most increment in fall in the future time period considering both scenarios the lowest variations in precipitation are also related to spring the minimum and maximum temperatures show an increasing trend in the future time period especially in 2041 2060 and under ssp585 emission scenario most augmentation in temperature is related to the summer and least increase in it is in reference to spring and thence winter while the coldest month is january the peak of minimum and maximum temperatures corresponds to july anns were not able to simulate the groundwater level whatsoever using the climatic variables as the input even though narx had high efficacy in simulating the groundwater level with r 0 95 for the test data set it considers the output of the previous time step as the input of each time step and hence it was not able to simulate the groundwater level in this long term groundwater related climate change impact study it is proposed to consider narx hydrological model more meticulously in climate change impact studies on groundwater in which long simulations are taken into regard on the other hand meta heuristic ai approaches were capable of simulating groundwater level in the pali aquifer with high accuracy only by using a combination of climatic variables as the network s input among the meta heuristic algorithms wsvr showed better performance considering the statistical criteria and hence it was chosen as the model to simulate the aquifer s response toward climate change the annual groundwater level declines further from the base time period 1970 2000 to the future time period 2021 2040 and to the future time period 2041 2060 regarding the emission scenarios this declination would be more as regards the ssp585 emission scenario than the ssp245 emission scenario as the average of all wells the seasonal fluctuations almost show that the groundwater level is in its lowest position in the fall and in its highest place in spring considering the time periods and emission scenarios all in all considering the time periods and emission scenarios most decrement in groundwater level under potential climate change would occur in spring which is the season with the highest groundwater level in the region on the other hand the least variations in groundwater level would occur in fall lastly considering all time periods and emission scenarios the highest and the lowest groundwater level would be in may and december respectively in regard to the scope of future research it is recommended to evaluate the global predownscaled climate data sets for other localities and utilize them more frequently in hydrological studies as a way to address the data scarcity and the difficulty with climate data downscaling various data sets may be evaluated and the best one may be selected for a specific region additionally other emission scenarios may be regarded to discern the groundwater level in the future furthermore a variety of hydrological models exist that may be used to appraise an aquifer response toward stresses like climate change which may be used to have a better understanding of the system anyway the application of non numerical approaches is surpassing the numerical models in groundwater related studies zeydalinejad 2022 and they are continuously updated or new procedures of them are introduced therefore considering an ensemble of models is highly suggested as in this research it is proposed to use the meta heuristic approaches e g wsvr and aig svr in the hard rock aquifers to appraise their capabilities in dissimilar groundwater systems hard rock aquifers are complex heterogeneous and anisotropic to be modeled by numerical models and in most cases different approaches have been employed to simulate them zeydalinejad 2022 taking into account their potential disparate surface and subsurface characteristic nassery et al 2021a the groundwater level in the pali aquifer declines in the future despite the fact that this decline is solely induced by climate and no human induced depletion occurs in the aquifer ergo the adaptaion strategies must be considered in regard to the aquifer in order to manage it sustainably some of these strategies have been represented in the study conducted by zeydalinejad and nassery 2022 therein the climate induced depletion of iran s aquifers was accentuated as a final point in the current study only temperature and precipitation were employed to train the model however other climatic and hydrological variables may be available in the future by putting more emphasis on gathering data by the related authorities such that a specific model may be trained more accurately by utilizing more variables as the inputs funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors declaration of competing

11722,nitrate no3 is one of the most important contaminants of subterranean aquifers and has been stated as a worldwide concern as available systems in iran have failed to examine and control the quality of groundwater resources the effective quality management of aquifers in the country is faced with many challenges in this study we implement management scenarios to predict the concentrations of no3 introduction in the case study region firstly no3 was established as the main contaminant in the andimeshk plain area of interest then the quantitative model of no3 contamination of the plain using pmwin software was prepared and finally the temporal and spatial changes in the plain were investigated our findings showed that by reducing no3 by around 25 and 50 in the agricultural zones no3 concentration drops about 2 11 and 11 87 mg l per month respectively moreover the results of our study indicated that at a 50 no3 decrease the minimum and maximum concentrations of no3 in andimeshk plain will be 9 48 and 38 51 mg l respectively well below the actual concentrations 73 69 mg l overall we suggest that the methodology developed in this work can act as a primary step for the implementation of active no3 reduction scenarios graphical abstract image 1 keywords andimeshk groundwater quality management nitrate contamination model scenarios pmwin data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction in many countries groundwater gw is utilized as the main source of water supply for drinking agricultural and industrial purposes it is estimated that one third of the world s population depends on gw aquifers for their drinking water supply jalali 2010 li et al 2021 carrard et al 2019 however in recent years the remarkable increase in population irregular withdrawal of aquifers and excessive application of fertilizers herbicides and pesticides to enhance agricultural products and meet the increasing human demand have put gw at risk these underlying factors combined with the absence of appropriate disposal systems of wastewaters and infiltration of agricultural wastewaters into aquifers have caused these essential resources to be faced with the crisis of quality degradation and the risk of contamination rahman 2008 sinan and razack 2008 tilahun and merkel 2009 islam et al 2021 among the most common contaminants in subterranean drinking water supplies are excessive amounts of nitrate no3 is one of the most important extensive and challenging contaminants of aquifers such that it has become a real concern all over the world goulding 2006 mclay et al 2001 power and nagy 1999 torres martínez et al 2020 in general the constant heavy use of nitrogen fertilizers in agricultural areas causes a rise in no3 in gw kwon et al 2021 kaown et al 2009 when the amount of n fertilizer applied on agricultural land exceeds the rate needed by the plant or the denitrifying capacity of the soil the fertilizer percolates through the soil into gw and its subsequent contamination is unavoidable bhagat et al 2021 kumar et al 2009 numerous adverse effects and hazards are attributed to the presence of no3 in drinking water such as methemoglobinemia in infants the formation of cancer causing nitrosamines and an increase in gastric and oesophageal cancers zhang et al 2003 huan et al 2020 he et al 2021 the maximum amounts of nitrate and nitrite in drinking water are suggested to be 45 mg l 10 mg l in terms of nitrogen and 3 3 mg l 1 mg l in terms of nitrogen respectively pontius 2003 the major components of quality management of water resources can be investigated from 3 perspectives prevention monitoring and control the prevention phase is an attempt to carry out all measures to prevent the contamination potential and a decrease in the quality of water resources by measuring the effects on the environment managing the land use conducting establishment of uses and others the monitoring phase consists of all plans and activities that are accomplished to measure the quality of water and examine the procedure of quality changes in water resources in different periods the control phase includes administrative measures that are conducted to prevent contamination of water resources as a result of activities of contaminating centers the available control systems such as sump pumping wellpoint systems siphon draining and deep well systems in iran have failed to examine and manage the quality of gw resources and the concerns of deteriorating water quality are increasing cashman and preene 2001 besides over the last years the status of iran s aquifers in terms of water quality has not been explored therefore this failure to manage the quality of the country s aquifers has caused the main resource of human s most important need to experience a huge crisis and consumer uncertainty zendehbad et al 2019 mathematical models are useful tools to identify the system and choose different management options for large scale environmental issues such as gw contamination they can be employed to prevent the problems in a way that by evaluating the various parameters involved the reactions of the aquifers can be observed in most regions of the world mathematical models are nowadays utilized to identify the method and simulation of fluctuations in the water tables and the movement of contamination in aquifers the pmwin processing modflow for windows www pmwin net software is one of the practical models for stimulating gw flow and movement of contamination in aquifers this model works based on modflow modular three dimensional finite difference ground water flow model and mt3d codes as a three dimensional finite difference model to explore and predict the flow behaviors in gw resources and also the movement of contamination through the aquifer sabzzadeh and shourian 2020 chiang and kinzelbach 1998 similar research based on the modflow model has been conducted in the modeling field using pmwin software lalehzari et al carried out research in 2009 using pmwin software to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients of an aquifer the findings reveal that the specific efficiency ranges from 0 03 to 0 08 and the hydraulic conductivity ranges from 2 to 16 m per day the responsiveness of the model to a given yield is greater than the responsiveness to hydraulic conductivity a difference of 0 45 and 0 61 was found between the water level forecasted by the model for may and june 2017 and the actual readings of the water level on the piezometers lalehzari et al 2010 in 2013 lalehzari et al did different research on the modeling of nitrate transport in groundwater flow the findings demonstrate the viability of the devised model for simulating flow route and nitrate transfer in saturated porous media nitrate concentrations are greatest in and around bahram abad village in a complex system the quality of groundwater in the area is impacted by several sources of contamination including urban wastewater and agricultural land runoff lalehzari et al 2013 from the abovementioned features it can be deduced that continuous management of gw resources through modeling can provide valuable data in terms of water resources management and sustainable development considering the ease of a rigorous model the value of the output data and the need to control the gw quality in iran the present study aimed at examining and adopting the necessary strategies to manage the country s aquifers in so doing the andimeshk plain was selected as a case study and the quantitative model for its no3 contamination was developed using the pmwin software through this application the spatial and temporal status of no3 was investigated offering insights into the actual and expected nitrate concentrations throughout the year besides the prediction of the no3 concentration reduction allows for evaluating the proposed strategies and further promoting their implementation for the alleviation of gw contamination in large geographical areas it is crucial to look at scenarios of lowering agricultural products and activities since the investigated region is mostly engaged in agricultural activities and because the percentage of nitrates entering the groundwater through urban and industrial areas is low the primary sources of nitrates in subterranean water according to scientific sources are frequently chemical and animal fertilizers and some businesses which is a clear justification for the job being done therefore using the program pmwin based on the modflow model this work aimed to simulate and predict changes in nitrate content in subsurface water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study region and data collection the andimeshk plain is located northwest of the khuzestan province within the range of andimeshk town it has an area of 305 km2 the main river in this plain is called balaroud river br which originates from mangareh and takht e golzar mountains then crosses the town of hosseiniyeh afterward leads toward andimeshk and passes towards its west and finally joins dez river dr after gaining water from both western and eastern regions fig 1 indicates the geographical location of the andimeshk plain according to the geological studies available regional alluvial sediments have been deposited as a result of the water erosion of different generators especially aghajari and bakhtiari generators and their re sedimentation every month for a year groundwater samples were taken twelve sampling events one sample was taken and delivered to an approved facility where the output variable the no3 concentration was measured the samples were taken on average 250 m below the earth s surface every sample was taken and labeled with its name and code in a polythene container that had already been washed and sterilized all samples were collected each month kept refrigerated and then evaluated for nitrate following the american public health association s standard procedures the amount of nitrate was measured using a portable multi parameter calorimeter model number dr 890 rehman et al 2020 in the andimeshk plain gw contaminants have various origins and points of entry into the water resources more specifically the contamination sources present in the region can be classified into 3 main groups a urban and rural sources these include the direct entrance of sewage systems animals wastes and or liquids into gw collecting and disposing of wastewater in andimeshk town which currently lacks a modern sanitation network is carried out through absorption wells and open canals the collected wastewater is transported out of the city through open collecting canals or pipelines and is disposed of in the balaroud river without treatment b agricultural sources these flows include waters returning from agricultural uses animal and chemical fertilizers pesticides and contamination resulting from livestock activities c industrial sources these include direct or indirect penetration of solids and liquids produced by industrial centers and mining activities in the region under investigation there is an industrial town a slaughterhouse some crusher factories and an impact crusher whose wastewater directly enters the balaroud river the amount of fixed nitrogen released into the atmosphere from land has grown due to human activity however the amount of these releases has nearly doubled worldwide with certain places experiencing far bigger rises by 2030 this fixed nitrogen flow is predicted to double once again excessive fixed nitrogen intake is associated with a number of environmental issues such as changes in species diversity groundwater quality deterioration nutrient enrichment of the aquatic environment and forests reduction nakagawa et al 2013 therefore it is also important to take into account the possibility that rain induced nitrate absorption into underground water sources might raise the nitrate content of water sources but this study excludes access to meteorological data making it impossible to assess nitrate intake through the atmosphere to underground water sources 2 2 nitrate modeling in groundwater model parameters and setup in order to conduct the study firstly the hydrogeological data of the aquifer including the observation wells drill logs geo electric sections water resources and others were collected likewise the depth of the bedrock on the western edge of the andimeshk plain varies between 30 and 200 m the trend and amount of the curves with the same depth of bedrock in the south and northwest of the plain follow the region s topography the minimum depth of bedrock was observed on the edge of the northwest and west mountains of the region and the maximum depth was in the center of the plain and the riverside of balaroud with a depth of 200 m on the eastern regions of the balaroud river the thickness of the aquifers increases from north to south and its thickness reaches about 15 m at the northeast of the plain and about 85 m on the dez riverside in the next phase the aquifer characteristics including transmissibility t and storage coefficient s were calculated based on pumping tests performed in the region accordingly transmissibility in the north of the region varies between 200 and 300 around dokouheh between 400 and 600 in the central part of the plain between 800 and 1200 and the south and southeast of the region up to around 4000 m2 per day moreover further hydrogeological studies of the plain were carried out including the preparation of the water resources map unit hydrograph and others and were utilized in preparing the quantitative model of the plain following to prepare the contamination model of the andimeshk plain first the contaminating centers of the plain such as waste disposal centers entrance centers of urban wastewater into the river agricultural lands and urban and rural centers were identified on a 1 25000 map drinking and agricultural wells were also marked on the map then by taking into account the contaminating centers and the gw flow direction 22 points with appropriate distribution all over the plain including exploitation wells and surface water bodies dez river and balaroud were identified and sampling was carried out see fig 1 specifically the sampling campaign was carried out in 12 periods from july 2014 to june 2015 to find the biggest contaminants of the gw aquifer nitrate vide infra finally from the aforementioned data the spatiotemporal profile of nitrate was generated in order to analyze the dispersion of no3 changes all over the plain the kriging method was used in arcgis 10 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrate measurement data in andimeshk plain nitrate was the most prevalent pollutant of gw resources in the andimeshk plain according to the studies of the 12 sample periods carried out between july 2014 and june 2015 the most significant nonorganic pollutant to demonstrate water pollution due to human activity and a solution incentive is the no3 it may pass through the unsaturated zone and has a lower liquidity absorption feature than other organic chemical and nonorganic pollutants it can also be somewhat removed by methods of chemical analysis and surface adsorption therefore no3 is hereby the contamination index parameter in qualitative modeling the simulated model of no3 contamination was employed to examine the spatial and temporal no3 changes when the cropping pattern of the region changes as presented in the graph representing the no3 of the region from july 2014 to june 2015 see fig 2 no3 concentration is low in dry seasons and increases with the beginning of the wet seasons due to the precipitation which causes no3 leaching from surface layers into deeper ones therefore the amount of no3 rises in fig 3 no3 concentration is examined in selected points according to this figure the average no3 concentration in most samples except for samples of zibashahr north of ghal e lour and agricultural lands located east of ghal e lour is less than 45 mg l fig 4 indicates the zonation map of no3 changes according to no3 changes in march 2015 as indicated by the interpolation results of this figure the minimum and maximum amounts of no3 exist on the dez riverside and its entrance boundaries at the north of the plain and the center of the plain s5 s6 respectively sample 5 s5 and samples 6 and 9 s6 s9 have the highest concentration respectively as a result of residential centers and agricultural lands utilizing pesticides and fertilizers commonly applied on agricultural lands the average nitrate concentration obtained in 2014 was equal to 22 74 mg l while in 2015 it was equal to 26 5 mg l which indicates its decrease 3 2 quantitative and qualitative model in order to simulate the quantitative flow and qualitative no3 contamination models for the andimeshk plain pmwin 5 3 and models of modflow and mt3d were utilized therefore the aquifer scope of andimeshk plain was zoned into 90 columns and 73 rows of block center type with equal column and row intervals 300 m which formed 6570 cells the quantitative model flow was carried out for a transient 18 month period from october 2013 to march 2015 after it was put into operation the flow model was evaluated both manually and automatically and the hydrodynamic and bedrock coefficients were measured afterward the no3 contamination model was carried out over 9 months from july 2014 to march 2015 one of the most important input parameters of the no3 contamination model in andimeshk plain is nitrate recharge which cannot usually be measured exactly according to the amount of n fertilizers in agricultural zones and the amount of wastewater entering gw sources in residential and industrial regions the recharge rate is estimated and inserted into the model the first and the most important no3 recharge source in the andimeshk plain is the returned water resulting from agricultural activities because in plains with agricultural activities the application of phosphate nitrogen and urea fertilizers as well as animal fertilizers leads to an increase in no3 concentration in intrusive waters the second important cause of the no3 increase in water resources of the plain can be attributed to urban and industrial wastewaters which can vividly be observed in central parts of the plain and around the residential region of zibashahr around the residential regions of zibashahr due to the presence of agricultural lands no3 recharge has two sources of urban wastewaters and agricultural returned water therefore the amount of no3 in gw resources of this region is higher than in other parts of the plain moreover water from precipitation can play an important role in increasing no3 in the water resources of the plain by carrying dissolving and transmitting nitrate from contaminated regions to water resources considering all these conditions no3 contamination of andimeshk plain was carried out and no3 recharge factors longitudinal distribution and effective porosity were evaluated 3 3 quality management in regions where agricultural activities take place no3 contaminates gw resources mostly through the flow of returned waters of agricultural uses or animal and chemical fertilizers a plethora of studies have reported the effect of agricultural activities on the nitrification of gw water resources behera and panda 2009 chen et al 2004 dahan et al 2014 esmaeili et al 2014 kraft and stites 2003 mahvi et al 2005 torres martínez et al 2021 the levels of contamination have also been made known for example in a previous study the no3 concentration in gw was 20 mg l before irrigation of the agricultural lands while the value was reported to increase up to 65 mg l after irrigation because n fertilizer was applied idriss et al 2021 consequently in the andimeshk plain no3 contaminated regions overlap agricultural lands therefore simulation of the no3 contamination model was employed to manage and reduce this contaminant and the corresponding risk there are some methods to reduce no3 leaching including a using crops with high nitrogen consumption efficiency during the cultivation period and b adopting a fertilization strategy in which fertilizer application is synchronized to meet the needs of the crop via separate application or using slow release n fertilizers c employing effective irrigation and water management strategies to minimize water loss and maximize the efficiency of the crop s water use d adopting a comprehensive approach that includes proper water and fertilizer management and crops with high n use efficiency and e trying to avoid intensive agriculture in fragile lands with high n leaching potential kühling et al 2020 we propose that if we change the cropping patterns in the plain crops that need less chemical fertilizer are planted with the planting of winter wheat while avoiding planting vegetables is practiced gutiérrez et al 2018 then the amount of no3 recharge will decrease therefore the amount of no3 recharge that takes place in the simulated no3 contamination model in agricultural zones will drop up to 25 and 50 fig 5 shows the no3 concentration graph during the tension periods when a 25 reduction of no3 recharge is applied and compares it with the real conditions the meaning of tension was in the andimeshk aquifer the balance of groundwater includes qanats qanats streams precipitation and groundwater hydraulic bounds don t factor in evapotranspiration due to a high water table as well as recharging from drainage and rivers no flow according to this figure on average no3 concentration decreases by 2 1 mg l per month according to fig 6 which demonstrates the changes in no3 amounts in the observed wells for the 8th tension period february 2015 in normal and 25 decrease in no3 recharge conditions the highest rate of reduction in no3 was observed in s5 about 18 mg l which was affected by the contamination of both agricultural lands and urban and industrial wastewaters fig 7 indicates the iso nitrate lines with the same no3 concentration in normal and a 25 decrease in no3 recharge conditions in the last period of tension march 2015 as indicated in this figure no3 concentration in the plain has existed within the critical range and around s5 the lines with the same concentration of 50 and 55 mg l available in real conditions are removed following fig 8 presents the no3 concentration graph over the tension periods in the conditions of a 50 reduction in no3 recharge and compares it with real conditions according to this figure on average the no3 concentration decreases by 11 87 mg l per month fig 9 indicates the changes in no3 amounts in the observed wells in the 8th period of tension february 2015 in normal conditions and the condition of a 50 reduction in no3 recharge according to this graph the maximum decrease in no3 was related to the sample retrieved from zibashahr about 38 6 mg l which is contaminated by both agricultural lands and urban and industrial wastewaters finally fig 10 presents the zonation of the same n concentration in the condition of a 50 reduction in no3 recharge in the last period of tension march 2015 as indicated in this figure the minimum and maximum no3 concentrations in andimeshk plain are respectively 9 48 and 39 51 mg l but more importantly it is observed that the gw resources of the andimeshk plain are estimated to be contamination free and will no more be in the critical range this variation of nitrate readings may be caused by the fact that the quality of water in a specific site relies on both the quality of water inflowing from a long distance as well as the agricultural and urban usage of the region directly overlaying the location it is crucial to remember that groundwater recharge in a riparian floodplain is the result of water entering or exfiltrating across the groundwater surface water interface vertical infiltration and groundwater absorption which in this study is sensitive to scenario variations therefore the balancing reaction of groundwater surface water exchange fluxes is responsible for the fact that the overall groundwater recharge changes relatively slightly even though the vertical penetration fluctuates greatly as stated when groundwater levels are changing owing to vertical infiltration or absorption for example due to scenario changes and the surface water levels are steady an alteration of exchange fluxes between the riparian groundwater and the river may frequently be seen vertical recharge induced pressure head variations are balanced out by lateral exchange fluxes at the groundwater surface water interface ehteshami and sharifi 2017 kessasra et al 2017 smaoui et al 2012 4 conclusions in our study the sampling campaigns permitted setting up the boundary conditions and investigation of the primary source of contamination for a representative mixed use region in iran the most important contaminant of gw resources in andimeshk plain is nitrate which is mostly produced by leaching no3 from existing chemical and animal fertilizers in the returned water of agricultural lands investigating the temporal changes in no3 in andimeshk plain indicates that no3 concentration in gw resources is higher in wet seasons due to the leaching process of no3 therefore to manage and reduce the amount of this contaminant in andimeshk plain the quantitative and qualitative no3 model was simulated in pmwin 5 3 software and temporal and spatial changes in no3 were investigated by carrying out 2 scenarios given the change in cropping pattern which reduces the use of chemical fertilizers in the first scenario we suggest that if the n feed is reduced by 25 from chemical fertilizers this will positively impact on average with a 2 11 mg l no3 reduction in gw resources per month the highest no3 reduction will then be observed in the sample of zibashahr whose agricultural lands are under the effect of no3 leaching and urban wastewaters more importantly this scenario indicates that the no3 amount in the andimeshk plain will almost exit the critical range 45 mg l in the second proposed scenario where the no3 recharge amount decreases 50 in agricultural zones on average no3 concentration of gw resources is expected to drop by 11 87 mg l per month in general if the amount of no3 recharge in the plain halves the minimum and maximum no3 concentrations in andimeshk plain will be 9 48 and 39 51 mg l respectively it is also expected that if a 50 reduction is implemented then no no3 contamination will occur in the gw resources in the andimeshk plain beyond limits and the aquifers will not be characterized as in critical condition overall we suggest that the combination of a complete geological demographical physicochemical and modeling study can predict accurately the patterns of nitrate contamination this methodology could be transferred to different regions and possibly be extended to other macro contaminants e g nitrite cod or micro contaminants such as pfas antibiotics and other contaminants of emerging concern the study s findings are outlined in the following points nitrate is the most significant contaminant of gw resources in the andimeshk plain and it is mostly created when no3 from chemical and animal fertilizers is washed away in the runoff from agricultural regions the concentration of no3 in gw sources is greater in rainy seasons due to the no3 washing process as evidenced by research into the temporal variations of no3 in andimeshk plain in the first scenario we propose that a decrease of 25 in the nitrogen feed from chemical fertilizers will have a beneficial impact on average resulting in a monthly reduction of 2 11 mg l no3 in gw resources the mean no3 concentration of gw sources is anticipated to fall by 11 87 mg l per month in the second scenario which proposes a 50 reduction in no3 loading in agricultural regions declaration of competing interest

11722,nitrate no3 is one of the most important contaminants of subterranean aquifers and has been stated as a worldwide concern as available systems in iran have failed to examine and control the quality of groundwater resources the effective quality management of aquifers in the country is faced with many challenges in this study we implement management scenarios to predict the concentrations of no3 introduction in the case study region firstly no3 was established as the main contaminant in the andimeshk plain area of interest then the quantitative model of no3 contamination of the plain using pmwin software was prepared and finally the temporal and spatial changes in the plain were investigated our findings showed that by reducing no3 by around 25 and 50 in the agricultural zones no3 concentration drops about 2 11 and 11 87 mg l per month respectively moreover the results of our study indicated that at a 50 no3 decrease the minimum and maximum concentrations of no3 in andimeshk plain will be 9 48 and 38 51 mg l respectively well below the actual concentrations 73 69 mg l overall we suggest that the methodology developed in this work can act as a primary step for the implementation of active no3 reduction scenarios graphical abstract image 1 keywords andimeshk groundwater quality management nitrate contamination model scenarios pmwin data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction in many countries groundwater gw is utilized as the main source of water supply for drinking agricultural and industrial purposes it is estimated that one third of the world s population depends on gw aquifers for their drinking water supply jalali 2010 li et al 2021 carrard et al 2019 however in recent years the remarkable increase in population irregular withdrawal of aquifers and excessive application of fertilizers herbicides and pesticides to enhance agricultural products and meet the increasing human demand have put gw at risk these underlying factors combined with the absence of appropriate disposal systems of wastewaters and infiltration of agricultural wastewaters into aquifers have caused these essential resources to be faced with the crisis of quality degradation and the risk of contamination rahman 2008 sinan and razack 2008 tilahun and merkel 2009 islam et al 2021 among the most common contaminants in subterranean drinking water supplies are excessive amounts of nitrate no3 is one of the most important extensive and challenging contaminants of aquifers such that it has become a real concern all over the world goulding 2006 mclay et al 2001 power and nagy 1999 torres martínez et al 2020 in general the constant heavy use of nitrogen fertilizers in agricultural areas causes a rise in no3 in gw kwon et al 2021 kaown et al 2009 when the amount of n fertilizer applied on agricultural land exceeds the rate needed by the plant or the denitrifying capacity of the soil the fertilizer percolates through the soil into gw and its subsequent contamination is unavoidable bhagat et al 2021 kumar et al 2009 numerous adverse effects and hazards are attributed to the presence of no3 in drinking water such as methemoglobinemia in infants the formation of cancer causing nitrosamines and an increase in gastric and oesophageal cancers zhang et al 2003 huan et al 2020 he et al 2021 the maximum amounts of nitrate and nitrite in drinking water are suggested to be 45 mg l 10 mg l in terms of nitrogen and 3 3 mg l 1 mg l in terms of nitrogen respectively pontius 2003 the major components of quality management of water resources can be investigated from 3 perspectives prevention monitoring and control the prevention phase is an attempt to carry out all measures to prevent the contamination potential and a decrease in the quality of water resources by measuring the effects on the environment managing the land use conducting establishment of uses and others the monitoring phase consists of all plans and activities that are accomplished to measure the quality of water and examine the procedure of quality changes in water resources in different periods the control phase includes administrative measures that are conducted to prevent contamination of water resources as a result of activities of contaminating centers the available control systems such as sump pumping wellpoint systems siphon draining and deep well systems in iran have failed to examine and manage the quality of gw resources and the concerns of deteriorating water quality are increasing cashman and preene 2001 besides over the last years the status of iran s aquifers in terms of water quality has not been explored therefore this failure to manage the quality of the country s aquifers has caused the main resource of human s most important need to experience a huge crisis and consumer uncertainty zendehbad et al 2019 mathematical models are useful tools to identify the system and choose different management options for large scale environmental issues such as gw contamination they can be employed to prevent the problems in a way that by evaluating the various parameters involved the reactions of the aquifers can be observed in most regions of the world mathematical models are nowadays utilized to identify the method and simulation of fluctuations in the water tables and the movement of contamination in aquifers the pmwin processing modflow for windows www pmwin net software is one of the practical models for stimulating gw flow and movement of contamination in aquifers this model works based on modflow modular three dimensional finite difference ground water flow model and mt3d codes as a three dimensional finite difference model to explore and predict the flow behaviors in gw resources and also the movement of contamination through the aquifer sabzzadeh and shourian 2020 chiang and kinzelbach 1998 similar research based on the modflow model has been conducted in the modeling field using pmwin software lalehzari et al carried out research in 2009 using pmwin software to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients of an aquifer the findings reveal that the specific efficiency ranges from 0 03 to 0 08 and the hydraulic conductivity ranges from 2 to 16 m per day the responsiveness of the model to a given yield is greater than the responsiveness to hydraulic conductivity a difference of 0 45 and 0 61 was found between the water level forecasted by the model for may and june 2017 and the actual readings of the water level on the piezometers lalehzari et al 2010 in 2013 lalehzari et al did different research on the modeling of nitrate transport in groundwater flow the findings demonstrate the viability of the devised model for simulating flow route and nitrate transfer in saturated porous media nitrate concentrations are greatest in and around bahram abad village in a complex system the quality of groundwater in the area is impacted by several sources of contamination including urban wastewater and agricultural land runoff lalehzari et al 2013 from the abovementioned features it can be deduced that continuous management of gw resources through modeling can provide valuable data in terms of water resources management and sustainable development considering the ease of a rigorous model the value of the output data and the need to control the gw quality in iran the present study aimed at examining and adopting the necessary strategies to manage the country s aquifers in so doing the andimeshk plain was selected as a case study and the quantitative model for its no3 contamination was developed using the pmwin software through this application the spatial and temporal status of no3 was investigated offering insights into the actual and expected nitrate concentrations throughout the year besides the prediction of the no3 concentration reduction allows for evaluating the proposed strategies and further promoting their implementation for the alleviation of gw contamination in large geographical areas it is crucial to look at scenarios of lowering agricultural products and activities since the investigated region is mostly engaged in agricultural activities and because the percentage of nitrates entering the groundwater through urban and industrial areas is low the primary sources of nitrates in subterranean water according to scientific sources are frequently chemical and animal fertilizers and some businesses which is a clear justification for the job being done therefore using the program pmwin based on the modflow model this work aimed to simulate and predict changes in nitrate content in subsurface water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study region and data collection the andimeshk plain is located northwest of the khuzestan province within the range of andimeshk town it has an area of 305 km2 the main river in this plain is called balaroud river br which originates from mangareh and takht e golzar mountains then crosses the town of hosseiniyeh afterward leads toward andimeshk and passes towards its west and finally joins dez river dr after gaining water from both western and eastern regions fig 1 indicates the geographical location of the andimeshk plain according to the geological studies available regional alluvial sediments have been deposited as a result of the water erosion of different generators especially aghajari and bakhtiari generators and their re sedimentation every month for a year groundwater samples were taken twelve sampling events one sample was taken and delivered to an approved facility where the output variable the no3 concentration was measured the samples were taken on average 250 m below the earth s surface every sample was taken and labeled with its name and code in a polythene container that had already been washed and sterilized all samples were collected each month kept refrigerated and then evaluated for nitrate following the american public health association s standard procedures the amount of nitrate was measured using a portable multi parameter calorimeter model number dr 890 rehman et al 2020 in the andimeshk plain gw contaminants have various origins and points of entry into the water resources more specifically the contamination sources present in the region can be classified into 3 main groups a urban and rural sources these include the direct entrance of sewage systems animals wastes and or liquids into gw collecting and disposing of wastewater in andimeshk town which currently lacks a modern sanitation network is carried out through absorption wells and open canals the collected wastewater is transported out of the city through open collecting canals or pipelines and is disposed of in the balaroud river without treatment b agricultural sources these flows include waters returning from agricultural uses animal and chemical fertilizers pesticides and contamination resulting from livestock activities c industrial sources these include direct or indirect penetration of solids and liquids produced by industrial centers and mining activities in the region under investigation there is an industrial town a slaughterhouse some crusher factories and an impact crusher whose wastewater directly enters the balaroud river the amount of fixed nitrogen released into the atmosphere from land has grown due to human activity however the amount of these releases has nearly doubled worldwide with certain places experiencing far bigger rises by 2030 this fixed nitrogen flow is predicted to double once again excessive fixed nitrogen intake is associated with a number of environmental issues such as changes in species diversity groundwater quality deterioration nutrient enrichment of the aquatic environment and forests reduction nakagawa et al 2013 therefore it is also important to take into account the possibility that rain induced nitrate absorption into underground water sources might raise the nitrate content of water sources but this study excludes access to meteorological data making it impossible to assess nitrate intake through the atmosphere to underground water sources 2 2 nitrate modeling in groundwater model parameters and setup in order to conduct the study firstly the hydrogeological data of the aquifer including the observation wells drill logs geo electric sections water resources and others were collected likewise the depth of the bedrock on the western edge of the andimeshk plain varies between 30 and 200 m the trend and amount of the curves with the same depth of bedrock in the south and northwest of the plain follow the region s topography the minimum depth of bedrock was observed on the edge of the northwest and west mountains of the region and the maximum depth was in the center of the plain and the riverside of balaroud with a depth of 200 m on the eastern regions of the balaroud river the thickness of the aquifers increases from north to south and its thickness reaches about 15 m at the northeast of the plain and about 85 m on the dez riverside in the next phase the aquifer characteristics including transmissibility t and storage coefficient s were calculated based on pumping tests performed in the region accordingly transmissibility in the north of the region varies between 200 and 300 around dokouheh between 400 and 600 in the central part of the plain between 800 and 1200 and the south and southeast of the region up to around 4000 m2 per day moreover further hydrogeological studies of the plain were carried out including the preparation of the water resources map unit hydrograph and others and were utilized in preparing the quantitative model of the plain following to prepare the contamination model of the andimeshk plain first the contaminating centers of the plain such as waste disposal centers entrance centers of urban wastewater into the river agricultural lands and urban and rural centers were identified on a 1 25000 map drinking and agricultural wells were also marked on the map then by taking into account the contaminating centers and the gw flow direction 22 points with appropriate distribution all over the plain including exploitation wells and surface water bodies dez river and balaroud were identified and sampling was carried out see fig 1 specifically the sampling campaign was carried out in 12 periods from july 2014 to june 2015 to find the biggest contaminants of the gw aquifer nitrate vide infra finally from the aforementioned data the spatiotemporal profile of nitrate was generated in order to analyze the dispersion of no3 changes all over the plain the kriging method was used in arcgis 10 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrate measurement data in andimeshk plain nitrate was the most prevalent pollutant of gw resources in the andimeshk plain according to the studies of the 12 sample periods carried out between july 2014 and june 2015 the most significant nonorganic pollutant to demonstrate water pollution due to human activity and a solution incentive is the no3 it may pass through the unsaturated zone and has a lower liquidity absorption feature than other organic chemical and nonorganic pollutants it can also be somewhat removed by methods of chemical analysis and surface adsorption therefore no3 is hereby the contamination index parameter in qualitative modeling the simulated model of no3 contamination was employed to examine the spatial and temporal no3 changes when the cropping pattern of the region changes as presented in the graph representing the no3 of the region from july 2014 to june 2015 see fig 2 no3 concentration is low in dry seasons and increases with the beginning of the wet seasons due to the precipitation which causes no3 leaching from surface layers into deeper ones therefore the amount of no3 rises in fig 3 no3 concentration is examined in selected points according to this figure the average no3 concentration in most samples except for samples of zibashahr north of ghal e lour and agricultural lands located east of ghal e lour is less than 45 mg l fig 4 indicates the zonation map of no3 changes according to no3 changes in march 2015 as indicated by the interpolation results of this figure the minimum and maximum amounts of no3 exist on the dez riverside and its entrance boundaries at the north of the plain and the center of the plain s5 s6 respectively sample 5 s5 and samples 6 and 9 s6 s9 have the highest concentration respectively as a result of residential centers and agricultural lands utilizing pesticides and fertilizers commonly applied on agricultural lands the average nitrate concentration obtained in 2014 was equal to 22 74 mg l while in 2015 it was equal to 26 5 mg l which indicates its decrease 3 2 quantitative and qualitative model in order to simulate the quantitative flow and qualitative no3 contamination models for the andimeshk plain pmwin 5 3 and models of modflow and mt3d were utilized therefore the aquifer scope of andimeshk plain was zoned into 90 columns and 73 rows of block center type with equal column and row intervals 300 m which formed 6570 cells the quantitative model flow was carried out for a transient 18 month period from october 2013 to march 2015 after it was put into operation the flow model was evaluated both manually and automatically and the hydrodynamic and bedrock coefficients were measured afterward the no3 contamination model was carried out over 9 months from july 2014 to march 2015 one of the most important input parameters of the no3 contamination model in andimeshk plain is nitrate recharge which cannot usually be measured exactly according to the amount of n fertilizers

parts of the plain moreover water from precipitation can play an important role in increasing no3 in the water resources of the plain by carrying dissolving and transmitting nitrate from contaminated

is required not to contain soluble salts in amounts that are detrimental to the plants or have an adverse effect on the soil properties abrol et al 1988 pivić et al 2022 since the quality of the irrigation water may affect both crop yields and soil physical conditions testing the quality of irrigation water prior to the selection of the agricultural site and the crops to be grown is crucial since different crops require different irrigation water qualities abrol et al 1988 rao et al 2017 2021 aravinthasamy et al 2020 the quality of irrigation water is determined by different parameters these parameters are divided into three categories chemical salinity toxicity hazards for the soil plants and irrigation system physical emitters blockages problems from suspended solid particles and other impurities content and biological problems from bacteria and other contents harmful for human and animal health as well as for the soil plants and irrigation systems phocaides 2000 in this paper the chemical parameters that determine the quality of the irrigation water are discussed irrigation water quality is determined based on different hydrochemical indices these include ph electrical conductivity ec i e salinity total dissolved solids tds sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium percentage na or sodium hazard sh residual sodium carbonate rsc or residual alkalinity ra permeability index

of irrigation water in the form of a single value meireles et al 2010 several authors have recommended the use of iwqi for evaluation of quality of irrigation water as it gives more reliable evaluation karakuş and yildiz 2020 batarseh et al 2021 pivić et al 2022 in the arusha volcanic region in northern tanzania to the best of my knowledge only a study by makoba and muzuka 2019 has reported on the groundwater quality for irrigation on the northern and south eastern flanks of mount meru therefore there is a need to assess the quality of groundwaters used for irrigation on different flanks of mount meru to uncover a spatial distribution of irrigation water quality on and around mount meru it is worth mentioning that a study by sturdy et al 1932 analysed the quality of irrigation waters from streams and minor lakes occurring on the slopes of meru after assumption that the alkali salts either originating naturally in the soil or introduced by irrigation were possibly causing injury to coffee the principal economic crop in the area by the time recently a study by bennett et al 2021 presented that from the 122 sampled inventoried groundwater points on the eastern northern western and south western flanks of mount meru 93 n 114 of the points provide groundwaters for different purposes drinking other domestic use irrigation and livestock this indicates that groundwater resources are essential for providing waters for different uses in the area moreover the study by bennett et al 2021 addressed the quality of groundwaters for drinking purposes in the area the study found that from 175 groundwater samples 91 of the samples containing f values above the who health based guideline for drinking water 1 5 mg l whereas 39 of the samples have na concentrations above the who taste based guideline of 200 mg l in the northern tanzania in arusha and kilimanjaro areas high f concentration in groundwater is the main and well known parameter which hinder the quality of groundwater for drinking purposes both for human beings and livestock ijumulana et al 2020 2022 ligate et al 2021 also elevated levels of multiple potentially toxic elements such as molybdenum and uranium pose another threat to the health of the local communities in arusha region tomašek et al 2022 in the arusha region not only that the groundwater for drinking purposes is susceptible to chemical and other mineral concentration above the who health based guideline for drinking purposes but also groundwater for irrigation purpose is susceptible to chemical and other mineral concentration which hinder its quality therefore also there is a need to assess the quality of groundwaters used for irrigation purposes on the flanks of mount meru due to elevated na concentrations in the groundwaters bennett et al 2021 therefore this paper assessing the current condition of the irrigation water quality used for irrigation on the eastern northern western and south western flanks of mount meru based on the results of bennett et al 2021 using 114 groundwater samples from 76 sampled inventoried groundwater points used to provide water for irrigation in the study area the findings of this paper can be used by water managers in tanzania for proper irrigation and crop management but also the findings will be useful for water managers working in other similar geological settings 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area 2 1 1 general description the study area covers most of the slopes of mount meru in arusha region northern tanzania and occupies about 1000 km2 fig 1 the topography of the study area is dominated by mount meru with various parasitic cones in the vicinity bennett et al 2021 2022a in arusha there are three distinct seasons two rainy seasons long rains late february to late may short rains early november to early january and one dry season june to october the windward sides of the mountain eastern and southern flanks average annual rainfall 960 mm on the southern flank have a subtropical highland climate the leeward sides northern and western flanks average annual rainfall 770 mm have a semi arid climate bennett et al 2021 2022a the average annual temperature is 25 c temperature range 13 30 c chacha et al 2018 2 1 2 geology and hydrogeology the geology of the study area and the link between the local geology and hydrogeology in the area has been described in bennett et al 2021 mount meru is an active stratovolcano located within the northern tanzanian divergence zone of the eastern branch of the east african rift the lithology in the study area is dominated by volcanic rocks lava flows pyroclastic and debris avalanche deposits from the mount meru with some alluvium alluvial fan and lake deposits found around the volcano base fig 1 bennett et al 2021 the aquifer system on the flanks of mount meru is a sloping aquifer with sloping beds the aquifer on the far east of the eastern flank i e on the northern flank of ngurdoto crater is composed of debris avalanche deposits while the aquifer on the north eastern and west flanks is composed of weathered fractured lava and the aquifer on the south western flank fig 2 is composed of different layers pyroclastics on the top weathered fractured lava weathered pyroclastics and weathered fractured lava at the bottom the aquifer is semi confined on the north eastern and western flanks on the north eastern flank the overlying debris avalanche deposits acting as an aquitard while on the western flank the overlying layers pyroclastics and unweathered lava acting as an aquitard and aquiclude respectively the aquifer is unconfined on the far east of the eastern flank and south western flank the geomorphology in the area is controlling groundwater flow paths with multidirectional flows from high to low altitude areas bennett et al 2022b 2 2 overview of groundwater points used for irrigation the inventory of groundwater points in the study area has been discussed in detail in bennett et al 2021 the study by bennett et al 2021 presented that 93 n 114 of the sampled inventoried groundwater points n 122 on and around mount meru provide groundwaters for different purposes drinking other domestic use irrigation and livestock table 1 summarises the overview of the sampled inventoried groundwater points in reference to the provision of irrigation waters from the 114 groundwater points used to provide waters for different purposes 67 n 76 of the points are used to provide waters for irrigation to the local community this indicates that groundwater resources are essential for providing irrigation waters in the area the 76 groundwater points used for irrigation consist of 24 springs 50 hand dug wells and 2 boreholes fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of the sampled inventoried groundwater points used to provide waters for irrigation in the study area the distribution of the groundwater points is in five clusters located on the south western flank at ngaramtoni western flank at mamsa north western flank at oldonyo sambu north eastern flank at mkuru uwiro and ngarenanyuki and far east of the eastern flank i e on the northern flank of ngurdoto crater at nkoasenga and leguruki 2 3 sampling and laboratory analysis the sampling of the water points and laboratory analysis have been discussed in detail in bennett et al 2021 a total of 114 groundwater samples from the 76 groundwater points used to provide waters for irrigation to the local community are used in this study the samples were sampled during five sampling campaigns one in 2017 in september two in 2018 in august and september and two in 2019 in april and august from the 76 groundwater points used for irrigation 67 n 51 of the points were sampled once while 33 n 25 of the points were sampled atleast twice 14 points were sampled twice 10 points were sampled three times and 1 point was sampled five times the samples which were sampled atleast twice once in each sampling year will be used to analyse a temporal variability of groundwater quality for irrigation in the study area in different years 2 4 evaluation of quality of irrigation waters the suitability of the groundwater quality used for irrigation in the study area was assessed using the following common water quality parameters ph ec tds sar na rsc pi mar kr ps th and iwqi the following parameters sar na rsc pi mar kr ps and th were calculated using the standard equations given in table 2 while the iwqi was calculated based on the following five water quality parameters ec sar sodium ion concentration na chloride ion concentration cl and total alkalinity hco3 co3 2 using the model developed by meireles et al 2010 equation 1 the model by meireles et al 2010 uses the alkalinity hco3 parameter but in this study the total alkalinity hco3 co3 2 parameter is used instead because during the analysis of the bicarbonate hco3 contents for the groundwater samples the tipping point between bicarbonate hco3 and carbonate co3 2 at ph 8 2 was not determined analytically with sufficient accuracy suggesting that the distribution of hco3 and co3 2 in the samples is strongly variable with ph hence it was impossible to measure it accurately using ph as the criterion hence the total alkalinity ta which is the sum of hco3 and co3 2 is expressed as mg l hco3 bennett et al 2021 1 i w q i i 1 n q i w i where q i is the water quality measurement parameter calculated by equation 2 meireles et al 2010 and w i is the weight of the parameter given in table 3 meireles et al 2010 2 q i q i m a x x i j x inf q i m a p x m a p where q i m a x is the maximum value of q i for the class x i j is the observed for the parameter x inf is the corresponding value to the lower limit of the class to which the parameter belongs q i m a p is class amplitude x m a p is class amplitude to which the parameter belongs the q i values for the five water quality parameters q i e c q i s a r q i n a q i c l and q i h c o 3 c o 3 2 were determined based on the parameters values and the limits of the parameters indicated in table 4 meireles et al 2010 2 5 data processing and analysis before starting data analysis the concentration of ions was converted from mg l to meq l the descriptive statistics minimum maximum mean median standard deviation and coefficient of variation of physicochemical parameters of groundwaters used for irrigation in the study area was determined using microsoft excel 2019 the iwqi for groundwater samples was tested for normality using ibm spss statistics 28 software considering that it was not normally distributed a wilcoxon signed rank test was carried out to assess whether the iwqi in september 2017 and september 2018 are significantly different 2 6 temporal variability and spatial distribution of groundwater quality for irrigation the temporal variability of groundwater quality for irrigation was assessed using statistical analysis and visualized using line graph while qgis software a geographic information system application that supports viewing editing and analysis of geospatial data was used to shows a spatial distribution of groundwater quality for irrigation in the study area 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical parameters of groundwaters used for irrigation table 5 summarises descriptive statistics minimum maximum mean median standard deviation and coefficient of variation for the physicochemical parameters of the irrigation groundwater samples from each studied flank of mount meru the raw analytical data are given in table a1 in the appendix in 114 groundwater samples ph values range from 6 7 to 8 6 with an average of 7 8 and a median of 7 8 the ec values of the samples range from 152 μs cm at reference temperature of 25 c to 3510 μs cm with an average of 1192 μs cm and a median of 993 μs cm while their tds values range from 191 to 3560 mg l with an average of 1091 mg l and a median of 932 mg l the general groundwater chemistry in the study area is f rich nahco3 alkaline water bennett et al 2021 the main sources of f and na ions in groundwater chemistry in the study area are dissolution of fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f and albite naalsi3o8 respectively bennett et al 2022a 3 2 evaluation of groundwater quality for irrigation table 6 summarises the suitability of groundwater samples for irrigation based on different parameters and associated classifications along with the number and percentage of groundwater samples fitting to each class the raw data for water quality indices are given in table a2 in the appendix results show that the parameters ph pi mar and ps are favourable for irrigation in more than 90 of the samples respectively whereas the parameters na rsc kr and th are unfavourable for irrigation in more than 89 of the samples respectively there is a huge contrast between these two groups of the parameters the ec is favourable for irrigation in 92 of the samples while is doubtful in 8 of the samples moreover the tds is favourable for irrigation in 82 5 of the samples while is unfavourable for irrigation in 17 5 of the samples the sar is favourable for irrigation in 85 of the samples while is unfavourable for irrigation in 15 of the samples finally the iwqi shows that only 1 n 1 of the samples is good for irrigation while 29 and 38 of the samples are poor and very poor for irrigation respectively and 32 of the samples are unsuitable for irrigation the iwqi which combine different indices gives a fair overall evaluation of quality of irrigation water compared to the evaluation based on the individual parameter however the iwqi used in this study has limitations such as high sensitivity in recommending water into unsuitable category due to a limited number of parameters used and the magnitude of the weight assigned to the parameters islam and mostafa 2022 therefore the groundwaters used for irrigation on the investigated flanks of mount meru are not suitable for irrigation the study by fenta et al 2020 on similar geological settings volcanic region found that the high na in borehole samples from deep volcanic aquifers in northwest ethiopia which contain nahco3 water types like my study area restrict the deep groundwater suitability for irrigation high na concentration with co3 2 turn the soil into alkaline soil whereas na mixed with cl accelerate the formation of saline soil which ultimately reduce infiltration capacity permeability of the soil and reduce plant growth fenta et al 2020 pivić et al 2022 hence treatment of groundwaters used for irrigation on the investigated flanks of mount meru is recommend by reducing the na concentration and total alkalinity hco3 co3 2 the application of appropriate quantities of amendments such as gypsum soluble calcium salts or sulphuric acid can greatly reduce the toxicity hazard due to excess sodium abrol et al 1988 application of gypsum and soluble calcium do not change the ph and there is a potential to have sulphur sulphate toxicity higher ph of the groundwater e g ph 8 may exert the most critical problem for nutrient unavailability for plants the use of appropriate amount of sulphuric acid or elemental sulphur in treatment of irrigation water can reduce soil ph but care should be taken to avoid the sulphur sulphate toxicity moreover the applications of acidified water or acidic fertilizer can be used to lower ph in irrigation water also since the groundwater in the study area contains high f concentration there is a need to remove excess fluoride from water using applications of nalgonda technique activated alumina red mud montmorillonite and magnesia rao 2018 3 3 temporal and spatial variability of groundwater quality for irrigation 3 3 1 temporal variability of groundwater quality for irrigation the temporal variability of groundwater quality for irrigation in the study area is analysed based on the 21 groundwater points for the samples taken in september 2017 and september 2018 fig 4 since the samples are paired hence the wilcoxon signed rank test was applied to analyse the difference between iwqi in the two different years the wilcoxon signed rank test showed that at the significance level α of 0 05 there is no statistically significant difference between the iwqi in september 2017 mean rank 10 53 and september 2018 mean rank 12 17 z 1 477 p 0 140 therefore there were no changes of groundwater quality for irrigation in the inventoried groundwater points between september 2017 and september 2018 despite high groundwater recharge in year 2017 as the year 2017 was wetter annual rainfall 797 mm than 2018 annual rainfall 680 mm bennett et al 2021 3 3 2 spatial distribution of groundwater quality for irrigation for the 25 groundwater points that were sampled atleast twice the iwqi value for each point is an average value of iwqi values of the samples from the point table 7 summarises the irrigation water suitability for the inventoried groundwater points on the flanks of mount meru from the 76 groundwater points used for irrigation 1 n 1 of the points is classified as good for irrigation use while 30 n 23 and 37 n 28 of the points are classified as poor and very poor respectively furthermore 32 n 24 of the groundwater points are unsuitable for irrigation fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of groundwater quality for irrigation based on irrigation water quality index iwqi table 8 summarises the irrigation water suitability for the inventoried groundwater points on each flank of mount meru the only groundwater point that is classified as good for irrigation use is found on the far east of the eastern flank i e on the northern flank of ngurdoto crater whereas most of the groundwater points which are unsuitable for irrigation use are found on the south western flank n 17 other groundwater points that are unsuitable for irrigation use are found on the north eastern flank n 6 and far east of the eastern flank n 1 4 conclusions and recommendations based on irrigation water quality index iwqi the groundwaters used for irrigation on the eastern northern western and south western flanks of mount meru are not suitable for irrigation only 1 n 1 of the inventoried groundwater points n 76 is classified as good for irrigation use and 99 n 75 of the points are classified as poor to unsuitable for irrigation use hence treatment of groundwaters used for irrigation is recommended in the investigated areas to avoid damage of crops and low production as well as damage in soil properties the treatment of these groundwaters can be done by reducing the na concentration and total alkalinity hco3 co3 2 using appropriate quantities of amendments also the study recommends a regular long term monitoring of irrigation water quality to uncover its seasonal temporal variability for proper irrigation and crop management in the area moreover the study recommends that potential future studies should focus on determining which types and what quantity of amendments are suitable for treatment of irrigation waters in the study area author contribution george

11723,the study focuses on assessing the suitability of groundwaters used for irrigation on the flanks of mount meru in northern tanzania and providing a map showing the spatial variability of irrigation water quality for proper irrigation and crop management in the area results of irrigation water quality index iwqi show that the groundwaters f rich nahco3 alkaline waters used for irrigation on the eastern northern western and south western flanks of mount meru are not suitable for irrigation only 1 n 1 of the inventoried groundwater points n 76 is classified as good for irrigation use while 99 n 75 of the points are classified as poor to unsuitable for irrigation use hence the study recommends the treatment of groundwaters used for irrigation in the study area by reducing the na concentration and total alkalinity hco3 co3 2 using appropriate quantities of amendments this study would be helpful for water resources management in other similar geological settings graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater quality assessment irrigation suitability irrigation water quality index spatial temporal variability mount meru tanzania data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the arid and semi arid regions crop production is dependent on irrigated agriculture due to the hot and dry climates of these regions the irrigation water is required not to contain soluble salts in amounts that are detrimental to the plants or have an adverse effect on the soil properties abrol et al 1988 pivić et al 2022 since the quality of the irrigation water may affect both crop yields and soil physical conditions testing the quality of irrigation water prior to the selection of the agricultural site and the crops to be grown is crucial since different crops require different irrigation water qualities abrol et al 1988 rao et al 2017 2021 aravinthasamy et al 2020 the quality of irrigation water is determined by different parameters these parameters are divided into three categories chemical salinity toxicity hazards for the soil plants and irrigation system physical emitters blockages problems from suspended solid particles and other impurities content and biological problems from bacteria and other contents harmful for human and animal health as well as for the soil plants and irrigation systems phocaides 2000 in this paper the chemical parameters that determine the quality of the irrigation water are discussed irrigation water quality is determined based on different hydrochemical indices these include ph electrical

reported on the groundwater quality for irrigation on the northern and south eastern flanks of mount meru therefore there is a need to assess the quality of groundwaters used for irrigation on different flanks of mount meru to uncover a spatial distribution of irrigation water quality on and around mount meru it is worth mentioning that a study by sturdy et al 1932 analysed the quality of irrigation waters from streams and minor lakes occurring on the slopes of meru after assumption that the alkali salts either originating naturally in the soil or introduced by irrigation were possibly causing injury to coffee the principal economic crop in the area by the time recently a study by bennett et al 2021 presented that from the 122 sampled inventoried groundwater points on the eastern northern western and south western flanks of mount meru 93 n 114 of the points provide groundwaters for different purposes drinking other domestic use irrigation and livestock this indicates that groundwater resources are essential for providing waters for different uses in the area moreover the study by bennett et al 2021 addressed the quality of groundwaters for drinking purposes in the area the study found that from 175 groundwater samples 91 of the samples containing f values above the who health based guideline for drinking water 1 5 mg l whereas 39 of the samples have na concentrations above the who taste based guideline of 200 mg l in the northern tanzania in arusha and kilimanjaro areas high f concentration in groundwater is the main and well known parameter which hinder the quality of groundwater for drinking purposes both for human beings and livestock ijumulana et al 2020 2022 ligate et al 2021 also elevated levels of multiple potentially toxic elements such as molybdenum and uranium pose another threat to the health of the local communities in arusha region tomašek et al 2022 in the arusha region not only that the groundwater for drinking purposes is susceptible to chemical and other mineral concentration above the who health based guideline for drinking purposes but also groundwater for irrigation purpose is susceptible to chemical and other mineral concentration which hinder its quality therefore also there is a need to assess the quality of groundwaters used for irrigation purposes on the flanks of mount meru due to elevated na concentrations in the groundwaters bennett et al 2021 therefore this paper assessing the current condition of the irrigation water quality used for irrigation on the eastern northern western and south western flanks of mount meru based on the results of bennett et al 2021 using 114 groundwater samples from 76 sampled inventoried groundwater points used to provide water for irrigation in the study area the findings of this paper can be used by water managers in tanzania for proper irrigation and crop management but also the findings will be useful for water managers working in other similar geological settings 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area 2 1 1 general description the study area covers most of the slopes of mount meru in arusha region northern tanzania and occupies about 1000 km2 fig 1 the topography of the study area is dominated by mount meru with various parasitic cones in the vicinity bennett et al 2021 2022a in arusha there are three distinct seasons two rainy seasons long rains late february to late may short rains early november to early january and one dry season june to october the windward sides of the mountain eastern and southern flanks average annual rainfall 960 mm on the southern flank have a subtropical highland climate the leeward sides northern and western flanks average annual rainfall 770 mm have a semi arid climate bennett et al 2021 2022a the average annual temperature is 25 c temperature range 13 30 c chacha et al 2018 2 1 2 geology and hydrogeology the geology of the study area and the link between the local geology and hydrogeology in the area has been described in bennett et al 2021 mount meru is an active stratovolcano located within the northern tanzanian divergence zone of the eastern branch of the east african rift the lithology in the study area is dominated by volcanic rocks lava flows pyroclastic and debris avalanche deposits from the mount meru with some alluvium alluvial fan and lake deposits found around the volcano base fig 1 bennett et al 2021 the aquifer system on the flanks of mount meru is a sloping aquifer with sloping beds the aquifer on the far east of the eastern flank i e on the northern flank of ngurdoto crater is composed of debris avalanche deposits while the aquifer on the north eastern and west flanks is composed of weathered fractured lava and the aquifer on the south western flank fig 2 is composed of different layers pyroclastics on the top weathered fractured lava weathered pyroclastics and weathered fractured lava at the bottom the aquifer is semi confined on the north eastern and western flanks on the north eastern flank the overlying debris avalanche deposits acting as an aquitard while on the western flank the overlying layers pyroclastics and unweathered lava acting as an aquitard and aquiclude respectively the aquifer is unconfined on the far east of the eastern flank and south western flank the geomorphology in the area is controlling groundwater flow paths with multidirectional flows from high to low altitude areas bennett et al 2022b 2 2 overview of groundwater points used for irrigation the inventory of groundwater points in the study area has been discussed in detail in bennett et al 2021 the study by bennett et al 2021 presented that 93 n 114 of the sampled inventoried groundwater points n 122 on and around mount meru provide groundwaters for different purposes drinking other domestic use irrigation and livestock table 1 summarises the overview of the sampled inventoried groundwater points in reference to the provision of irrigation waters from the 114 groundwater points used to provide waters for different purposes 67 n 76 of the points are used to provide waters for irrigation to the local community this indicates that groundwater resources are essential for providing irrigation waters in the area the 76 groundwater points used for irrigation consist of 24 springs 50 hand dug wells and 2 boreholes fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of the sampled inventoried groundwater points used to provide waters for irrigation in the study area the distribution of the groundwater points is in five clusters located on the south western flank at ngaramtoni western flank at mamsa north western flank at oldonyo sambu north eastern flank at mkuru uwiro and ngarenanyuki and far east of the eastern flank i e on the northern flank of ngurdoto crater at nkoasenga and leguruki 2 3 sampling and laboratory analysis the sampling of the water points and laboratory analysis have been discussed in detail in bennett et al 2021 a total of 114 groundwater samples from the 76 groundwater points used to provide waters for irrigation to the local community are used in this study the samples were sampled during five sampling campaigns one in 2017 in september two in 2018 in august and september and two in 2019 in april and august from the 76 groundwater points used for irrigation 67 n 51 of the points were sampled once while 33 n 25 of the points were sampled atleast twice 14 points were sampled twice 10 points were sampled three times and 1 point was sampled five times the samples which were sampled atleast twice once in each sampling year will be used to analyse a temporal variability of groundwater quality for irrigation in the study area in different years 2 4 evaluation of quality of irrigation waters the suitability of the groundwater quality used for irrigation in the study area was assessed using the following common water quality parameters ph ec tds sar na rsc pi mar kr ps th and iwqi the following parameters sar na rsc pi mar kr ps and th were calculated using the standard equations given in table 2 while the iwqi was calculated based on the following five water quality parameters ec sar sodium ion concentration na chloride ion concentration cl and total alkalinity hco3 co3 2 using the model developed by meireles et al 2010 equation 1 the model by meireles et al 2010 uses the alkalinity hco3 parameter but in this study the total alkalinity hco3 co3 2 parameter is used instead because during the analysis of the bicarbonate hco3 contents for the groundwater samples the tipping point between bicarbonate hco3 and carbonate co3 2 at ph 8 2 was not determined analytically with sufficient accuracy suggesting that the distribution of hco3 and co3 2 in the samples is strongly variable with ph hence it was impossible to measure it accurately using ph as the criterion hence the total alkalinity ta which is the sum of hco3 and co3 2 is expressed as mg l hco3 bennett et al 2021 1 i w q i i 1 n q i w i where q i is the water quality measurement parameter calculated by equation 2 meireles et al 2010 and w i is the weight of the parameter given in table 3 meireles et al 2010 2 q i q i m a x x i j x inf q i m a p x m a p where q i m a x is the maximum value of q i for the class x i j is the observed for the parameter x inf is the corresponding value to the lower limit of the class to which the parameter belongs q i m a p is class amplitude x m a p is class amplitude to which the parameter belongs the q i values for the five water quality parameters q i e c q i s a r q i n a q i c l and q i h c o 3 c o 3 2 were determined based on the parameters values and the limits of the parameters indicated in table 4 meireles et al 2010 2 5 data processing and analysis before starting data analysis the concentration of ions was converted from mg l to meq l the descriptive statistics minimum maximum mean median standard deviation and coefficient of variation of physicochemical parameters of groundwaters used for irrigation in the study area was determined using microsoft excel 2019 the iwqi for groundwater samples was tested for normality using ibm spss statistics 28 software considering that it was not normally distributed a wilcoxon signed rank test was carried out to assess whether the iwqi in september 2017 and september 2018 are significantly different 2 6 temporal variability and spatial distribution of groundwater quality for irrigation the temporal variability of groundwater quality for irrigation was assessed using statistical analysis and visualized using line graph while qgis software a geographic information system application that supports viewing editing and analysis of geospatial data was used to shows a spatial distribution of groundwater quality for irrigation in the study area 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical parameters of groundwaters used for irrigation table 5 summarises descriptive statistics minimum maximum mean median standard deviation and coefficient of variation for the physicochemical parameters of the irrigation groundwater samples from each studied flank of mount meru the raw analytical data are given in table a1 in the appendix in 114 groundwater samples ph values range from 6 7 to 8 6 with an average of 7 8 and a median of 7 8 the ec values of the samples range from 152 μs cm at reference temperature of 25 c to 3510 μs cm with an average of 1192 μs cm and a median of 993 μs cm while their tds values range from 191 to 3560 mg l with an average of 1091 mg l and a median of 932 mg l the general groundwater chemistry in the study area is f rich nahco3 alkaline water bennett et al 2021 the main sources of f and na ions in groundwater chemistry in the study area are dissolution of fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f and albite naalsi3o8 respectively bennett et al 2022a 3 2 evaluation of groundwater quality for irrigation table 6 summarises the suitability of groundwater samples for irrigation based on different parameters and associated classifications along with the number and percentage of groundwater samples fitting to each class the raw data for water quality indices are given in table a2 in the appendix results show that the parameters ph pi mar and ps are favourable for irrigation in more than 90 of the samples respectively whereas the parameters na rsc kr and th are unfavourable for irrigation in more than 89 of the samples respectively there is a huge contrast between these two groups of the parameters the ec is favourable for irrigation in 92 of the samples while is doubtful in 8 of the samples moreover the tds is favourable for irrigation in 82 5 of the samples while is unfavourable for irrigation in 17 5 of the samples the sar is favourable for irrigation in 85 of the samples while is unfavourable for irrigation in 15 of the samples finally the iwqi shows that only 1 n 1 of the samples is good for irrigation while 29 and 38 of the samples are poor and very poor for irrigation respectively and 32 of the samples are unsuitable for irrigation the iwqi which combine different indices gives a fair overall evaluation of quality of irrigation water compared to the evaluation based on the individual parameter however the iwqi used in this study has limitations such as high sensitivity in recommending water into unsuitable category due to a limited number of parameters used and the magnitude of the weight assigned to the parameters islam and mostafa 2022 therefore the groundwaters used for irrigation on the investigated flanks of mount meru are not suitable for irrigation the study by fenta et al 2020 on similar geological settings volcanic region found that the high na in borehole samples from deep volcanic aquifers in northwest ethiopia which contain nahco3 water types like my study area restrict the deep groundwater suitability for irrigation high na concentration with co3 2 turn the soil into alkaline soil whereas na mixed with cl accelerate the formation of saline soil which ultimately reduce infiltration capacity permeability of the soil and reduce plant growth fenta et al 2020 pivić et al 2022 hence treatment of groundwaters used for irrigation on the investigated flanks of mount meru is recommend by reducing the na concentration and total alkalinity hco3 co3 2 the application of appropriate quantities of amendments such as gypsum soluble calcium salts or sulphuric acid can greatly reduce the toxicity hazard due to excess sodium abrol et al 1988 application of gypsum and soluble calcium do not change the ph and there is a potential to have sulphur sulphate toxicity higher ph of the groundwater e g ph 8 may exert the most critical problem for nutrient unavailability for plants the use of appropriate amount of sulphuric acid or elemental sulphur in treatment of irrigation water can reduce soil ph but care should be taken to avoid the sulphur sulphate toxicity moreover the applications of acidified water or acidic fertilizer can be used to lower ph in irrigation water also since the groundwater in the study area contains high f concentration there is a need to remove excess fluoride from water using applications of nalgonda technique activated alumina red mud montmorillonite and magnesia rao 2018 3 3 temporal and spatial variability of groundwater quality for irrigation 3 3 1 temporal variability of groundwater quality for irrigation the temporal variability of groundwater quality for irrigation in the study area is analysed based on the 21 groundwater points for the samples taken in september 2017 and september 2018 fig 4 since the samples are paired hence the wilcoxon signed rank test was applied to analyse the difference between iwqi in the two different years the wilcoxon signed rank test showed that at the significance level α of 0 05 there is no statistically significant difference between the iwqi in september 2017 mean rank 10 53 and september 2018 mean rank 12 17 z 1 477 p 0 140 therefore there were no changes of groundwater quality for irrigation in the inventoried groundwater points between september 2017 and september 2018 despite high groundwater recharge in year 2017 as the year 2017 was wetter annual rainfall 797 mm than 2018 annual rainfall 680 mm bennett et al 2021 3 3 2 spatial distribution of groundwater quality for irrigation for the 25 groundwater points that were sampled atleast twice the iwqi value for each point is an average value of iwqi values of the samples from the point table 7 summarises the irrigation water suitability for the inventoried groundwater points on the flanks of mount meru from the 76 groundwater points used for irrigation 1 n 1 of the points is classified as good for irrigation use while 30 n 23 and 37 n 28 of the points are classified as poor and very poor respectively furthermore 32 n 24 of the groundwater points are unsuitable for irrigation fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of groundwater quality for irrigation based on irrigation water quality index iwqi table 8 summarises the irrigation water suitability for the inventoried groundwater points on each flank of mount meru the only groundwater point that is classified as good for irrigation use is found on the far east of the eastern flank i e on the northern flank of ngurdoto crater whereas most of the groundwater points which are unsuitable for irrigation use are found on the south western flank n 17 other groundwater points that are unsuitable for irrigation use are found on the north eastern flank n 6 and far east of the eastern flank n 1 4 conclusions and recommendations based on irrigation water quality index iwqi the groundwaters used for irrigation on the eastern northern western and south western flanks of mount meru are not suitable for irrigation only 1 n 1 of the inventoried groundwater points n 76 is classified as good for irrigation use and 99 n 75 of the points are classified as poor to unsuitable for irrigation use hence treatment of groundwaters used for irrigation is recommended in the investigated areas to avoid damage of crops and low production as well as damage in soil properties the treatment of these groundwaters can be done by reducing the na concentration and total alkalinity hco3 co3 2 using appropriate quantities of amendments also the study recommends a regular long term monitoring of irrigation water quality to uncover its seasonal temporal variability for proper irrigation and crop management in the area moreover the study recommends that potential future studies should focus on determining which types and what quantity of amendments are suitable for treatment of irrigation waters in the study area author contribution george

11724,groundwater levels have declined significantly in the last decades in many parts of the world due to anthropogenic activities and climate change the study focuses on the long term potential and environmental impacts of rooftop rainwater harvesting coupled with shallow well infiltration which is a local scale inexpensive solution that could contribute to easing water shortage the danube tisza interfluve hungary was used as a study area where a field experiment was set up funneling rainwater from the roof of a family house to the shallow dug well in the yard connected to a porous unconfined aquifer changes in groundwater levels as well as thermal hydrochemical and isotopic footprints were monitored and evaluated for over 600 days to determine the quantitative and qualitative effects of this method and to identify the long term physico chemical impacts of infiltrated water on ambient groundwater during the monitoring period 60 616 m3 of precipitation was infiltrated through the shallow well that could achieve significant water quality improvement mg2 na cl so4 2 no3 concentrations and tds decreased by 35 88 after the infiltration started and a further 35 96 decrease occurred in these parameters by the end of the monitoring period rooftop collected water was enriched in zn sr cu mn ba and al their concentrations being 1 9 48 2 times higher in roof runoff than in the precipitation the monitoring of water column changes and infiltration curve analysis after precipitation events helped identifying the clogging process that decreased the hydraulic conductivity of the well bottom by one order of magnitude the results of this research provide information on the efficiency and environmental impacts of the pilot project and contribute to the extension of the design to town level and to similar settlements in the area additionally general conclusions can be drawn to promote the implementation of similar projects in porous unconfined aquifers worldwide graphical

introduction and aims due to climate change weather conditions are becoming more and more extreme with longer periods of drought and flood causing environmental agricultural and consequent health infrastructural social and economic problems worldwide treidel et al 2011 taylor et al 2013 harrison et al 2015 arnell et al 2016 at the same time the need for irrigation increases the use of fresh groundwater globally zhou et al 2010 wada et al 2013 wu et al 2020 these two effects can cause serious water shortage in many parts of the world including e g california usa northern india the north china plain the middle east rodell et al 2018 etc in the field of water management one of the most significant ways to achieve adaptation to climate change is mar which is the purposeful recharge of water to aquifers for subsequent recovery or environmental benefit nrmmc 2009 it is a group of nature inspired approaches that promote the accumulation of water reserves under the surface and support the joint management of surface waters and groundwaters evans and dillon 2018 dillon et al 2018 managed aquifer recharge is a suitable way to reduce the inequalities of water conditions and helps mitigating the related consequences this solution can contribute to the rehabilitation of groundwater depletion restoration of pressure levels in aquifers avoiding declining yields halting ground subsidence improving water quality and maintaining groundwater dependent ecosystems e g gale 2005 dillon et al 2009 dillon et al 2018 different types of mar methods can be used based on the local environmental conditions and opportunities geomorphology geology water availability hydrogeology etc as well as on the aims of the aquifer recharge igrac 2007 dillon et al 2009 spreading methods e g infiltration ponds and basins induced bank filtration and well shaft and borehole recharge are used to enhance infiltration and replenishment while in channel modifications and rainwater and runoff harvesting are mainly aimed at intercepting the water igrac 2007 these methods can be well combined with each other e g rainwater and runoff harvesting can serve as the water source for infiltration basins or wells to replenish groundwater reservoirs rainwater can be infiltrated via ponds basins and ditches through the unsaturated zone or using wells thus leading water directly to the saturated zone gale 2005 dillon et al 2009 the latter solution has several advantages including lower evaporation loss faster increase of groundwater level smaller surface area use and lower risk of biological activity on the other hand adequate water quality of infiltrated water is crucial in this case in order to avoid groundwater contamination gale 2005 dillon et al 2009 casanova et al 2016 page et al 2018 one of the areas in hungary suffering from serious water shortage is the danube tisza interfluve dti fig 1 where water level reduction and related water management problems started in the 1970s major and neppel 1988 the water shortage of the area can be attributed to several factors climate change especially the reduction and change in the distribution of precipitation and yearly average temperature increase played an important role in the occurring processes additionally several types of human activities such as land use changes afforestation shallow and deep groundwater abstraction canalization and land drainage contributed to the water level decrease pálfai 1993 2010 kovács et al 2017 the degree of water level decline is approx 2 3 m but in some areas it can reach even 6 7 m

the ridge part of the dti many shallow wells and lakes have dried out as an example lake kondor sw of kerekegyháza fig 1c as a wetland almost entirely disappeared ujházy and biró 2013 and most of the dug wells of kerekegyháza run out of water based on personal communications with the residents many plans were worked out in the last decades involving large cross regional technical investments but

been unresolved for decades but its severity is growing in light of the ongoing climate change as dti is one of the most vulnerable areas in the country in this regard nccs 2018 in hungary the annual average temperature is expected to increase by 4 5 4 c and the annual precipitation is likely to decrease by about 20 by the end of the century pieczka et al 2011 a further increase in weather extremes e g occurrence of droughts are expected bartholy et al 2014 as well as a significant decrease in the climatic water balance rotárné szalkai et al 2015 the unconfined aquifers have adequate storage capacity and this would provide an opportunity for more efficient water retention and water replenishment on local scale páris 2009 therefore one of the aims of this research is to evaluate the water replenishment possibilities of the shallow porous aquifers of the dti from a different perspective by investigating a local water replenishment method rooftop rainwater harvesting rrwh coupled with shallow well infiltration rrwh sw was selected for this purpose for the following reasons i the only possible local source of replenishment in the area is rainwater ii using dug wells is possibly the most inexpensive and most convenient way of water replenishment in the area these wells are already available and usually not used anymore because either they have dried out or the water quality of shallow groundwater is not adequate anymore by using them for infiltration they could have a new purpose in water management iii using dug wells for rainwater collection or disposal is an existing practice in the area however it is not favored by the authorities as it might pose a risk to groundwater quality and fine sediments may clog the pores of the well bottom ministry of interior 2017 in order to recommend these systems to the authorities and residents assurance of the effectiveness of the method is needed and the possible downsides should be assessed consequently the second aim is to demonstrate the quantitative and qualitative potential and environmental impacts of the method several former research proved that rainwater harvesting either collected from roofs and roads can be an effective tool to increase groundwater levels especially on catchment scale e g sayana et al 2010 glendenning and vervoort 2010 jebamalar et al 2012 jebamalar et al 2021 mapping of suitable

meera and mansoor ahammed 2006 however for tile roofs the enrichment factor of zn in roof runoff is much lower other parameters such as turbidity hardness and nitrate content can increase in roof runoff from tile roofs meera and mansoor ahammed 2018 in order to guarantee the long term efficiency of rrwh sw systems in a porous aquifer both in terms of quantity and water quality the implementation of a field experiment seems to be an adequate method however in order to exclude the effects of seasonality a continuous monitoring scheme and an observation period longer than one hydrologic year is needed based on these preliminary considerations the objectives of this study were to carry out a long term experimental field study i to assess the quantitative and ii qualitative potential of rooftop rainwater harvesting coupled with shallow well infiltration rrwh sw iii to determine the related environmental consequences especially related to groundwater contamination iv to examine the effect of clogging and v to evaluate the significance of the results on settlement regional scales and globally although the results of the experimental study directly widen the scope of water replenishment possibilities in the dti the results for an unconfined porous environment can also provide thorough information on the solution s long term potential and environmental impacts 2 characterization of the pilot site in the study area the study area is located in the danube tisza interfluve area hungary fig 1 the dti is a ridge region up to 130 140 m a s l between danube and tisza rivers the river valleys are situated at 85 90 m above sea level the experiment is located in a small rural town kerekegyháza which is situated on the western side of the elevated ridge on the catchment area of the danube in the surroundings of kerekegyháza the topographical elevation difference is less than 10 m 109 118 m a s l fig 1c the near surface aquifers and aquitards of the area consist of sand coarse silt peat mud clay and calcareous mud the shallow groundwater flow systems of the elevated ridge region are under the effect of topography driven meteoric flow regime and in shallow depth ca mg hco3 2 type waters are predominant mádl szőnyi and tóth 2009 the study area is located in the recharge area the vertical hydraulic gradient is approx 2 4 10 2 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2009 based on fig 1c the horizontal hydraulic gradient is one order of magnitude lower 1 5 10 3 the climate of the study area is moderately warm and dry the average annual temperature is around 11 c the annual average rainfall is 500 550 mm y 1 with an uneven temporal distribution the number of hours of sunshine is considered high in hungary exceeding 2000 h per year omsz website the rate of evapotranspiration is 80 90 of the annual precipitation on average 470 mm szilágyi et al 2012 using 3h 3he age profiling to a well nest in a near study area 5 km the recharge rate has been estimated to be 48 6 mm y 1 palcsu et al 2017 which is about 9 of the annual precipitation being in a good agreement with the evapotranspiration rate in january 2020 a field experiment was set up funneling rainwater from the roof of a family house into an abandoned shallow dug well sw located in the house yard fig 2 sw is 6 2 m deep with an open bottom its diameter being 0 8 m the well is screened in an unconfined shallow aquifer consisting of sand and silt although sw was not used in the past we found it in excellent conditions the concrete rings were intact and it was still covered with a tin lid sw was found not dry before rainwater infiltration started with an initial water column of about 0 7 m during preliminary cleaning the mud was removed from the bottom before the start of the experiment and once again in may 2021 to maintain the infiltration efficiency of sw since the rainwater was introduced into sw solely driven by gravitation in the experiment i e no pumps were used the term infiltration describes better the rainwater harvesting process rather than injection the overall inclined rooftop area was 115 m2 considering vertical rainfall this corresponded to about 80 m2 of projected flat surface receiving rainfall thus the potentially collectable amount of vertical rainfall was 80 m2 multiplied by the precipitation rates the shallow dug well was connected to the rooftop gutters by pvc hoses the gutters were cleaned twice during the experimental time before the experiment started and in december 2020 the water passed through a filter mesh before it entered the tube system to impede the entrance of leaves and other larger objects into the well the filter mesh did not however remove fine grained materials the filters were changed in december 2020 and may 2021 two monitoring wells p1 and p2 were constructed in the direction of groundwater flow for water level observation and for sampling purposes as schematically shown in fig 2 the radial distance between sw and p1 is 8 3 m and between sw and p2 is 12 3 m the depth of the monitoring wells is 6 7 m of which the last 1 m is screened the diameter of the wells is 0 04 m 3 material and methods understanding the shortcomings of previous field experiments regarding rooftop rainwater harvesting coupled with shallow wells water level temperature and specific electrical conductivity were recorded continuously every half hour in sw and in the monitoring wells by automatic data loggers to collect information about the changes in these parameters and thus the impact of the rainfall harvesting process on native groundwater in addition meteorological data precipitation and daily average temperature were available from időkép kft measured in kerekegyháza between january 28 2020 and june 29 2021 and from the hungarian meteorological service omsz measured in the neighboring village fülöpháza from june 30 2021 complimentary water level monitoring data of 5 shallow monitoring wells were used which were acquired from the territorially competent water directorate aduvízig to compare them with the time series data measured in sw p1 and p2 during the experiment the maximum distance of these wells from the pilot site was 5 km fig 1c in order to get to know the shallow unconfined environment sediment samples were collected from the aquifer during drilling of p1 sample dr a and from the bottom of sw samples sw t from the upper layer and st b from the lower layer during maintenance may 2021 grain size measurements were carried out by sieving above d 0 063 mm and elutriation below d 0 063 mm in the laboratory of department of geology elte eötvös loránd university budapest hungary the organic matter can influence contamination fate and transport therefore it was estimated for sw t and st b by measuring loss on ignition loi at 550 c hydraulic conductivity k values were determined using the excel based tool called hydrogeosievexl devlin 2015 hydraulic conductivity of the well bottom was also estimated by evaluating infiltration curves for 22 selected precipitation events as slug tests using the aquifertest 11 0 pro software wh 2021 the bouwer rice method bouwer and rice 1976 was found to be the most applicable for the experiment the following parameters were used for the evaluation unconfined aquifer aquifer thickness 20 m partially penetrating well well diameter 0 4 m screen length 0 2 m well depth 6 2 m porosity 30 water sampling was conducted seasonally by a submersible pump in the case of sw after taking out approx 300 l of water p1 and p2 were sampled with small bailers volume 0 1 l due to their small diameters after taking out 1 l of water water samples were collected from sw from january 2020 and from p1 p2 from september 2020 for measuring the main anions and cations in the laboratory of department of geology elte eötvös loránd university budapest hungary following the interaction of rooftop rainwater with shallow groundwater stable isotope δ18o and δ2h and tritium measurements started in december 2020 at hertelendi laboratory of environmental studies hekal debrecen hungary in addition detailed laboratory analysis of water samples including main and trace elements chemical oxygen demand cod and total suspended solids tss content as well started in february 2021 and continued seasonally at the mining and geological survey of hungary budapest hungary precipitation was sampled once in april 2021 two samples were taken pr precipitation collected directly in buckets rt rooftop rainwater collected from the pvc hoses total organic carbon toc and dissolved organic carbon doc content of sw p1 p2 pr and rt were measured once at the institute of aquatic ecology centre for ecological research budapest hungary considering the aims of the research these measurements were used i to determine the original water composition ii to monitor the occurring changes during the experimental period iii to follow the infiltration process by comparing the data sets of sw p1 and p2 iv to compare the results with the hungarian limit values for groundwater decree 2009 in order to delineate possible contaminants two control wells ke01 ke02 fig 1c were involved in the evaluation where rainwater is directed to the well by the residents for 30 and 10 years respectively they were sampled from september 2020 seasonally for main elements and once for detailed laboratory analysis in september 2021 main and trace elements as well to identify any long term contamination risk the water was sampled with a submersible pump after taking out approx 300 l of water similarly to sw detailed summary of monitored parameters and related accuracies the used methods and equipment can be found in table 1 4 results and interpretation 4 1 groundwater hydraulics and quantity 4 1 1 the recharge rate of sw the daily precipitation rates p observed in the study area between january 2020 and september 2021 are shown in fig 3 such p can be used to obtain an estimation of the collectable amount of rainwater that can artificially recharge the aquifer through sw the volumetric recharge rate of sw can be calculated based on equation 1 1 q s w a r p where q sw is the volumetric recharge rate of sw m3d 1 a r is the area of the rooftop m2 and p is the daily precipitation rate md 1 considering the area covered by the rooftop a r 80 m2 an event with p 0 01 md 1 would correspond to a volumetric recharge rate of sw of q sw 0 8 m3d 1 this linear calculation can be used to compute the cumulative q sw occurring during the experimental time which is shown in fig 3 the total amount of rainfall p tot at the end of the monitoring period a total of 20 months was p tot 0 7577 m thus resulting in q tot 60 616 m3 collected rainwater that could be used to artificially recharge the aquifer note that the actual amount of rainwater falling on the rooftop and reaching the well is influenced by many factors such as wind direction rainfall intensity rainfall length evaporation rate and the conditions of the gutter and pvc hose systems however we consider that the obtained values are a valid first cut indication of the scale of rainfall volumes that were recharging the aquifer through sw 4 1 2 temporal changes of water level the water level in sw p1 and p2 showed seasonal changes fig 4 a with an increase until the end of march 2020 a decrease until mid september 2020 then an increase until mid may 2021 and a decrease until the end of the experimental time end of september 2021 the aquifer response in sw is directly linked to the occurrence of the rainfall events i e rainfall driven aquifer recharge water level in sw is always higher than in p1 and p2 as it is the infiltration well and located slightly upgradient fig 2 the water level maximum of p1 and p2 occurs in march in 2020 and in may in 2021 the range of water level change in sw is approx 2 m while that in p1 and p2 is approx 1 m the water level time series of sw p1 and p2 were compared with the water level time series of shallow observation wells in the vicinity of kerekegyháza for location see fig 1c to evaluate the similarities and differences in the observed trends an overall water level decrease can be observed in all of the wells fig 4 and table 2 on average water levels decreased 0 28 m in one year between 21 sept 2020 and 2021 the rate of decline was 0 25 m 0 35 m and 0 32 m over one year for sw p1 and p2 respectively the least effected well is w 1387 located at the local discharge area where water level decreased only 0 07 m in a year the water level maximums decreased as well on average 0 22 m while in the experimental wells the rate of decrease was lower 0 21 m and 0 17 m for p1 and p2 respectively considering the temporal differences in the water level maximum of the wells in 2020 the water level maximum occurs much sooner in sw p1 and p2 than in the other wells may w 1458 w 1300 w 6960 july august w 3833 except for w 1387 in 2021 the water level maximums are observed in may june except for w 1458 which shows the highest values in july the autumn winter water level increase seen in the case of sw p1 and p2 does not or only less markedly occurs with the exception of w 6960 the behavior of the wells taking part in the experiment is very similar to the other observation wells in the area however the discovered differences namely the earlier water level maximum and the autumn water level increase might be caused by the rooftop rainwater infiltration 4 1 3 changes in water column increase to better understand the dynamics of rainwater infiltration through sw the induced water columns were evaluated the water level in sw is very sensitive to the precipitation events fig 4a similarly to a slug test the water level quickly increases when rainfall events occur as a consequence of the direct funneling of rooftop collected water inside the well after the precipitation events the water level decreases proportionally to the hydrodynamic properties of the aquifer specifically the hydraulic conductivity k and the specific yield s y the water level of sw shows a sudden increase and then a gradual decrease recession due to a precipitation event as the water seeps into the aquifer fig 4a however the precipitation rate p was not always linearly proportional to the increase of the water column δh induced by the funneled rooftop collected water for analyzing the relationship of p and δh 58 distinct precipitation events were selected each of them lasting for maximum one day fig 5 comparing p and δh two different correlations can be observed fig 5a the different seasons are showing different relationships in winter the water column increase is higher while in summer it is lower fig 5a spring and autumn events are falling into both of the groups if the potentially collectable amount of rooftop water fully reaches the well theoretically water level increases proportionally based on this the following equation equation 2 was introduced for the calculation of potential water column increase 2 δ h p o t p a r r s w 2 π where δh pot is the potential water column increase m p is the daily precipitation rate md 1 a r is the rooftop area m2 and r sw is the radius of sw m as an example theoretically 0 01 m precipitation induces 1 6 m water column increase however this exact relationship is rarely observed by comparing the ratio of the observed δh and the potential δh pot water column increase for the selected events with the daily average temperature a significant negative correlation r 0 74 p value 0 05 was obtained fig 5b higher temperatures can result in higher evaporation rates especially during summer thus less water can get into the well from the rooftop than in winter this can be one influencing factor however evaporation solely does not explain the observed changes as smaller ratios of δh and δh pot can be observed even in october and november when evaporation is not high fig 5c by evaluating the temporal distribution of the ratio of δh and δh pot for the selected events the following trends can be noticed fig 5c until may 2020 the average ratio of these values is 41 period i it s 6 during summer and autumn until december period ii 86 until may 2021 period iii and then decreased again to the average of 17 until september 2021 period iv note for the interpretation that the calculations are less reliable from event 21 08 01 as the precipitation data were measured at a different meteorological station see chapter 3 for details additionally the amount of water reaching the well is not measured but estimated and dependent on many factors see chapter 4 1 1 for details thus in some cases the ratio of δh and δh pot can be higher than 100 assuming that the system is working properly and all the rainwater from the rooftop enters the well the degree of water column rise depends on the rate of infiltration from the well to the aquifer during the precipitation event based on darcy s law the infiltration rate depends on the hydraulic head difference thus on the amount of precipitation in the well and the location of the water level in its surroundings and on the saturated hydraulic conductivity k of the aquifer freeze and cherry 1979 the decrease of the ratio of observed and the potential water column increase occurs in may in both years fig 5c after relatively low precipitation amounts in march and april see fig 4a these drier periods could result in lower water tables and drier conditions in the aquifer itself as well which could have an impact on the infiltration rates when the water table is lower and the pores are less saturated the infiltration from the shallow well can be more effective thus the water column increase in the well is lower this process however cannot be well detected with the selected 30 min measuring frequency the influence of hydraulic conductivity can be best observed on fig 5c there is a notable difference between period i and iii after 15 5 months of operation a 40 cm thick layer of fine sediments accumulated in the bottom of the well possibly decreasing the hydraulic conductivity due to clogging effect therefore in period iii the infiltration rate was slower so a larger water column could form fig 5c p1 and p2 also showed a response to precipitation events but to a lesser extent figs 4a 5d there were precipitation events when the water level increase in the monitoring wells was unambiguous e g summer of 2020 and there were events when natural daily water level fluctuations masked the effect of rainwater infiltration clogging process could also be detected by comparing sw and p2 levels fig 5d there s no significant difference between p1 and p2 water levels thus p2 was chosen for demonstration as this well provided more reliable results the first observable increase in p2 water level occurred on february 26 2020 one month after the project started between may and october 2020 the water level in p2 followed the water level of sw with higher peaks between october 2020 and may 2021 time of well maintenance sw showed much higher peaks however the water level of p2 barely increased after the precipitation events it can be assumed that clogging process advanced in sw during autumn 2020 and slowed down the infiltration process and impaired the connection between the wells however the well bottom did not clog entirely infiltration still occurred since the water level of sw declined after every precipitation event after cleaning the well bottom of sw the water levels of the wells changed similarly again without high peaks these results well correspond to the ones obtained from the comparison of observed and potential water column increases in sw fig 5c 4 1 4 infiltration curve analysis and changes in hydraulic conductivity one of the key parameters that determines the efficiency of shallow well infiltration is the hydraulic conductivity of the well bottom based on grain size distribution analysis the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer on average geometric mean is 1 8 10 6 m s 1 while the well bottom sediments after 15 5 months of infiltration showed 8 7 10 7 m s 1 in the upper part and 3 9 10 7 m s 1 in the lower part table 3 the hydraulic conductivity of the well bottom was also estimated by infiltration curve analysis slug test with bouwer and rice method bouwer and rice 1976 the result of each evaluated infiltration curve is plotted in chronological order in fig 6 to follow the temporal changes in hydraulic conductivity thus the effectiveness of infiltration before cleaning the well bottom may 2021 most of the events showed k values between 1 and 3 10 7 m s 1 with the exception of 3 winter precipitation events after the accumulated sediments were removed the hydraulic conductivity increased even reaching 1 2 10 6 m s 1 fig 6 these results are in accordance with the ones obtained from grain size distribution analysis and from the evaluation of water column changes chapter 4 1 3 4 2 consequences on groundwater quality and temperature 4 2 1 composition of main ions in water first of all baseline conditions were surveyed by sampling sw on january 14 2020 before the project started fig 7 table a1 the shallow water composition showed mg2 and hco3 dominance the total dissolved solids content tds was considerably high 1743 mg l 1 as well as mg2 na cl so4 2 no3 concentrations sw displayed a significant improvement in water quality during the experiment fig 7 table a1 2 mg2 na cl so4 2 no3 concentrations and tds decreased significantly due to rainwater infiltration an initial decrease of 87 82 81 88 35 and 81 respectively was observed after the infiltration started sampling time 31 01 20 and a further 96 93 68 58 96 and 35 decrease occurred in these parameters by the end of the monitoring period sampling time 21 09 21 initially no3 exceeded the limit value for shallow groundwater 50 μg l 1 decree 2009 but from june 2020 the values complied with the legislation while ca2 and hco3 concentrations and tds to some extent were constantly changing in time depending on the rainfall amount reaching the well the first measurements of p1 and p2 occurred in september 2020 7 months after the project started fig 7 table a1 in contrast with the decreasing trends observed in sw a slight increase in mg2 na cl so4 2 no3 concentrations and increasing tds were detected no3 displayed the highest variability in this regard 4 2 2 trace elements and possible contaminants the quality of precipitation pr and rooftop water rt were examined and the results mostly complied with the hungarian legislation regarding groundwater table a2 decree 6 2009 except for nh4 and zn nh4 was slightly higher in pr than the limit value 0 5 mg l 1 however higher concentrations were not detected in sw in any of the samples in rt only zinc concentration exceeded the limit value 200 μg l 1 which was also notably high 114 249 μg l 1 in sw fig 8 a but overall it decreased during the observation period based on the comparison of pr and rt samples rooftop water was enriched in a number of trace elements compared to rainwater table a2 zinc concentration was 48 2 times higher in rooftop water in case of sr cu mn ba and al it was about 6 9 6 4 3 3 6 and 1 9 times higher in roof runoff respectively these results indicate that the roof material the gutters and the tube system are affecting the water quality furthermore doc toc cod and tds are all higher in the rooftop water than in the precipitation on the other hand in the shallow well the values are not elevated so the sedimentation and or degradation of organic matter on the bottom of the well can be assumed the sedimentation process was also confirmed when the well bottom was cleaned in may 2021 a 40 cm thick mud layer accumulated on the bottom after only 15 5 months of infiltration the organic content of the samples was not significant loi was 3 41 for the upper layer sw t and 2 53 for the lower layer sw b in the monitoring wells toc and tss content is high compared to pr rt and sw it might have a natural geological reason or it might be due to the design of the wells cod values are similar in sw and in p1 p2 in sw water quality complied with the hungarian limit values for groundwater with zinc being the only exception table a2 decree 6 2009 in p1 and p2 no3 concentrations were significant 81 165 mg l 1 and in some cases nh4 and po4 3 exceeded the limit comparing the trace element composition of sw and p1 p2 the following trends can be observed zinc concentrations are significantly higher compared to p1 and p2 while it decreased in sw it fluctuated in the monitoring wells fig 8a copper and arsenic concentrations were constantly changing in all three wells not showing an exact trend fig 8b and c they slightly increased in sw and decreased in p1 however their concentrations were well below the limit values 200 μg l 1 for cu and 10 μg l 1 for as manganese concentrations were quite low in sw but showed an increase the values were one order of magnitude higher in p1 and decreased by the end of the monitoring period p2 values were falling in between and also increased fig 8e in contrast ferrous iron and aluminum concentrations were low in all three wells except for 1 1 occasional increase in sw and p2 fig 8d g phosphate showed an increase in sw while it decreased in p1 and in p2 after the second sampling fig 8f boron showed very low concentrations in sw and significantly higher ones in p1 and p2 additionally a constant decrease can be observed in the latter ones fig 8h uranium showed a similar picture but a decrease can only be observed in p2 fig 8j silicic acid content was also lower in sw and increased during the monitoring period while it was higher in p1 p2 and showed a decrease only in p1 fig 8l although barium concentrations increased as well in sw there was no observable trend for p1 and p2 fig 8k strontium concentrations changed similarly in all three wells during the monitoring period however sw showed significantly lower values than p1 and p2 fig 8i 4 2 3 water chemistry of the control wells we used the data of two additional shallow wells control wells with rainwater infiltration from the surroundings of the experimental area fig 1c for comparison to better understand the long term effect of rainwater infiltration on groundwater quality the water composition of ke02 was quite stable while that of ke01 showed seasonal variations the control wells were showing very similar compositions to sw table a1 low tds and low mg2 na cl so4 2 no3 concentrations on the other hand in both wells the po4 3 concentration exceeded the limit value for groundwater 0 5 mg l 1 all other values were compliant with the legislation the zinc values 38 and 70 μg l 1 were lower than in sw but higher than in p1 and p2 cod was also slightly higher in the control wells than in sw p1 and p2 this can be the cause of sediment load from the roof to the wells because there are no filters built in these systems 4 2 4 isotopic changes isotope measurements were included in the research to follow the effects of the infiltration process the observed δ2h and δ18o trends in the wells showed similar patterns especially in case of δ18o fig 9 a and b the range of change was much higher in sw while it was lower for p1 and p2 similar changes can be observed on fig 9c as well this shows the effect of rooftop water inflow to the infiltration well significant effect of evaporation cannot be seen for sw the lowest values can be observed in december 2020 and the highest ones in march 2021 both in terms of δ2h and δ18o for p1 and p2 the values of δ2h were barely changing while δ18o showed seasonal changes the lowest values were observed in june 2021 and the highest ones in march 2021 the measured values are close to the global gmwl and local meteoric waterlines lmwl with the exception of the samples taken from sw in december 2020 and from p1 and p2 in june 2021 fig 9c tritium increased in sw decreased in p1 and was quite stable in p2 fig 9d at the depth of p1 and p2 tritium values of 3 5 4 0 tu are expected in the study area palcsu et al 2017 the elevated tritium concentrations in sw can be attributed to the contribution of the precipitation which has an annual variation between 5 and 15 tu palcsu et al 2018 the highest tritium values of 10 tu sampled in september 2021 can be explained by the inflow of summer precipitation with higher tritium concentration 4 2 5 water temperature changes water temperature changes of the wells were compared with each other and with the daily average air temperatures to evaluate the effect of rooftop rainwater infiltration sw showed lower temperature values than p1 and p2 fig 10 the infiltrated water significantly affected the water temperatures in sw which is represented by the positive heating and negative cooling anomalies in the dataset the collected water had a cooling effect on well water until may 2020 then a heating effect until october 2020 a cooling effect until may 2021 and then a heating effect again until the end of the monitoring period september 2021 on the other hand seasonal changes are also observable in sw water temperature increased until october 2020 decreased until february 2021 and increased again until september 2021 the range of temperature changes during the monitoring period is approx 6 5 c in sw and 1 5 c in p1 and p2 the air temperature reached its maximum in august while the water temperature in the shallow well in october and that of the monitoring wells in december the colder winter precipitation had a cooling effect on the water of sw which can also indirectly cause cooling in p1 p2 wells by june the water heats back up by december and then cools down again by june in these wells 5 discussion based on the interpretation of individual results and literature review the most significant findings related to the field experiment can be discussed the extension possibilities of the results were also evaluated for the area and for different regions worldwide 5 1 quantitative potential of rrwh sw all of the wells including sw p1 p2 and the observation wells in the vicinity of kerekegyháza showed a decrease in water levels figs 1c and 4 following the long term trend of the area i e declining water level e g garamhegyi et al 2020 although the water level in sw and in the monitoring wells p1 p2 did not increase permanently during the monitoring period the effect of infiltration has been confirmed comparing the water levels of sw p1 p2 with other observation wells from the area showed that water level maximum occurs earlier in the wells which are part of the experiment and the autumn winter water level increase is only present in one other well apart from the experimental ones fig 4 based on the results of analyzing the differences between the precipitation and water column increase ratios chapter 4 1 3 seasonality strongly affects the infiltration process sw infiltrates the aquifer faster after dryer periods i e drought and when the water table is lower if the summer precipitation can be collected in sufficient amount in the infiltration well evaporation loss is reduced and this water can effectively recharge the uppermost aquifer considering that the natural infiltration of precipitation in the danube tisza interfluve is only 14 9 due to high evaporation rates approx 80 90 szilágyi et al 2012 collecting rainwater and thus water retention in the saturated zone is highly important in the area although the infiltrated water amount during the observation period was only 60 616 m3 approx 40 m3y 1 by involving more rooftops into the experiment thus increasing the amount of harvestable rainwater the impact of rrwh sw on water levels would be more significant based on gis based settlement scale calculations of yousif 2022 the total roof covered area in kerekegyháza is 0 55 km2 15 of the total area thus calculating with an average of 515 mm annual precipitation the total collectable water amount from the roofs of kerekegyháza is 283 250 m3y 1 which is a remarkable potential based on simple water balance calculations infiltrating all the collectable water from roofs would increase the groundwater table with approx 0 27 m in one year which is comparable with the yearly decrease of water table yousif 2022 the collectable volume of rainwater can be further increased if surface runoff was collected from roads as well shekh 2021 the treated wastewater of the settlement offers additional opportunities however for the safe reuse of these waters further field experiments and water chemical measurements are needed in the future 5 2 qualitative potential of rrwh sw the observed concentration changes in sw namely the decrease of mg2 na cl so4 2 no3 and tds indicate significant improvement in shallow groundwater quality due to the infiltration of rainwater to the well fig 7 hasan et al 2018 achieved similar results after 5 months of infiltration while dillon and barry 2005 could only reach temporary water quality improvement in 2 years due to high tds of native groundwater in case of sw these changes could be maintained no significant increase was observable during the 20 months of the project the measurements made in the control wells ke01 and ke02 also confirmed that long term improvement in water quality is achievable with this method thus by infiltrating rainwater directly to the saturated zone shallow groundwater can be diluted therefore resulting in better quality rainwater stored underground can be abstracted later on for irrigation if needed as the water chemical parameters are adequate for that groundwater quality improvement is not yet observable after 20 months in the monitoring wells p1 p2 located 8 3 m and 12 3 m from sw on the contrary an increase in the concentration of these parameters can be seen it can be assumed that the surroundings of sw were contaminated before the experiment fig 7 sampling time 14 01 20 and the infiltrated rainwater pushed forward this water in the direction of local groundwater flow thus in the direction of the monitoring wells in the future it is expected that these concentrations will start to decrease similarly to the changes occurring in sw indicating this supposed process a decrease in u b po4 3 h2sio3 concentrations occurs either in p1 or p2 or both fig 8 these changes might be attributed to rainwater infiltration but at this state of the research it cannot be stated with high certainty and further monitoring of water quality is needed nevertheless water samples from sw and the monitoring wells are well separated in terms of zn u b sr and h2sio3 concentrations fig 8 so these parameters and the main water composition can be selected as natural tracers to monitor the movement of infiltrated water in the saturated zone the effect of rainwater infiltration on stable isotope composition of the wells is already observable in sw the range of change in δ2h and δ18o was higher in this well however in p1 and p2 it is not yet evident fig 9 summer and autumn samples are very similar to each other however when more rainwater is accumulated winter and spring the wells are showing high differences in isotopic compositions these differences might also be helpful in the future to track groundwater movement from sw similarly to main and trace element compositions and groundwater temperature 5 3 environmental impacts of rrwh sw sampling of precipitation pr and rooftop rainwater rt showed table a2 that despite enrichment in some trace elements zn sr cu mn ba and al chapter 4 2 2 infiltrating rainwater through sw is able to dilute shallow groundwater and possible contamination is limited to only a few parameters zinc not only occurs in rooftop rainwater in higher concentrations but in sw as well this is a common problem associated with rainwater harvesting systems as the steel roofs or in our case gutters have an effect on the water composition meera and mansoor ahammed 2006 dillon and barry 2005 had similar findings in kingswood australia where they observed 80 248 μg l 1 zinc levels in the rainwater storage tank which they used for well infiltration the control wells ke01 and ke02 which are in operation for 30 and 10 years respectively also showed elevated zinc levels 69 4 and 38 μg l 1 however they stayed well below the limit value 200 μg l 1 these results indicate that the rainwater collecting systems are affecting the water quality of these wells too but considering that rainwater funneling to these wells takes place already for several years zinc do not pose a high risk on groundwater quality in the long run contaminating groundwater with zinc is a possible risk related to rrwh sw thus it must be monitored in order to avoid any serious problems additionally the decrease in zn concentration in sw and lower concentrations measured in ke01 and ke02 can indicate the potential adsorption of zn on clay minerals or bonding to organic matter at the bottom of the well which has to be examined in the future in order to better understand the ongoing processes several parameters showed concentration increase in sw which can cause groundwater contamination such as cu as po4 2 and ba but their concentrations were well below the limit values thus they do not pose a risk apart from the elevated zn concentrations the increase of cu mn sr ba concentrations in sw can be attributed to rainwater infiltration as rooftop collected water showed enrichment in these elements table a2 ammonium only exceeded the limit value in the precipitation sample but not in the samples taken from sw thus it does not pose a considerable risk ke01 and ke02 showed slightly elevated values of po4 3 however its source is not clear it can either come from roof runoff or can be the sign of previous contamination from leaking cesspools phosphorus and nitrogen are common component of rainwater harvested from roofs due to atmospheric deposition from transport industrial processes and application of fertilizers novak et al 2014 5 4 clogging one of the reasons of why the authorities advise against rrwh sw is clogging of the well bottom ministry of interior 2017 clogging is a general process related to all mar facilities dillon et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 and it has to be managed but it does not necessarily make the infiltration impossible clogging of the well bottom was identifiable through analyzing the water level time series of sw chapter 4 1 3 and 4 1 4 and during the maintenance of the well bottom however the infiltration during the experiment was successful the accumulated mud at the bottom did not impede the infiltration significantly during the monitoring period although higher water columns could form in sw during partially clogged conditions the collected water always seeped into the aquifer in relatively short time max 1 2 weeks depending on the precipitation rate the reason behind is that higher water columns can even accelerate the infiltration rate by increasing the vertical hydraulic gradient thus act against efficiency decrease induced by clogging this is an advantage of using dug wells with large diameter and open bottom the increased water columns in the infiltration well can be used for indicating the need for maintenance if the ratio of δh and δh pot is higher than 50 60 for 3 consecutive precipitation events clogging of the well bottom can be assumed and measures should be taken to remedy the problem 5 5 limitations of the experiment for further considerations in our experiment the design of rrwh sw was intentionally kept simple in order to investigate the problems that might occur during the operation of these systems and observe its environmental effects on the other hand using first flush removal devices sedimentation tanks and filters can significantly improve water quality especially considering the amount of sediment and organic matter load to the well dillon and barry 2005 barry et al 2013 wang et al 2015 dillon et al 2016 soni et al 2020 the use of these complementary settings is highly recommended during the implementation of real systems furthermore using water flow meters would help determining the exact amount of water reaching the infiltration well from the gutters and thus it would enable a more accurate estimation of the efficiency of water harvesting the selected monitoring frequency of 30 min was adequate to investigate the efficiency of the system however in order to better understand the infiltration process during a specific infiltration event especially in drier periods i e summer more frequent measurements are needed seasonal monitoring of water chemical parameters gave information on water quality changes both in sw and in p1 p2 in the case of sw the water quality improvement was observable from the beginning of the experiment however these changes were not yet visible in p1 p2 additionally the sampling of well bottom sediments for total element concentration would give insight on the sedimentation and adsorption of elements during the infiltration process for these reasons the experiment is still ongoing in order to observe the long term water chemical changes induced by rooftop rainwater infiltration in the monitoring wells too to rule out any possible contamination effect and thus gain acceptance and trust of the residents regarding rrwh sw systems water balance calculations yousif 2022 suggest that the town scale potential of rrwh sh is quite remarkable in order to determine the effect of town scale rainwater harvesting more accurately detailed geological and hydrogeological investigation of the area and 3d numerical modeling studies are needed to delineate possible sites for new infiltration structures suitability mapping could be a useful tool either on regional or local scale adham et al 2016 5 6 relevance and applicability of this research on settlement scale the obtained results from the experiment can serve as a basis for numerical modeling studies for settlement scale implementation of rrwh sw in kerekegyháza and in the danube tisza interfluve this solution can provide a cheap local scale and environmentally promising water replenishment method for the region suffering from serious water shortage the experimental results however are not only applicable for the study region but can be used in other regions of the earth as well there is a growing need worldwide for the development of municipal rainwater and stormwater management from all sides residents municipalities public utilities water directorates etc to avoid flash floods and related geoengineering problems and to preserve water for droughts melville shreeve 2017 palla et al 2017 hussain et al 2019 tamagnone et al 2020 qin 2020 boroomandnia et al 2021 rainwater management is necessary from a protection point of view but it is equally important to retain water and thus to adapt to climate change to counteract overexploitation and to contribute to reaching sustainability e g pandey et al 2003 qi et al 2019 amos et al 2020 socioeconomic acceptance and residents participation is crucial for household level implementation of these systems and proper guidelines policies and governmental subsidies can increase the willingness to harvest rainwater barthwal et al 2014 pawar et al 2014 the results of this study and similar pilot projects such as pavelic et al 2020 for basaltic terrains or dillon and barry 2005 for borewells can help to better understand the ongoing processes during rainfall events and promote the implementation of such projects worldwide 6 conclusions and recommendations the 20 month long monitoring of a field scale rooftop rainwater harvesting and shallow well infiltration experiment can provide conclusions for the pilot area and can give basis for extending the application of this method to settlement level and using it in other parts of the danube tisza interfluve area in addition general conclusions can be drawn for similar projects in porous unconfined aquifers worldwide direct conclusions for the pilot area 1 quantitative changes and water level trends the total of 60 616 m3 infiltrated precipitation as a sporadic phenomenon had little effect on the general decreasing water level trend observed in the monitoring wells of the pilot the rate of water level decline on average was 0 28 m in the area between sept 2020 and 2021 in the experimental wells sw p1 p2 0 25 m 0 35 m and 0 32 m water level decrease was observed in one year respectively on the other hand by increasing the involved rooftop areas and continuing the infiltration could increase the quantitative potential of the method on settlement level based on yousif 2022 the water level increase can even reach 0 27 m y 1 if the total collectable water amount of the roofs is infiltrated 2 indication and troubleshooting of clogging the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer originally was 1 8 10 6 m s 1 the well bottom sediments after 15 5 months of infiltration showed k values of 8 7 10 7 m s 1 in the upper part and 3 9 10 7 m s 1 in the lower part by removing the accumulated sediment layer the hydraulic conductivity of the well bottom increased to that of the aquifer 3 diluting effect of infiltration on groundwater quality in the pilot a significant improvement in water quality was achieved mg2 na cl so4 2 no3 concentrations and tds decreased by 87 82 81 88 35 and 81 respectively after the infiltration started and a further 96 93 68 58 96 and 35 decrease occurred in these parameters by the end of the monitoring period this improvement could be maintained throughout the experiment and no significant increase occurred in these parameters 4 trace element enrichment in rooftop collected water concentration of zn sr cu mn ba and al were 48 2 6 9 6 4 3 3 6 and 1 9 times higher respectively in roof runoff than in the precipitation despite the observed enrichment none of them poses a considerable risk to groundwater quality the only exception is zn whose concentrations in sw 114 249 μg l 1 varied around the limit value for shallow groundwater 200 μg l 1 however its concentration decreased during the monitoring period and samples from the control wells also indicated lower values which is a positive sign for long term applications conclusions for similar projects anywhere 1 methodology the introduced experimental setup namely a shallow dug well with two monitoring wells and involvement of further shallow reference wells with the monitored parameters can be adequate for groundwater quantity and quality evaluation regarding rooftop rainwater harvesting the long term more than 1 year monitoring could provide insight on not only seasonal but multiannual processes and the effects of extreme precipitations which is significant to adapt to long term water shortage 2 parameters to follow quantitative effects the recharge rate in the infiltration well water column changes temporal changes of water level due to infiltration are applicable parameters for quantitative evaluation of the impacts in any study area 3 efficiency of infiltration continuous water level measurement in the infiltration well is an easy relatively inexpensive and suitable way to monitor the efficiency of the process monitoring water column increase and comparing it with the calculated potential water column increase as well as infiltration curve analysis after precipitation events can provide immediate information on the operation of the system 4 maintenance the water column increase in the infiltration well can be the sign of clogging thus it can be used for indicating the need for maintenance if the ratio of δh and δh pot is higher than 50 60 for 3 consecutive precipitation events clogging of the well bottom can be assumed and measures can be taken to remedy the problem 5 environmental tracers to monitor the pathways of infiltration environmental isotopes are useful tracers to monitor the infiltration process due the isotopic differences in precipitation and groundwater temperature is another useful parameter as the temperature of precipitation is changing seasonally while that of groundwater is more stable during the experiment further natural tracers were found zn u b sr and h2sio3 to monitor the pathway of infiltrated rainwater plume in groundwater as they have significantly different concentrations in sw and in p1 p2 based on the results and conclusions of the field experiment the following recommendations are given for the implementation and monitoring of rrwh sw systems on household level 1 the materials and conditions of the rooftop and the gutters should be checked and if needed it should be renovated before implementation of rrwh sw 2 at least a filter mesh should be used in order to filter out larger contaminants e g leaves further instruments such as first flush devices and sedimentation tanks can be used to decrease the amount of sediment load to the well 3 the well and the well bottom should be cleaned before infiltration if possible initial pumping of the well is advisable to freshen the water and to avoid initial contamination 4 proper maintenance of the gutters filters and the well bottom especially during and after autumn is essential for maintaining the efficiency of the system water column increase can help delineate clogging and indicate the need for maintenance 5 sampling of direct precipitation and roof collected rainwater is necessary to delineate enrichment and possible contaminants further monitoring of critical parameters is advisable in the infiltration well 6 if the continuous monitoring is not possible at least seasonal water level and water quality measurements for main and critical elements are suggested to follow the infiltration process preparing guidelines on how to properly implement maintain and monitor rrwh sw systems taking into consideration national and european union law regarding groundwater could improve the effectivity of water retention and turn rrwh sw from an unfavorable practice to a water management measure capable

11724,groundwater levels have declined significantly in the last decades in many parts of the world due to anthropogenic activities and climate change the study focuses on the long term potential and environmental impacts of rooftop rainwater harvesting coupled with shallow well infiltration which is a local scale inexpensive solution that could contribute to easing water shortage the danube tisza interfluve hungary was used as a study area where a field experiment was set up funneling rainwater from the roof of a family house to the shallow dug well in the yard connected to a porous unconfined aquifer changes in groundwater levels as well as thermal hydrochemical and isotopic footprints were monitored and evaluated for over 600 days to determine the quantitative and qualitative effects of this method and to identify the long term physico chemical impacts of infiltrated water on ambient groundwater during the monitoring period 60 616 m3 of precipitation was infiltrated through the shallow well that could achieve significant water quality improvement mg2 na cl so4 2 no3 concentrations and tds decreased by 35 88 after the infiltration started and a further 35 96 decrease occurred in these parameters by the end of the monitoring period rooftop collected water was enriched in zn sr cu mn ba and al their concentrations being 1 9 48 2 times higher in roof runoff than in the precipitation the monitoring of water column changes and infiltration curve analysis after precipitation events helped identifying the clogging process that decreased the hydraulic conductivity of the well bottom by one order of magnitude the results of this research provide information on the efficiency and environmental impacts of the pilot project and contribute to the extension of the design to town level and to similar settlements in the area additionally general conclusions can be drawn to promote the implementation of similar projects in porous unconfined aquifers worldwide graphical

infrastructural social and economic problems worldwide treidel et al 2011 taylor et al 2013 harrison et al 2015 arnell et al 2016 at the same time the need for irrigation increases the use of fresh groundwater globally zhou et al 2010 wada et al 2013 wu et al 2020 these two effects can cause serious water shortage in many parts of the world including e g california usa northern india the north china plain the middle east rodell et al 2018 etc in the field of water management one of the most significant ways to achieve adaptation to climate change is mar which is the purposeful recharge of water to aquifers for subsequent recovery or environmental benefit nrmmc 2009 it is a group of nature inspired approaches that promote the accumulation of water reserves under the surface and support the joint management of surface waters and groundwaters evans and dillon 2018 dillon et al 2018 managed aquifer recharge is a suitable way to reduce the inequalities of water conditions and helps mitigating the related consequences this solution can contribute to the rehabilitation of groundwater depletion restoration of pressure levels in aquifers avoiding declining yields halting ground subsidence improving water quality and maintaining groundwater dependent ecosystems e g gale 2005 dillon et al 2009 dillon et al 2018 different types of mar methods can be used based on the local environmental conditions and opportunities geomorphology geology water availability hydrogeology etc as well as on the aims of the aquifer recharge igrac 2007 dillon et al 2009 spreading methods e g infiltration ponds and basins induced bank filtration and well shaft and borehole recharge are used to enhance infiltration and replenishment while in channel modifications and rainwater and runoff harvesting are mainly aimed at intercepting the water igrac 2007 these methods can be well combined with each other e g rainwater and runoff harvesting can serve as the water source for infiltration basins or wells to replenish groundwater reservoirs rainwater can be infiltrated via ponds basins and ditches through the unsaturated zone or using wells thus leading water directly to the saturated zone gale 2005 dillon et al 2009 the latter solution has several advantages including lower evaporation loss faster increase of groundwater level smaller surface area use and lower risk of biological activity on the other hand adequate water quality of infiltrated water is crucial in this case in order to avoid groundwater contamination gale 2005 dillon et al 2009 casanova et al 2016 page et al 2018 one of the areas in hungary suffering from serious water shortage is the danube tisza interfluve dti fig 1 where water level reduction and related water management problems started in the 1970s major and neppel 1988 the water shortage of the area can be attributed to several factors climate change especially the reduction and change in the distribution of precipitation and yearly average temperature increase played an important role in the occurring processes additionally several types of human activities such as land use changes afforestation shallow and deep groundwater abstraction canalization and land drainage contributed to the water level decrease pálfai 1993 2010 kovács et al 2017 the degree of water level decline is approx 2 3 m but in some areas it can reach even 6 7 m major and neppel 1988 szilágyi and vorosmarty 1997 szalai and nagy 2006 these processes caused major agricultural ecological and other related social problems ladányi et al 2009 kovács et al 2017 in the ridge part of the dti many shallow wells and lakes have dried out as an example lake kondor sw of kerekegyháza fig 1c as a wetland almost entirely disappeared ujházy and biró 2013 and most of the dug wells of kerekegyháza run out of water based on personal communications with the residents many plans were worked out in the last decades involving large cross regional technical investments but none of them fully materialized due to financial and ecological concerns kovács et al 2017 different replenishment scenarios were made for channeling river water from the danube to the area e g orlóci 2003 alföldi and kapolyi 2011 nagy et al 2016 other plans tried to offer a solution by constructing reservoirs even using them for infiltration nemere 1994 gyirán 2009 nagy et al 2016 the problem has been unresolved for decades but its severity is growing in light of the ongoing climate change as dti is one of the most vulnerable areas in the country in this regard nccs 2018 in hungary the annual average temperature is expected to increase by 4 5 4 c and the annual precipitation is likely to decrease by about 20 by the end of the century pieczka et al 2011 a further increase in weather extremes e g occurrence of droughts are expected bartholy et al 2014 as well as a significant decrease in the climatic water balance rotárné szalkai et al 2015 the unconfined aquifers have adequate storage capacity and this would provide an opportunity for more efficient water retention and water replenishment on local scale páris 2009 therefore one of the aims of this research is to evaluate the water replenishment possibilities of the shallow porous aquifers of the dti from a different perspective by investigating a local water replenishment method rooftop rainwater harvesting rrwh coupled with shallow well infiltration rrwh sw was selected for this purpose for the following reasons i the only possible local source of replenishment in the area is rainwater ii using dug wells is possibly the most inexpensive and most convenient way of water replenishment in the area these wells are already available and usually not used anymore because either they have dried out or the water quality of shallow groundwater is not adequate anymore by using them for infiltration they could have a new purpose in water management iii using dug wells for rainwater collection or disposal is an existing practice in the area however it is not favored by the authorities as it might pose a risk to groundwater quality and fine sediments may clog the pores of the well bottom ministry of interior 2017 in order to recommend these systems to the authorities and residents assurance of the effectiveness of the method is needed and the possible downsides should be assessed consequently the second aim is to demonstrate the quantitative and qualitative potential and environmental impacts of the method several former research proved that rainwater harvesting either collected from roofs and roads can be an effective tool to increase groundwater levels especially on catchment scale e g sayana et al 2010 glendenning and vervoort 2010 jebamalar et al 2012 jebamalar et al 2021 mapping of suitable

ahammed 2006 its quality depends on several important factors like pollutant concentration in the rain location of the site distance from pollutant sources material and physical properties of the roof

meera and mansoor ahammed 2006 however for tile roofs the enrichment factor of zn in roof runoff is much lower other parameters such as turbidity hardness and nitrate content can increase in roof runoff from tile roofs meera and mansoor ahammed 2018 in order to guarantee the long term efficiency of rrwh sw systems in a porous aquifer both in terms of quantity and water quality the implementation of a field experiment seems to be an adequate method however in order to exclude the effects of seasonality a continuous monitoring scheme and an observation period longer than one hydrologic year is needed based on these preliminary considerations the objectives of this study were to carry out a long term experimental field study i to assess the quantitative and ii qualitative potential of rooftop rainwater harvesting coupled with shallow well infiltration rrwh sw iii to determine the related environmental consequences especially related to groundwater contamination iv to examine the effect of clogging and v to evaluate the significance of the results on settlement regional scales and globally although the results of the experimental study directly widen the scope of water replenishment possibilities in the dti the results for an unconfined porous environment can also provide thorough information on the solution s long term potential and environmental impacts 2 characterization of the pilot site in the study area the study area is located in the danube tisza interfluve area hungary fig 1 the dti is a ridge region up to 130 140 m a s l between danube and tisza rivers the river valleys are situated at 85 90 m above sea level the experiment is located in a small rural town kerekegyháza which is situated on the western side of the elevated ridge on the catchment area of the danube in the surroundings of kerekegyháza the topographical elevation difference is less than 10 m 109 118 m a s l fig 1c the near surface aquifers and aquitards of the area consist of sand coarse silt peat mud clay and calcareous mud the shallow groundwater flow systems of the elevated ridge region are under the effect of topography driven meteoric flow regime and in shallow depth ca mg hco3 2 type waters are predominant mádl szőnyi and tóth 2009 the study area is located in the recharge area the vertical hydraulic gradient is approx 2 4 10 2 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2009 based on fig 1c the horizontal hydraulic gradient is one order of magnitude lower 1 5 10 3 the climate of the study area is moderately warm and dry the average annual temperature is around 11 c the annual average rainfall is 500 550 mm y 1 with an uneven temporal distribution the number of hours of sunshine is considered high in hungary exceeding 2000 h per year omsz website the rate of evapotranspiration is 80 90 of the annual precipitation on average 470 mm szilágyi et al 2012 using 3h 3he age profiling to a well nest in a near study area 5 km the recharge rate has been estimated to be 48 6 mm y 1 palcsu et al 2017 which is about 9 of the annual precipitation being in a good agreement with the evapotranspiration rate in january 2020 a field experiment was set up funneling rainwater from the roof of a family house into an abandoned shallow dug well sw located in the house yard fig 2 sw is 6 2 m deep with an open bottom its diameter being 0 8 m the well is screened in an unconfined shallow aquifer consisting of sand and silt although sw was not used in the past we found it in excellent conditions the concrete rings were intact and it was still covered with a tin lid sw was found not dry before rainwater infiltration started with an initial water column of about 0 7 m during preliminary cleaning the mud was removed from the bottom before the start of the experiment and once again in may 2021 to maintain the infiltration efficiency of sw since the rainwater was introduced into sw solely driven by gravitation in the experiment i e no pumps were used the term infiltration describes better the rainwater harvesting process rather than injection the overall inclined rooftop area was 115 m2 considering vertical rainfall this corresponded to about 80 m2 of projected flat surface receiving rainfall thus the potentially collectable amount of vertical rainfall was 80 m2 multiplied by the precipitation rates the shallow dug well was connected to the rooftop gutters by pvc hoses the gutters were cleaned twice during the experimental time before the experiment started and in december 2020 the water passed through a filter mesh before it entered the tube system to impede the entrance of leaves and other larger objects into the well the filter mesh did not however remove fine grained materials the filters were changed in december 2020 and may 2021 two monitoring wells p1 and p2 were constructed in the direction of groundwater flow for water level observation and for sampling purposes as schematically shown in fig 2 the radial distance between sw and p1 is 8 3 m and between sw and p2 is 12 3 m the depth of the monitoring wells is 6 7 m of which the last 1 m is screened the diameter of the wells is 0 04 m 3 material and methods understanding the shortcomings of previous field experiments regarding rooftop rainwater harvesting coupled with shallow wells water level temperature and specific electrical conductivity were recorded continuously every half hour in sw and in the monitoring wells by automatic data loggers to collect information about the changes in these parameters and thus the impact of the rainfall harvesting process on native groundwater in addition meteorological data precipitation and daily average temperature were available from időkép kft measured in kerekegyháza between january 28 2020 and june 29 2021 and from the hungarian meteorological service omsz measured in the neighboring village fülöpháza from june 30 2021 complimentary water level monitoring data of 5 shallow monitoring wells were used which were acquired from the territorially competent water directorate aduvízig to compare them with the time series data measured in sw p1 and p2 during the experiment the maximum distance of these wells from the pilot site was 5 km fig 1c in order to get to know the shallow unconfined environment sediment samples were collected from the aquifer during drilling of p1 sample dr a and from the bottom of sw samples sw t from the upper layer and st b from the lower layer during maintenance may 2021 grain size measurements were carried out by sieving above d 0 063 mm and elutriation below d 0 063 mm in the laboratory of department of geology elte eötvös loránd university budapest hungary the organic matter can influence contamination fate and transport therefore it was estimated for sw t and st b by measuring loss on ignition loi at 550 c hydraulic conductivity k values were determined using the excel based tool called hydrogeosievexl devlin 2015 hydraulic conductivity of the well bottom was also estimated by evaluating infiltration curves for 22 selected precipitation events as slug tests using the aquifertest 11 0 pro software wh 2021 the bouwer rice method bouwer and rice 1976 was found to be the most applicable for the experiment the following parameters were used for the evaluation unconfined aquifer aquifer thickness 20 m partially penetrating well well diameter 0 4 m screen length 0

the laboratory of department of geology elte eötvös loránd university budapest hungary following the interaction of rooftop rainwater with shallow groundwater stable isotope δ18o and δ2h and tritium measurements started in december 2020 at hertelendi laboratory of environmental studies hekal debrecen hungary in addition detailed laboratory analysis of water samples including main and trace elements chemical oxygen demand cod and total suspended solids tss content as well started in february 2021 and continued seasonally at the mining and geological survey of hungary budapest hungary

dissolved organic carbon doc content of sw p1 p2 pr and rt were measured once at the institute of aquatic ecology centre for ecological research budapest hungary considering the aims of the research these measurements were used i to determine the original water composition ii to monitor the occurring changes during the experimental period iii to follow the infiltration process by comparing the data sets of sw p1 and p2 iv to compare the results with the hungarian limit values for groundwater decree 2009 in order to delineate possible contaminants two control wells ke01 ke02 fig 1c were involved in the evaluation where rainwater is directed to the well by the residents for 30 and 10 years respectively they were sampled from september 2020 seasonally for main elements and once for detailed laboratory analysis in september 2021 main and trace elements as well to identify any long term contamination risk the water was sampled with a submersible pump after taking out approx 300 l of water similarly to sw detailed summary of monitored parameters and related accuracies the used methods and equipment can be found in table 1 4 results and interpretation 4 1 groundwater hydraulics and quantity 4 1 1 the recharge rate of sw the daily precipitation rates p observed in the study area between january 2020 and september 2021 are shown in fig 3 such p can be used to obtain an estimation of the collectable amount of rainwater that can artificially recharge the aquifer through sw the volumetric recharge rate of sw can be calculated based on equation 1 1 q s w a r p where q sw is the volumetric recharge rate of sw m3d 1 a r is the area of the rooftop m2 and p is the daily precipitation rate md 1 considering the area covered by the rooftop a r 80 m2 an event with p 0 01 md 1 would correspond to a volumetric recharge rate of sw of q sw 0 8 m3d 1 this linear calculation can be used to compute the cumulative q sw occurring during the experimental time which is shown in fig 3 the total amount of rainfall p tot at the end of the monitoring period a total of 20 months was p tot 0 7577 m thus resulting in q tot 60 616 m3 collected rainwater that could be used to artificially recharge the aquifer note that the actual amount of rainwater falling on the rooftop and reaching the well is influenced by many factors such as wind direction rainfall intensity rainfall length evaporation rate and the conditions of the gutter and pvc hose systems however we consider that the obtained values are a valid first cut indication of the scale of rainfall volumes that were recharging the aquifer through sw 4 1 2 temporal changes of water level the water level in sw p1 and p2 showed seasonal changes fig 4 a with an increase until the end of march 2020 a decrease until mid september 2020 then an increase until mid may 2021 and a decrease until the end of the experimental time end of september 2021 the aquifer response in sw is directly linked to the occurrence of the rainfall events i e rainfall driven aquifer recharge water level in sw is always higher than in p1 and p2 as it is the infiltration well and located slightly upgradient fig 2 the water level maximum of p1 and p2 occurs in march in 2020 and in may in 2021 the range of water level change in sw is approx 2 m while that in p1 and p2 is approx 1 m the water level time series of sw p1 and p2 were compared with the water level time series of shallow observation wells in the vicinity of kerekegyháza for location see fig 1c to evaluate the similarities and differences in the observed trends an overall water level decrease can be observed in all of the wells fig 4 and table 2 on average water levels decreased 0 28 m in one year between 21 sept 2020 and 2021 the rate of decline was 0 25 m 0 35 m and 0 32 m over one year for sw p1 and p2 respectively the least effected well is w 1387 located at the local discharge area where water level decreased only 0 07 m in a year the water level maximums decreased as well on average 0 22 m while in the experimental wells the rate of decrease was lower 0 21 m and 0 17 m for p1 and p2 respectively considering the temporal differences in the water level maximum of the wells in 2020 the water level maximum occurs much sooner in sw p1 and p2 than in the other wells may w 1458 w 1300 w 6960 july august w 3833 except for w 1387 in 2021 the water level maximums are observed in may june except for w 1458 which shows the highest values in july the autumn winter water level increase seen in the case of sw p1 and p2 does not or only less markedly occurs with the exception of w 6960 the behavior of the wells taking part in the experiment is very similar to the other observation wells in the area however the discovered differences namely the earlier water level maximum and the autumn water level increase might be caused by the rooftop rainwater infiltration 4 1 3 changes in water column increase to better understand the dynamics of rainwater infiltration through sw the induced water columns were evaluated the water level in sw is very sensitive to the precipitation events fig 4a similarly to a slug test the water level quickly increases when rainfall events occur as a consequence of the direct funneling of rooftop collected water inside the well after the precipitation events the water level decreases proportionally to the hydrodynamic properties of the aquifer specifically the hydraulic conductivity k and the specific yield s y the water level of sw shows a sudden increase and then a gradual decrease recession due to a precipitation event as the water seeps into the aquifer fig 4a however the precipitation rate p was not always linearly proportional to the increase of the water column δh induced by the funneled rooftop collected water for analyzing the relationship of p and δh 58 distinct precipitation events were selected each of them lasting for maximum one day fig 5 comparing p and δh two different correlations can be observed fig 5a the different seasons are showing different relationships in winter the water column increase is higher while in summer it is lower fig 5a spring and autumn events are falling into both of the groups if the potentially collectable amount of rooftop water fully reaches the well theoretically water level increases proportionally based on this the following equation equation 2 was introduced for the calculation of potential water column increase 2 δ h p o t p a r r s w 2 π where δh pot is the potential water column increase m p is the daily precipitation rate md 1 a r is the rooftop area m2 and r sw is the radius of sw m as an example theoretically 0 01 m precipitation induces 1 6 m water column increase however this exact relationship is rarely observed by comparing the ratio of the observed δh and the potential δh pot water column increase for the selected events with the daily average temperature a significant negative correlation r 0 74 p value 0 05 was obtained fig 5b higher temperatures can result in higher evaporation rates especially during summer thus less water can get into the well from the rooftop than in winter this can be one influencing factor however evaporation solely does not explain the observed changes as smaller ratios of δh and δh pot can be observed even in october and november when evaporation is not high fig 5c by evaluating the temporal distribution of the ratio of δh and δh pot for the selected events the following trends can be noticed fig 5c until may 2020 the average ratio of these values is 41 period i it s 6 during summer and autumn until december period ii 86 until may 2021 period iii and then decreased again to the average of 17 until september 2021 period iv note for the interpretation that the calculations are less reliable from event 21 08 01 as the precipitation data were measured at a different meteorological station see chapter 3 for details additionally the amount of water reaching the well is not measured but estimated and dependent on many factors see chapter 4 1 1 for details thus in some cases the ratio of δh and δh pot can be higher than 100 assuming that the system is working properly and all the rainwater from the rooftop enters the well the degree of water column rise depends on the rate of infiltration from the well to the aquifer during the precipitation event based on darcy s law the infiltration rate depends on the hydraulic head difference thus on the amount of precipitation in the well and the location of the water level in its surroundings and on the saturated hydraulic conductivity k of the aquifer freeze and cherry 1979 the decrease of the ratio of observed and the potential water column increase occurs in may in both years fig 5c after relatively low precipitation amounts in march and april see fig 4a these drier periods could result in lower water tables and drier conditions in the aquifer itself as well which could have an impact on the infiltration rates when the water table is lower and the pores are less saturated the infiltration from the shallow well can be more effective thus the water column increase in the well is lower this process however cannot be well detected with the selected 30 min measuring frequency the influence of hydraulic conductivity can be best observed on fig 5c there is a notable difference between period i and iii after 15 5 months of operation a 40 cm thick layer of fine sediments accumulated in the bottom of the well possibly decreasing the hydraulic conductivity due to clogging effect therefore in period iii the infiltration rate was slower so a larger water column could form fig 5c p1 and p2 also showed a response to precipitation events but to a lesser extent figs 4a 5d there were precipitation events when the water level increase in the monitoring wells was unambiguous e g summer of 2020 and there were events when natural daily water level fluctuations masked the effect of rainwater infiltration clogging process could also be detected by comparing sw and p2 levels fig 5d there s no significant difference between p1 and p2 water levels thus p2 was chosen for demonstration as this well provided more reliable results the first observable increase in p2 water level occurred on february 26 2020 one month after the project started between may and october 2020 the water level in p2 followed the water level of sw with higher peaks between october 2020 and may 2021 time of well maintenance sw showed much higher peaks however the water level of p2 barely increased after the precipitation events it can be assumed that clogging process advanced in sw during autumn 2020 and slowed down the infiltration process and impaired the connection between the wells however the well bottom did not clog entirely infiltration still occurred since the water level of sw declined after every precipitation event after cleaning the well bottom of sw the water levels of the wells changed similarly again without high peaks these results well correspond to the ones obtained from the comparison of observed and potential water column increases in sw fig 5c 4 1 4 infiltration curve analysis and changes in hydraulic conductivity one of the key parameters that determines the efficiency of shallow well infiltration is the hydraulic conductivity of the well bottom based on grain size distribution analysis the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer on average geometric mean is 1 8 10 6 m s 1 while the well bottom sediments after 15 5 months of infiltration showed 8 7 10 7 m s 1 in the upper part and 3 9 10 7 m s 1 in the lower part table 3 the hydraulic conductivity of the well bottom was also estimated by infiltration curve analysis slug test with bouwer and rice method bouwer and rice 1976 the result of each evaluated infiltration curve is plotted in chronological order in fig 6 to follow the temporal changes in hydraulic conductivity thus the effectiveness of infiltration before cleaning the well bottom may 2021 most of the events showed k values between 1 and 3 10 7 m s 1 with the exception of 3 winter precipitation events after the accumulated sediments were removed the hydraulic conductivity increased even reaching 1 2 10 6 m s 1 fig 6 these results are in accordance with the ones obtained from grain size distribution analysis and from the evaluation of water column changes chapter 4 1 3 4 2 consequences on groundwater quality and temperature 4 2 1 composition of main ions in water first of all baseline conditions were surveyed by sampling sw on january 14 2020 before the project started fig 7 table a1 the shallow water composition showed mg2 and hco3 dominance the total dissolved solids content tds was considerably high 1743 mg l 1 as well as mg2 na cl so4 2 no3 concentrations sw displayed a significant improvement in water quality during the experiment fig 7 table a1 2 mg2 na cl so4 2 no3 concentrations and tds decreased significantly due to rainwater infiltration an initial decrease of 87 82 81 88 35 and 81 respectively was observed after the infiltration started sampling time 31 01 20 and a further 96 93 68 58 96 and 35 decrease occurred in these parameters by the end of the monitoring period sampling time 21 09 21 initially no3 exceeded the limit value for shallow groundwater 50 μg l 1 decree 2009 but from june 2020 the values complied with the legislation while ca2 and hco3 concentrations and tds to some extent were constantly changing in time depending on the rainfall amount reaching the well the first measurements of p1 and p2 occurred in september 2020 7 months after the project started fig 7 table a1 in contrast with the decreasing trends observed in sw a slight increase in mg2 na cl so4 2 no3 concentrations and increasing tds were detected no3 displayed the highest variability in this regard 4 2 2 trace elements and possible contaminants the quality of precipitation pr and rooftop water rt were examined and the results mostly complied with the hungarian legislation regarding groundwater table a2 decree 6 2009 except for nh4 and zn nh4 was slightly higher in pr than the limit value 0 5 mg l 1 however higher concentrations were not detected in sw in any of the samples in rt only zinc concentration exceeded the limit value 200 μg l 1 which was also notably high 114 249 μg l 1 in sw fig 8 a but overall it decreased during the observation period based on the comparison of pr and rt samples rooftop water was enriched in a number of trace elements compared to rainwater table a2 zinc concentration was 48 2 times higher in rooftop water in case of sr cu mn ba and al it was about 6 9 6 4 3 3 6 and 1 9 times higher in roof runoff respectively these results indicate that the roof material the gutters and the tube system are affecting the water quality furthermore doc toc cod and tds are all higher in the rooftop water than in the precipitation on the other hand in the shallow well the values are not elevated so the sedimentation and or degradation of organic matter on the bottom of the well can be assumed the sedimentation process was also confirmed when the well bottom was cleaned in may 2021 a 40 cm thick mud layer accumulated on the bottom after only 15 5 months of infiltration the organic content of the samples was not significant loi was 3 41 for the upper layer sw t and 2 53 for the lower layer sw b in the monitoring wells toc and tss content is high compared to pr rt and sw it might have a natural geological reason or it might be due to the design of the wells cod values are similar in sw and in p1 p2 in sw water quality complied with the hungarian limit values for groundwater with zinc being the only exception table a2 decree 6 2009 in p1 and p2 no3 concentrations were significant 81 165 mg l 1 and in some cases nh4 and po4 3 exceeded the limit comparing the trace element composition of sw and p1 p2 the following trends can be observed zinc concentrations are significantly higher compared to p1 and p2 while it decreased in sw it fluctuated in the monitoring wells fig 8a copper and arsenic concentrations were constantly changing in all three wells not showing an exact trend fig 8b and c they slightly increased in sw and decreased in p1 however their concentrations were well below the limit values 200 μg l 1 for cu and 10 μg l 1 for as manganese concentrations were quite low in sw but showed an increase the values were one order of magnitude higher in p1 and decreased by the end of the monitoring period p2 values were falling in between and also increased fig 8e in contrast ferrous iron and aluminum concentrations were low in all three wells except for 1 1 occasional increase in sw and p2 fig 8d g phosphate showed an increase in sw while it decreased in p1 and in p2 after the second sampling fig 8f boron showed very low concentrations in sw and significantly higher ones in p1 and p2 additionally a constant decrease can be observed in the latter ones fig 8h uranium showed a similar picture but a decrease can only be observed in p2 fig 8j silicic acid content was also lower in sw and increased during the monitoring period while it was higher in p1 p2 and showed a decrease only in p1 fig 8l although barium concentrations increased as well in sw there was no observable trend for p1 and p2 fig 8k strontium concentrations changed similarly in all three wells during the monitoring period however sw showed significantly lower values than p1 and p2 fig 8i 4 2 3 water chemistry of the control wells we used the data of two additional shallow wells control wells with rainwater infiltration from the surroundings of the experimental area fig 1c for comparison to better understand the long term effect of rainwater infiltration on groundwater quality the water composition of ke02 was quite stable while that of ke01 showed seasonal variations the control wells were showing very similar compositions to sw table a1 low tds and low mg2 na cl so4 2 no3 concentrations on the other hand in both wells the po4 3 concentration exceeded the limit value for groundwater 0 5 mg l 1 all other values were compliant with the legislation the zinc values 38 and 70 μg l 1 were lower than in sw but higher than in p1 and p2 cod was also slightly higher in the control wells than in sw p1 and p2 this can be the cause of sediment load from the roof to the wells because there are no filters built in these systems 4 2 4 isotopic changes isotope measurements were included in the research to follow the effects of the infiltration process the observed δ2h and δ18o trends in the wells showed similar patterns especially in case of δ18o fig 9 a and b the range of change was much higher in sw while it was lower for p1 and p2 similar changes can be observed on fig 9c as well this shows the effect of rooftop water inflow to the infiltration well significant effect of evaporation cannot be seen for sw the lowest values can be observed in december 2020 and the highest ones in march 2021 both in terms of δ2h and δ18o for p1 and p2 the values of δ2h were barely changing while δ18o showed seasonal changes the lowest values were observed in june 2021 and the highest ones in march 2021 the measured values are close to the global gmwl and local meteoric waterlines lmwl with the exception of the samples taken from sw in december 2020 and from p1 and p2 in june 2021 fig 9c tritium increased in sw decreased in p1 and was quite stable in p2 fig 9d at the depth of p1 and p2 tritium values of 3 5 4 0 tu are expected in the study area palcsu et al 2017 the elevated tritium concentrations in sw can be attributed to the contribution of the precipitation which has an annual variation between 5 and 15 tu palcsu et al 2018 the highest tritium values of 10 tu sampled in september 2021 can be explained by the inflow of summer precipitation with higher tritium concentration 4 2 5 water temperature changes water temperature changes of the wells were compared with each other and with the daily average air temperatures to evaluate the effect of rooftop rainwater infiltration sw showed lower temperature values than p1 and p2 fig 10 the infiltrated water significantly affected the water temperatures in sw which is represented by the positive heating and negative cooling anomalies in the dataset the collected water had a cooling effect on well water until may 2020 then a heating effect until october 2020 a cooling effect until may 2021 and then a heating effect again until the end of the monitoring period september 2021 on the other hand seasonal changes are also observable in sw water temperature increased until october 2020 decreased until february 2021 and increased again until september 2021 the range of temperature changes during the monitoring period is approx 6 5 c in sw and 1 5 c in p1 and p2 the air temperature reached its maximum in august while the water temperature in the shallow well in october and that of the monitoring wells in december the colder winter precipitation had a cooling effect on the water of sw which can also indirectly cause cooling in p1 p2 wells by june the water heats back up by december and then cools down again by june in these wells 5 discussion based on the interpretation of individual results and literature review the most significant findings related to the field experiment can be discussed the extension possibilities of the results were also evaluated for the area and for different regions worldwide 5 1 quantitative potential of rrwh sw all of the wells including sw p1 p2 and the observation wells in the vicinity of kerekegyháza showed a decrease in water levels figs 1c and 4 following the long term trend of the area i e declining water level e g garamhegyi et al 2020 although the water level in sw and in the monitoring wells p1 p2 did not increase permanently during the monitoring period the effect of infiltration has been confirmed comparing the water levels of sw p1 p2 with other observation wells from the area showed that water level maximum occurs earlier in the wells which are part of the experiment and the autumn winter water level increase is only present in one other well apart from the experimental ones fig 4 based on the results of analyzing the differences between the precipitation and water column increase ratios chapter 4 1 3 seasonality strongly affects the infiltration process sw infiltrates the aquifer faster after dryer periods i e drought and when the water table is lower if the summer precipitation can be collected in sufficient amount in the infiltration well evaporation loss is reduced and this water can effectively recharge the uppermost aquifer considering that the natural infiltration of precipitation in the danube tisza interfluve is only 14 9 due to high evaporation rates approx 80 90 szilágyi et al 2012 collecting rainwater and thus water retention in the saturated zone is highly important in the area although the infiltrated water amount during the observation period was only 60 616 m3 approx 40 m3y 1 by involving more rooftops into the experiment thus increasing the amount of harvestable rainwater the impact of rrwh sw on water levels would be more significant based on gis based settlement scale calculations of yousif 2022 the total roof covered area in kerekegyháza is 0 55 km2 15 of the total area thus calculating with an average of 515 mm annual precipitation the total collectable water amount from the roofs of kerekegyháza is 283 250 m3y 1 which is a remarkable potential based on simple water balance calculations infiltrating all the collectable water from roofs would increase the groundwater table with approx 0 27 m in one year which is comparable with the yearly decrease of water table yousif 2022 the collectable volume of rainwater can be further increased if surface runoff was collected from roads as well shekh 2021 the treated wastewater of the settlement offers additional opportunities however for the safe reuse of these waters further field experiments and water chemical measurements are needed in the future 5 2 qualitative potential of rrwh sw the observed concentration changes in sw namely the decrease of mg2 na cl so4 2 no3 and tds indicate significant improvement in shallow groundwater quality due to the infiltration of rainwater to the well fig 7 hasan et al 2018 achieved similar results after 5 months of infiltration while dillon and barry 2005 could only reach temporary water quality improvement in 2 years due to high tds of native groundwater in case of sw these changes could be maintained no significant increase was observable during the 20 months of the project the measurements made in the control wells ke01 and ke02 also confirmed that long term improvement in water quality is achievable with this method thus by infiltrating rainwater directly to the saturated zone shallow groundwater can be diluted therefore resulting in better quality rainwater stored underground can be abstracted later on for irrigation if needed as the water chemical parameters are adequate for that groundwater quality improvement is not yet observable after 20 months in the monitoring wells p1 p2 located 8 3 m and 12 3 m from sw on the contrary an increase in the concentration of these parameters can be seen it can be assumed that the surroundings of sw were contaminated before the experiment fig 7 sampling time 14 01 20 and the infiltrated rainwater pushed forward this water in the direction of local groundwater flow thus in the direction of the monitoring wells in the future it is expected that these concentrations will start to decrease similarly to the changes occurring in sw indicating this supposed process a decrease in u b po4 3 h2sio3 concentrations occurs either in p1 or p2 or both fig 8 these changes might be attributed to rainwater infiltration but at this state of the research it cannot be stated with high certainty and further monitoring of water quality is needed nevertheless water samples from sw and the monitoring wells are well separated in terms of zn u b sr and h2sio3 concentrations fig 8 so these parameters and the main water composition can be selected as natural tracers to monitor the movement of infiltrated water in the saturated zone the effect of rainwater infiltration on stable isotope composition of the wells is already observable in sw the range of change in δ2h and δ18o was higher in this well however in p1 and p2 it is not yet evident fig 9 summer and autumn samples are very similar to each other however when more rainwater is accumulated winter and spring the wells are showing high differences in isotopic compositions these differences might also be helpful in the future to track groundwater movement from sw similarly to main and trace element compositions and groundwater temperature 5 3 environmental impacts of rrwh sw sampling of precipitation pr and rooftop rainwater rt showed table a2 that despite enrichment in some trace elements zn sr cu mn ba and al chapter 4 2 2 infiltrating rainwater through sw is able to dilute shallow groundwater and possible contamination is limited to only a few parameters zinc not only occurs in rooftop rainwater in higher concentrations but in sw as well this is a common problem associated with rainwater harvesting systems as the steel roofs or in our case gutters have an effect on the water composition meera and mansoor ahammed 2006 dillon and barry 2005 had similar findings in kingswood australia where they observed 80 248 μg l 1 zinc levels in the rainwater storage tank which they used for well infiltration the control wells ke01 and ke02 which are in operation for 30 and 10 years respectively also showed elevated zinc levels 69 4 and 38 μg l 1 however they stayed well below the limit value 200 μg l 1 these results indicate that the rainwater collecting systems are affecting the water quality of these wells too but considering that rainwater funneling to these wells takes place already for several years zinc do not pose a high risk on groundwater quality in the long run contaminating groundwater with zinc is a possible risk related to rrwh sw thus it must be monitored in order to avoid any serious problems additionally the decrease in zn concentration in sw and lower concentrations measured in ke01 and ke02 can indicate the potential adsorption of zn on clay minerals or bonding to organic matter at the bottom of the well which has to be examined in the future in order to better understand the ongoing processes several parameters showed concentration increase in sw which can cause groundwater contamination such as cu as po4 2 and ba but their concentrations were well below the limit values thus they do not pose a risk apart from the elevated zn concentrations the increase of cu mn sr ba concentrations in sw can be attributed to rainwater infiltration as rooftop collected water showed enrichment in these elements table a2 ammonium only exceeded the limit value in the precipitation sample but not in the samples taken from sw thus it does not pose a considerable risk ke01 and ke02 showed slightly elevated values of po4 3 however its source is not clear it can either come from roof runoff or can be the sign of previous contamination from leaking cesspools phosphorus and nitrogen are common component of rainwater harvested from roofs due to atmospheric deposition from transport industrial processes and application of fertilizers novak et al 2014 5 4 clogging one of the reasons of why the authorities advise against rrwh sw is clogging of the well bottom ministry of interior 2017 clogging is a general process related to all mar facilities dillon et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 and it has to be managed but it does not necessarily make the infiltration impossible clogging of the well bottom was identifiable through analyzing the water level time series of sw chapter 4 1 3 and 4 1 4 and during the maintenance of the well bottom however the infiltration during the experiment was successful the accumulated mud at the bottom did not impede the infiltration significantly during the monitoring period although higher water columns could form in sw during partially clogged conditions the collected water always seeped into the aquifer in relatively short time max 1 2 weeks depending on the precipitation rate the reason behind is that higher water columns can even accelerate the infiltration rate by increasing the vertical hydraulic gradient thus act against efficiency decrease induced by clogging this is an advantage of using dug wells with large diameter and open bottom the increased water columns in the infiltration well can be used for indicating the need for maintenance if the ratio of δh and δh pot is higher than 50 60 for 3 consecutive precipitation events clogging of the well bottom can be assumed and measures should be taken to remedy the problem 5 5 limitations of the experiment for further considerations in our experiment the design of rrwh sw was intentionally kept simple in order to investigate the problems that might occur during the operation of these systems and observe its environmental effects on the other hand using first flush removal devices sedimentation tanks and filters can significantly improve water quality especially considering the amount of sediment and organic matter load to the well dillon and barry 2005 barry et al 2013 wang et al 2015 dillon et al 2016 soni et al 2020 the use of these complementary settings is highly recommended during the implementation of real systems furthermore using water flow meters would help determining the exact amount of water reaching the infiltration well from the gutters and thus it would enable a more accurate estimation of the efficiency of water harvesting the selected monitoring frequency of 30 min was adequate to investigate the efficiency of the system however in order to better understand the infiltration process during a specific infiltration event especially in drier periods i e summer more frequent measurements are needed seasonal monitoring of water chemical parameters gave information on water quality changes both in sw and in p1 p2 in the case of sw the water quality improvement was observable from the beginning of the experiment however these changes were not yet visible in p1 p2 additionally the sampling of well bottom sediments for total element concentration would give insight on the sedimentation and adsorption of elements during the infiltration process for these reasons the experiment is still ongoing in order to observe the long term water chemical changes induced by rooftop rainwater infiltration in the monitoring wells too to rule out any possible contamination effect and thus gain acceptance and trust of the residents regarding rrwh sw systems water balance calculations yousif 2022 suggest that the town scale potential of rrwh sh is quite remarkable in order to determine the effect of town scale rainwater harvesting more accurately detailed geological and hydrogeological investigation of the area and 3d numerical modeling studies are needed to delineate possible sites for new infiltration structures suitability mapping could be a useful tool either on regional or local scale adham et al 2016 5 6 relevance and applicability of this research on settlement scale the obtained results from the experiment can serve as a basis for numerical modeling studies for settlement scale implementation of rrwh sw in kerekegyháza and in the danube tisza interfluve this solution can provide a cheap local scale and environmentally promising water replenishment method for the region suffering from serious water shortage the experimental results however are not only applicable for the study region but can be used in other regions of the earth as well there is a growing need worldwide for the development of municipal rainwater and stormwater management from all sides residents municipalities public utilities water directorates etc to avoid flash floods and related geoengineering problems and to preserve water for droughts melville shreeve 2017 palla et al 2017 hussain et al 2019 tamagnone et al 2020 qin 2020 boroomandnia et al 2021 rainwater management is necessary from a protection point of view but it is equally important to retain water and thus to adapt to climate change to counteract overexploitation and to contribute to reaching sustainability e g pandey et al 2003 qi et al 2019 amos et al 2020 socioeconomic acceptance and residents participation is crucial for household level implementation of these systems and proper guidelines policies and governmental subsidies can increase the willingness to harvest rainwater barthwal et al 2014 pawar et al 2014 the results of this study and similar pilot projects such as pavelic et al 2020 for basaltic terrains or dillon and barry 2005 for borewells can help to better understand the ongoing processes during rainfall events and promote the implementation of such projects worldwide 6 conclusions and recommendations the 20 month long monitoring of a field scale rooftop rainwater harvesting and shallow well infiltration experiment can provide conclusions for the pilot area and can give basis for extending the application of this method to settlement level and using it in other parts of the danube tisza interfluve area in addition general conclusions can be drawn for similar projects in porous unconfined aquifers worldwide direct conclusions for the pilot area 1 quantitative changes and water level trends the total of 60 616 m3 infiltrated precipitation as a sporadic phenomenon had little effect on the general decreasing water level trend observed in the monitoring wells of the pilot the rate of water level decline on average was 0 28 m in the area between sept 2020 and 2021 in the experimental wells sw p1 p2 0 25 m 0 35 m and 0 32 m water level decrease was observed in one year respectively on the other hand by increasing the involved rooftop areas and continuing the infiltration could increase the quantitative potential of the method on settlement level based on yousif 2022 the water level increase can even reach 0 27 m y 1 if the total collectable water amount of the roofs is infiltrated 2 indication and troubleshooting of clogging the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer originally was 1 8 10 6 m s 1 the well bottom sediments after 15 5 months of infiltration showed k values of 8 7 10 7 m s 1 in the upper part and 3 9 10 7 m s 1 in the lower part by removing the accumulated sediment layer the hydraulic conductivity of the well bottom increased to that of the aquifer 3 diluting effect of infiltration on groundwater quality in the pilot a significant improvement in water quality was achieved mg2 na cl so4 2 no3 concentrations and tds decreased by 87 82 81 88 35 and 81 respectively after the infiltration started and a further 96 93 68 58 96 and 35 decrease occurred in these parameters by the end of the monitoring period this improvement could be maintained throughout the experiment and no significant increase occurred in these parameters 4 trace element enrichment in rooftop collected water concentration of zn sr cu mn ba and al were 48 2 6 9 6 4 3 3 6 and 1 9 times higher respectively in roof runoff than in the precipitation despite the observed enrichment none of them poses a considerable risk to groundwater quality the only exception is zn whose concentrations in sw 114 249 μg l 1 varied around the limit value for shallow groundwater 200 μg l 1 however its concentration decreased during the monitoring period and samples from the control wells also indicated lower values which is a positive sign for long term applications conclusions for similar projects anywhere 1 methodology the introduced experimental setup namely a shallow dug well with two monitoring wells and involvement of further shallow reference wells with the monitored parameters can be adequate for groundwater quantity and quality evaluation regarding rooftop rainwater harvesting the long term more than 1 year monitoring could provide insight on not only seasonal but multiannual processes and the effects of extreme precipitations which is significant to adapt to long term water shortage 2 parameters to follow quantitative effects the recharge rate in the infiltration well water column changes temporal changes of water level due to infiltration are applicable parameters for quantitative evaluation of the impacts in any study area 3 efficiency of infiltration continuous water level measurement in the infiltration well is an easy relatively inexpensive and suitable way to monitor the efficiency of the process monitoring water column increase and comparing it with the calculated potential water column increase as well as infiltration curve analysis after precipitation events can provide immediate information on the operation of the system 4 maintenance the water column increase in the infiltration well can be the sign of clogging thus it can be used for indicating the need for maintenance if the ratio of δh and δh pot is higher than 50 60 for 3 consecutive precipitation events clogging of the well bottom can be assumed and measures can be taken to remedy the problem 5 environmental tracers to monitor the pathways of infiltration environmental isotopes are useful tracers to monitor the infiltration process due the isotopic differences in precipitation and groundwater temperature is another useful parameter as the temperature of precipitation is changing seasonally while that of groundwater is more stable during the experiment further natural tracers were found zn u b sr and h2sio3 to monitor the pathway of infiltrated rainwater plume in groundwater as they have significantly different concentrations in sw and in p1 p2 based on the results and conclusions of the field experiment the following recommendations are given for the implementation and monitoring of rrwh sw systems on household level 1 the materials and conditions of the rooftop and the gutters should be checked and if needed it should be renovated before implementation of rrwh sw 2 at least a filter mesh should be used in order to filter out larger contaminants e g leaves further instruments such as first flush devices and sedimentation tanks can be used to decrease the amount of sediment load to the well 3 the well and the well bottom should be cleaned before infiltration if possible initial pumping of the well is advisable to freshen the water and to avoid initial contamination 4 proper maintenance of the gutters filters and the well bottom especially during and after autumn is essential for maintaining the efficiency of the system water column increase can help delineate clogging and indicate the need for maintenance 5 sampling of direct precipitation and roof collected rainwater is necessary to delineate enrichment and possible contaminants further monitoring of critical parameters is advisable in the infiltration well 6 if the continuous monitoring is not possible at least seasonal water level and water quality measurements for main and critical elements are suggested to follow the infiltration process preparing guidelines on how to properly implement maintain and monitor rrwh sw systems taking into consideration national and european union law regarding groundwater could improve the effectivity of water retention and turn rrwh sw from an unfavorable practice to a water management measure capable
