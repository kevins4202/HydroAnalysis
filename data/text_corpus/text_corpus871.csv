4355,hydraulic head distributions can inform spring source water characterisation by determining whether aquifers meet the thresholds required to sustain spring flow assessing hydraulic head data can be challenging in areas where data are sparsely distributed and subject to variable measurement uncertainty geostatistical methods can be used to estimate hydraulic head values at unmeasured locations with quantitative uncertainty estimates while these methods have been applied extensively for hydraulic head estimation in management contexts no studies have used these approaches for spring source water conceptual model testing in this study an investigation into the hydraulic head distribution was conducted through the application of ordinary indicator co kriging interpolated hydraulic head estimates were used to quantitatively assess the plausibility of source aquifer conceptual models for the doongmabulla springs complex dsc queensland australia the results offer insights into the likelihood of alternative source aquifers having adequate head to support flow to eight springs within the dsc probabilities of adequate head to support the springs ranged from 0 03 to 0 12 for the permian formations compared to 0 01 to 0 49 for the triassic formations analyses indicated that the triassic formations are more likely to have adequate hydraulic head to support spring flow however significant uncertainty exists in the conceptual model assessment due to hydraulic head measurement scarcity particularly in the vicinity of the springs these findings have important implications given that the permian formations will be dewatered by the operation of the nearby carmichael coal mine the techniques employed here can inform conceptual model uncertainties arising from the interpretation of sparsely distributed hydraulic head datasets a major benefit over traditional interpolation methods keywords conceptual model testing interpolation methods measurement uncertainty ordinary indicator co kriging geostatistics hydraulic heads 1 introduction in hydrogeological investigations the development of conceptual models requires the synthesis of uncertain observations and expert knowledge leading to multiple plausible conceptual models oreskes et al 1994 neuman and wierenga 2003 when mathematically modelled alternative conceptual models may provide vastly different estimates of hydrogeological behaviour despite comparable consistency with field observations oreskes et al 1994 bredehoeft 2003 neuman and wierenga 2003 this leads to non uniqueness in the mathematical representations of hydrogeological systems the importance of considering alternative conceptual models has been recognised neuman and wierenga 2003 bredehoeft 2005 enemark et al 2019 however such conceptual models are rarely considered in practice bredehoeft 2005 failure to consider alternative conceptual models is problematic as it can result in underestimation of the uncertainty of predictions e g hydraulic heads groundwater fluxes solute concentrations enemark et al 2019 the importance of considering conceptual model uncertainty for decision making is well recognised in management frameworks such as adaptive management e g williams et al 2009 thomann et al 2020 hydraulic head is a measure of fluid potential that is used to determine groundwater flow patterns freeze and cherry 1979 and to inform conceptual model development neuman and wierenga 2003 hydraulic head measurements are typically sparsely distributed and collected infrequently with varying precision post and von asmuth 2013 rau et al 2019 expert knowledge and mathematical models are invariably needed to interpret hydraulic head data and predict hydraulic heads at unmeasured locations hydraulic head data may be analysed manually by contouring e g salama et al 1996 siegel 2008 or through the use of automated mathematical approaches such as kriging e g bastin and gevers 1985 nikroo et al 2010 varouchakis and hristopulos 2013 quay et al 2020 or inverse distance weighted interpolation e g philip and watson 1986 varouchakis and hristopulos 2013 by manually contouring hydraulic head data hydrogeologists can include their understanding of the system into the interpretation kresic 2006 for example information on the subsurface hydrogeological features e g faults or dykes surface features e g lakes or rivers or physical properties e g changes in hydraulic conductivity may assist in the interpretation of regional flow directions boundary effects e g no flow boundaries and recharge discharge stresses salama et al 1996 siegel 2008 in contrast automated techniques provide the ability to assess a wide range of alternative conceptual models through interpolation algorithms which is generally infeasible with manual contouring however it is often challenging to include qualitative expert knowledge and understanding into automated analyses failure to consider expert knowledge and understanding can result in unrealistic interpretations of the hydraulic head salama et al 1996 siegel 2008 peeters et al 2010 for example in a case study of the cuballing catchment western australia salama et al 1996 described hydraulic head predictions that intersect the surface elevation for unconfined aquifers automated interpolation approaches applied to groundwater datasets include various forms of kriging which is used routinely to interpolate datasets in developing hydrogeological conceptual models journel 1983 developed a modified form of kriging indicator kriging ik whereby data are transformed to binary indicators of 1 for values less than or equal to a threshold value or 0 otherwise the resulting indicators are termed indicator transformed values the probability of a value less than or equal to the threshold value can be estimated at unmeasured locations by kriging the indicator transformed values this process can be applied for a series of threshold values using co kriging to estimate the conditional cumulative distribution function ccdf at unmeasured locations the ik technique makes no distribution assumptions and allows for a quantitative assessment of the uncertainty of predicted values at unmeasured locations journel 1983 however in cases of high measurement uncertainty the use of a binary indicator transform i e either 0 or 1 may be problematic as the measured values could plausibly be coded as either of the indicator values leading to uncertainty in the indicator transformed values furthermore ik can result in predictions at unmeasured locations outside of the 0 to 1 bounds of probability journel 1986 to address these limitations journel 1986 extended the technique to include expert knowledge in the form of constraints and prior probability distributions the constraints ensure predictions lie within reasonable limits while the prior probability distributions allow the inclusion of uncertain information based on observations or expert knowledge in this way ik provides the ability to overcome issues of unrealistic predictions and allows the user to include their qualitative expert knowledge into the modelling process in hydrogeology ik has been widely applied to assess the probability of values of interest being above or below a chosen threshold based on a set of observations e g saito and goovaerts 2002 liu et al 2004 lyon et al 2006 arslan 2012 anane et al 2014 chica olmo et al 2014 varouchakis et al 2020 for example ik has been used to compare contaminant concentrations with thresholds for remediation e g saito and goovaerts 2002 to assess water quality parameters against guidelines for water use e g arslan 2012 anane et al 2014 chica olmo et al 2014 and to evaluate the probability of saturated soil conditions e g lyon et al 2006 ik has also been used to evaluate the probability of hydraulic heads dropping below a threshold value selected to avoid groundwater depletion varouchakis et al 2020 despite the widespread use of ik throughout the field of hydrogeology we are unaware of any studies that have used ik to assess the probability of alternative aquifers having adequate hydraulic head to drive spring flow this study applies ik to hydraulic head data to assess the likelihood of alternative conceptual models relating to the source of discharge from a spring complex the method evaluates the probability that an aquifer has adequate hydraulic head to meet a threshold required for spring flow this threshold referred to as the spring geomorphic threshold sgt is defined as the topographical elevation in the vicinity of a spring vent that controls whether the spring will discharge to the surrounding landscape merrick 2015 currell et al 2017 the springs considered in this study are part of the ecologically and culturally significant doongmabulla springs complex dsc located in queensland australia fensham et al 2016 currell et al 2017 currell et al 2020 the flow contribution to the dsc from underlying aquifers i e the triassic aged and permian aged formations of the galilee basin is disputed currell et al 2017 currell et al 2020 since the nearby carmichael coal mine is expected to dewater the deeper permian formations to support mining activities currell et al 2017 currell et al 2020 a better understanding of the water source to the dsc is essential for the ongoing conservation efforts 2 study area the dsc is a collection of freshwater springs located in the galilee basin queensland australia fig 1 the dsc provides water to an extensive wetland system that is listed in the national directory of important wetlands in australia environment australia 2001 these wetlands offer niche habitat for several endangered species and are culturally significant to the wangan and jagalingou people fensham et al 2016 currell et al 2017 the eight springs examined in this study see fig 1c were selected for being representative of the varying spring morphologies throughout the dsc these springs were classified into two categories based on the spring morphology the first category discharge springs are hypothesised to occur due to artesian discharge via vertical conduits in flatter areas fensham et al 2016 in contrast the second category outcrop springs are hypothesised to occur due to lateral discharge in areas of sloping topography where the triassic formations outcrop fensham et al 2016 the discharge springs show a variety of surface expressions such as mounded vegetated areas with pooled water e g springs b c d and e a modified dam surrounding a spring vent e g spring f springs with discrete vents that discharge to wetland systems e g spring a and small vegetated areas without visible pooled surface water e g spring g photograph shown in fig 2 b the outcrop spring examined in this study spring h photograph shown in fig 2a did not have a visible discrete vent but rather a large pooled area 100 m2 which discharges to an extensive wetland system the surface expression of the spring vent is important for characterising the sgts as they vary between springs surrounded by mounds or dams and those in flatter areas in the case of discrete mound form springs the sgt is the minimum elevation of the mound over which spring water flows while in flatter areas with more diffuse springs the sgt is simply the topographic elevation of the spring discharge point the sgts for the springs considered in this study were measured in may 2019 using a trimble r10 integrated gnss system with a precision of 8 mm horizontal and 15 mm vertical trimble navigation limited 2014 the triassic formation aquifers see fig 1b consist of the moolayember formation made up of sandstones and siltstones the clematis formation composed of siltstone sandstone and mudstone and the dunda beds consisting of predominantly sandstone aecom 2021 the triassic formations are separated from the permian formations by the triassic aged rewan formation fig 1b primarily composed of siltstone fine grained sandstone clays and mudstone aecom 2021 the rewan formation is considered a competent aquitard at least in the areas where monitoring infrastructure has been installed aecom 2021 the permian formations fig 1b consist of the bandanna formation made up of lithic sandstone siltstone and coal seams which overlies the colinlea sandstone composed of quartz sandstone conglomerate with minor shale and coal seams aecom 2021 there are several proposed and active mining developments throughout the galilee basin that target the coal seams in the permian formations in areas where these formations outcrop along the edge of the basin these developments include the currently under construction carmichael coal mine located approximately 8 km to the east of the dsc fig 1a the imminent mining operations will potentially dewater the permian formations that underlie the triassic rewan formation aquitard fig 1b currell et al 2017 the triassic formations which outcrop to the west of the mine site are unlikely to be impacted directly by the mine construction currell et al 2017 however it is currently unclear whether dewatering and associated reductions in hydraulic head in the permian formations will propagate through the rewan formation and impact the water levels in the triassic formations currell et al 2017 csiro and geoscience australia 2019 furthermore if the springs rely even partially on groundwater from the permian formations mine induced reductions in pressure could lead to the cessation of spring flow currell et al 2017 currell et al 2020 despite these concerns the mine was approved currell et al 2020 currently there exist two conceptual models explaining the source of water to the dsc currell et al 2017 the first conceptualisation assumes that the rewan formation see fig 1b is a competent laterally extensive aquitard comprised of sediments that do not allow significant vertical flow bradley 2015 in this conceptual model the dsc relies entirely on groundwater from the triassic formations bradley 2015 the mine induced drawdown in the permian formations will be less likely to impact the springs in this case bradley 2015 the second conceptualisation proposes that the dsc may receive water at least in part from the permian formations via leakage or preferential flow e g via faulting through the rewan formation webb 2015 in this case the drawdown in the permian formations will more likely pose a significant threat to the long term survival of the dsc webb 2015 the outcomes of these previous studies highlight that further work is required to identify the potential risk of mine impacts on the springs 3 data sources the data used in this study were collated from the queensland groundwater database the department of state development 2018 and the aecom 2021 report a total of 34 and 78 wells had available hydraulic head measurements in the triassic and permian formations respectively some of these wells featured extensive time series of up to 10 years of daily measurements 6 and 39 in the triassic and permian respectively while others 28 and 39 in the triassic and permian respectively featured few 10 measurements fig 3 a displays the time series data for well id 158090 a in the triassic formations the range of variability is relatively low 0 6 m indicating reasonably consistent hydraulic head conditions over the 7 year measurement period six wells in the triassic formations featured time series data and the temporal variability of these wells varied from 1 m to 0 2 m with an average range of 0 4 m the remaining 28 wells in the triassic formations featured few 10 or single measurements fig 3b shows hydraulic head time series in well id 158069 a in the permian formations the period 2015 to mid 2017 displays a seasonal pattern with a range of 0 2 m the hydraulic head values have a small range 0 4 m indicating that the groundwater conditions have remained relatively stable over the measurement period in total 39 wells in the permian formations had time series data and the range of measurements varied between 0 1 m and 5 m with an average of 1 9 m the other 39 wells in the permian formations featured few 10 or single measurements a table of the hydraulic head data available from each well in the triassic and permian formations is provided as supplementary material 1 4 methods the methodology aims to evaluate the likelihood that hypothesised spring source aquifers have sufficient hydraulic head to support discharge to eight springs in the dsc this process can be separated into i assessing the uncertainty of the available hydraulic head measurements ii transforming the hydraulic head data to indicator transformed values relative to threshold values iii characterising the semi variance and iv applying ordinary co kriging to make predictions at unmeasured locations 4 1 hydraulic head measurement uncertainty prior to the commencement of mine site dewatering in 2019 it was presumed that seasonal and random variations in head occur around a stationary mean value and otherwise the groundwater system was in a steady state the steady state assumption was reasonable as there was limited groundwater abstraction in the area and where multi year records were available the range was relatively small on average approximately 0 4 and 1 9 m in the triassic and permian formations respectively see section 3 where time series data were available the mean hydraulic head denoted h x for each well was estimated as the arithmetic mean of pre 2019 records except in the case of wells influenced by pumping or where only post 2019 records were available in the case of pumping the mean was estimated by discarding measurements that were believed to be influenced by pumping and estimating the mean for wells that only featured post 2019 records the earliest dated measurement was selected to represent the mean as this measurement was expected to be least impacted by mine site dewatering in total all triassic wells and 73 permian wells were estimated from the mean of pre 2019 records while 3 permian wells were interpreted to be influenced by pumping and 2 permian wells featured only post 2019 records hydrographs and interpretations for each well are provided in supplementary material 2 in this study uncertainty is considered as a combination of accuracy and precision whereby measurement precision is defined as the spread of measurements around the mean and the measurement accuracy is the closeness of the mean to the true value post and von asmuth 2013 we consider explicitly the major factors expected to influence measurement uncertainty including the temporal variability of hydraulic head measurements the hydraulic head measurement technique and the elevation survey method post and von asmuth 2013 rau et al 2019 other sources of uncertainty are modelled implicitly using a nugget effect parameter in the semi variogram models see diggle et al 1998 the uncertainty due to the range of measurements above and below the mean was denoted as σ t x and where adequate data were available i e 10 measurements this was manually interpreted from hydrographs of the time series data based on the range of measurements about the mean excluding clear outliers e g measurements influenced by pumping in cases with inadequate time series i e 10 measurements values of 0 4 and 1 9 m were assigned based on the average of the ranges observed from time series in the triassic and permian formations respectively an additional 2 m of uncertainty was added to wells with single measurements i e a total σ t x of 2 4 and 3 9 m for the triassic and permian respectively to reflect the uncertainty in groundwater levels following well construction and the lack of measurement repeatability hydraulic head measurements were assigned an elevation survey uncertainty denoted σ e x based on the elevation survey method detailed in the metadata the reference elevation e g top of casing is the point from which water levels are measured at well locations and was presumed to be measured with three alternative levels of uncertainty 1 high precision survey σ e x 0 04 m garrido et al 2011 2 global positioning system σ e x 1 8 m wing and frank 2011 and 3 estimated elevation from digital elevation model dem for which σ e x was presumed to be 5 m based on the average of the bare areas and shrubland scenarios described by rexer and hirt 2014 in the absence of a reported survey method σ e x was set to 5 m assuming the poorest precision method these σ e x values were presumed to be normally distributed and were multiplied by 2 to construct intervals reflecting the range of plausible elevation values above and below the elevation measurement measurement uncertainty arising from instrument error denoted σ m x varies between measurement techniques including dip meters automated loggers vibrating wire piezometers and drill stem tests rau et al 2019 in the absence of detailed reporting on the instrument specification or data collection methods a conservative approach was adopted by assigning measurements collected with dip meters automated loggers or vibrating wire piezometers a value for σ m x consistent with the poorest precision method i e dip meter with σ m x 8 4 mm rau et al 2019 these σ m x values were presumed to be normally distributed so were multiplied by 2 to construct intervals reflecting the range of plausible values around the measurement it was presumed that each of the considered sources of uncertainty i e elevation survey method water level measurement technique and temporal variability were independent therefore the range around the mean was estimated as 1 σ h x σ t x σ e x σ m x 4 2 indicator transformation the hydraulic head values for each well were converted to indicator transformed values based on the probability of the measurement being less than or equal to a specified threshold value a set of m hydraulic head threshold values were selected denoted a a 1 a m to discretise the range of plausible values at the spring locations in our study we defined 16 thresholds discretised with variable spacing starting with 7 sgt elevations two springs shared the same threshold and 9 equal p quantiles from 0 to 1 derived from the empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf as described by goovaerts 2009 once the thresholds were defined the probability of the hydraulic head measurement being less than or equal to a threshold value denoted a i was estimated from the mean h x and range σ h x using the uniform cumulative distribution function grimmett and stirzaker 2020 2 i x a i 0 a i h x σ h x 2 a i h x σ h x 2 σ h x a i h x σ h x 2 h x σ h x 2 1 a i h x σ h x 2 where i x a i is the probability that a measurement is less than or equal to a i 4 3 characterising the semi variance for ordinary co kriging it is necessary to characterise the semi variance of each variable and between each of the variables which in the current study are indicator transformed values the experimental semi variogram γ δ x consists of semi variance values γ that are a function of distance between observation points and is obtained from cressie 1993 3 γ δ x 1 2 n δ x n δ x i x k a i i x l a i 2 here n δ x is a set of observation well pairs separated by euclidean distance x k x l δ x n δ x is the number of data pairs in n δ x and i x k a i and i x l a i are the indicator transformed hydraulic head values for a threshold value a i at the locations x k and x l respectively the semi variogram is obtained by applying eq 3 to a set of values of δ x the semi variance between variables here indicator transformed hydraulic head values can be assessed not only as a function of the distance between measurement sites i e eq 3 but also incorporating differences between values of i x a i that arise between elements of a this leads to a modified form of eq 3 whereby γ is calculated as a function of i x a i for alternate values within the vector a i e a i and a j where a j is an alternate hydraulic head threshold value to a i both of which are elements of a this gives the experimental cross semi variogram γ δ x a i j obtained as wackernagel 1995 4 γ δ x a i j 1 2 n δ x n δ x i x k a i i x l a i i x k a j i x l a j here a i j refers to alternative hydraulic head threshold values a i and a j note that equation 4 reduces to equation 3 if a i a j in practice eqs 3 and 4 are applied to bins of δ x values thereby obtaining γ for a set of δ x bins the choice of the number of bins in the experimental semi variogram is an essential consideration as there exists a trade off between overly smooth semi variance values when using too few bins and noisy semi variance values when using too many bins in the current study 9 bins of δ x values ranging from 0 to 3787 m to 30 299 34 087 m were adopted for the triassic formations while 14 δ x bins 0 1398 m to 18 174 19 572 m were used for the permian formations the number of δ x bins and maximum δ x values were selected to ensure that all bins contained a reasonable count of data pairs albeit this was a subjective choice this resulted in at least 22 data pairs in each δ x bin within the experimental semi variograms for the triassic formations in comparison the experimental semi variograms for the permian formations contained at least 103 data pairs this difference in the count is due to the permian formations having 78 samples available compared with the triassic formations which had 34 samples for ordinary co kriging it is necessary to know γ at distances other than the discrete distances estimated with eqs 3 and 4 and for γ to be negative definite cressie 1993 this is achieved by fitting empirical mathematical models to the relationships between semi variance and distance for experimental semi variograms and experimental cross semi variograms commonly used models include the nugget gaussian exponential spherical and matérn models goovaerts 1997 these semi variogram models can be added together to construct more complex model structures goovaerts 1997 for example the nugget model characterises the discontinuity of the semi variance at the origin i e at or near a separation distance of zero which can be included in a model structure e g with the gaussian model to characterise the measurement error and micro scale variability diggle et al 1998 in our study isotropic semi variogram models were used due to insufficient data to characterise anisotropy properly the range was selected based on the range of the experimental semi variogram of the indicator transformed values for the median value the median was used because the experimental semi variogram is best defined when approximately half the data lies on either side of the threshold value journel 1983 the fit of this range was visually assessed against the experimental semi variograms at all other thresholds where the range was not appropriate for an experimental semi variogram an additional model structure was added to include the range of that experimental semi variogram next the sills and nuggets were modified to fit the experimental semi variograms and experimental cross semi variograms subject to a constraint of positive semi definiteness i e all eigenvalues are non negative in this study the parameters of range sill and nugget were estimated using weighted least squares with weights proportional to n δ x δ x 2 following pebesma and graeler 2020 when the condition of positive semi definiteness is not met it is necessary to apply a correction in this study we used the gstat package pebesma 2004 in the r statistical language ihaka and gentleman 1996 which corrects for non positive definite matrices by setting any negative eigenvalues to zero pebesma and graeler 2020 the choice of semi variogram models was qualitative based on the visual assessment of graphs of the fit of the semi variogram models to the experimental semi variance we elected not to use leave one out cross validation loo cv for semi variogram model selection as some of the semi variogram models required the use of multiple nested model structures which meant the number of possible model combinations increased substantially e g 6 candidate models in a 2 model nested structure have 15 possible combinations as such the semi variogram models were selected qualitatively based on the shape of the experimental semi variance loo cv was used as an exploratory technique to assess how well the chosen model represented the available data and identify the locations where the model performed poorly the loo cv results were evaluated using summary statistics i e mean error me mean absolute error mae and mean standardised squared residual mssr see goovaerts 2009 for details and a spatial analysis of the residuals 4 4 predictions using ordinary co kriging in applying ordinary co kriging to estimate the probability of hydraulic head values less than or equal to a set of threshold values it is necessary to develop semi variogram models of the indicator transformed values for each threshold see section 4 3 and cross semi variogram models between each the indicator transformed values for each threshold see section 4 3 the indicator transformed values for all thresholds at a well location x can be represented as 5 i x a i x a 1 i x a m given that a 1 is the first value in a set of m thresholds and a m is the last threshold in a the probabilities of hydraulic head values at unmeasured locations x being less than or equal to the threshold values denoted i x a can be estimated using a linear combination of i x a for each of the n observation well locations myers 1982 6 i x a j 1 n i x j a λ j here λ j is a matrix of weights which are found by solving the equation myers 1982 7 j 1 n γ x i x j λ j μ γ x i x i 1 n subject to the constraint 8 j 1 n λ j i where μ is an matrix of lagrange parameters found by the solution of eq 7 γ x i x j is an matrix with the semi variance between sites x i and x j given by the semi variogram model for the indicator transformed values for each threshold as the diagonal elements and the cross semi variograms between indicator transformed values for separate thresholds as the off diagonal elements γ x i x is an matrix with the semi variance between the sites x i and x and i is the identity matrix once the probabilities of hydraulic head values less than or equal to each threshold were calculated order relation corrections were applied to ensure a valid ccdf in this study we corrected the ccdf using the average of the upwards and downwards corrections as described by deutsch and journel 1998 after order relation corrections were applied linear interpolation see deutsch and journel 1998 was used to interpolate between the threshold values examined in this study interpolation was used to allow for the prediction of hydraulic head values at selected probabilities e g the median or quartiles and of the probability of hydraulic heads less than or equal to specified threshold values e g sgts additionally the mean was estimated from the ccdf using the procedure outlined by goovaerts 2009 5 results and discussion the following sections outline and discuss i the semi variogram models and cross validation results ii the regional hydraulic head distributions in the triassic and permian formations iii the likely hydraulic head values and associated uncertainties at the spring locations iv the ccdf for hydraulic heads in the triassic and permian formations and the probabilities of hydraulic heads in each formation exceeding sgts v the likelihood of the alternate conceptual models for the source of water to the springs and vi the uncertainties and future directions for this study 5 1 semi variogram models and cross validation sixteen threshold values were used leading to 120 direct and cross experimental semi variograms fig 4 shows the semi variogram models for 5 selected p quantiles for the indicator transformed values in triassic and permian formations the 5 p quantiles were chosen as representative values to show the fit of the semi variogram models to the variety of semi variance values derived from the experimental semi variograms of the indicator transformed values for different thresholds as shown in fig 4 the semi variogram models in the triassic formations have a short range fit of 10 280 m for p 0 125 and p 0 25 which increases to 21 012 m for p 0 5 meaning hydraulic head values became dissimilar over a shorter distance for p 0 125 and p 0 25 when compared with p 0 5 this could be related to physical differences resulting in varying ranges for different p quantiles or few measurements at extreme thresholds to populate semi variograms journel 1983 this meant it was necessary to use a nested model with a short range for the lower p quantiles and a larger range for the higher p quantiles we selected the gaussian model for the model structures as the shape of the semi variance in the short range 10 000 m had a shape similar to that of the gaussian model we used a three model nested structure consisting of the nugget the gaussian with a range of 5140 m and the gaussian with a range of 10 506 m the sills and nugget values were set using a linear model of coregionalization as described in section 4 3 for example the model structure for p 0 5 consisted of a nugget of 0 02 m2 a gaussian with a range of 10506 m and a sill of 0 60 m2 and a gaussian with a range of 5140 m and a sill of 0 07 m2 as there were 120 semi variograms the sill and nugget for each semi variogram are provided in supplementary material 3 the semi variance for p 0 75 and p 0 875 was low 0 m2 due to most measurements having a high probability 1 of being less than these thresholds leading to a consistent spatial distribution that yielded low semi variance values as the sgts are located between p 0 125 and p 0 5 where the semi variance is better defined the low semi variance values for the higher p quantiles should not influence the sgt probability estimates the experimental semi variance and semi variogram models for 5 p quantiles in the permian formations are shown in fig 4 the semi variogram models exhibit a long range of 21 000 m which is consistent between the semi variance for the varying p quantiles a two model nested structure was used comprising of the nugget and the spherical model with a range of 21 000 m the sills and nuggets were fitted for each model using a linear model of coregionalization see section 4 3 for p 0 5 the two model structure consisted of a nugget of 0 01 m2 and a spherical model with a range of 21 000 m and a sill of 0 31 m2 the nugget and sill for each of the semi variogram models are provided in supplementary material 4 the semi variance for all of the shown p quantiles were well defined likely due to adequate samples to properly characterise the semi variance including at extreme p quantiles e g p 0 125 or p 0 875 for the triassic formations the model had a me of 0 83 m a mae of 5 06 m and a mssr of 0 66 the me indicated a low model bias as the me was close to 0 suggesting the model was not overly biased towards over or under predicting values the mae of 5 06 m suggested the model did not perform well at all data points cross validation predictions near the edge of the study area had higher residuals than predictions near the springs this is expected given that the fundamental assumption of the model is that points closer together are more similar i e have a lower semi variance importantly the residuals in the vicinity of the springs were lower i e between 0 and 3 9 m indicating good model performance in the area of interest fig 5 b additionally the mssr of 0 66 indicated that the prediction variance was larger than the squared residuals suggesting the model over estimated the prediction uncertainty at least for the observation locations loo cv was conducted with the data for the permian formations the results yielded a me of 0 11 m a mae of 1 64 m and a mssr of 0 41 this indicated that the model for the permian formations had a low bias i e the me was close to 0 and had good predictive abilities at least for the observation locations as signified by the low mae the mssr suggested that prediction variance was greater than the squared residuals indicating that the model overestimated prediction uncertainty at least for the observation locations spatially the loo cv residuals in the permian formations suggested low errors 5 m throughout the study area fig 6 a most importantly only one well was available near the spring locations and the residual at this location was 0 3 m fig 6b this suggested that the model performed well in this area despite few available measurements 5 2 regional hydraulic head distributions the regional hydraulic head distributions can provide an indication of recharge areas discharge areas and flow directions fig 7 displays the mean hydraulic head distributions in the triassic formations fig 7a and the permian formations fig 7b the mean hydraulic head distribution in the triassic formations suggests higher hydraulic heads 250 m to the north south and west of the springs with a lower head near the springs 230 240 m and a continued decrease to the east the lower hydraulic heads near the springs may indicate discharge occurring to the springs and or the carmichael river this is consistent with the findings of adani mining 2013 who found that water in the clematis formation a triassic unit flowed towards the dsc and carmichael river furthermore in both interpretations of the regional flow directions the flow appears to continue to the east of the springs as the formations outcrop to the east it is plausible there may be flow from the triassic formations to other formations beyond the galilee basin the mean predictions in the permian formations suggest higher hydraulic heads 230 240 m to the north south and west of the study area which lowers to 215 m in the mine area again this is consistent with the flow directions interpreted by adani mining 2013 in the colinlea formation a permian unit this pattern could indicate the presence of a discharge source in the mine site area however as no surface water bodies are observed this may suggest discharge to another aquifer unit or groundwater extraction 5 3 hydraulic head estimates at spring locations the ccdf for each spring was used to calculate statistics representing the likely hydraulic head values and associated uncertainties at the spring locations these statistics consisted of the mean median first quartile q1 third quartile q3 and interquartile range q3 q1 table 1 displays these statistics for the hydraulic head estimates in the triassic formations at each spring location the mean hydraulic head estimates in the triassic formations range from 235 8 m at spring h to 237 3 m at spring e the median is larger than the mean for all spring locations except springs e and h indicating that the ccdf is not symmetric and has a negative skew the negative skew indicates a wider range of plausible values less than the mean compared to the range of values greater than the mean the uncertainty in the mean estimate can be represented using the quartile values q1 and q3 which reflect the bounds about the mean within which there is a 0 5 probability of the true value residing the lower quartile q1 ranges from 232 7 m at spring h to 235 5 m at spring g while the upper quartile q3 ranges from 238 3 m at springs b c and d to 239 4 m at spring h the interquartile range q3 q1 for estimates at the spring locations in the triassic formations ranges from 2 9 m to 6 8 m table 2 displays the mean median quartiles and interquartile range in the permian formations at the spring locations the mean hydraulic head estimates in the permian formations range from 228 5 m at spring h to 231 1 m at springs f and g the mean values are greater than the median for all springs except for springs a e and h this suggests that the ccdf has a positive skew indicating a larger range of plausible values greater than the median the first quartile q1 ranges from 226 3 m at spring h to 228 m for springs b and c while the third quartile q3 ranges from 231 6 m at spring h to 233 9 m at spring f the interquartile ranges of permian formations range from 4 5 m for springs b c and d to 6 6 m at spring f the mean values in the permian formations are less than the sgts for all springs while the mean values for these springs in the triassic formations are less than the sgts for all springs except spring h the sgts are within the interquartile range for the hydraulic head in the triassic formations for springs a b c and h in contrast the sgts at all spring locations are higher than q3 for the hydraulic heads in the permian formations tables 1 and 2 show that the estimated mean hydraulic head values are greater in the triassic formations than the permian formations for all springs this difference between hydraulic head values in the permian and triassic formations indicates the potential vertical direction of groundwater flow if hydraulic connectivity exists across the rewan formation aquitard this hydraulic head difference has implications for interpreting the source aquifer for the dsc springs and various scenarios can be developed whereby hydraulic head differences across the rewan formation influence conceptual model development for example it may be possible that connectivity exists across the rewan formation near the springs and the permian formations provide a source of water to the triassic formations which in turn are a source of water to the dsc in this case that scenario appears unlikely as the hydraulic heads in the triassic formations appear higher than those in the permian formations suggesting the potential for downwards flow 5 4 spring geomorphic threshold probabilities the estimated probabilities i e i x a that hydraulic heads at spring locations are less than or equal to thresholds i e a are shown in fig 8 in the form of ccdfs probabilities range from 0 to 1 that is probabilities for spring b of non exceedance of 233 and 239 m are 0 and 1 respectively in the triassic formations while corresponding non exceedance probabilities for the permian formations are 0 and 1 for elevations of 220 and 245 m respectively fig 8 shows that the ccdf for permian formations changes more gradually than the ccdf for the triassic formations due to the larger range of hydraulic head values for the permian formations this is a consequence of the greater uncertainty in permian hydraulic head values relative to triassic hydraulic heads at spring locations as outlined in section 5 2 the estimates shown in fig 8 appear similar for some springs e g springs b c and d due to the close proximity of these locations see fig 1c for tabulated values of estimated probabilities the reader is directed to table a1 for the triassic formations and table a2 for the permian formations in appendix a tables a1 and a2 show that the majority of probabilities abide by order relations with order relation corrections applying predominantly to probabilities near the limits of 0 and 1 the order relation deviations at extreme values are not unexpected given the lack of data available to populate semi variograms beyond the hydraulic head elevation limits as discussed by deutsch and journel 1998 ccdfs for the triassic and permian formations can be used to assess the probability of each formation having adequate hydraulic head to exceed individual sgts referred to hereafter as sgt probabilities sgt probabilities are identified in fig 8 by the intersection of red lines sgts and ccdf curves the probabilities of the triassic and permian formations having hydraulic heads exceeding the sgts are given in table 3 these were obtained by subtracting values of i x a from one the probability that head in the triassic formations exceeds sgts at the spring locations range from 0 01 to 0 49 while the probability that permian formation heads exceed sgts ranges from 0 03 to 0 12 the results indicate that triassic formations have a moderate probability 0 24 of adequate hydraulic head to support the southern springs a b c and d and a south eastern spring h but lower probabilities 0 11 of adequate hydraulic head to support the northern springs e f g results also indicate a lower probability 0 12 that the permian formations have adequate head to exceed the sgts of all springs notably the triassic formations have a higher probability of hydraulic heads exceeding spring sgts than the permian formations for all springs except springs f and g interestingly the triassic and permian formations both have low sgt probabilities for the springs e f and g possibly suggesting an alternate source aquifer or a missing component in our conceptual models 5 5 the likelihood of alternate conceptual models the likelihood of the alternate conceptual models for the source of water to the dsc can be considered based on the regional hydraulic head distributions section 5 2 likely hydraulic head values at spring locations section 5 3 and sgt probabilities section 5 4 the regional hydraulic head distributions in the triassic formations suggested higher head in the north south and west of the study area reducing towards lower head near the springs and along the carmichael river to the west fig 7 this may suggest the occurrence of discharge e g spring flow or baseflow to the river from the triassic formations in this area while the hydraulic head distribution in the permian formations suggests higher heads to the north south and west lowering to a minimum in the mine site area fig 8 as no surface water bodies are observed in this area this pattern may indicate discharge occurring to another formation these hydraulic head distributions suggest that the triassic formations display a pattern more consistent with discharge to the dsc than that observed in the permian formations the likely hydraulic head values at the spring locations indicate the potential vertical flow directions if connectivity existed across the rewan formation in these locations the results suggest that the hydraulic head at the spring locations are likely higher in the triassic formations than in the permian formations table 1 and table 2 this indicates that if connectivity existed in these locations flow directions would likely be downwards from the triassic to the permian formations which implies it is unlikely that the permian formations could be contributing water to the triassic formations in this area the triassic formations have a higher probability than the permian formations of adequate hydraulic head to support spring flow to springs a b c d e and h sgt probabilities for springs f and g were low for both formations suggesting inconclusive findings for these springs overall the hydraulic head evidence interpreted from regional head distributions potential vertical flow directions and sgt probabilities suggests that the triassic formations are more likely than the permian formations to provide a source of water to springs a b c d e and h while results for spring f and g were inconclusive despite these findings it remains plausible that the permian formations may indirectly support the springs by providing a source of water to the triassic formations via connectivity at a location away from the spring sites thus although the triassic formations may present as the principal source of water at the spring locations i e due to hydraulic heads exceeding the sgt and flow directions converging towards the dsc the permian formations may nevertheless contribute indirectly to spring flow via leakage to and pressurisation of the triassic formations at another location in this scenario the permian formations may indirectly support spring flow even though permian heads do not exceed triassic heads at the spring locations nevertheless if connectivity exists across the rewan formation at a location then drawdown in the permian formations due to mine site dewatering may impact the dsc that is if drawdown in the permian formations propagates through connections between the two formations this will induce a net downward flux relative to the natural pre mining conditions regardless of the natural head gradient and flow direction across the rewan formation the resulting drawdown could result in the reduction or cessation of flow from the dsc even if the permian formations do not discharge either into the triassic formations or directly to the springs thus for mining activities to potentially affect spring discharge there need only to be connectivity between the permian and triassic formations close enough to the dsc that mining induced drawdown in either formation can reach the springs 5 6 uncertainties and future directions conceptual models are often accepted or rejected based on their consistency with the observed data enemark et al 2019 however the consistency of a model with observed data does not ensure that the model is a valid representation of the system oreskes et al 1994 and this consistency may change as new data becomes available enemark et al 2019 in our case both conceptual models are reasonably consistent with observations see section 5 1 but give a low probability of adequate head to support spring flow particularly for springs f and g this may be explained as either a type i error where a valid conceptual model has not been considered or a type ii error where an invalid conceptual model has been adopted neuman 2003 a plausible error type ii error is that the conceptual models did not consider the vertical stratification of hydraulic head measurements within each formation in this study most of the available measurements particularly in the triassic formations were taken at shallow depths making it difficult to characterise the vertical stratification of hydraulic heads within the formations a recently drilled well august 2020 in the triassic formation suggests an increase in the head with depth and as the analysis in the triassic formations is based primarily on shallow measurements it is plausible that it may underestimate the potential of the triassic formations to support spring flow similarly vertical stratification of hydraulic heads within the permian formations may exist which could influence modelling outcomes however there is a lack of measurements outside of the mine site to identify any vertical head stratification in the permian formations future studies should consider the vertical stratification within these formations and how this influences modelling outcomes which would require the installation of piezometers to monitor the head at various depths in both the permian and triassic formations alternately there could be a valid conceptual model being ignored e g a conceptual model where the shallow tertiary or deeper joe joe formation that underlies the permian formation provide water to the spring or there may be a lack of data to properly interrogate these conceptual models although there were more data points in the permian formations than the triassic formations i e 78 and 34 respectively these data were clustered in a region near the margin of the study area with only a few measurements in the region near the springs fig 1 the kriging weights given by the solution of eq 7 take into account the redundancy of measurements whereby measurements located close to one another may convey little additional information diggle et al 1998 as such many of the data points within localised data clusters were largely redundant and provided minimal additional information about the regional hydraulic head distribution in contrast the triassic formations had measurements over a wider spatial distribution and therefore less data redundancy than those of the permian formations fig 1a furthermore the permian had only a single well id 190229 a near the spring locations which meant the findings in the permian formations at the spring locations were highly dependent on the quality of this measurement this was a single measurement collected on the same day as drilling without a reported survey method and thus was assigned a mean of 229 86 m i e the measured value and a range of 222 9 to 236 8 m based on the considered uncertainties as demonstrated by the cross validation map of residuals fig 6 the inclusion of this well had little impact on the mean predictions as the predicted value at this well when censoring the observation was 229 57 m which is within 0 3 m of the observed head value however the inclusion of this observation reduced the uncertainty of predictions substantially in the vicinity of the springs this influenced the sgt probabilities for the permian formations by reducing the plausibility of adequate head to meet the sgts the modelling of the impacts of mine induced drawdown on the dsc outlined in the environmental impact statement assumes that the source aquifer is the triassic formations and that adaptive management will be applied to mitigate impacts upon the springs adani mining 2013 however studies by other investigators e g webb 2015 currell et al 2017 csiro and geoscience australia 2019 werner et al 2019 currell et al 2020 have suggested that there is substantial uncertainty in the source aquifer of the dsc and that the permian conceptualisation remains plausible the results of this study indicate that the triassic conceptualisation is more likely than the permian conceptualisation although both conceptualisations remain plausible significant uncertainty exists in our assessment due to hydraulic head measurement scarcity in the vicinity of the springs and the analysis only considering a single data type neuman and wierenga 2003 furthermore the locations and degree of inter aquifer connectivity across the rewan formation aquitard is a major source of uncertainty csiro and geoscience australia 2019 which will control how the drawdown in the permian formations will impact the dsc despite the remaining conceptual model uncertainties and the unsuitability of adaptive management to scenarios with time delayed or irreversible impacts currell et al 2017 thomann et al 2020 the mine has been approved future studies should aim to reduce the conceptual model uncertainty to identify potential impacts and mitigation strategies this could be achieved through the installation of additional monitoring wells at various depths in the major formations as well as by analysing other data types including hydrochemistry and geophysical surveys and investigating the degree of inter aquifer connectivity across the rewan formation aquitard at and away from the dsc 6 conclusions knowledge of hydraulic head distributions throughout aquifers can assist in hydrogeological conceptual model development and assessment ordinary indicator co kriging is a geostatistical interpolation technique that estimates hydraulic head values and their uncertainties at unmeasured locations these hydraulic head estimates can be used to quantitatively assess the probability of hydraulic heads exceeding specified thresholds at unmeasured locations additionally when expert knowledge is available for physical thresholds in the hydrogeological system e g hydraulic head thresholds required for spring flow the likelihood of conceptual models meeting these physical thresholds can be quantitatively assessed this approach is widely applicable throughout hydrogeology in the assessment of conceptual models the application of the ordinary indicator co kriging in conceptual model assessment was demonstrated using the hydraulic head data from the alternate hypothesised source aquifers of the dsc the analysis indicated likelihoods ranging from 0 01 to 0 49 that the triassic formations have adequate hydraulic head to support flow to the dsc springs assessed here while there was a lower likelihood i e 0 03 0 12 that the springs could derive water from the deeper permian formations these results suggest that the triassic formations have a higher likelihood of adequate hydraulic head than the permian formations however significant uncertainty exists in the conceptual model assessment due to hydraulic head measurement scarcity in the vicinity of the springs particularly in the permian formations and the analysis only considering a single data type furthermore the locations and degree of inter aquifer connectivity across the rewan formation aquitard is a major source of uncertainty which will influence the likelihood of alternate conceptual models and control how the drawdown in the permian formations will impact the dsc as such we suggest that further studies are conducted to complement this research through the collection of additional hydraulic head measurements analysis of other data types including hydrochemistry and geophysical surveys and further investigation into the degree of inter aquifer connectivity across the rewan formation aquitard at and away from the dsc credit authorship contribution statement robin keegan treloar conceptualization methodology software

4355,hydraulic head distributions can inform spring source water characterisation by determining whether aquifers meet the thresholds required to sustain spring flow assessing hydraulic head data can be challenging in areas where data are sparsely distributed and subject to variable measurement uncertainty geostatistical methods can be used to estimate hydraulic head values at unmeasured locations with quantitative uncertainty estimates while these methods have been applied extensively for hydraulic head estimation in management contexts no studies have used these approaches for spring source water conceptual model testing in this study an investigation into the hydraulic head distribution was conducted through the application of ordinary indicator co kriging interpolated hydraulic head estimates were used to quantitatively assess the plausibility of source aquifer conceptual models for the doongmabulla springs complex dsc queensland australia the results offer insights into the likelihood of alternative source aquifers having adequate head to support flow to eight springs within the dsc probabilities of adequate head to support the springs ranged from 0 03 to 0 12 for the permian formations compared to 0 01 to 0 49 for the triassic formations analyses indicated that the triassic formations are more likely to have adequate hydraulic head to support spring flow however significant uncertainty exists in the conceptual model assessment due to hydraulic head measurement scarcity particularly in the vicinity of the springs these findings have important implications given that the permian formations will be dewatered by the operation of the nearby carmichael coal mine the techniques employed here can inform conceptual model uncertainties arising from the interpretation of sparsely distributed hydraulic head datasets a major benefit over traditional interpolation methods keywords conceptual model testing interpolation methods measurement uncertainty ordinary indicator co kriging geostatistics hydraulic heads 1 introduction in hydrogeological investigations the development of conceptual models requires the synthesis of uncertain observations and expert knowledge leading to multiple plausible conceptual models oreskes et al 1994 neuman and wierenga 2003 when mathematically modelled alternative conceptual models may provide vastly different estimates of hydrogeological behaviour despite comparable consistency with field observations oreskes et al 1994 bredehoeft 2003 neuman and wierenga 2003 this leads to non uniqueness in the mathematical representations of hydrogeological systems the importance of considering alternative conceptual models has been recognised neuman and wierenga 2003 bredehoeft 2005 enemark et al 2019 however such conceptual models are rarely considered in practice bredehoeft 2005 failure to consider alternative conceptual models is problematic as it can result in underestimation of the uncertainty of predictions e g hydraulic heads groundwater fluxes solute concentrations enemark et al 2019 the importance of considering conceptual model uncertainty for decision making is well recognised in management frameworks such as adaptive management e g williams et al 2009 thomann et al 2020 hydraulic head is a measure of fluid potential that is used to determine groundwater flow patterns freeze and cherry 1979 and to inform conceptual model development neuman and wierenga 2003 hydraulic head measurements are typically sparsely distributed and collected infrequently with varying precision post and von asmuth 2013 rau et al 2019 expert knowledge and mathematical models are invariably needed to interpret hydraulic head data and predict hydraulic heads at unmeasured locations hydraulic head data may be analysed manually by contouring e g salama et al 1996 siegel 2008 or through the use of automated mathematical approaches such as kriging e g bastin and gevers 1985 nikroo et al 2010 varouchakis and hristopulos 2013 quay et al 2020 or inverse distance weighted interpolation e g philip and watson 1986 varouchakis and hristopulos 2013 by manually contouring hydraulic head data hydrogeologists can include their understanding of the system into the interpretation kresic 2006 for example information on the subsurface hydrogeological features e g faults or dykes surface features e g lakes or rivers or physical properties e g changes in hydraulic conductivity may assist in the interpretation of regional flow directions boundary effects e g no flow boundaries and recharge discharge stresses salama et al 1996 siegel 2008 in contrast automated techniques provide the ability to assess a wide range of alternative conceptual models through interpolation algorithms which is generally infeasible with manual contouring however it is often challenging to include qualitative expert knowledge and understanding into automated analyses failure to consider expert knowledge and understanding can result in unrealistic interpretations of the hydraulic head salama et al 1996 siegel 2008 peeters et al 2010 for example in a case study of the cuballing catchment western australia salama et al 1996 described hydraulic head predictions that intersect the surface elevation for unconfined aquifers automated interpolation approaches applied to groundwater datasets include various forms of kriging which is used routinely to interpolate datasets in developing hydrogeological conceptual models journel 1983 developed a modified form of kriging indicator kriging ik whereby data are transformed to binary indicators of 1 for values less than or equal to a threshold value or 0 otherwise the resulting indicators are termed indicator transformed values the probability of a value less than or equal to the threshold value can be estimated at unmeasured locations by kriging the indicator transformed values this process can be applied for a series of threshold values using co kriging to estimate the conditional cumulative distribution function ccdf at unmeasured locations the ik technique makes no distribution assumptions and allows for a quantitative assessment of the uncertainty of predicted values at unmeasured locations journel 1983 however in cases of high measurement uncertainty the use of a binary indicator transform i e either 0 or 1 may be problematic as the measured values could plausibly be coded as either of the indicator values leading to uncertainty in the indicator transformed values furthermore ik can result in predictions at unmeasured locations outside of the 0 to 1 bounds of probability journel 1986 to address these limitations journel 1986 extended the technique to include expert knowledge in the form of constraints and prior probability distributions the constraints ensure predictions lie within reasonable limits while the prior probability distributions allow the inclusion of uncertain information based on observations or expert knowledge in this way ik provides the ability to overcome issues of unrealistic predictions and allows the user to include their qualitative expert knowledge into the modelling process in hydrogeology ik has been widely applied to assess the probability of values of interest being above or below a chosen threshold based on a set of observations e g saito and goovaerts 2002 liu et al 2004 lyon et al 2006 arslan 2012 anane et al 2014 chica olmo et al 2014 varouchakis et al 2020 for example ik has been used to compare contaminant concentrations with thresholds for remediation e g saito and goovaerts 2002 to assess water quality parameters against guidelines for water use e g arslan 2012 anane et al 2014 chica olmo et al 2014 and to evaluate the probability of saturated soil conditions e g lyon et al 2006 ik has also been used to evaluate the probability of hydraulic heads dropping below a threshold value selected to avoid groundwater depletion varouchakis et al 2020 despite the widespread use of ik throughout the field of hydrogeology we are unaware of any studies that have used ik to assess the probability of alternative aquifers having adequate hydraulic head to drive spring flow this study applies ik to hydraulic head data to assess the likelihood of alternative conceptual models relating to the source of discharge from a spring complex the method evaluates the probability that an aquifer has adequate hydraulic head to meet a threshold required for spring flow this threshold referred to as the spring geomorphic threshold sgt is defined as the topographical elevation in the vicinity of a spring vent that controls whether the spring will discharge to the surrounding landscape merrick 2015 currell et al 2017 the springs considered in this study are part of the ecologically and culturally significant doongmabulla springs complex dsc located in queensland australia fensham et al 2016 currell et al 2017 currell et al 2020 the flow contribution to the dsc from underlying aquifers i e the triassic aged and permian aged formations of the galilee basin is disputed currell et al 2017 currell et al 2020 since the nearby carmichael coal mine is expected to dewater the deeper permian formations to support mining activities currell et al 2017 currell et al 2020 a better understanding of the water source to the dsc is essential for the ongoing conservation efforts 2 study area the dsc is a collection of freshwater springs located in the galilee basin queensland australia fig 1 the dsc provides water to an extensive wetland system that is listed in the national directory of important wetlands in australia environment australia 2001 these wetlands offer niche habitat for several endangered species and are culturally significant to the wangan and jagalingou people fensham et al 2016 currell et al 2017 the eight springs examined in this study see fig 1c were selected for being representative of the varying spring morphologies throughout the dsc these springs were classified into two categories based on the spring morphology the first category discharge springs are hypothesised to occur due to artesian discharge via vertical conduits in flatter areas fensham et al 2016 in contrast the second category outcrop springs are hypothesised to occur due to lateral discharge in areas of sloping topography where the triassic formations outcrop fensham et al 2016 the discharge springs show a variety of surface expressions such as mounded vegetated areas with pooled water e g springs b c d and e a modified dam surrounding a spring vent e g spring f springs with discrete vents that discharge to wetland systems e g spring a and small vegetated areas without visible pooled surface water e g spring g photograph shown in fig 2 b the outcrop spring examined in this study spring h photograph shown in fig 2a did not have a visible discrete vent but rather a large pooled area 100 m2 which discharges to an extensive wetland system the surface expression of the spring vent is important for characterising the sgts as they vary between springs surrounded by mounds or dams and those in flatter areas in the case of discrete mound form springs the sgt is the minimum elevation of the mound over which spring water flows while in flatter areas with more diffuse springs the sgt is simply the topographic elevation of the spring discharge point the sgts for the springs considered in this study were measured in may 2019 using a trimble r10 integrated gnss system with a precision of 8 mm horizontal and 15 mm vertical trimble navigation limited 2014 the triassic formation aquifers see fig 1b consist of the moolayember formation made up of sandstones and siltstones the clematis formation composed of siltstone sandstone and mudstone and the dunda beds consisting of predominantly sandstone aecom 2021 the triassic formations are separated from the permian formations by the triassic aged rewan formation fig 1b primarily composed of siltstone fine grained sandstone clays and mudstone aecom 2021 the rewan formation is considered a competent aquitard at least in the areas where monitoring infrastructure has been installed aecom 2021 the permian formations fig 1b consist of the bandanna formation made up of lithic sandstone siltstone and coal seams which overlies the colinlea sandstone composed of quartz sandstone conglomerate with minor shale and coal seams aecom 2021 there are several proposed and active mining developments throughout the galilee basin that target the coal seams in the permian formations in areas where these formations outcrop along the edge of the basin these developments include the currently under construction carmichael coal mine located approximately 8 km to the east of the dsc fig 1a the imminent mining operations will potentially dewater the permian formations that underlie the triassic rewan formation aquitard fig 1b currell et al 2017 the triassic formations which outcrop to the west of the mine site are unlikely to be impacted directly by the mine construction currell et al 2017 however it is currently unclear whether dewatering and associated reductions in hydraulic head in the permian formations will propagate through the rewan formation and impact the water levels in the triassic formations currell et al 2017 csiro and geoscience australia 2019 furthermore if the springs rely even partially on groundwater from the permian formations mine induced reductions in pressure could lead to the cessation of spring flow currell et al 2017 currell et al 2020 despite these concerns the mine was approved currell et al 2020 currently there exist two conceptual models explaining the source of water to the dsc currell et al 2017 the first conceptualisation assumes that the rewan formation see fig 1b is a competent laterally extensive aquitard comprised of sediments that do not allow significant vertical flow bradley 2015 in this conceptual model the dsc relies entirely on groundwater from the triassic formations bradley 2015 the mine induced drawdown in the permian formations will be less likely to impact the springs in this case bradley 2015 the second conceptualisation proposes that the dsc may receive water at least in part from the permian formations via leakage or preferential flow e g via faulting through the rewan formation webb 2015 in this case the drawdown in the permian formations will more likely pose a significant threat to the long term survival of the dsc webb 2015 the outcomes of these previous studies highlight that further work is required to identify the potential risk of mine impacts on the springs 3 data sources the data used in this study were collated from the queensland groundwater database the department of state development 2018 and the aecom 2021 report a total of 34 and 78 wells had available hydraulic head measurements in the triassic and permian formations respectively some of these wells featured extensive time series of up to 10 years of daily measurements 6 and 39 in the triassic and permian respectively while others 28 and 39 in the triassic and permian respectively featured few 10 measurements fig 3 a displays the time series data for well id 158090 a in the triassic formations the range of variability is relatively low 0 6 m indicating reasonably consistent hydraulic head conditions over the 7 year measurement period six wells in the triassic formations featured time series data and the temporal variability of these wells varied from 1 m to 0 2 m with an average range of 0 4 m the remaining 28 wells in the triassic formations featured few 10 or single measurements fig 3b shows hydraulic head time series in well id 158069 a in the permian formations the period 2015 to mid 2017 displays a seasonal pattern with a range of 0 2 m the hydraulic head values have a small range 0 4 m indicating that the groundwater conditions have remained relatively stable over the measurement period in total 39 wells in the permian formations had time series data and the range of measurements varied between 0 1 m and 5 m with an average of 1 9 m the other 39 wells in the permian formations featured few 10 or single measurements a table of the hydraulic head data available from each well in the triassic and permian formations is provided as supplementary material 1 4 methods the methodology aims to evaluate the likelihood that hypothesised spring source aquifers have sufficient hydraulic head to support discharge to eight springs in the dsc this process can be separated into i assessing the uncertainty of the available hydraulic head measurements ii transforming the hydraulic head data to indicator transformed values relative to threshold values iii characterising the semi variance and iv applying ordinary co kriging to make predictions at unmeasured locations 4 1 hydraulic head measurement uncertainty prior to the commencement of mine site dewatering in 2019 it was presumed that seasonal and random variations in head occur around a stationary mean value and otherwise the groundwater system was in a steady state the steady state assumption was reasonable as there was limited groundwater abstraction in the area and where multi year records were available the range was relatively small on average approximately 0 4 and 1 9 m in the triassic and permian formations respectively see section 3 where time series data were available the mean hydraulic head denoted h x for each well was estimated as the arithmetic mean of pre 2019 records except in the case of wells influenced by pumping or where only post 2019 records were available in the case of pumping the mean was estimated by discarding measurements that were believed to be influenced by pumping and estimating the mean for wells that only featured post 2019 records the earliest dated measurement was selected to represent the mean as this measurement was expected to be least impacted by mine site dewatering in total all triassic wells and 73 permian wells were estimated from the mean of pre 2019 records while 3 permian wells were interpreted to be influenced by pumping and 2 permian wells featured only post 2019 records hydrographs and interpretations for each well are provided in supplementary material 2 in this study uncertainty is considered as a combination of accuracy and precision whereby measurement precision is defined as the spread of measurements around the mean and the measurement accuracy is the closeness of the mean to the true value post and von asmuth 2013 we consider explicitly the major factors expected to influence measurement uncertainty including the temporal variability of hydraulic head measurements the hydraulic head measurement technique and the elevation survey method post and von asmuth 2013 rau et al 2019 other sources of uncertainty are modelled implicitly using a nugget effect parameter in the semi variogram models see diggle et al 1998 the uncertainty due to the range of measurements above and below the mean was denoted as σ t x and where adequate data were available i e 10 measurements this was manually interpreted from hydrographs of the time series data based on the range of measurements about the mean excluding clear outliers e g measurements influenced by pumping in cases with inadequate time series i e 10 measurements values of 0 4 and 1 9 m were assigned based on the average of the ranges observed from time series in the triassic and permian formations respectively an additional 2 m of uncertainty was added to wells with single measurements i e a total σ t x of 2 4 and 3 9 m for the triassic and permian respectively to reflect the uncertainty in groundwater levels following well construction and the lack of measurement repeatability hydraulic head measurements were assigned an elevation survey uncertainty denoted σ e x based on the elevation survey method detailed in the metadata the reference elevation e g top of casing is the point from which water levels are measured at well locations and was presumed to be measured with three alternative levels of uncertainty 1 high precision survey σ e x 0 04 m garrido et al 2011 2 global positioning system σ e x 1 8 m wing and frank 2011 and 3 estimated elevation from digital elevation model dem for which σ e x was presumed to be 5 m based on the average of the bare areas and shrubland scenarios described by rexer and hirt 2014 in the absence of a reported survey method σ e x was set to 5 m assuming the poorest precision method these σ e x values were presumed to be normally distributed and were multiplied by 2 to construct intervals reflecting the range of plausible elevation values above and below the elevation measurement measurement uncertainty arising from instrument error denoted σ m x varies between measurement techniques including dip meters automated loggers vibrating wire piezometers and drill stem tests rau et al 2019 in the absence of detailed reporting on the instrument specification or data collection methods a conservative approach was adopted by assigning measurements collected with dip meters automated loggers or vibrating wire piezometers a value for σ m x consistent with the poorest precision method i e dip meter with σ m x 8 4 mm rau et al 2019 these σ m x values were presumed to be normally distributed so were multiplied by 2 to construct intervals reflecting the range of plausible values around the measurement it was presumed that each of the considered sources of uncertainty i e elevation survey method water level measurement technique and temporal variability were independent therefore the range around the mean was estimated as 1 σ h x σ t x σ e x σ m x 4 2 indicator transformation the hydraulic head values for each well were converted to indicator transformed values based on the probability of the measurement being less than or equal to a specified threshold value a set of m hydraulic head threshold values were selected denoted a a 1 a m to discretise the range of plausible values at the spring locations in our study we defined 16 thresholds discretised with variable spacing starting with 7 sgt elevations two springs shared the same threshold and 9 equal p quantiles from 0 to 1 derived from the empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf as described by goovaerts 2009 once the thresholds were defined the probability of the hydraulic head measurement being less than or equal to a threshold value denoted a i was estimated from the mean h x and range σ h x using the uniform cumulative distribution function grimmett and stirzaker 2020 2 i x a i 0 a i h x σ h x 2 a i h x σ h x 2 σ h x a i h x σ h x 2 h x σ h x 2 1 a i h x σ h x 2 where i x a i is the probability that a measurement is less than or equal to a i 4 3 characterising the semi variance for ordinary co kriging it is necessary to characterise the semi variance of each variable and between each of the variables which in the current study are indicator transformed values the experimental semi variogram γ δ x consists of semi variance values γ that are a function of distance between observation points and is obtained from cressie 1993 3 γ δ x 1 2 n δ x n δ x i x k a i i x l a i 2 here n δ x is a set of observation well pairs separated by euclidean distance x k x l δ x n δ x is the number of data pairs in n δ x and i x k a i and i x l a i are the indicator transformed hydraulic head values for a threshold value a i at the locations x k and x l respectively the semi variogram is obtained by applying eq 3 to a set of values of δ x the semi variance between variables here indicator transformed hydraulic head values can be assessed not only as a function of the distance between measurement sites i e eq 3 but also incorporating differences between values of i x a i that arise between elements of a this leads to a modified form of eq 3 whereby γ is calculated as a function of i x a i for alternate values within the vector a i e a i and a j where a j is an alternate hydraulic head threshold value to a i both of which are elements of a this gives the experimental cross semi variogram γ δ x a i j obtained as wackernagel 1995 4 γ δ x a i j 1 2 n δ x n δ x i x k a i i x l a i i x k a j i x l a j here a i j refers to alternative hydraulic head threshold values a i and a j note that equation 4 reduces to equation 3 if a i a j in practice eqs 3 and 4 are applied to bins of δ x values thereby obtaining γ for a set of δ x bins the choice of the number of bins in the experimental semi variogram is an essential consideration as there exists a trade off between overly smooth semi variance values when using too few bins and noisy semi variance values when using too many bins in the current study 9 bins of δ x values ranging from 0 to 3787 m to 30 299 34 087 m were adopted for the triassic formations while 14 δ x bins 0 1398 m to 18 174 19 572 m were used for the permian formations the number of δ x bins and maximum δ x values were selected to ensure that all bins contained a reasonable count of data pairs albeit this was a subjective choice this resulted in at least 22 data pairs in each δ x bin within the experimental semi variograms for the triassic formations in comparison the experimental semi variograms for the permian formations contained at least 103 data pairs this difference in the count is due to the permian formations having 78 samples available compared with the triassic formations which had 34 samples for ordinary co kriging it is necessary to know γ at distances other than the discrete distances estimated with eqs 3 and 4 and for γ to be negative definite cressie 1993 this is achieved by fitting empirical mathematical models to the relationships between semi variance and distance for experimental semi variograms and experimental cross semi variograms commonly used models include the nugget gaussian exponential spherical and matérn models goovaerts 1997 these semi variogram models can be added together to construct more complex model structures goovaerts 1997 for example the nugget model characterises the discontinuity of the semi variance at the origin i e at or near a separation distance of zero which can be included in a model structure e g with the gaussian model to characterise the measurement error and micro scale variability diggle et al 1998 in our study isotropic semi variogram models were used due to insufficient data to characterise anisotropy properly the range was selected based on the range of the experimental semi variogram of the indicator transformed values for the median value the median was used because the experimental semi variogram is best defined when approximately half the data lies on either side of the threshold value journel 1983 the fit of this range was visually assessed against the experimental semi variograms at all other thresholds where the range was not appropriate for an experimental semi variogram an additional model structure was added to include the range of that experimental semi variogram next the sills and nuggets were modified to fit the experimental semi variograms and experimental cross semi variograms subject to a constraint of positive semi definiteness i e all eigenvalues are non negative in this study the parameters of range sill and nugget were estimated using weighted least squares with weights proportional to n δ x δ x 2 following pebesma and graeler 2020 when the condition of positive semi definiteness is not met it is necessary to apply a correction in this study we used the gstat package pebesma 2004 in the r statistical language ihaka and gentleman 1996 which corrects for non positive definite matrices by setting any negative eigenvalues to zero pebesma and graeler 2020 the choice of semi variogram models was qualitative based on the visual assessment of graphs of the fit of the semi variogram models to the experimental semi variance we elected not to use leave one out cross validation loo cv for semi variogram model selection as some of the semi variogram models required the use of multiple nested model structures which meant the number of possible model combinations increased substantially e g 6 candidate models in a 2 model nested structure have 15 possible combinations as such the semi variogram models were selected qualitatively based on the shape of the experimental semi variance loo cv was used as an exploratory technique to assess how well the chosen model represented the available data and identify the locations where the model performed poorly the loo cv results were evaluated using summary statistics i e mean error me mean absolute error mae and mean standardised squared residual mssr see goovaerts 2009 for details and a spatial analysis of the residuals 4 4 predictions using ordinary co kriging in applying ordinary co kriging to estimate the probability of hydraulic head values less than or equal to a set of threshold values it is necessary to develop semi variogram models of the indicator transformed values for each threshold see section 4 3 and cross semi variogram models between each the indicator transformed values for each threshold see section 4 3 the indicator transformed values for all thresholds at a well location x can be represented as 5 i x a i x a 1 i x a m given that a 1 is the first value in a set of m thresholds and a m is the last threshold in a the probabilities of hydraulic head values at unmeasured locations x being less than or equal to the threshold values denoted i x a can be estimated using a linear combination of i x a for each of the n observation well locations myers 1982 6 i x a j 1 n i x j a λ j here λ j is a matrix of weights which are found by solving the equation myers 1982 7 j 1 n γ x i x j λ j μ γ x i x i 1

semi variogram model for the indicator transformed values for each threshold as the diagonal elements and the cross semi variograms between indicator transformed values for separate thresholds as the off diagonal elements γ x i x is an matrix with the semi variance between the sites x i and x and i is the identity matrix once the probabilities of hydraulic head values less than or equal to each threshold were calculated order relation corrections were applied to ensure a valid ccdf in this study we corrected the ccdf using the average of the upwards and downwards corrections as described by deutsch and journel 1998 after order relation corrections were applied linear interpolation see deutsch and journel 1998 was used to interpolate between the threshold values examined in this study interpolation was used to allow for the prediction of hydraulic head values at selected probabilities e g the median or quartiles and of the probability of hydraulic heads less than or equal to specified threshold values e g sgts additionally the mean was estimated from the ccdf using the procedure outlined by goovaerts 2009 5 results and discussion the following sections outline and discuss i the semi variogram models and cross validation results ii the regional hydraulic head distributions in the triassic and permian formations iii the likely hydraulic head values and associated uncertainties at the spring locations iv the ccdf for hydraulic heads in the triassic and permian formations and the probabilities of hydraulic heads in each formation exceeding sgts v the likelihood

values were used leading to 120 direct and cross experimental semi variograms fig 4 shows the semi variogram models for 5 selected p quantiles for the indicator transformed values in triassic and permian formations the 5 p quantiles were chosen as representative values to show the fit of the semi variogram models to the variety of semi variance values derived from the experimental semi variograms of the indicator transformed values for different thresholds as shown in fig 4 the semi variogram models in the triassic formations have a short range fit of 10 280 m for p 0 125 and p 0 25 which increases to 21 012 m for p 0 5 meaning hydraulic head values became dissimilar over a shorter distance for p 0 125 and p 0 25 when compared with p 0 5 this could be related to physical differences resulting in varying ranges for different p quantiles or few measurements at extreme thresholds to populate semi variograms journel 1983 this meant it was necessary to use a nested model with a short range for the lower p quantiles and a larger range for the higher p quantiles we selected the gaussian model for the model structures as the shape of the semi variance in the short range 10 000 m had a shape similar to that of the gaussian model we used a three model nested structure consisting of the nugget the gaussian with a range of 5140 m and the gaussian with a range of 10 506 m the sills and nugget values were set using a linear model of coregionalization as described in section 4 3 for example the model structure for p 0 5 consisted of a nugget of 0 02 m2 a gaussian with a range of 10506 m and a sill of 0 60 m2 and a gaussian with a range of 5140 m and a sill of 0 07 m2 as there were 120 semi variograms the sill and nugget for each semi variogram are provided in supplementary material 3 the semi variance for p 0 75 and p 0 875 was low 0 m2 due to most measurements having a high probability 1 of being less than these thresholds leading to a consistent spatial distribution that yielded low semi variance values as the sgts are located between p 0 125 and p 0 5 where the semi variance is better defined the low semi variance values for the higher p quantiles should not influence the sgt probability estimates the experimental semi variance and semi variogram models for 5 p quantiles in the permian formations are shown in fig 4 the semi variogram models exhibit a long range of 21 000 m which is consistent between the semi variance for the varying p quantiles a two model nested structure was used comprising of the nugget and the spherical model with a range of 21 000 m the sills and nuggets were fitted for each model using a linear model of coregionalization see section 4 3 for p 0 5 the two model structure consisted of a nugget of 0 01 m2 and a spherical model with a range of 21 000 m and a sill of 0 31 m2 the nugget and sill for each of the semi variogram models are provided in supplementary material 4 the semi variance for all of the shown p quantiles were well defined likely due to adequate samples to properly characterise the semi variance including at extreme p quantiles e g p 0 125 or p 0 875 for the triassic formations the model had a me of 0 83 m a mae of 5 06 m and a mssr of 0 66 the me indicated a low model bias as the me was close to 0 suggesting the model was not overly biased towards over or under predicting values the mae of 5 06 m suggested the model did not perform well at all data points cross validation predictions near the edge of the study area had higher residuals than predictions near the springs this is expected given that the fundamental assumption of the model is that points closer together are more similar i e have a lower semi variance importantly the residuals in the vicinity of the springs were lower i e between 0 and 3 9 m indicating good model performance in the area of interest fig 5 b additionally the mssr of 0 66 indicated that the prediction variance was larger than the squared residuals suggesting the model over estimated the prediction uncertainty at least for the observation locations loo cv was conducted with the data for the permian formations the results yielded a me of 0 11 m a mae of 1 64 m and a mssr of 0 41 this indicated that the model for the permian formations had a low bias i e the me was close to 0 and had good predictive abilities at least for the observation locations as signified by the low mae the mssr suggested that prediction variance was greater than the squared residuals indicating that the model overestimated prediction uncertainty at least for the observation locations spatially the loo cv residuals in the permian formations suggested low errors 5 m throughout the study area fig 6 a most importantly only one well was available near the spring locations and the residual at this location was 0 3 m fig 6b this suggested that the model performed well in this area despite few available measurements 5 2 regional hydraulic head distributions the regional hydraulic head distributions can provide an indication of recharge areas discharge areas and flow directions fig 7 displays the mean hydraulic head distributions in the triassic formations fig 7a and the permian formations fig 7b the mean hydraulic head distribution in the triassic formations suggests higher hydraulic heads 250 m to the north south and west of the springs with a lower head near the springs 230 240 m and a continued decrease to the east the lower hydraulic heads near the springs may indicate discharge occurring to the springs and or the carmichael river this is consistent with the findings of adani mining 2013 who found that water in the clematis formation a triassic unit flowed towards the dsc and carmichael river furthermore in both interpretations of the regional flow directions the flow appears to continue to the east of the springs as the formations outcrop to the east it is plausible there may be flow from the triassic formations to other formations beyond the galilee basin the mean predictions in the permian formations suggest higher hydraulic heads 230 240 m to the north south and west of the study area which lowers to 215 m in the mine area again this is consistent with the flow directions interpreted by adani mining 2013 in the colinlea formation a permian unit this pattern could indicate the presence of a discharge source in the mine site area however as no surface water bodies are observed this may suggest discharge to another aquifer unit or groundwater extraction 5 3 hydraulic head estimates at spring locations the ccdf for each spring was used to calculate statistics representing the likely hydraulic head values and associated uncertainties at the spring locations these statistics consisted of the mean median first quartile q1 third quartile q3 and interquartile range q3 q1 table 1 displays these statistics for the hydraulic head estimates in the triassic formations at each spring location the mean hydraulic head estimates in the triassic formations range from 235 8 m at spring h to 237 3 m at spring e the median is larger than the mean for all spring locations except springs e and h indicating that the ccdf is not symmetric and has a negative skew the negative skew indicates a wider range of plausible values less than the mean compared to the range of values greater than the mean the uncertainty in the mean estimate can be represented using the quartile values q1 and q3 which reflect the bounds about the mean within which there is a 0 5 probability of the true value residing the lower quartile q1 ranges from 232 7 m at spring h to 235 5 m at spring g while the upper quartile q3 ranges from 238 3 m at springs b c and d to 239 4 m at spring h the interquartile range q3 q1 for estimates at the spring locations in the triassic formations ranges from 2 9 m to 6 8 m table 2 displays the mean median quartiles and interquartile range in the permian formations at the spring locations the mean hydraulic head estimates in the permian formations range from 228 5 m at spring h to 231 1 m at springs f and g the mean values are greater than the median for all springs except for springs a e and h this suggests that the ccdf has a positive skew indicating a larger range of plausible values greater than the median the first quartile q1 ranges from 226 3 m at spring h to 228 m for springs b and c while the third quartile q3 ranges from 231 6 m at spring h to 233 9 m at spring f the interquartile ranges of permian formations range from 4 5 m for springs b c and d to 6 6 m at spring f the mean values in the permian formations are less than the sgts for all springs while the mean values for these springs in the triassic formations are less than the sgts for all springs except spring h the sgts are within the interquartile range for the hydraulic head in the triassic formations for springs a b c and h in contrast the sgts at all spring locations are higher than q3 for the hydraulic heads in the permian formations tables 1 and 2 show that the estimated mean hydraulic head values are greater in the triassic formations than the permian formations for all springs this difference between hydraulic head values in the permian and triassic formations indicates the potential vertical direction of groundwater flow if hydraulic connectivity exists across the rewan formation aquitard this hydraulic head difference has implications for interpreting the source aquifer for the dsc springs and various scenarios can be developed whereby hydraulic head differences across the rewan formation influence conceptual model development for example it may be possible that connectivity exists across the rewan formation near the springs and the permian formations provide a source of water to the triassic formations which in turn are a source of water to the dsc in this case that scenario appears unlikely as the hydraulic heads in the triassic formations appear higher than those in the permian formations suggesting the potential for downwards flow 5 4 spring geomorphic threshold probabilities the estimated probabilities i e i x a that hydraulic heads at spring locations are less than or equal to thresholds i e a are shown in fig 8 in the form of ccdfs probabilities range from 0 to 1 that is probabilities for spring b of non exceedance of 233 and 239 m are 0 and 1 respectively in the triassic formations while corresponding non exceedance probabilities for the permian formations are 0 and 1 for elevations of 220 and 245 m respectively fig 8 shows that the ccdf for permian formations changes more gradually than the ccdf for the triassic formations due to the larger range of hydraulic head values for the permian formations this is a consequence of the greater uncertainty in permian hydraulic head values relative to triassic hydraulic heads at spring locations as outlined in section 5 2 the estimates shown in fig 8 appear similar for some springs e g springs b c and d due to the close proximity of these locations see fig 1c for tabulated values of estimated probabilities the reader is directed to table a1 for the triassic formations and table a2 for the permian formations in appendix a tables a1 and a2 show that the majority of probabilities abide by order relations with order relation corrections applying predominantly to probabilities near the limits of 0 and 1 the order relation deviations at extreme values are not unexpected given the lack of data available to populate semi variograms beyond the hydraulic head elevation limits as discussed by deutsch and journel 1998 ccdfs for the triassic and permian formations can be used to assess the probability of each formation having adequate hydraulic head to exceed individual sgts referred to hereafter as sgt probabilities sgt probabilities are identified in fig 8 by the intersection of red lines sgts and ccdf curves the probabilities of the triassic and permian formations having hydraulic heads exceeding the sgts are given in table 3 these were obtained by subtracting values of i x a from one the probability that head in the triassic formations exceeds sgts at the spring locations range from 0 01 to 0 49 while the probability that permian formation heads exceed sgts ranges from 0 03 to 0 12 the results indicate that triassic formations have a moderate probability 0 24 of adequate hydraulic head to support the southern springs a b c and d and a south eastern spring h but lower probabilities 0 11 of adequate hydraulic head to support the northern springs e f g results also indicate a lower probability 0 12 that the permian formations have adequate head to exceed the sgts of all springs notably the triassic formations have a higher probability of hydraulic heads exceeding spring sgts than the permian formations for all springs except springs f and g interestingly the triassic and permian formations both have low sgt probabilities for the springs e f and g possibly suggesting an alternate source aquifer or a missing component in our conceptual models 5 5 the likelihood of alternate conceptual models the likelihood of the alternate conceptual models for the source of water to the dsc can be considered based on the regional hydraulic head distributions section 5 2 likely hydraulic head values at spring locations section 5 3 and sgt probabilities section 5 4 the regional hydraulic head distributions in the triassic formations suggested higher head in the north south and west of the study area reducing towards lower head near the springs and along the carmichael river to the west fig 7 this may suggest the occurrence of discharge e g spring flow or baseflow to the river from the triassic formations in this area while the hydraulic head distribution in the permian formations suggests higher heads to the north south and west lowering to a minimum in the mine site area fig 8 as no surface water bodies are observed in this area this pattern may indicate discharge occurring to another formation these hydraulic head distributions suggest that the triassic formations display a pattern more consistent with discharge to the dsc than that observed in the permian formations the likely hydraulic head values at the spring locations indicate the potential vertical flow directions if connectivity existed across the rewan formation in these locations the results suggest that the hydraulic head at the spring locations are likely higher in the triassic formations than in the permian formations table 1 and table 2 this indicates that if connectivity existed in these locations flow directions would likely be downwards from the triassic to the permian formations which implies it is unlikely that the permian formations could be contributing water to the triassic formations in this area the triassic formations have a higher probability than the permian formations of adequate hydraulic head to support spring flow to springs a b c d e and h sgt probabilities for springs f and g were low for both formations suggesting inconclusive findings for these springs overall the hydraulic head evidence interpreted from regional head distributions potential vertical flow directions and sgt probabilities suggests that the triassic formations are more likely than the permian formations to provide a source of water to springs a b c d e and h while results for spring f and g were inconclusive despite these findings it remains plausible that the permian formations may indirectly support the springs by providing a source of water to the triassic formations via connectivity at a location away from the spring sites thus although the triassic formations may present as the principal source of water at the spring locations i e due to hydraulic heads exceeding the sgt and flow directions converging towards the dsc the permian formations may nevertheless contribute indirectly to spring flow via leakage to and pressurisation of the triassic formations at another location in this scenario the permian formations may indirectly support spring flow even though permian heads do not exceed triassic heads at the spring locations nevertheless if connectivity exists across the rewan formation at a location then drawdown in the permian formations due to mine site dewatering may impact the dsc that is if drawdown in the permian formations propagates through connections between the two formations this will induce a net downward flux relative to the natural pre mining conditions regardless of the natural head gradient and flow direction across the rewan formation the resulting drawdown could result in the reduction or cessation of flow from the dsc even if the permian formations do not discharge either into the triassic formations or directly to the springs thus for mining activities to potentially affect spring discharge there need only to be connectivity between the permian and triassic formations close enough to the dsc that mining induced drawdown in either formation can reach the springs 5 6 uncertainties and future directions conceptual models are often accepted or rejected based on their consistency with the observed data enemark et al 2019 however the consistency of a model with observed data does not ensure that the model is a valid representation of the system oreskes et al 1994 and this consistency may change as new data becomes available enemark et al 2019 in our case both conceptual models are reasonably consistent with observations see section 5 1 but give a low probability of adequate head to support spring flow particularly for springs f and g this may be explained as either a type i error where a valid conceptual model has not been considered or a type ii error where an invalid conceptual model has been adopted neuman 2003 a plausible error type ii error is that the conceptual models did not consider the vertical stratification of hydraulic head measurements within each formation in this study most of the available measurements particularly in the triassic formations were taken at shallow depths making it difficult to characterise the vertical stratification of hydraulic heads within the formations a recently drilled well august 2020 in the triassic formation suggests an increase in the head with depth and as the analysis in the triassic formations is based primarily on shallow measurements it is plausible that it may underestimate the potential of the triassic formations to support spring flow similarly vertical stratification of hydraulic heads within the permian formations may exist which could influence modelling outcomes however there is a lack of measurements outside of the mine site to identify any vertical head stratification in the permian formations future studies should consider the vertical stratification within these formations and how this influences modelling outcomes which would require the installation of piezometers to monitor the head at various depths in both the permian and triassic formations alternately there could be a valid conceptual model being ignored e g a conceptual model where the shallow tertiary or deeper joe joe formation that underlies the permian formation provide water to the spring or there may be a lack of data to properly interrogate these conceptual models although there were more data points in the permian formations than the triassic formations i e 78 and 34 respectively these data were clustered in a region near the margin of the study area with only a few measurements in the region near the springs fig 1 the kriging weights given by the solution of eq 7 take into account the redundancy of measurements whereby measurements located close to one another may convey little additional information diggle et al 1998 as such many of the data points within localised data clusters were largely redundant and provided minimal additional information about the regional hydraulic head distribution in contrast the triassic formations had measurements over a wider spatial distribution and therefore less data redundancy than those of the permian formations fig 1a furthermore the permian had only a single well id 190229 a near the spring locations which meant the findings in the permian formations at the spring locations were highly dependent on the quality of this measurement this was a single measurement collected on the same day as drilling without a reported survey method and thus was assigned a mean of 229 86 m i e the measured value and a range of 222 9 to 236 8 m based on the considered uncertainties as demonstrated by the cross validation map of residuals fig 6 the inclusion of this well had little impact on the mean predictions as the predicted value at this well when censoring the observation was 229 57 m which is within 0 3 m of the observed head value however the inclusion of this observation reduced the uncertainty of predictions substantially in the vicinity of the springs this influenced the sgt probabilities for the permian formations by reducing the plausibility of adequate head to meet the sgts the modelling of the impacts of mine induced drawdown on the dsc outlined in the environmental impact statement assumes that the source aquifer is the triassic formations and that adaptive management will be applied to mitigate impacts upon the springs adani mining 2013 however studies by other investigators e g webb 2015 currell et al 2017 csiro and geoscience australia 2019 werner et al 2019 currell et al 2020 have suggested that there is substantial uncertainty in the source aquifer of the dsc and that the permian conceptualisation remains plausible the results of this study indicate that the triassic conceptualisation is more likely than the permian conceptualisation although both conceptualisations remain plausible significant uncertainty exists in our assessment due to hydraulic head measurement scarcity in the vicinity of the springs and the analysis only considering a single data type neuman and wierenga 2003 furthermore the locations and degree of inter aquifer connectivity across the rewan formation aquitard is a major source of uncertainty csiro and geoscience australia 2019 which will control how the drawdown in the permian formations will impact the dsc despite the remaining conceptual model uncertainties and the unsuitability of adaptive management to scenarios with time delayed or irreversible impacts currell et al 2017 thomann et al 2020 the mine has been approved future studies should aim to reduce the conceptual model uncertainty to identify potential impacts and mitigation strategies this could be achieved through the installation of additional monitoring wells at various depths in the major formations as well as by analysing other data types including hydrochemistry and geophysical surveys and investigating the degree of inter aquifer connectivity across the rewan formation aquitard at and away from the dsc 6 conclusions knowledge of hydraulic head distributions throughout aquifers can assist in hydrogeological conceptual model development and assessment ordinary indicator co kriging is a geostatistical interpolation technique that estimates hydraulic head values and their uncertainties at unmeasured locations these hydraulic head estimates can be used to quantitatively assess the probability of hydraulic heads exceeding specified thresholds at unmeasured locations additionally when expert knowledge is available for physical thresholds in the hydrogeological system e g hydraulic head thresholds required for spring flow the likelihood of conceptual models meeting these physical thresholds can be quantitatively assessed this approach is widely applicable throughout hydrogeology in the assessment of conceptual models the application of the ordinary indicator co kriging in conceptual model assessment was demonstrated using the hydraulic head data from the alternate hypothesised source aquifers of the dsc the analysis indicated likelihoods ranging from 0 01 to 0 49 that the triassic formations have adequate hydraulic head to support flow to the dsc springs assessed here while there was a lower likelihood i e 0 03 0 12 that the springs could derive water from the deeper permian formations these results suggest that the triassic formations have a higher likelihood of adequate hydraulic head than the permian formations however significant uncertainty exists in the conceptual model assessment due to hydraulic head measurement scarcity in the vicinity of the springs particularly in the permian formations and the analysis only considering a single data type furthermore the locations and degree of inter aquifer connectivity across the rewan formation aquitard is a major source of uncertainty which will influence the likelihood of alternate conceptual models and control how the drawdown in the permian formations will impact the dsc as such we suggest that further studies are conducted to complement this research through the collection of additional hydraulic head measurements analysis of other data types including hydrochemistry and geophysical surveys and further investigation into the degree of inter aquifer connectivity across the rewan formation aquitard at and away from the dsc credit authorship contribution statement robin keegan treloar conceptualization methodology software

4356,the application of neural networks nn in groundwater gw level prediction has been shown promising by previous works yet previous works have relied on a variety of inputs such as air temperature pumping rates precipitation service population and others this work presents a long short term memory neural network lstm nn for gw level forecasting using only previously observed gw level data as the input without resorting to any other type of data and information about a groundwater basin this work applies the lstm nn for short term and long term gw level forecasting in the edwards aquifer

gathering high quality long term gw level data for predicting key groundwater characteristics useful in sustainable groundwater management keywords long short term memory lstm neural network adam optimizer groundwater prediction edward aquifer 1 introduction previous works have been studied water resources management methods to address the sustainability of different water resources systems solgi et al 2015 solgi et al 2016a solgi et al 2016b solgi et al 2020 bozorg haddad et al 2017 sustainable operation of water resources groundwater systems among them is contingent upon accurate groundwater level tracking and prediction hydraulic head in groundwater systems affects surface water sustainability sea water intrusion in coastal zones soil stability stream flow and other key hydrologic functions for these reasons the prediction of the groundwater level is central to the management of aquifer resources nevertheless the nonlinearity of the governing groundwater flow equations the heterogeneity and anisotropy of aquifers and the complex interconnection of surface and groundwater systems associated uncertainties about aquifer recharge and boundary conditions and anthropogenic effects i e withdrawal and managed aquifer recharge render the task of forecasting groundwater levels challenging a variety of methods have been developed for the purpose of groundwater prediction orsborn 1966 yakowitz 1976 hipel and mcleod 1994 sahoo and jha 2013 suryanarayana et al 2014 shao et al 2017 wunsch et al 2018 takafuji et al 2019 rajabi et al 2020 ataie ashtiani et al 2020 several machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to groundwater head prediction rajaee et al 2019 reviewed machine learning ml methods for groundwater modeling including neural networks nn adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis genetic programming gp and support vector machine svm among others the majority of the ml models applied to groundwater level prediction require a variety of inputs such as precipitation air temperature evaporation service population surface water systems data i e reservoir storage river discharge pumping rates and so forth coulibaly et al 2001 sun 2013 sahoo et al 2017 adiat et al 2020 khedri et al 2020 only a limited number of models have been presented which successfully forecast the groundwater level relying on the historical groundwater hydraulic head as the sole model input yang et al 2009 presented a nn to predict groundwater level in western jillian china the network consists of six input nodes receiving six successive previous lags of monthly average groundwater level one hidden layer with 10 sigmoid nodes and it predicts the monthly average ground level one month ahead the latter authors demonstrated the superiority of the nn over the autoregressive ar model chen et al 2010 implemented the self organizing map som technique to determine the hyperparameters i e the number of hidden unit layers of a radial basis function network rbfn for groundwater level prediction for a case study in taiwan the inputs to the model were the past 13 12 and one lag monthly average groundwater levels the latter authors employed the model for 1 month one step ahead prediction chen et al 2011 applied autoregressive integrated moving average arima and the semivariogram to determine the best set of lags of historical groundwater level as the inputs to a nn to predict one month ahead groundwater level kisi and shiri 2012 applied a modified wavelet neuro fuzzy model to predict groundwater level up to three days ahead where the inputs to the network were at most five lags of observed daily gw depths maheswaran and khosa 2013 presented a wavelet neural network wa ann for gw prediction using monthly data yang et al 2015 studied the performance of wa ann in comparison to integrated time series model employing monthly average gw data in an island in china a long short term memory lstm network is a variety of recurrent neural networks rnns introduced by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 and has been successfully applied to executing elaborate machine learning tasks like speech recognition and machine translation van houdt et al 2020 the lstm architecture is superior to other rnns as it provides a deep network but does not suffer from vanishing gradient shortcomings prevalent in other rnns therefore the lstm networks seem well suited for modeling dependencies imbedded in timeseries lstm has been successfully applied for some other machine learning tasks yet its application to gw level forecasting has been limited zhang et al 2018 implemented an lstm network to predict gw level where the inputs to the network were monthly water diversions evaporation precipitation air temperature and time bows et al 2019 applied an lstm network to predict gw level for flood control purposes using observed gw table precipitation and sea level data the latter two studies showed the capability of lstm in predicting groundwater levels ml techniques of the nn variety have demonstrated good performance in gw level prediction most previous related works however have predicted the gw table using nn models based on a variety of inputs e g temperature pumping precipitation service population and others besides the fact that the choice of the input commonly depends on data availability the task of finding the best set of inputs is a challenging task and varies among groundwater basins to address these difficulties this paper introduces and applies a long short term memory neural network lstm nn for gw level forecasting relying only on previously observed gw level data lstm has been successfully applied to predict various types of timeseries nevertheless to the best of our knowledge it has not been applied to forecast gw timeseries relying only on previous in situ piezometric observations this work tests the application of the lstm nn trained by the adam optimizer to forecast gw level where the only input to the network is observed gw level most pertinent studies carried out gw level prediction based on other sources of data such as precipitation due to the lack of enough piezometric data gw data have become more widely available worldwide opening new avenues for developing and testing novel algorithms predicting groundwater phenomena the gw data themselves can be viewed as a hydrologic footprint in a basin when no other data are available this work presents and tests the lstm nn for forecasting short term and long term groundwater level and evaluates its performance in the edwards balcones fault zone aquifer of south central texas the lstm nn s performance is compared with that of a simple nn this work s results demonstrate the capacity of ml in groundwater prediction and affirm the importance of gathering high quality long term gw level data for the purpose of predicting key groundwater characteristics 2 methodology this study s objective is to predict the future groundwater level from in situ groundwater level data this is accomplished with an lstm nn and calculated results are compared with those of a simple nn the studied networks were optimized using the adam optimizer the performance of the lstm nn was evaluated under several scenarios of data availability and prediction horizons this section presents the applied simple nn followed by a description of the proposed lstm nn s architecture and the adam optimizer and a definition of the prediction scenarios 2 1 simple neural network nn a typical simple neural network consists of an input layer one or several hidden layers and one output layer see e g kelleher and tierney 2018 each layer consists of one or several cells units each cell s output y i j is a function of the weighted sum of all the inputs to the cell the simple nns employ an activation function as expressed by the following equations 1 y i j f l w i j l j 1 y l j 1 b i j in which the sigmoid function f is defined as follows 2 f x 1 1 e x p x where y i j the output of cell i of layer j w i j l j 1 the weight of the connection between cell i of layer j and cell l of layer j 1 and b i j the bias of cell i of layer j the simple nn comprises of one hidden layer with 10 sigmoid cells one input layer with p input cells where p the number of previous lags of observed gw level and one output layer with one cell whose activation is the identity function as depicted in fig 1 the simple nn is fully connected meaning that the cells of each layer are connected to all the cells of the previous and next layers the number of parameters of the simple nn is equal to p 10 21 number of cells in the hidden layer number of input cells number of cells in the output layer 1 number of cells in the output layer for example when inputs of the network are three lags of previously observed gw level the simple nn has 51 parameters including connection weights and biases these are the parameters which must be optimized to minimize the predictive error of the network 2 2 long short term memory neural network lstm nn a recurrent neural network rnn features adjacent layers in which the cells of each layer are connected to other cells of the same layer and may have self feedback connections where one of the inputs to a cell at time step t is the output of the cell at time step t 1 an lstm network is a partially connected rnn made of lstm cells each lstm cell consists of a memory gm input gin output gout and forget gf gates the output y i j t of every lstm nn cell in feed forward networks is calculated as follows staudemeyer and morris 2019 3 y i j t gout i j t h state i j t where gout i j t the output of the output gate of cell i in layer j at time t state i j t the state of cell i in layer j at time t h represents the hyperbolic tangent function calculated by eq 9 and state i j t denotes the current state of cell i in layer j at time t which is given by 4 state i j t gf i j t state i j t 1 gm i j t gin i j t the input forget output and memory gates of cell i in layer j at time t are respectively denoted by gin i j t gf i j t gout i j t and gm i j t and are calculated as follows 5 gin i j t f l w i j in l j 1 y l j 1 t l w i j in l j y l j t 1 b i j in 6 gf i j t f l w i j f l j 1 y l j 1 t l w i j f l j y l j t 1 b i j f 7 gout i j t f l w i j out l j 1 y l j 1 t l w i j out l j y l j t 1 b i j out 8 gm i j t h l w i j m l j 1 y l j 1 t l w i j m l j y l j t 1 b i j m in which y i j t the output of cell i of layer j at time t w i j in l j w i j f l j w i j out l j and w i j m l j the weights of the connection from cell l of layer j to the input forget output and memory gates of cell i of layer j respectively b i j in b i j f b i j out and b i j m the bias of the input forget output and memory gates of cell i of layer j respectively and f denotes the sigmoid activation function introduced in equation 2 notice that unlike other gates the memory gate s activation function is the hyperbolic tangent function instead of the sigmoid function the hyperbolic tangent function h is defined as follows 9 h x e x p x e x p x e x p x e x p x fig 2 depicts a schematic of the applied lstm nn in the current study the applied lstm nn has one input cell a hidden layer which consists of 10 lstm cells and one output cell with the identity activation function unlike the simple nn which needs p input cells to receive p lags of previously observed gw level the lstm nn has only one input cell regardless of the number of lags and the lstm nn receives the previous lags as a sequence in fact unlike the simple nn the feedforward of the lstm nn is a temporal process as shown in fig 2 the outputs of the lstm cells are not passed to the output cell of the network after the network receives the first input i e the oldest lag which here is lag p instead the outputs of the lstm layer are received by itself in addition to the next input i e lag p 1 this procedure continues until the network receives the last input which is lag 1 at this stage the outputs of the lstm cells are passed to the output cell of the network notice that in general an lstm network may have more than one input and output cell this study applies one input cell because there is one kind of data the gw level timeseries used as the input to the model also one output cell is used because one lag gw level is forecasted fig 3 depicts the structure of a single lstm cell of the applied lstm nn and its connections it is seen in fig 3 that an lstm cell has several gates each of which are directly connected to the input cell and other lstm cells in fact each of these gates is a cell with its own activation function connection weights and biases the state of an lstm cell is stored inside the cell and contributes to the next output of the cell as shown in fig 3 and equation 4 the specific structure of the lstm cells allows temporal dependencies to be captured such a characteristic makes an lstm network an ideal candidate for the task of timeseries prediction for further reading about the lstm architecture see staudemeyer and morris 2019 regardless of the number of input lags the lstm nn has only one input cell therefore the number of parameters of the lstm nn does not depend on p the number of lags of gw level observation unlike the simple nn the applied lstm nn in this study has 10 lstm cells one input cell and one output cell therefore the total number of parameters including weights and biases is a fixed value and is equal to 491 number of lstm cells 4 number of input cells number of lstm cells 1 number of cells in the output layer number of lstm cells 1 among two identical networks one simple and one lstm with the same number of cells the lstm network has a larger number of parameters because every lstm cell has four gates each of which is connected to all of the other cells in the same layer and the previous layer while a simple cell is only connected to the cells of the previous layer this increases the number of parameters which must be optimized for the lstm network with the recent advanced techniques for training neural networks optimizing networks of such size with several hundreds of parameters is straightforward thus such an increase in the number of parameters does not pose a serious computational burden on the other hand however the lstm nn has an advantage over the simple nn when there are long term dependencies in the timeseries and many lags are required as the input to the network for accurate prediction in such a case the independence of the number of parameters of the lstm from the length of the input sequence provides better scalability 2 3 adam optimizer for the training phase training of a neural network requires that its parameters weights biases be optimized to minimize the network s prediction error the training objective function is to minimize the mean squared error mse defined below 10 mse f θ t 1 n z t z t θ 2 n in which n the number of observations of a phenomenon under study say the groundwater level z t the observed value at time t z t θ the predicted value at time t it is the output of the neural network and a function of the parameter vector θ where θ θ 1 θ 2 θ l θ m and θ l lth parameter of the network to be optimized and m the total number of trainable parameters of the network during training of the parameters coefficients of the network f θ is treated as a stochastic function evaluated at batches of the train data set this means that the training data set is divided into several batches subsets randomly and the parameters are updated based on the partial evaluation of the objective function in each batch this study applies the adam optimizer to obtain the neural network s parameters the adam optimizer is a stochastic gradient based optimization algorithm introduced by kingma and ba 2015 it differs from traditional stochastic gradient descent sgd algorithms in that it assigns adaptive individual learning rates to each neural network parameter separately and updates them based on the estimates of the first and second moments of the gradients traditional sgd algorithms on the other hand use a single learning rate for all the neural network s parameters the adam optimizer has proven successful in solving deep machine learning problems and domains with sparse gradients it is therefore a suitable choice when working with lstm networks that commonly have several times more parameters than simple neural networks optimization of such networks with traditional sgds is computationally burdensome while the adam optimizer is more effective for the task the adam optimizer has several hyperparameters these are the step size α exponential decay rates for the estimates of moments β 1 and β 2 and a small value ε which must be specified the recommended initial hyperparameters are α 0 001 β 1 0 9 β 2 0 999 and ε 10 8 kingma and ba 2015 the algorithm starts by initializing the vector θ neural network parameters and 1st moment vector m 0 2nd moment vector v 0 and iteration s by setting them equal to zero the moments and vector θ neural network parameters are updated iteratively until the algorithm converges at the beginning of each iteration the gradient vector is calculated as follows 11 g s θ f θ s 1 in which g s gradient vector at iteration s with respect to the objective function f θ s 1 parameter vector at iteration s 1 and θ denotes the gradient vector obtained by differentiating the objective function f with respect to the components of the parameter vector θ next the first and second moments are updated as follows 12 m s β 1 m s 1 1 β 1 g s 13 v s β 2 v s 1 1 β 2 g s 2 in which m s and v s denote respectively the first and second moments at iteration s and g s 2 g s g s denotes the hadamard product which involves elementwise multiplication note that all operations on vectors are elementwise an iteration updates the parameters as follows 14 θ s θ s 1 α m s v s ε 15 m s m s 1 β 1 s 16 v s v s 1 β 2 s in which θ s updated vector of neural network parameters at iteration s β 1 s and β 2 s denote β 1 and β 2 to the power s respectively the adam optimizer terminates when a specific number of epochs are completed otherwise the updated parameters are used as initial values to start the next iteration in every epoch the parameters are updated with respect to the whole train data set every epoch consists of several data batches each of which is a subset of the train dataset therefore every iteration of the adam optimizer uses a batch sample of the train dataset to update the parameters the adam optimizer performs step size annealing when the ratio m s v s is small the step size is small for instance close to optimal parameter values the magnitude of the aforementioned ratio tends to zero resulting in small step sizes for the updating of parameters for further reading about the adam optimizer and its convergence properties see kingma and ba 2015 2 4 scenarios this work evaluates the performance of the applied neural networks the lstm nn and the simple nn under three scenarios named d ma and mm and several prediction horizons corresponding to each scenario scenario d refers to the situation when daily data are available in this instance the networks are trained using daily data scenarios ma and mm refer to the situation in which monthly average gw level data and monthly minimum data are available respectively in all of the cases the inputs and outputs of the networks are consistent for example if the lstm nn forecast monthly groundwater level this means the input to the model is a set of monthly groundwater observations and furthermore the lstm nn is trained with monthly data scenario d is employed to evaluate the performance of the networks in predicting the gw level from one day step ahead to 30 days steps ahead in the case of monthly scenarios the performance of the models is evaluated with one two and three steps months ahead predictions also the number associated with each scenario refers to the prediction horizon thus scenarios d1 and d20 denote one day and 20 day ahead predictions respectively or scenario ma2 refers to two month ahead prediction of monthly average gw level 3 evaluation criteria the following criteria are applied to test the lstm nn s and simple nn s performances in forecasting the gw level the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse was also calculated and it was always equal to the coefficient of determination r2 therefore only the r2 is reported 3 1 coefficient of determination r2 the coefficient of determination r2 measures the level of statistical association between the observed and predicted time series the value of this criteria varies from zero to one the higher the value of r2 the better the prediction with a value equal to one indicating a perfect fit between observed and predicted time series an r2 equal to zero means a lack of association between predictions and observation r2 is calculated as follows 17 r 2 1 t 1 n z t z t 2 t 1 n z t 2 t 1 n z t 2 n 3 2 mean squared error mse the mse measures the discrepancy between the observed and predicted time series in this study the lstm nn and the simple nn are trained to minimize the mse equation 10 a lower mse implies a better prediction although during training phase in order to optimize the parameters coefficients of the network f θ was treated as a stochastic function evaluated at batches of the train data set in the results section the reported mse is calculated with respect to the whole data set encompassing the testing and training data sets 3 3 mean absolute error mae the mean absolute error is used to measure the accuracy of the time series predictions unlike the mse the mae avoids the contribution of large errors to the value of the index the mae is calculated as follows 18 mae t 1 n z t z t n 4 case study the edwards aquifer this work evaluated the performances of the presented models in forecasting gw level in the edwards balcones fault zone region aquifer the reason for this choice of aquifer was the availability of a long term daily gw level time series dating back to 1932 the regional water supply and ecologic importance of the edwards aquifer the edwards aquifer is located in south central texas and its catchment area encompass all or part of 13 counties in south central texas usa the hydrogeologic and groundwater management of the edwards aquifer have been described in detail in several studies see e g loáiciga et al 2000 loáiciga 2017 loáiciga and schofield 2019 sharp et al 2019 the edwards aquifer is a highly productive confined karst aquifer which has an upstream drainage area a recharge unconfined aquifer region a transition zone between unconfined and confined conditions and a confined zone the edwards aquifer encompasses an area approximately 290 km long and its width varies from 8 to 65 km the edwards aquifer is the primary water source for the city of san antonio and various neighboring areas the average annual discharge to springs plus groundwater withdrawal by pumping wells is approximately equal to 57 419 106 m3 of which 49 94 28 02 13 64 4 23 and 4 16 represent spring discharge and to meet municipal and military irrigation domestic and livestock and industrial water demands respectively also groundwater rights and the effect of groundwater withdrawal on several native species of animals and plants in the edwards aquifer have been contentious over decades the degradation of aquatic ecosystems in the edwards aquifer caused by groundwater withdrawal led to the listing of some endemic species i e the fountain darter the comal springs riffle beetle the texas blind salamander etc as endangered by the us fish and wildlife service 5 data the gw level data used in this study are maximum daily water level at index well j 17 in san antonio texas recorded from 11 12 1932 until 7 31 2020 in total 31 239 days reported by the edward aquifer authority eaa https www edwardsaquifer org eaa the eaa archives the highest water level observed every day the eaa reports gw level in feet above mean sea level msl prior to using the data for training the networks and prediction the data were standardized standardized data the original data the mean of the data the standard deviation of the data the entire available gw level data were used for daily scenarios scenario d in the case of monthly scenarios the minimum and average of daily gw levels were calculated for every month to create two distinct monthly gw level time series the partial data i e less than one month duration for the last and first month were removed and the rest of the data were used for prediction with the monthly scenarios scenarios ma and mm therefore the data period for monthly scenarios started in december 1932 and ended in july 2020 1 043 months in total figs 4 and 5 depict the available data for the daily and monthly scenarios respectively the available data were divided into training and testing data sets such that the older 80 percent of the data were applied for training and the most recent 20 percent of the time series were used for testing 6 results the proposed lstm nn s predictive skill was evaluated and compared with that of the simple nn the codes were executed in python 3 7 and the nn models are simulated using tensorflow 2 three goodness of fit criteria r2 mse and mae were employed for the evaluative comparison first the effect of the number of lags of previously observed gw level as the input to the simple nn on its performance was evaluated this was done to ensure that the simple nn would achieve the best possible results the simple nn with three past lags of gw level observations as input provided the best result among a set of candidates including 1 2 3 4 5 6 12 and 24 previous lags for monthly scenarios and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 14 21 and 30 previous lags for daily scenarios the same test applied to the lstm nn demonstrated that the past three lags performed well for the lstm nn also there are a few cases when other numbers of previous lags e g six lags performed better as the input to the lstm nn yet the improvement was negligible therefore three lags of previously observed gw level were initially selected as the input to the neural networks to provide a baseline for their comparison also the performance of the lstm nn is compared with that of the simple nn when the past 47 lags are used as the input in this case the simple nn has 47 input cells and consequently its total number of parameters is 491 which is equal to the number of parameters of the lstm nn this comparison is made to study the performance of the networks when they have the same number of parameters number of hidden cells and they receive the same inputs table 1 lists the results corresponding to the training and testing data sets for each nn with respect to the monthly scenarios and selected daily scenarios d1 d10 d20 and d30 where three previous lags are the inputs of the nns the accuracy of the lstm nn is consistently better than that of the simple nn by several percentages with respect to the goodness of fit criteria for example for one day ahead prediction under scenario d1 the r2 of the lstm nn prediction for the test data set is equal to 99 89 whereas the r2 of the simple network is 95 32 demonstrating about 4 5 improvement in the accuracy of prediction the lstm nn s r2 for the testing data set under scenarios d10 d20 and d30 is at least 4 better than those of the simple nn it is seen in table 1 that the same pattern exists for monthly scenarios for instance the lstm nn s r2 for scenarios ma1 one month ahead prediction of the average gw level and mm1 one month ahead prediction of minimum gw level with the testing data set are at least 8 better than those of the simple nn the results listed in table 1 indicate that on average the r2 of the lstm nn for testing data set features about a 5 improvement over the simple nn the mse and mae produced goodness of fit results consistent with those of the r2 such that the mse and mae of the lstm nn have lower values i e they indicate better predictive skill than those of the simple nn for instance the mse of the lstm nn for the testing data set under scenario d1 is equal to two percent 2 of the mse of the simple nn the results for the training data set demonstrates the same pattern the number of parameters of the simple nn is smaller than that of the lstm nn when the inputs to the nns are three previous lags therefore the improved results might be assumed to be due to the greater number of parameters and not to the lstm architecture to resolve this dilemma table 2 lists the results corresponding to the training and testing data sets for each nn with respect to the monthly scenarios and selected daily scenarios d1 d10 d20 and d30 featuring the past 47 lags as the inputs to the nns the simple nn requires 47 input cells to receive 47 previous lags as the input the simple nn with 47 input cells has 491 parameters however as discussed earlier the number of parameters of the lstm does not depend on the number of input lags therefore in this case both nns have the same number of parameters nevertheless the results listed in table 2 show the accuracy of the lstm nn is always better than that of the simple nn also comparing tables 1 and 2 it is seen that increasing the number of input lags may improve or worsen the accuracy of the nns for example for scenario d1 the results of table 2 47 lags are slightly better than those of table 1 three lags for both nns however the accuracy for scenarios ma3 and mm3 is reduced for both nns in table 2 in comparison to table 1 it is noteworthy that for scenario ma3 and mm3 when 47 input lags were used table 2 the difference between the training and testing accuracies increased this shows that neither the lstm nn s nor for the simple nn s prediction accuracy increases with increasing number of lags we found that three previous lags perform best for the gw level time series of the edwards aquifer this finding may or may not apply to other basins the results of the lstm nn for the rest of the daily scenarios i e the ones that are not reported in table 1 such as scenarios d2 d3 are presented in table 3 for the training and testing data sets using three past lags for the sake of brevity the results corresponding to the simple nn are not listed considering that the lstm nn featured a consistently better performance than the simple nn it is evident from table 3 that the lstm nn s predictive skill of the daily gw level is good up to 30 day ahead predictions specifically the lstm nn predicts up to four day ahead gw level with an r2 above 99 one week predictions features an r2 as high as 98 26 two week ahead predictions achieved an r2 above 95 and predictions of the gw level up to 26 day ahead achieved an r2 of at least 90 therefore it can be stated that the lstm nn successfully predicts the gw level of the edwards aquifer several day ahead with high accuracy figs 6 7 and 8 display the observed and predicted time series calculated with the lstm nn and the simple nn for the testing data set corresponding respectively to daily scenarios d1 d10 d20 and d30 and average monthly scenarios mm1 through ma3 and minimum monthly scenarios mm1 through mm3 using three previous input lags fig 6 demonstrates a good fit achieved by the lstm nn whereas the simple nn frequently failed to render accurate predictions of the time series it is seen in figs 7 and 8 that although the results of the monthly predictions are not as good as that of daily scenarios the results of the lstm nn network are consistently better than those of the simple nn furthermore the predictive skill of the simple nn decreases with increasing length of the prediction horizon it is noteworthy that the length of the available data for the monthly scenarios was shorter than that of the daily scenarios even for a long prediction horizon e g ma3 the lstm nn predicts the monthly gw level well but with a slight shift to the right the improvement of the lstm nn over the simple nn is critical it is seen in fig 6 that the simple nn produced poor prediction of extreme events peaks and troughs of the gw levels however the lstm nn predicted all the extreme events of the gw levels observed during a testing period of 17 years with a very good accuracy even up to 30 days ahead for scenario d30 the performance of the lstm nn demonstrated in this work is noteworthy considering that this work applied in situ observed gw level records without using any other kind of predictive data such as precipitation and pumping rates or other hydrogeologic information about the groundwater basin the edwards aquifer is subjected to various stresses such as groundwater withdrawal and recharge zone land use changes and its geohydrology is complex nevertheless the lstm nn successfully predicted the gw level in the training stage and with high accuracy in the testing phase without relying on any information about anthropogenic factors e g population water usage etc or hydrologic factors e g precipitation runoff spring discharge groundwater withdrawal etc and only by applying a long data set of observed gw levels this work s results demonstrate the importance of long term multi decadal groundwater monitoring for the purpose of constructing accurate predictive machine learning methods to forecast gw level the proposed model is applicable if there exist enough data available if the basin does not have enough observed gw level data available we must resort to other sources of data like air temperature precipitation etc 7 conclusion this work introduced the lstm nn for gw level forecasting and compared the results of the lstm nn with those achieved by a simple nn in predicting long term and short term gw level in the edwards aquifer texas the predictive skill of the nns was evaluated under multiple daily monthly average and monthly minimum scenarios considering several prediction horizons and data availability the goodness of fit criteria r2 mse and mae established that the performance of the lstm nn was superior to that of the simple nn for example it was shown that the r2 of the lstm nn was on average about 5 superior to that of the simple nn also the lstm nn was able to predict one day up to four days and up to 26 days ahead gw level with an accuracy r2 of at least 99 89 99 00 and 90 00 respectively this level of predictive skill was achieved using the gw level as the only input to the nns without resorting to any other kind of data and information about the groundwater basin it is noteworthy that the edward aquifer is subjected to various stresses such as groundwater withdrawal and recharge zone land use changes and its geohydrology is complex this successful application of machine learning to gw level prediction for such a complex basin emphasizes the importance of gathering high quality and long term gw level data

4356,the application of neural networks nn in groundwater gw level prediction has been shown promising by previous works yet previous works have relied on a variety of inputs such as air temperature pumping rates precipitation service population and others this work presents a long short term memory neural network lstm nn for gw level forecasting using only previously observed gw level data as the input without resorting to any other type of data and information about a groundwater basin this work applies the lstm nn for short term and long term gw level forecasting in the edwards aquifer in texas the adam optimizer is employed for training the lstm nn the performance of the lstm nn was compared with that of a simple nn under 36 different scenarios with prediction horizons ranging from one day to three months and covering several conditions of data availability this paper s results demonstrate the superiority of the lstm nn over the simple nn in all scenarios and the success of the lstm nn in accurate gw level prediction the lstm nn predicts one lag up to four lags and up to 26 lags ahead gw level with an accuracy r2 of at least 99 89 99 00 and 90 00 respectively over a testing period longer than 17 years of the most recent records the quality of this work s results demonstrates the capacity of machine learning ml in groundwater prediction and affirms the importance of gathering high quality long term gw level data for predicting key groundwater characteristics useful in sustainable groundwater management keywords long short term memory lstm neural network adam optimizer groundwater prediction edward aquifer 1 introduction previous works have been studied water resources management methods to address the sustainability of different water resources systems solgi et al 2015 solgi et al 2016a solgi et al 2016b solgi et al 2020 bozorg haddad et al 2017 sustainable operation of water resources groundwater systems among them is contingent upon accurate groundwater level tracking and prediction hydraulic head in groundwater systems affects surface water sustainability sea water intrusion in coastal zones soil stability stream flow and other key hydrologic functions for these reasons the prediction of the groundwater level is central to the management of aquifer resources nevertheless the nonlinearity of the governing groundwater flow equations the heterogeneity and anisotropy of aquifers and the complex interconnection of surface and groundwater systems associated uncertainties about aquifer recharge and boundary conditions and anthropogenic effects i e withdrawal and managed aquifer recharge render the task of forecasting groundwater levels challenging a variety of methods have been developed for the purpose of groundwater prediction orsborn 1966 yakowitz 1976 hipel and mcleod 1994 sahoo and jha 2013 suryanarayana et al 2014 shao et al 2017 wunsch et al 2018 takafuji et al 2019 rajabi et al 2020 ataie ashtiani et al 2020 several machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to groundwater head prediction rajaee et al 2019 reviewed machine learning ml methods for groundwater modeling including neural networks nn adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis genetic programming gp and support vector machine svm among others the majority of the ml models applied to groundwater level prediction require a variety of inputs such as precipitation air temperature evaporation service population surface water systems data i e reservoir storage river discharge pumping rates and so forth coulibaly et al 2001 sun 2013 sahoo et al 2017 adiat et al 2020 khedri et al 2020 only a limited number of models have been presented which successfully forecast the groundwater level relying on the historical groundwater hydraulic head as the sole model input yang et al 2009 presented a nn to predict groundwater level in western jillian china the network consists of six input nodes receiving six successive previous lags of monthly average groundwater level one hidden layer with 10 sigmoid nodes and it predicts the monthly average ground level one month ahead the latter authors demonstrated the superiority of the nn over the autoregressive ar model chen et al 2010 implemented the self organizing map som technique to determine the hyperparameters i e the number of hidden unit layers of a radial basis function network rbfn for groundwater level prediction for a case study in taiwan the inputs to the model were the past 13 12 and one lag monthly average groundwater levels the latter authors employed the model for 1 month one step ahead prediction chen et al 2011 applied autoregressive integrated moving average arima and the semivariogram to determine the best set of lags of historical groundwater level as the inputs to a nn to predict one month ahead groundwater level kisi and shiri 2012 applied a modified wavelet neuro fuzzy model to predict groundwater level up to three days ahead where the inputs to the network were at most five lags of observed daily gw depths maheswaran and khosa 2013 presented a wavelet neural network wa ann for gw prediction using monthly data yang et al 2015 studied the performance of wa ann in comparison to integrated time series model employing monthly average gw data in an island in china a long short term memory lstm network is a variety of recurrent neural networks rnns introduced by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 and has been successfully applied to executing elaborate machine learning tasks like speech recognition and machine translation van houdt et al 2020 the lstm architecture is superior to other rnns as it provides a deep network but does not suffer from vanishing gradient shortcomings prevalent in other rnns therefore the lstm networks seem well suited for modeling dependencies imbedded in timeseries lstm has been successfully applied for some other machine learning tasks yet its application to gw level forecasting has been limited zhang et al 2018 implemented an lstm network to predict gw level where the inputs to the network were monthly water diversions evaporation precipitation air temperature and time bows et al 2019 applied an lstm network to predict gw level for flood control purposes using observed gw table precipitation and sea level data the latter two studies showed the capability of lstm in predicting groundwater levels ml techniques of the nn variety have demonstrated good performance in gw level prediction most previous related works however have predicted the gw table using nn models based on a variety of inputs e g temperature pumping precipitation service population and others besides the fact that the choice of the input commonly depends on data availability the task of finding the best set of inputs is a challenging task and varies among groundwater basins to address these difficulties this paper introduces and applies a long short term memory neural network lstm nn for gw level forecasting relying only on previously observed gw level data lstm has been successfully applied to predict various types of timeseries nevertheless to the best of our knowledge it has not been applied to forecast gw timeseries relying only on previous in situ piezometric observations this work tests the application of the lstm nn trained by the adam optimizer to forecast gw level where the only input to the network is observed gw level most pertinent studies carried out gw level prediction based on other sources of data such as precipitation due to the lack of enough piezometric data gw data have become more widely available worldwide opening new avenues for developing and testing novel algorithms predicting groundwater phenomena the gw data themselves can be viewed as a hydrologic footprint in a basin when no other data are available this work presents and tests the lstm nn for forecasting short term and long term groundwater level and evaluates its performance in the edwards balcones fault zone aquifer of south central texas the lstm nn s performance is compared with that of a simple nn this work s results demonstrate the capacity of ml in groundwater prediction and affirm the importance of gathering high quality long term gw level data for the purpose of predicting key groundwater characteristics 2 methodology this study s objective is to predict the future groundwater level from in situ groundwater level data this is accomplished with an lstm nn and calculated results are compared with those of a simple nn the studied networks were optimized using the adam optimizer the performance of the lstm nn was evaluated under several scenarios of data availability and prediction horizons this section presents the applied simple nn followed by a description of the proposed lstm nn s architecture and the adam optimizer and a definition of the prediction scenarios 2 1 simple neural network nn a typical simple neural network consists of an input layer one or several hidden layers and one output layer see e g kelleher and tierney 2018 each layer consists of one or several cells units each cell s output y i j is a function of the weighted sum of all the inputs to the cell the simple nns employ an activation function as expressed by the following equations 1 y i j f l w i j l j 1 y l j 1 b i j in which the sigmoid function f is defined as follows 2 f x 1 1 e x p x where y i j the output of cell i of layer j w i j l j 1 the weight of the connection between cell i of layer j and cell l of layer j 1 and b i j the bias of cell i of layer j the simple nn comprises of one hidden layer with 10 sigmoid cells one input layer with p input cells where p the number of previous lags of observed gw level and one output layer with one cell whose activation is the identity function as depicted in fig 1 the simple nn is fully connected meaning that the cells of each layer are connected to all the cells of the previous and next layers the number of parameters of the simple nn is equal to p 10 21 number of cells in the hidden layer number of input cells number of cells in the output layer 1 number of cells in the output layer for example when inputs of the network are three lags of previously observed gw level the simple nn has 51 parameters including connection weights and biases these are the parameters which must be optimized to minimize the predictive error of the network 2 2 long short term memory neural network lstm nn a recurrent neural network rnn features adjacent layers in which the cells of each layer are connected to other cells of the same layer and may have self feedback connections where one of the inputs to a cell at time step t is the output of the cell at time step t 1 an lstm network is a partially connected rnn made of lstm cells each lstm cell consists of a memory gm input gin output gout and forget gf gates the output y i j t of every lstm nn cell in feed forward networks is calculated as follows staudemeyer and morris 2019 3 y i j t gout i j t h state i j t where gout i j t the output of the output gate of cell i in layer j at time t state i j t the state of cell i in layer j at time t h represents the hyperbolic tangent function calculated by eq 9 and state i j t denotes the current state of cell i in layer j at time t which is given by 4 state i j t gf i j t state i j t 1 gm i j t gin i j t the input forget output and memory gates of cell i in layer j at time t are respectively denoted by gin i j t gf i j t gout i j t and gm i j t and are calculated as follows 5 gin i j t f l w i j in l j 1 y l j 1 t l w i j in l j y l j t 1 b i j in 6 gf i j t f l w i j f l j 1 y l j 1 t l w i j f l j y l j t 1 b i j f 7 gout i j t f l w i j out l j 1 y l j 1 t l w i j out l j y l j t 1 b i j out 8 gm i j t h l w i j m l j 1 y l j 1 t l w i j m l j y l j t 1 b i j m in which y i j t the output of cell i of layer j at time t w i j in l j w i j f l j w i j out l j and w i j m l j the weights of the connection from cell l of layer j to the input forget output and memory gates of cell i of layer j respectively b i j in b i j f b i j out and b i j m the bias of the input forget output and memory gates of cell i of layer j respectively and f denotes the sigmoid activation function introduced in equation 2 notice that unlike other gates the memory gate s activation function is the hyperbolic tangent function instead of the sigmoid function the hyperbolic tangent function h is defined as follows 9 h x e x p x e x p x e x p x e x p x fig 2 depicts a schematic of the applied lstm nn in the current study the applied lstm nn has one input cell a hidden layer which consists of 10 lstm cells and one output cell with the identity activation function unlike the simple nn which needs p input cells to receive p lags of previously observed gw level the lstm nn has only one input cell regardless of the number of lags and the lstm nn receives the previous lags as a sequence in fact unlike the simple nn the feedforward of the lstm nn is a temporal process as shown in fig 2 the outputs of the lstm cells are not passed to the output cell of the network after the network receives the first input i e the oldest lag which here is lag p instead the outputs of the lstm layer are received by itself in addition to the next input i e lag p 1 this procedure continues until the network receives the last input which is lag 1 at this stage the outputs of the lstm cells are passed to the output cell of the network notice that in general an lstm network may have more than one input and output cell this study applies one input cell because there is one kind of data the gw level timeseries used as the input to the model also one output cell is used because one lag gw level is forecasted fig 3 depicts the structure of a single lstm cell of the applied lstm nn and its connections it is seen in fig 3 that an lstm cell has several gates each of which are directly connected to the input cell and other lstm cells in fact each of these gates is a cell with its own activation function connection weights and biases the state of an lstm cell is stored inside the cell and contributes to the next output of the cell as shown in fig 3 and equation 4 the specific structure of the lstm cells allows temporal dependencies to be captured such a characteristic makes an lstm network an ideal candidate for the task of timeseries prediction for further reading about the lstm architecture see staudemeyer and morris 2019 regardless of the number of input lags the lstm nn has only one input cell therefore the number of parameters of the lstm nn does not depend on p the number of lags of gw level observation unlike the simple nn the applied lstm nn in this study has 10 lstm cells one input cell and one output cell therefore the total number of parameters including weights and biases is a fixed value and is equal to 491 number of lstm cells 4 number of input cells number of lstm cells 1 number of cells in the output layer number of lstm cells 1 among two identical networks one simple and one lstm with the same number of cells the lstm network has a larger number of parameters because every lstm cell has four gates each of which is connected to all of the other cells in the same layer and the previous layer while a simple cell is only connected to the cells of the previous layer this increases the number of parameters which must be optimized for the lstm network with the recent advanced techniques for training neural networks optimizing networks of such size with several hundreds of parameters is straightforward thus such an increase in the number of parameters does not pose a serious computational burden on the other hand however the lstm nn has an advantage over the simple nn when there are long term dependencies in the timeseries and many lags are required as the input to the network for accurate prediction in such a case the independence of the number of parameters of the lstm from the length of the input sequence provides better scalability 2 3 adam optimizer for the training phase training of a neural network requires that its parameters weights biases be optimized to minimize the network s prediction error the training objective function is to minimize the mean squared error mse defined below 10 mse f θ t 1 n z t z t θ 2 n in which n the number of observations of a phenomenon under study say the groundwater level z t the observed value at time t z t θ the predicted value at time t it is the output of the neural network and a function of the parameter vector θ where θ θ 1 θ 2 θ l θ m and θ l lth parameter of the network to be optimized and m the total number of trainable parameters of the network during training of the parameters coefficients of the network f θ is treated as a stochastic function evaluated at batches of the train data set this means that the training data set is divided into several batches subsets randomly and the parameters are updated based on the partial evaluation of the objective function in each batch this study applies the adam optimizer to obtain the neural network s parameters the adam optimizer is a stochastic gradient based optimization algorithm introduced by kingma and ba 2015 it differs from traditional stochastic gradient descent sgd algorithms in that it assigns adaptive individual learning rates to each neural network parameter separately and updates them based on the estimates of the first and second moments of the gradients traditional sgd algorithms on the other hand use a single learning rate for all the neural network s parameters the adam optimizer has proven successful in solving deep machine learning problems and domains with sparse gradients it is therefore a suitable choice when working with lstm networks that commonly have several times more parameters than simple neural networks optimization of such networks with traditional sgds is computationally burdensome while the adam optimizer is more effective for the task the adam optimizer has several hyperparameters these are the step size α exponential decay rates for the estimates of moments β 1 and β 2 and a small value ε which must be specified the recommended initial hyperparameters are α 0 001 β 1 0 9 β 2 0 999 and ε 10 8 kingma and ba 2015 the algorithm starts by initializing the vector θ neural network parameters and 1st moment vector m 0 2nd moment vector v 0 and iteration s by setting them equal to zero the moments and vector θ neural network parameters are updated iteratively until the algorithm converges at the beginning of each iteration the gradient vector is calculated as follows 11 g s θ f θ s 1 in which g s gradient vector at iteration s with respect to the objective function f θ s 1 parameter vector at iteration s 1 and θ denotes the gradient vector obtained by differentiating the objective function f with respect to the components of the parameter vector θ next the first and second moments are updated as follows 12 m s β 1 m s 1 1 β 1 g s 13 v s β 2 v s 1 1 β 2 g s 2 in which m s and v s denote respectively the first and second moments at iteration s and g s 2 g s g s denotes the hadamard product which involves elementwise multiplication note that all operations on vectors are elementwise an iteration updates the parameters as follows 14 θ s θ s 1 α m s v s ε 15 m s m s 1 β 1 s 16 v s v s 1 β 2 s in which θ s updated vector of neural network parameters at iteration s β 1 s and β 2 s denote β 1 and β 2 to the power s respectively the adam optimizer terminates when a specific number of epochs are completed otherwise the updated parameters are used as initial values to start the next iteration in every epoch the parameters are updated with respect to the whole train data set every epoch consists of several data batches each of which is a subset of the train dataset therefore every iteration of the adam optimizer uses a batch sample of the train dataset to update the parameters the adam optimizer performs step size annealing when the ratio m s v s is small the step size is small for instance close to optimal parameter values the magnitude of the aforementioned ratio tends to zero resulting in small step sizes for the updating of parameters for further reading about the adam optimizer and its convergence properties see kingma and ba 2015 2 4 scenarios this work evaluates the performance of the applied neural networks the lstm nn and the simple nn under three scenarios named d ma and mm and several prediction horizons corresponding to each scenario scenario d refers to the situation when daily data are available in this instance the networks are trained using daily data scenarios ma and mm refer to the situation in which monthly average gw level data and monthly minimum data are available respectively in all of the cases the inputs and outputs of the networks are consistent for example if the lstm nn forecast monthly groundwater level this means the input to the model is a set of monthly groundwater observations and furthermore the lstm nn is trained with monthly data scenario d is employed to evaluate the performance of the networks in predicting the gw level from one day step ahead to 30 days steps ahead in the case of monthly scenarios the performance of the models is evaluated with one two and three steps months ahead predictions also the number associated with each scenario refers to the prediction horizon thus scenarios d1 and d20 denote one day and 20 day ahead predictions respectively or scenario ma2 refers to two month ahead prediction of monthly average gw level 3 evaluation criteria the following criteria are applied to test the lstm nn s and simple nn s performances in forecasting the gw level the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse was also calculated and it was always equal to the coefficient of determination r2 therefore only the r2 is reported 3 1 coefficient of determination r2 the coefficient of determination r2 measures the level of statistical association between the observed and predicted time series the value of this criteria varies from zero to one the higher the value of r2 the better the prediction with a value equal to one indicating a perfect fit between observed and predicted time series an r2 equal to zero means a lack of association between predictions and observation r2 is calculated as follows 17 r 2 1 t 1 n z t z t 2 t 1 n z t 2 t 1 n z t 2 n 3 2 mean squared error mse the mse measures the discrepancy between the observed and predicted time series in this study the lstm nn and the simple nn are trained to minimize the mse equation 10 a lower mse implies a better prediction although during training phase in order to optimize the parameters coefficients of the network f θ was treated as a stochastic function evaluated at batches of the train data set in the results section the reported mse is calculated with respect to the whole data set encompassing the testing and training data sets 3 3 mean absolute error mae the mean absolute error is used to measure the accuracy of the time series predictions unlike the mse the mae avoids the contribution of large errors to the value of the index the mae is calculated as follows 18 mae t 1 n z t z t n 4 case study the edwards aquifer this work evaluated the performances of the presented models in forecasting gw level in the edwards balcones fault zone region aquifer the reason for this choice of aquifer was the availability of a long term daily gw level time series dating back to 1932 the regional water supply and ecologic importance of the edwards aquifer the edwards aquifer is located in south central texas and its catchment area encompass all or part of 13 counties in south central texas usa the hydrogeologic and groundwater management of the edwards aquifer have been described in detail in several studies see e g loáiciga et al 2000 loáiciga 2017 loáiciga and schofield 2019 sharp et al 2019 the edwards aquifer is a highly productive confined karst aquifer which has an upstream drainage area a recharge unconfined aquifer region a transition zone between unconfined and confined conditions and a confined zone the edwards aquifer encompasses an area approximately 290 km long and its width varies from 8 to 65 km the edwards aquifer is the primary water source for the city of san antonio and various neighboring areas the average annual discharge to springs plus groundwater withdrawal by pumping wells is approximately equal to 57 419 106 m3 of which 49 94 28 02 13 64 4 23 and 4 16 represent spring discharge and to meet municipal and military irrigation domestic and livestock and industrial water demands respectively also groundwater rights and the effect of groundwater withdrawal on several native species of animals and plants in the edwards aquifer have been contentious over decades the degradation of aquatic ecosystems in the edwards aquifer caused by groundwater withdrawal led to the listing of some endemic species i e the fountain darter the comal springs riffle beetle the texas blind salamander etc as endangered by the us fish and wildlife service 5 data the gw level data used in this study are maximum daily water level at index well j 17 in san antonio texas recorded from 11 12 1932 until 7 31 2020 in total 31 239 days reported by the edward aquifer authority eaa https www edwardsaquifer org eaa the eaa archives the highest water level observed every day the eaa reports gw level in feet above mean sea level msl prior to using the data for training the networks and prediction the data were standardized standardized data the original data the mean of the data the standard deviation of the data the entire available gw level data were used for daily scenarios scenario d in the case of monthly scenarios the minimum and average of daily gw levels were calculated for every month to create two distinct monthly gw level time series the partial data i e less than one month duration for the last and first month were removed and the rest of the data were used for prediction with the monthly scenarios scenarios ma and mm therefore the data period for monthly scenarios started in december 1932 and ended in july 2020 1 043 months in total figs 4 and 5 depict the available data for the daily and monthly scenarios respectively the available data were divided into training and testing data sets such that the older 80 percent of the data were applied for training and the most recent 20 percent of the time series were used for testing 6 results the proposed lstm nn s predictive skill was evaluated and compared with that of the simple nn the codes were executed in python 3 7 and the nn models are simulated using tensorflow 2 three goodness of fit criteria r2 mse and mae were employed for the evaluative comparison first the effect of the number of lags of previously observed gw level as the input to the simple nn on its performance was evaluated this was done to ensure that the simple nn would achieve the best possible results the simple nn with three past lags of gw level observations as input provided the best result among a set of candidates including 1 2 3 4 5 6 12 and 24 previous lags for monthly scenarios and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 14 21 and 30 previous lags for daily scenarios the same test applied to the lstm nn demonstrated that the past three lags performed well for the lstm nn also there are a few cases when other numbers of previous lags e g six lags performed better as the input to the lstm nn yet the improvement was negligible therefore three lags of previously observed gw level were initially selected as the input to the neural networks to provide a baseline for their comparison also the performance of the lstm nn is compared with that of the simple nn when the past 47 lags are used as the input in this case the simple nn has 47 input cells and consequently its total number of parameters is 491 which is equal to the number of parameters of the lstm nn this comparison is made to study the performance of the networks when they have the same number of parameters number of hidden cells and they receive the same inputs table 1 lists the results corresponding to the training and testing data sets for each nn with respect to the monthly scenarios and selected daily scenarios d1 d10 d20 and d30 where three previous lags are the inputs of the nns the accuracy of the lstm nn is consistently better than that of the simple nn by several percentages with respect to the goodness of fit criteria for example for one day ahead prediction under scenario d1 the r2 of the lstm nn prediction for the test data set is equal to 99 89 whereas the r2 of the simple network is 95 32 demonstrating about 4 5 improvement in the accuracy of prediction the lstm nn s r2 for the testing data set under scenarios d10 d20 and d30 is at least 4 better than those of the simple nn it is seen in table 1 that the same pattern exists for monthly scenarios for instance the lstm nn s r2 for scenarios ma1 one month ahead prediction of the average gw level and mm1 one month ahead prediction of minimum gw level with the testing data set are at least 8 better than those of the simple nn the results listed in table 1 indicate that on average the r2 of the lstm nn for testing data set features about a 5 improvement over the simple nn the mse and mae produced goodness of fit results consistent with those of the r2 such that the mse and mae of the lstm nn have lower values i e they indicate better predictive skill than those of the simple nn for instance the mse of the lstm nn for the testing data set under scenario d1 is equal to two percent 2 of the mse of the simple nn the results for the training data set demonstrates the same pattern the number of parameters of the simple nn is smaller than that of the lstm nn when the inputs to the nns are three previous lags therefore the improved results might be assumed to be due to the greater number of parameters and not to the lstm architecture to resolve this dilemma table 2 lists the results corresponding to the training and testing data sets for each nn with respect to the monthly scenarios and selected daily scenarios d1 d10 d20 and d30 featuring the past 47 lags as the inputs to the nns the simple nn requires 47 input cells to receive 47 previous lags as the input the simple nn with 47 input cells has 491 parameters however as discussed earlier the number of parameters of the lstm does not depend on the number of input lags therefore in this case both nns have the same number of parameters nevertheless the results listed in table 2 show the accuracy of the lstm nn is always better than that of the simple nn also comparing tables 1 and 2 it is seen that increasing the number of input lags may improve or worsen the accuracy of the nns for example for scenario d1 the results of table 2 47 lags are slightly better than those of table 1 three lags for both nns however the accuracy for scenarios ma3 and mm3 is reduced for both nns in table 2 in comparison to table 1 it is noteworthy that for scenario ma3 and mm3 when 47 input lags were used table 2 the difference between the training and testing accuracies increased this shows that neither the lstm nn s nor for the simple nn s prediction accuracy increases with increasing number of lags we found that three previous lags perform best for the gw level time series of the edwards aquifer this finding may or may not apply to other basins the results of the lstm nn for the rest of the daily scenarios i e the ones that are not reported in table 1 such as scenarios d2 d3 are presented in table 3 for the training and testing data sets using three past lags for the sake of brevity the results corresponding to the simple nn are not listed considering that the lstm nn featured a consistently better performance than the simple nn it is evident from table 3 that the lstm nn s predictive skill of the daily gw level is good up to 30 day ahead predictions specifically the lstm nn predicts up to four day ahead gw level with an r2 above 99 one week predictions features an r2 as high as 98 26 two week ahead predictions achieved an r2 above 95 and predictions of the gw level up to 26 day ahead achieved an r2 of at least 90 therefore it can be stated that the lstm nn successfully predicts the gw level of the edwards aquifer several day ahead with high accuracy figs 6 7 and 8 display the observed and predicted time series calculated with the lstm nn and the simple nn for the testing data set corresponding respectively to daily scenarios d1 d10 d20 and d30 and average monthly scenarios mm1 through ma3 and minimum monthly scenarios mm1 through mm3 using three previous input lags fig 6 demonstrates a good fit achieved by the lstm nn whereas the simple nn frequently failed to render accurate predictions of the time series it is seen in figs 7 and 8 that although the results of the monthly predictions are not as good as that of daily scenarios the results of the lstm nn network are consistently better than those of the simple nn furthermore the predictive skill of the simple nn decreases with increasing length of the prediction horizon it is noteworthy that the length of the available data for the monthly scenarios was shorter than that of the daily scenarios even for a long prediction horizon e g ma3 the lstm nn predicts the monthly gw level well but with a slight shift to the right the improvement of the lstm nn over the simple nn is critical it is seen in fig 6 that the simple nn produced poor prediction of extreme events peaks and troughs of the gw levels however the lstm nn predicted all the extreme events of the gw levels observed during a testing period of 17 years with a very good accuracy even up to 30 days ahead for scenario d30 the performance of the lstm nn demonstrated in this work is noteworthy considering that this work applied in situ observed gw level records without using any other kind of predictive data such as precipitation and pumping rates or other hydrogeologic information about the groundwater basin the edwards aquifer is subjected to various stresses such as groundwater withdrawal and recharge zone land use changes and its geohydrology is complex nevertheless the lstm nn successfully predicted the gw level in the training stage and with high accuracy in the testing phase without relying on any information about anthropogenic factors e g population water usage etc or hydrologic factors e g precipitation runoff spring discharge groundwater withdrawal etc and only by applying a long data set of observed gw levels this work s results demonstrate the importance of long term multi decadal groundwater monitoring for the purpose of constructing accurate predictive machine learning methods to forecast gw level the proposed model is applicable if there exist enough data available if the basin does not have enough observed gw level data available we must resort to other sources of data like air temperature precipitation etc 7 conclusion this work introduced the lstm nn for gw level forecasting and compared the results of the lstm nn with those achieved by a simple nn in predicting long term and short term gw level in the edwards aquifer texas the predictive skill of the nns was evaluated under multiple daily monthly average and monthly minimum scenarios considering several prediction horizons and data availability the goodness of fit criteria r2 mse and mae established that the performance of the lstm nn was superior to that of the simple nn for example it was shown that the r2 of the lstm nn was on average about 5 superior to that of the simple nn also the lstm nn was able to predict one day up to four days and up to 26 days ahead gw level with an accuracy r2 of at least 99 89 99 00 and 90 00 respectively this level of predictive skill was achieved using the gw level as the only input to the nns without resorting to any other kind of data and information about the groundwater basin it is noteworthy that the edward aquifer is subjected to various stresses such as groundwater withdrawal and recharge zone land use changes and its geohydrology is complex this successful application of machine learning to gw level prediction for such a complex basin emphasizes the importance of gathering high quality and long term gw level data in addition the rising awareness worldwide for the need of accurate and long term groundwater monitoring creates an ideal juncture for resorting to machine learning algorithms to support decision

4357,flooding is a significant threat to life and property in hawaiʻi as climate warming continues to alter precipitation patterns and hydrological processes in the tropics characterizing the shifting patterns in magnitude seasonality and location of floods would improve our understanding of the consequences and better prepare us for future flood events in this study 84 rain gauges and 111 crest gauges across five major hawaiian islands were analyzed from 1970 to 2005 we estimated trends in the annual maximum daily rainfall rfmax and the annual peak flow pfmax using the mann kendall test and senʻs slope subsequently we examined the association between pfmax and rainfall then we assessed temporal shifting by combining circular analysis with senʻs slope the main identified trends showed decreases in rfmax and pfmax 67 and 61 of all gauges respectively the physiography of the hawaiian islands i e windward vs leeward has little contribution to both trends in addition pfmax trend cannot be fully attributed to rfmax trend and in many cases rfmax andpfmax did not occur coincidently we also found the timing of rfmax and pfmax occurred in early wet season during the el niño years and shifted even earlier from 1970 to 2005 likely due to the change of el niño these findings have implications for assessing flood risk our finding will aid watershed management and flood mitigation and can increase resilience of downstream communities and near shore environments keywords annual maximum rainfall annual peak streamflow mann kendall test sen s slope trends climate shifting occurrence date 1 introductions in hawaiʻi floods contributed to the largest economic loss and the second largest cause of death from natural hazards between 1996 and 2018 data sources hazards reported from the storm event database national centers for environmental information ncei 2019a flooding is associated with erosion that scours stream beds abrades bedrock moves large amounts of sediment and debris downstream and downcuts channels improving our understanding of changes in flooding will inform watershed planning and potential mitigation strategies especially as climate warming continues to alter precipitation patterns and hydrological processes in theory increasing global temperature results in increased water vapor in the air with its greater water holding capacity which leads to larger and more frequent extreme precipitation events held et al 2006 knutson and manabe 1995 extreme precipitation events have increased in magnitude and frequency with warming temperature in many regions alexander et al 2006 beck et al 2015 donat et al 2013 easterling et al 2017 groisman et al 2005 wentz et al 2007 westra et al 2013 nevertheless an analysis with 390 watersheds across the u s found the 99th percentile precipitation does not completely contribute to 99th percentile streamflow and the contributions varied with soil moisture condition ivancic and shaw 2015 unlike rainfall streamflow and flooding are scale dependent based on local watershed characteristics wasko and sharma 2017 therefore extreme rainfall trends might not fully describe the observed patterns in extreme streamflow trends and their linkage needs to be studied locally previous studies have shown various trends in extreme streamflow across the world such as in north america cunderlik and ouarda 2009 groisman et al 2001 europe blöschl et al 2019 hannaford and marsh 2008 mediero et al 2014 renard et al 2008 and australia ishak et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 the annual maximum peak flow in canada has decreased cunderlik and ouarda 2009 whereas the high discharge in the eastern u s has increased groisman et al 2001 in europe the annual 10 day streamflow and annual maximum peak flow between 1969 and 2003 in the u k increased hannaford and marsh 2008 but decreased in france between 1968 and 1998 renard et al 2008 the magnitude and frequency of annual peak flow in spain generally decreased from 1942 to 2009 mediero et al 2014 in australia the annual peak flow decreased in the south but increased in the north ishak et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 in addition to changes in the frequency and duration of extreme streamflow events the timing of flooding has also shifted in europe including earlier spring snowmelt floods in northern areas later winter floods along the mediterranean coast and earlier winter floods in western europe blöschl et al 2017 as trends in extreme streamflow are geographically heterogeneous it is critical to study the trends of extreme streamflow locally most trend analyses of extreme streamflow events have been conducted in mid latitude continental systems and little has been discussed in tropical regions which are sensitive to changes in large climate patterns extreme events in the tropics including hawaiʻi are influenced by large scale climate variability including the el niño southern oscillation enso the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and the pacific north america teleconnection pattern pna beck et al 2015 chu et al 1993 chu and chen 2005 elison timm et al 2011 lyons 1982 mantua et al 1997 recent evidence indicated that climate change has affected the enso s behavior across the tropics diaz and giambelluca 2012 o connor et al 2015 trenberth and hoar 1997 and changed el niño properties including its earlier starting time wang et al 2019 in singapore both daily and hourly maximum rainfall were found to increase between 1981 and 2010 with enso related changes in their intensity and timing beck et al 2015 with global warming the intensity and longevity of tropical cyclones tcs in the northeast pacific has slightly decreased between 1986 and 2005 klotzbach 2006 however tcs around the pacific are expected to occur more frequently in the future li et al 2010 murakami et al 2013 in hawaiʻi there are two seasons dry may oct and wet nov apr seasons in the dry season an extreme precipitation event is often attributed to hurricanes or tcs e g nugent et al 2020 the tc activity is more favorable under el niño conditions chu and wang 1997 jin et al 2014 and associates with the western north pacific wnp biennial oscillations luo et al 2020 in the wet season winter storms contribute the most to extreme rainfall a combination of pna enso and pdo contributes to the rainfall variability in the wet season frazier et al 2018 longman et al 2021 during el niño conditions the wet season months often become drier in hawaiʻi and wetter during la niña conditions in addition negative periods of pdo that align with la niña typically strengthen the intensity and lengthen the wetter period chen and chu 2014 streams in hawaiʻi respond to rainfall rapidly within hours as the majority of streams are first order streams with small drainage areas steep slopes and short time of concentration which combined with high intensity rainfall generating flashy hydrographs oki 2003 besides the coastal areas of hawaiian watersheds are often urbanized with impervious surface and channelized streams which contribute to the fast rising and falling hydrograph in hawaiʻi we expect extreme streamflow to highly correspond to its rainfall although we anticipate a close relationship between extreme streamflow and rainfall in hawaiʻi previous studies investigated their trends separately chu et al 2010 and chen and chu 2014 showed that extreme precipitation between the 1950s and 2007 became more common on the largest island hawaiʻi island but not on other islands using indices including the annual count of the number of days when the precipitation was over 25 4 mm annual maximum consecutive 5 day precipitation and the normalized 95th percentile precipitation bassiouni and oki 2013 investigated streamflow trends in hawaiʻi and found that 16 out of 26 gauges of peak flow decreased between 1943 and 2008 furthermore clilverd et al 2019 assessed streamflow records for 23 unregulated streams from 1967 to 2016 across the hawaiian islands and found significant declines in baseflow and surface runoff they also discovered significant declines in peak flow on hawaiʻi island however in some cases peak flow showed opposite trends from extreme precipitation e g chen and chu 2014 chu et al 2010 clilverd et al 2019 because extreme rainfall and streamflow trends have been investigated separately the linkages between these extreme events are not clear to better understand their associations we need a joined examination of extreme rainfall and peak flow trends this study aims to characterize local changes in the annual maximum daily rainfall rfmax and the annual peak flow pfmax by examining their spatial and temporal trends with their associations across five major hawaiian islands we investigated the trends in rfmax and pfmax to determine possible relationships between the meteorological and hydrologic response to climate change by studying 1 the spatial distribution of trends in rfmax and pfmax in hawaiʻi from 1970 to 2005 2 the association between peak rainfall and peak flow by pairing representative rain gauges to crest gauges and 3 the temporal shifts of rfmax and pfmax respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area analysis was focused on the five main islands including from west to east kauaʻi oʻahu molokaʻi maui and hawaiʻi island spanning from 18 9 n 154 8 w to 22 24 n 159 8 w the climate in hawaiʻi is strongly affected by hadley cell atmospheric circulation patterns in the pacific these patterns generate typical northeast trade winds in the northern hemisphere which induces orographic rainfall when moist air encounters the steep island topography lyons 1982 thus windward facing sides of the islands experience more frequent rain and higher annual rainfall below the trade wind inversion twi approximate mean elevation at 2000 m cao et al 2007 while the leeward sides are much drier in addition widespread and intense precipitation may be attributed to four other types of atmosphere conditions i kona storms the low pressure systems that usually develop to the west of the islands accompanied with southern winds ii cold fronts iii upper level trough or iv tropical cyclones caruso and businger 2006 kodama and barnes 1997 longman et al 2021 the wide range of terrain across the hawaiian islands with the large scale atmospheric systems results in heterogeneous climate patterns and steep rainfall gradients mean annual rainfall varies from 200 mm to 10 000 mm giambelluca et al 2013 further watersheds in hawaiʻi are typically characterized by young volcanic geology small drainage size steep topography and limited channel storage craig 2003 thus streams frequently experience flash flooding where water levels rise and fall rapidly within hours of locally intense rainfall events oki 2003 sahoo et al 2006 2 2 data the locations of rain and crest annual peak flow gauges across the hawaiian islands and their physiographical regions windward vs leeward are shown in fig 1 we sought crest gauges with the longest period of record and greatest overlap with rainfall records which resulted in a study period of 1970 to 2005 by water year daily rainfall data were obtained from the national centers for environmental information ncei and the u s geological survey usgs eighty four rain gauges kaua i n 17 o ahu n 25 moloka i n 3 maui n 20 and hawai i island n 19 with data records longer than half of the study period were used in this study fig 1 most rain gauges were located at low elevations and only a few were above the average twi 2000 m the rain gauges were not evenly distributed across the islands except for kauaʻi for oʻahu and molokaʻi most of rain gauges were located on the leeward side whereas for maui and hawaiʻi island rain gauges were located mostly on the windward side and along the coast annual records of peak flow were obtained for 111 long term crest gauges circles in fig 1 kaua i n 18 o ahu n 45 moloka i n 7 maui n 25 and hawai i island n 16 from the water years 1970 to 2005 maintained by the usgs compared with the distribution of rain gauges crest gauges have a more even spatial distribution except on hawaiʻi island where crest gauges were predominantly located on the windward side peak flow values of each gauge were standardized by the watershed area and converted to a daily scale mm day that is comparable to the daily rainfall values mm day we used two climate indices to examine the shifts in the seasonality of peak events and their association with large climatic cycle the oceanic niño index oni and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo index the oni is one of the primary indices for monitoring enso it is calculated by averaging sea surface temperature monthly anomalies of the east central equatorial pacific ocean niño 3 4 region we retrieved monthly oni from the climate prediction center cpc 2019 the pdo index is defined by ocean temperature anomalies in the northeast and the tropical pacific ocean the pdo index is downloaded from ncei 2019b 2 3 trend analysis trends in the magnitude of rfmax and pfmax were analyzed using the non parametric mann kendall test hirsch and slack 1984 mann 1945 a p value 0 05 was used to indicate a significant trend changes of the magnitude were evaluated using sen s slope sen 1968 then the change of values per year were divided by the mean value of the study period to generate percent changes in the value per year these two trend analysis methods are recommended for analyzing environmental time series without normal distribution assumptions required hirsch and slack 1984 mann 1945 additionally evaluation with sen s slope is not sensitive to outliers these trend analyses have been widely applied to quantifying and testing the significance of streamflow trends bassiouni and oki 2013 clilverd et al 2019 oki 2004 small et al 2006 and rainfall trends chen and chu 2014 frazier and giambelluca 2017 the r package trends pohlert et al 2018 was applied in this analysis 2 4 analysis of paired rainfall gauges and stream crest gauges in addition to examining data from 84 rain gauges and 111 crest gauges we paired crest gauges with rain gauges that most likely represent the rainfall received from upstream watersheds to better understand the associations between rainfall and peak flow we paired them geographically with the following criteria ranked in order of preference 1 the rain gauge was located upstream of the crest gauge in the same watershed if multiple rain gauges existed in the same watershed we chose the gauge with the highest elevation but below the twi 2 the rain gauge was upstream from the crest gauge in the neighboring watershed 3 the rain gauge was close to the crest gauge within a 5 km radius 4 the rain gauge best represented the rainfall at the upstream watershed of the crest gauge despite being in a different watershed for example three crest gauges on the windward side of east maui were paired with one rain gauge at hana maui that represents the windward rainfall subsequently we extracted daily rainfall on the same day as the pfmax of the paired gauges additionally 2 day and 5 day accumulated rainfall were examined to consider antecedent conditions and rainfall events that lasted more than one day 2 5 examination of temporal shifts in annual maximum rainfall and peak flow we examined the temporal shifts of rfmax and pfmax with circular statistics zar 1999 by using the r package circular lund et al 2017 circular statistics are useful to analyze data with unit radius or degree on a circumference pewsey et al 2013 we applied a circular analysis to the occurrence date of rfmax and pfmax for the study period by converting the date d y of rfmax and pfmax to angular values for each year y ϑ y 2 π d y d y 0 ϑ y 2 π where d y 1 corresponds to january 1st and d y d y to december 31st and d y is the number of days in that year i e 365 or 366 then the sen s slope z is adjusted for estimating trends in the timing z m e d i a n ϑ j ϑ i c j i w i t h c π i f ϑ j ϑ i π π i f ϑ j ϑ i π 0 o t h e r w i s e where i and j indicate the year covering all possible pairs of years within the study period and i j the adjustment factor c aims to represent the shifting trend i e to earlier or later based on the occurrence date at the ith year when the differences between ϑ i and ϑ j are larger than π finally we analyzed the temporal shifts by different physiographic zones i e windward and leeward to examine the effects of different rainfall forming mechanisms 3 results 3 1 changes in maximum rainfall magnitudes out of 84 rain gauges the majority 67 of rain gauges exhibited decreasing in rfmax magnitude kauaʻi n 9 oʻahu n 19 molokaʻi n 1 maui n 15 and hawai i island n 12 the magnitude of rfmax significantly decreased at seven rain gauges one on oʻahu p 0 021 changed 1 5 per year mean 195 2 mm five on maui p 0 01 changed from 2 to 4 mean 22 5 mm to 70 mm and one on hawai i island p 0 046 changed 1 6 mean 171 6 mm fig 2 the remaining 33 of rain gauges showed increasing rfmax trends kauaʻi n 8 oʻahu n 6 molokaʻi n 2 maui n 5 and hawai i island n 7 fig 2 significant increasing trends only occurred at one gauge on hawai i island p 0 047 and changed 2 7 per year with a mean of 151 4 mm on kauaʻi increasing rfmax trends were primarily located on the windward side whereas there were no discernable differences in rfmax between leeward and windward on the other islands decreasing trends in rfmax dominated on oahu maui and hawaiʻi island while no particular trend direction prevailed on kauai and moloka i however there are too few rain gauges on moloka i to address the spatial distribution in rfmax trends 3 2 changes in peak flow magnitudes decreasing magnitude in pfmax occurred at 60 of the crest gauges kaua i n 8 o ahu n 29 moloka i n 3 maui n 16 and hawai i n 11 predominantly on o ahu maui and hawai i islands fig 3 statistically significant decreasing trends occurred at a single gauge on o ahu p 0 002 decreased 6 5 mean 195 8 mm day and two on maui p 0 011 decreased 4 2 means 224 8 mm day and 107 8 mm day respectively although decreasing pfmax trends dominated across o ahu some crest gauges still showed increasing trends with two statistically significant p 0 05 peak flow trends that rose 5 8 and 3 4 with means of 302 mm day and 80 mm day respectively there was a general pattern of increasing pfmax on the windward sides of kaua i moloka i and east maui fig 3 compared with rfmax pfmax shows a greater physiographic division i e windward and leeward in trend directions 3 3 associations between peak flow annual maximum rainfall and paired rainfall when pairing rainfall and crest gauges there are 18 pairs identified following the first criterion and there are nine eight and four pairs found in the subsequent criteria respectively this resulted in a total of 39 pairs across islands 2 on kaua i 15 on o ahu 1 on moloka i 14 on maui and 17 on hawai i island some rain gauges were paired with multiple crest gauges as they were the most representative rainfall of the given watersheds of crest gauges this applied at 13 crest gauges on o ahu 5 at poamoho 2 at waiāhole 4 at pauoa flats 2 at palolo valley seven crest gauges on maui 4 at haleakala and 3 at hana and at four crest gauges on hawai i island 2 at waiakea and 2 at mauna kea fig 4 the timing of rfmax rarely coincided on the same date with the timing of pfmax and increasing vs decreasing trends direction are often inconsistent out of the 39 pairs of rainfall and crest gauges almost half 46 of the pairs have different trend directions between rfmax and pfmax fig 4 within the study period when we extracted the same date rainfall with pfmax 67 of the paired rainfall and pfmax records had consistent trends increasing or decreasing however when we extracted the 2 day and 5 day accumulated rainfall with pfmax the percent of consistency decreased table 1 among the pairs having consistent trends 56 of them showed decreasing trends whereas the remaining 44 exhibited increasing trends fig 4 there was no clear leeward versus windward patterns in trend direction across the islands paired decreasing trends occurred on both windward and leeward sides of oʻahu and maui and on windward hawaiʻi island consistent increasing trends occurred on the leeward side of oʻahu the windward side of maui and the north of hawaiʻi island 3 4 changes in the timing of annual maximum rainfall and peak flow rfmax and pfmax often occurred during the wet season nov apr with the median occurrence date of rfmax in early january and the median occurrence date of pfmax in mid january for all gauges during the study period fig 5 a b from 1970 to 2005 the occurrence date of both rfmax and pfmax shifted to an earlier time in the wet season from late january to late december fig 5c d yet the occurrence date oscillated between earlier and later throughout the four sub periods fig 5c d the sen s slope statistics also supported the temporal shifts in the study period the sen s slope estimator for the timing of the rfmax and the pfmax were 1 34 1 5 days earlier and 1 24 1 5 days earlier with p value 0 05 in leeward regions respectively 0 404 half day with p value 0 05 and 0 231 6 h later with p value 0 05 in windward areas respectively 3 5 the relationships of annual maximum rainfall and peak flow to large scale climate variability the magnitude of rfmax and pfmax showed no clear relationships to either the strength of enso figure a1 or pdo figure b1 indices on the other hand the median occurrence date of both rfmax and pfmax shifted earlier with a two to seven year cycle regardless in windward or leeward areas figs 6 and 7 which were correlated to the cycle of enso specifically the median occurrence date of rfmax and pfmax shifted to earlier during warm phase of enso shaded in red in figs 6 and 7 the enso s impact on median occurrence date was more pronounced in leeward regions i e with 12 8 recognized el niño la niña events 9 5 rfmax and 9 6 pfmax occurred earlier later in a water year fig 6 however there is no correlation between the strength of enso i e higher values of index and the amount of shifting in occurrence date of rfmax and pfmax with a correlation coefficient 0 15 besides the magnitude and occurrence date of rfmax and pfmax were not directly correlated to pdo figure b2 4 discussion 4 1 overview changes in extreme events are driven by complex atmospheric conditions and antecedent hydrological conditions and in general it is difficult to distinguish whether observed changes in rainfall and streamflow are due to natural atmospheric variability or global warming climate models have projected more intense rainfall under a warming climate which will lead to more severe flooding trenberth 2011 the dataset presented here extends our knowledge of changes in both magnitude and temporal distribution of rfmax and pfmax and their relationships to physiography and atmospheric circulation across the hawaiian islands we analyzed temporal and spatial trends in rfmax and pfmax examined the association between rfmax and pfmax and inspected the temporal shifts of rfmax and pfmax five key findings of this study were 1 decreasing rfmax trends in more than half of gauges particularly on oʻahu and maui 2 decreasing pfmax trends in most gauges on oʻahu maui and hawaiʻi island with more physiographic patterns in pfmax trends than rfmax trends 3 different timing between the pfmax and the rfmax 4 shifts in the occurrence date of rfmax and pfmax to earlier except for pfmax in windward areas and 5 an effect of enso on the occurrence date of rfmax and pfmax our results highlight that changes in rfmax are not sufficient to explain the observed trends in pfmax the observed shifts in the occurrence date of rfmax and pfmax are important for flood risk and environmental management 4 2 comparing trends in the hawaiian islands to other studies the predominantly decreasing trends of rfmax and pfmax shown in this study are consistent with previous findings in hawaiʻi bassiouni and oki 2013 chu et al 2010 clilverd et al 2019 however we did not find increasing rfmax trends on hawai i island as suggested by chu et al 2010 this difference may be in part due to the differences in the examined period 1970 2005 vs 1950 2007 and it highlights cautiously using fixed periods of record as statistical significances of long term trends frazier and giambelluca 2017 the majority of pfmax stations showed declining trends across the state of hawaiʻi during our study period particularly on oʻahu and hawai i island changes in the magnitude of pfmax range from 6 5 to 5 8 per year in general the hawaiian islands are experiencing decreasing rfmax and pfmax whereas globally extreme rainfall has increased in many continental regions changnon and kunkel 1995 groisman et al 2004 hannaford and marsh 2008 lins and slack 1999 petrow and merz 2009 madsen et al 2014 indicated that trends of extreme precipitation and floods in europe are heterogeneous besides the regional factor trends of extreme hydrological events may vary due to different definitions or methodologies to detect the trend e g the maximum value over a period count of precipitation days over a threshold the percentile values frequency etc cunderlik and ouarda 2009 do et al 2017 douglas et al 2000 hannaford and marsh 2008 ishak et al 2013 lins and slack 1999 madsen et al 2014 petrow and merz 2009 further variation in the observed peak flow trends may be due to different causes or mechanisms that generate peak flow such as intense rainfall saturated soil or snow melt blöschl et al 2017 cunderlik and ouarda 2009 studies in tropical regions i e singapore beck et al 2015 and india pingale et al 2014 only showed an increase in annual maximum daily precipitation but little has been done in examining the changes of peak flow and in other tropical islands in hawaiʻi decreasing pfmax may be related to decreased rfmax however little research has examined higher temporal resolution i e subdaily rainfall and its changes subdaily rainfall may be better associated with peak flow as streamflow responds to rainfall within hours in hawaiʻi streams in addition the increasing drought condition across the hawaiian islands frazier et al 2019 may also contribute to decreasing pfmax increasing evapotranspiration and decreasing the opportunity of saturation excess overland flow this study adds to the knowledge of peak flow changes in tropical regions especially on those tropical islands that are often first to experioence the impact of changing climate and are vulnerable to changes in precipitation nevertheless further studies with long term data recording of peak flows and high resolution rainfall will assist future assessments of their relationships and the mechanisms driving the observed trends across the islands 4 3 the inconsistency between annual peak flow and paired rainfall trends we found that some pfmax occurred at a different date to rfmax and only 64 of paired gauges showed consistent trend directions between daily rainfall and the peak flow the pairs with inconsistent trends may be an artifact of the limited availability of paired rain gauges as pairs showing inconsistent tends were mainly located in different watersheds or sub watersheds to each other however some of the inconsistency cannot be explained by the spatial mismatch for example the poamoho rain gauge 213215157552800 on o ahu best represented the rainfall on koʻolau mountain for nearby watersheds but interestingly three out of four nearby crest gauges did not follow its rainfall trend the inconsistency between pfmax and the paired rainfall may be because rainfall does not always lead to the peak flow additional factors in the runoff processes need further investigation these watersheds and their associated hydrological characteristics may have local scale patterns that alter the peak flow generation wasko and sharma 2017 suggested that disagreement between extreme rainfall and streamflow may be attributed to antecedent soil moisture conditions for larger watersheds in our analysis we found little changes when considering antecedent rainfall as indication of antecedent soil moisture conditions one limitation here was the difficulty in demonstrating the sensitivity of the pfmax to antecedent soil moisture there are two possible reasons for this 1 the pfmax is not sensitive to antecedent soil moisture likely due to the small watersheds with shorter concentration time in hawaiʻi or 2 the 5 day accumulated rainfall is insufficient to indicate the soil moisture maximum the pairing methods adopted in this study have improved our understanding and representation of rainfall events that cause peak flows however it remains unclear why some of the pairs exhibit opposite trend relationships and thus further investigation is required the change in rfmax cannot be conclusively applied as a proxy for the change in pfmax and we must be cautious in projecting changes in extreme streamflow based on changes in extreme rainfall alone 4 4 the shifts in seasonality of annual maximum rainfall and annual peak flow the occurrence date of rfmax and pfmax has receded from late january to december fig 5 that may due to the changes in the timing of winter storms in continental or large watersheds 2000 km2 changes in antecedent soil moisture play a notable part in temporal shifts of floods blöschl et al 2017 merz and blöschl 2003 wasko and sharma 2017 frazer and gaimbelluca 2016 showed that hawaiʻi had experienced drying trends from 1920 to 2012 however it is unclear how drying conditions have impacted the timing of maximum soil moisture and the occurrence date of pfmax shifting climate patterns may also have altered atmospheric circulations and the timing of winter rainfall blöschl et al 2017 diaz et al 2016 2001 which would change the timing of rfmax and then pfmax to our knowledge no other studies have addressed temporal shifts of rfmax and pfmax in hawaiʻi hence this study provides an important contribution to our understanding of shifting hydrological regimes and raises awareness of the temporal shifts in both rfmax and pfmax the occurrence date of rfmax in both windward and leeward regions exhibited 2 to 7 years oscillations figs 5 7 these oscillations may be caused by enso or other large atmospheric cycles previous running trend analyses of the magnitude of monthly rainfall extreme precipitation and streamflow have also identified distinct associations with atmospheric oscillations chu et al 2010 clilverd et al 2019 frazier and giambelluca 2017 these oscillations are most likely due to natural oceanic and atmospheric cycles such as the enso chu et al 2010 suggested that more extreme precipitation in the hawaiian islands occur during la niña years while fewer extreme precipitation events happen during el niño years however we found no pronounced relationship between enso and the magnitude of rfmax and pfmax with possible bias due to different methods and study periods instead we discovered that the occurrence date of both rfmax and pfmax likely depends on the enso phase regardless of its strength it is unsurprising that enso impacted the occurrence date of both rfmax and pfmax studies show that enso events delayed the starting time of monsoon in asia e g joseph et al 1994 wang et al 2013 different el niño properties might have led to different starting time of el niño and thus on the timing of rainfall wang et al 2013 wang et al 2019 different mechanisms in occurrences of el niño e g the el niño that had earlier starting time and occurred more frequent from 1901 to 2017 wang et al 2019 possibly contributed to the shift of occurrence date of rfmax and pfmax the shifts in occurrence date observed in this study have important ecological implications for instance the timing of flash floods triggers the migration of native hawaiian stream fishes oʻopu from their coastal nursery grounds to core stream habitats where they mature and reproduce fitzsimons and nishimoto 1995 radtke and kinzie 1996 therefore shifts in the timing of these migratory cues could have consequences for the dispersal and life cycles of native stream species across the hawaiian islands additional research on the sensitivity of peak flow to natural climate oscillations and climate change and the influence on the magnitude and seasonality of rfmax and pfmax is warranted this could be addressed with new stream gauges in watersheds a more extensive rainfall gauge network and support for long term records that would provide more effective streams and rainfall pairs needed to further our understanding of the association between peak flow and rainfall these would improve our understanding of the drivers of observed changes in seasonal peak flow and improve our ability to project future flooding events across the hawaiian islands and the potential impacts on humans and ecosystems 4 5 conclusions we have gained an improved understanding of local changes in peak streamflow and responses to changes in rainfall despite limitations in the availability of long term data our study demonstrated that both annual maximum rainfall and annual peak flow have declined local responses of both extreme rainfall and streamflow were varied and changes in peak streamflow do not necessarily follow the changes in maximum rainfall in addition we conclude that spatial linkages between rainfall and streamflow gauges are important when studying the relationship between peak streamflow and maximum rainfall also the temporal shifts in peak streamflow and rainfall should be considered in understanding changes in extreme events examining the inconsistency between the timing of peak streamflow and annual maximum rainfall is needed and investigating the mechanisms that cause annual maximum rainfall or heavy rainfall could shed light on the subsequent effect on temporal shifts in peak streamflow declaration of competing interest

4357,flooding is a significant threat to life and property in hawaiʻi as climate warming continues to alter precipitation patterns and hydrological processes in the tropics characterizing the shifting patterns in magnitude seasonality and location of floods would improve our understanding of the consequences and better prepare us for future flood events in this study 84 rain gauges and 111 crest gauges across five major hawaiian islands were analyzed from 1970 to 2005 we estimated trends in the annual maximum daily rainfall rfmax and the annual peak flow pfmax using the mann kendall test and senʻs slope subsequently we examined the association between pfmax and rainfall then we assessed temporal shifting by combining circular analysis with senʻs slope the main identified trends showed decreases in rfmax and pfmax 67 and 61 of all gauges respectively the physiography of the hawaiian islands i e windward vs leeward has little contribution to both trends in addition pfmax trend cannot be fully attributed to rfmax trend and in many cases rfmax andpfmax did not occur coincidently we also found the timing of rfmax and pfmax occurred in early wet season during the el niño years and shifted even earlier from 1970 to 2005 likely due to the change of el niño these findings have implications for assessing flood risk our finding will aid watershed management and flood mitigation and can increase resilience of downstream communities and near shore environments keywords annual maximum rainfall annual peak streamflow mann kendall test sen s slope trends climate shifting occurrence date 1 introductions in hawaiʻi floods contributed to the largest economic loss and the second largest cause of death from natural hazards between 1996 and 2018 data sources hazards reported from the storm event database national centers for environmental information ncei 2019a flooding is associated with erosion that scours stream beds abrades bedrock moves large amounts of sediment and debris downstream and downcuts channels improving our understanding of changes in flooding will inform watershed planning and potential mitigation strategies especially as climate warming continues to alter precipitation patterns and hydrological processes in theory increasing global temperature results in increased water vapor in the air with its greater water holding capacity which leads to larger and more frequent extreme precipitation events held et al 2006 knutson and manabe 1995 extreme precipitation events have increased in magnitude and frequency with warming temperature in many regions alexander et al 2006 beck et al 2015 donat et al 2013 easterling et al 2017 groisman et al 2005 wentz et al 2007 westra et al 2013 nevertheless an analysis with 390 watersheds across the u s found the 99th percentile precipitation does not completely contribute to 99th percentile streamflow and the contributions varied with soil moisture condition ivancic and shaw 2015 unlike rainfall streamflow and flooding are scale dependent based on local watershed characteristics wasko and sharma 2017 therefore extreme rainfall trends might not fully describe the observed patterns in extreme streamflow trends and their linkage needs to be studied locally previous studies have shown various trends in extreme streamflow across the world such as in north america cunderlik and ouarda 2009 groisman et al 2001 europe blöschl et al 2019 hannaford and marsh 2008 mediero et al 2014 renard et al 2008 and australia ishak et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 the annual maximum peak flow in canada has decreased cunderlik and ouarda 2009 whereas the high discharge in the eastern u s has increased groisman et al 2001 in europe the annual 10 day streamflow and annual maximum peak flow between 1969 and 2003 in the u k increased hannaford and marsh 2008 but decreased in france between 1968 and 1998 renard et al 2008 the magnitude and frequency of annual peak flow in spain generally decreased from 1942 to 2009 mediero et al 2014 in australia the annual peak flow decreased in the south but increased in the north ishak et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 in addition to changes in the frequency and duration of extreme streamflow events the timing of flooding has also shifted in europe including earlier spring snowmelt floods in northern areas later winter floods along the mediterranean coast and earlier winter floods in western europe blöschl et al 2017 as trends in extreme streamflow are geographically heterogeneous it is critical to study the trends of extreme streamflow locally most trend analyses of extreme streamflow events have been conducted in mid latitude continental systems and little has been discussed in tropical regions which are sensitive to changes in large climate patterns extreme events in the tropics including hawaiʻi are influenced by large scale climate variability including the el niño southern oscillation enso the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and the pacific north america teleconnection pattern pna beck et al 2015 chu et al 1993 chu and chen 2005 elison timm et al 2011 lyons 1982 mantua et al 1997 recent evidence indicated that climate change has affected the enso s behavior across the tropics diaz and giambelluca 2012 o connor et al 2015 trenberth and hoar 1997 and changed el niño properties including its earlier starting time wang et al 2019 in singapore both daily and hourly maximum rainfall were found to increase between 1981 and 2010 with enso related changes in their intensity and timing beck et al 2015 with global warming the intensity and longevity of tropical cyclones tcs in the northeast pacific has slightly decreased between 1986 and 2005 klotzbach 2006 however tcs around the pacific are expected to occur more frequently in the future li et al 2010 murakami et al 2013 in hawaiʻi there are two seasons dry may oct and wet nov apr seasons in the dry season an extreme precipitation event is often attributed to hurricanes or tcs e g nugent et al 2020 the tc activity is more favorable under el niño conditions chu and wang 1997 jin et al 2014 and associates with the western north pacific wnp biennial oscillations luo et al 2020 in the wet season winter storms contribute the most to extreme rainfall a combination of pna enso and pdo contributes to the rainfall variability in the wet season frazier et al 2018 longman et al 2021 during el niño conditions the wet season months often become drier in hawaiʻi and wetter during la niña conditions in addition negative periods of pdo that align with la niña typically strengthen the intensity and lengthen the wetter period chen and chu 2014 streams in hawaiʻi respond to rainfall rapidly within hours as the majority of streams are first order streams with small drainage areas steep slopes and short time of concentration which combined with high intensity rainfall generating flashy hydrographs oki 2003 besides the coastal areas of hawaiian watersheds are often urbanized with impervious surface and channelized streams which contribute to the fast rising and falling hydrograph in hawaiʻi we expect extreme streamflow to highly correspond to its rainfall although we anticipate a close relationship between extreme streamflow and rainfall in hawaiʻi previous studies investigated their trends separately chu et al 2010 and chen and chu 2014 showed that extreme precipitation between the 1950s and 2007 became more common on the largest island hawaiʻi island but not on other islands using indices including the annual count of the number of days when the precipitation was over 25 4 mm annual maximum consecutive 5 day precipitation and the normalized 95th percentile precipitation bassiouni and oki 2013 investigated streamflow trends in hawaiʻi and found that 16 out of 26 gauges of peak flow decreased between 1943 and 2008 furthermore clilverd et al 2019 assessed streamflow records for 23 unregulated streams from 1967 to 2016 across the hawaiian islands and found significant declines in baseflow and surface runoff they also discovered significant declines in peak flow on hawaiʻi island however in some cases peak flow showed opposite trends from extreme precipitation e g chen and chu 2014 chu et al 2010 clilverd et al 2019 because extreme rainfall and streamflow trends have been investigated separately the linkages between these extreme events are not clear to better understand their associations we need a joined examination of extreme rainfall and peak flow trends this study aims to characterize local changes in the annual maximum daily rainfall rfmax and the annual peak flow pfmax by examining their spatial and temporal trends with their associations across five major hawaiian islands we investigated the trends in rfmax and pfmax to determine possible relationships between the meteorological and hydrologic response to climate change by studying 1 the spatial distribution of trends in rfmax and pfmax in hawaiʻi from 1970 to 2005 2 the association between peak rainfall and peak flow by pairing representative rain gauges to crest gauges and 3 the temporal shifts of rfmax and pfmax respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area analysis was focused on the five main islands including from west to east kauaʻi oʻahu molokaʻi maui and hawaiʻi island spanning from 18 9 n 154 8 w to 22 24 n 159 8 w the climate in hawaiʻi is strongly affected by hadley cell atmospheric circulation patterns in the pacific these patterns generate typical northeast trade winds in the northern hemisphere which induces orographic rainfall when moist air encounters the steep island topography lyons 1982 thus windward facing sides of the islands experience more frequent rain and higher annual rainfall below the trade wind inversion twi approximate mean elevation at 2000 m cao et al 2007 while the leeward sides are much drier in addition widespread and intense precipitation may be attributed to four other types of atmosphere conditions i kona storms the low pressure systems that usually develop to the west of the islands accompanied with southern winds ii cold fronts iii upper level trough or iv tropical cyclones caruso and businger 2006 kodama and barnes 1997 longman et al 2021 the wide range of terrain across the hawaiian islands with the large scale atmospheric systems results in heterogeneous climate patterns and steep rainfall gradients mean annual rainfall varies from 200 mm to 10 000 mm giambelluca et al 2013 further watersheds in hawaiʻi are typically characterized by young volcanic geology small drainage size steep topography and limited channel storage craig 2003 thus streams frequently experience flash flooding where water levels rise and fall rapidly within hours of locally intense rainfall events oki 2003 sahoo et al 2006 2 2 data the locations of rain and crest annual peak flow gauges across the hawaiian islands and their physiographical regions windward vs leeward are shown in fig 1 we sought crest gauges with the longest period of record and greatest overlap with rainfall records which resulted in a study period of 1970 to 2005 by water year daily rainfall data were obtained from the national centers for environmental information ncei and the u s geological survey usgs eighty four rain gauges kaua i n 17 o ahu n 25 moloka i n 3 maui n 20 and hawai i island n 19 with data records longer than half of the study period were used in this study fig 1 most rain gauges were located at low elevations and only a few were above the average twi 2000 m the rain gauges were not evenly distributed across the islands except for kauaʻi for oʻahu and molokaʻi most of rain gauges were located on the leeward side whereas for maui and hawaiʻi island rain gauges were located mostly on the windward side and along the coast annual records of peak flow were obtained for 111 long term crest gauges circles in fig 1 kaua i n 18 o ahu n 45 moloka i n 7 maui n 25 and hawai i island n 16 from the water years 1970 to 2005 maintained by the usgs compared with the distribution of rain gauges crest gauges have a more even spatial distribution except on hawaiʻi island where crest gauges were predominantly located on the windward side peak flow values of each gauge were standardized by the watershed area and converted to a daily scale mm day that is comparable to the daily rainfall values mm day we used two climate indices to examine the shifts in the seasonality of peak events and their association with large climatic cycle the oceanic niño index oni and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo index the oni is one of the primary indices for monitoring enso it is calculated by averaging sea surface temperature monthly anomalies of the east central equatorial pacific ocean niño 3 4 region we retrieved monthly oni from the climate prediction center cpc 2019 the pdo index is defined by ocean temperature anomalies in the northeast and the tropical pacific ocean the pdo index is downloaded from ncei 2019b 2 3 trend analysis trends in the magnitude of rfmax and pfmax were analyzed using the non parametric mann kendall test hirsch and slack 1984 mann 1945 a p value 0 05 was used to indicate a significant trend changes of the magnitude were evaluated using sen s slope sen 1968 then the change of values per year were divided by the mean value of the study period to generate percent changes in the value per year these two trend analysis methods are recommended for analyzing environmental time series without normal distribution assumptions required hirsch and slack 1984 mann 1945 additionally evaluation with sen s slope is not sensitive to outliers these trend analyses have been widely applied to quantifying and testing the significance of streamflow trends bassiouni and oki 2013 clilverd et al 2019 oki 2004 small et al 2006 and rainfall trends chen and chu 2014 frazier and giambelluca 2017 the r package trends pohlert et al 2018 was applied in this analysis 2 4 analysis of paired rainfall gauges and stream crest gauges in addition to examining data from 84 rain gauges and 111 crest gauges we paired crest gauges with rain gauges that most likely represent the rainfall received from upstream watersheds to better understand the associations between rainfall and peak flow we paired them geographically with the following criteria ranked in order of preference 1 the rain gauge was located upstream of the crest gauge in the same watershed if multiple rain gauges existed in the same watershed we chose the gauge with the highest elevation but below the twi 2 the rain gauge was upstream from the crest gauge in the neighboring watershed 3 the rain gauge was close to the crest gauge within a 5 km radius 4 the rain gauge best represented the rainfall at the upstream watershed of the crest gauge despite being in a different watershed for example three crest gauges on the windward side of east maui were paired with one rain gauge at hana maui that represents the windward rainfall subsequently we extracted daily rainfall on the same day as the pfmax of the paired gauges additionally 2 day and 5 day accumulated rainfall were examined to consider antecedent conditions and rainfall events that lasted more than one day 2 5 examination of temporal shifts in annual maximum rainfall and peak flow we examined the temporal shifts of rfmax and pfmax with circular statistics zar 1999 by using the r package circular lund et al 2017 circular statistics are useful to analyze data with unit radius or degree on a circumference pewsey et al 2013 we applied a circular analysis to the occurrence date of rfmax and pfmax for the study period by converting the date d y of rfmax and pfmax to angular values for each year y ϑ y 2 π d y d y 0 ϑ y 2 π where d y 1 corresponds to january 1st and d y d y to december 31st and d y is the number of days in that year i e 365 or 366 then the sen s slope z is adjusted for estimating trends in the timing z m e d i a n ϑ j ϑ i c j i w i t h c π i f ϑ j ϑ i π π i f ϑ j ϑ i π 0 o t h e r w i s e where i and j indicate the year covering all possible pairs of years within the study period and i j the adjustment factor c aims to represent the shifting trend i e to earlier or later based on the occurrence date at the ith year when the differences between ϑ i and ϑ j are larger than π finally we analyzed the temporal shifts by different physiographic zones i e windward and leeward to examine the effects of different rainfall forming mechanisms 3 results 3 1 changes in maximum rainfall magnitudes out of 84 rain gauges the majority 67 of rain gauges exhibited decreasing in rfmax magnitude kauaʻi n 9 oʻahu n 19 molokaʻi n 1 maui n 15 and hawai i island n 12 the magnitude of rfmax significantly decreased at seven rain gauges one on oʻahu p 0 021 changed 1 5 per year mean 195 2 mm five on maui p 0 01 changed from 2 to 4 mean 22 5 mm to 70 mm and one on hawai i island p 0 046 changed 1 6 mean 171 6 mm fig 2 the remaining 33 of rain gauges showed increasing rfmax trends kauaʻi n 8 oʻahu n 6 molokaʻi n 2 maui n 5 and hawai i island n 7 fig 2 significant increasing trends only occurred at one gauge on hawai i island p 0 047 and changed 2 7 per year with a mean of 151 4 mm on kauaʻi increasing rfmax trends were primarily located on the windward side whereas there were no discernable differences in rfmax between leeward and windward on the other islands decreasing trends in rfmax dominated on oahu maui and hawaiʻi island while no particular trend direction prevailed on kauai and moloka i however there are too few rain gauges on moloka i to address the spatial distribution in rfmax trends 3 2 changes in peak flow magnitudes decreasing magnitude in pfmax occurred at 60 of the crest gauges kaua i n 8 o ahu n 29 moloka i n 3 maui n 16 and hawai i n 11 predominantly on o ahu maui and hawai i islands fig 3 statistically significant decreasing trends occurred at a single gauge on o ahu p 0 002 decreased 6 5 mean 195 8 mm day and two on maui p 0 011 decreased 4 2 means 224 8 mm day and 107 8 mm day respectively although decreasing pfmax trends dominated across o ahu some crest gauges still showed increasing trends with two statistically significant p 0 05 peak flow trends that rose 5 8 and 3 4 with means of 302 mm day and 80 mm day respectively there was a general pattern of increasing pfmax on the windward sides of kaua i moloka i and east maui fig 3 compared with rfmax pfmax shows a greater physiographic division i e windward and leeward in trend directions 3 3 associations between peak flow annual maximum rainfall and paired rainfall when pairing rainfall and crest gauges there are 18 pairs identified following the first criterion and there are nine eight and four pairs found in the subsequent criteria respectively this resulted in a total of 39 pairs across islands 2 on kaua i 15 on o ahu 1 on moloka i 14 on maui and 17 on hawai i island some rain gauges were paired with multiple crest gauges as they were the most representative rainfall of the given watersheds of crest gauges this applied at 13 crest gauges on o ahu 5 at poamoho 2 at waiāhole 4 at pauoa flats 2 at palolo valley seven crest gauges on maui 4 at haleakala and 3 at hana and at four crest gauges on hawai i island 2 at waiakea and 2 at mauna kea fig 4 the timing of rfmax rarely coincided on the same date with the timing of pfmax and increasing vs decreasing trends direction are often inconsistent out of the 39 pairs of rainfall and crest gauges almost half 46 of the pairs have different trend directions between rfmax and pfmax fig 4 within the study period when we extracted the same date rainfall with pfmax 67 of the paired rainfall and pfmax records had consistent trends increasing or decreasing however when we extracted the 2 day and 5 day accumulated rainfall with pfmax the percent of consistency decreased table 1 among the pairs having consistent trends 56 of them showed decreasing trends whereas the remaining 44 exhibited increasing trends fig 4 there was no clear leeward versus windward patterns in trend direction across the islands paired decreasing trends occurred on both windward and leeward sides of oʻahu and maui and on windward hawaiʻi island consistent increasing trends occurred on the leeward side of oʻahu the windward side of maui and the north of hawaiʻi island 3 4 changes in the timing of annual maximum rainfall and peak flow rfmax and pfmax often occurred during the wet season nov apr with the median occurrence date of rfmax in early january and the median occurrence date of pfmax in mid january for all gauges during the study period fig 5 a b from 1970 to 2005 the occurrence date of both rfmax and pfmax shifted to an earlier time in the wet season from late january to late december fig 5c d yet the occurrence date oscillated between earlier and later throughout the four sub periods fig 5c d the sen s slope statistics also supported the temporal shifts in the study period the sen s slope estimator for the timing of the rfmax and the pfmax were 1 34 1 5 days earlier and 1 24 1 5 days earlier with p value 0 05 in leeward regions respectively 0 404 half day with p value 0 05 and 0 231 6 h later with p value 0 05 in windward areas respectively 3 5 the relationships of annual maximum rainfall and peak flow to large scale climate variability the magnitude of rfmax and pfmax showed no clear relationships to either the strength of enso figure a1 or pdo figure b1 indices on the other hand the median occurrence date of both rfmax and pfmax shifted earlier with a two to seven year cycle regardless in windward or leeward areas figs 6 and 7 which were correlated to the cycle of enso specifically the median occurrence date of rfmax and pfmax shifted to earlier during warm phase of enso shaded in red in figs 6 and 7 the enso s impact on median occurrence date was more pronounced in leeward regions i e with 12 8 recognized el niño la niña events 9 5 rfmax and 9 6 pfmax occurred earlier later in a water year fig 6 however there is no correlation between the strength of enso i e higher values of index and the amount of shifting in occurrence date of rfmax and pfmax with a correlation coefficient 0 15 besides the magnitude and occurrence date of rfmax and pfmax were not directly correlated to pdo figure b2 4 discussion 4 1 overview changes in extreme events are driven by complex atmospheric conditions and antecedent hydrological conditions and in general it is difficult to distinguish whether observed changes in rainfall and streamflow are due to natural atmospheric variability or global warming climate models have projected more intense rainfall under a warming climate which will lead to more severe flooding trenberth 2011 the dataset presented here extends our knowledge of changes in both magnitude and temporal distribution of rfmax and pfmax and their relationships to physiography and atmospheric circulation across the hawaiian islands we analyzed temporal and spatial trends in rfmax and pfmax examined the association between rfmax and pfmax and inspected the temporal shifts of rfmax and pfmax five key findings of this study were 1 decreasing rfmax trends in more than half of gauges particularly on oʻahu and maui 2 decreasing pfmax trends in most gauges on oʻahu maui and hawaiʻi island with more physiographic patterns in pfmax trends than rfmax trends 3 different timing between the pfmax and the rfmax 4 shifts in the occurrence date of rfmax and pfmax to earlier except for pfmax in windward areas and 5 an effect of enso on the occurrence date of rfmax and pfmax our results highlight that changes in rfmax are not sufficient to explain the observed trends in pfmax the observed shifts in the occurrence date of rfmax and pfmax are important for flood risk and environmental management 4 2 comparing trends in the hawaiian islands to other studies the predominantly decreasing trends of rfmax and pfmax shown in this study are consistent with previous findings in hawaiʻi bassiouni and oki 2013 chu et al 2010 clilverd et al 2019 however we did not find increasing rfmax trends on hawai i island as suggested by chu et al 2010 this difference may be in part due to the differences in the examined period 1970 2005 vs 1950 2007 and it highlights cautiously using fixed periods of record as statistical significances of long term trends frazier and giambelluca 2017 the majority of pfmax stations showed declining trends across the state of hawaiʻi during our study period particularly on oʻahu and hawai i island changes in the magnitude of pfmax range from 6 5 to 5 8 per year in general the hawaiian islands are experiencing decreasing rfmax and pfmax whereas globally extreme rainfall has increased in many continental regions changnon and kunkel 1995 groisman et al 2004 hannaford and marsh 2008 lins and slack 1999 petrow and merz 2009 madsen et al 2014 indicated that trends of extreme precipitation and floods in europe are heterogeneous besides the regional factor trends of extreme hydrological events may vary due to different definitions or methodologies to detect the trend e g the maximum value over a period count of precipitation days over a threshold the percentile values frequency etc cunderlik and ouarda 2009 do et al 2017 douglas et al 2000 hannaford and marsh 2008 ishak et al 2013 lins and slack 1999 madsen et al 2014 petrow and merz 2009 further variation in the observed peak flow trends may be due to different causes or mechanisms that generate peak flow such as intense rainfall saturated soil or snow melt blöschl et al 2017 cunderlik and ouarda 2009 studies in tropical regions i e singapore beck et al 2015 and india pingale et al 2014 only showed an increase in annual maximum daily precipitation but little has been done in examining the changes of peak flow and in other tropical islands in hawaiʻi decreasing pfmax may be related to decreased rfmax however little research has examined higher temporal resolution i e subdaily rainfall and its changes subdaily rainfall may be better associated with peak flow as streamflow responds to rainfall within hours in hawaiʻi streams in addition the increasing drought condition across the hawaiian islands frazier et al 2019 may also contribute to decreasing pfmax increasing evapotranspiration and decreasing the opportunity of saturation excess overland flow this study adds to the knowledge of peak flow changes in tropical regions especially on those tropical islands that are often first to experioence the impact of changing climate and are vulnerable to changes in precipitation nevertheless further studies with long term data recording of peak flows and high resolution rainfall will assist future assessments of their relationships and the mechanisms driving the observed trends across the islands 4 3 the inconsistency between annual peak flow and paired rainfall trends we found that some pfmax occurred at a different date to rfmax and only 64 of paired gauges showed consistent trend directions between daily rainfall and the peak flow the pairs with inconsistent trends may be an artifact of the limited availability of paired rain gauges as pairs showing inconsistent tends were mainly located in different watersheds or sub watersheds to each other however some of the inconsistency cannot be explained by the spatial mismatch for example the poamoho rain gauge 213215157552800 on o ahu best represented the rainfall on koʻolau mountain for nearby watersheds but interestingly three out of four nearby crest gauges did not follow its rainfall trend the inconsistency between pfmax and the paired rainfall may be because rainfall does not always lead to the peak flow additional factors in the runoff processes need further investigation these watersheds and their associated hydrological characteristics may have local scale patterns that alter the peak flow generation wasko and sharma 2017 suggested that disagreement between extreme rainfall and streamflow may be attributed to antecedent soil moisture conditions for larger watersheds in our analysis we found little changes when considering antecedent rainfall as indication of antecedent soil moisture conditions one limitation here was the difficulty in demonstrating the sensitivity of the pfmax to antecedent soil moisture there are two possible reasons for this 1 the pfmax is not sensitive to antecedent soil moisture likely due to the small watersheds with shorter concentration time in hawaiʻi or 2 the 5 day accumulated rainfall is insufficient to indicate the soil moisture maximum the pairing methods adopted in this study have improved our understanding and representation of rainfall events that cause peak flows however it remains unclear why some of the pairs exhibit opposite trend relationships and thus further investigation is required the change in rfmax cannot be conclusively applied as a proxy for the change in pfmax and we must be cautious in projecting changes in extreme streamflow based on changes in extreme rainfall alone 4 4 the shifts in seasonality of annual maximum rainfall and annual peak flow the occurrence date of rfmax and pfmax has receded from late january to december fig 5 that may due to the changes in the timing of winter storms in continental or large watersheds 2000 km2 changes in antecedent soil moisture play a notable part in temporal shifts of floods blöschl et al 2017 merz and blöschl 2003 wasko and sharma 2017 frazer and gaimbelluca 2016 showed that hawaiʻi had experienced drying trends from 1920 to 2012 however it is unclear how drying conditions have impacted the timing of maximum soil moisture and the occurrence date of pfmax shifting climate patterns may also have altered atmospheric circulations and the timing of winter rainfall blöschl et al 2017 diaz et al 2016 2001 which would change the timing of rfmax and then pfmax to our knowledge no other studies have addressed temporal shifts of rfmax and pfmax in hawaiʻi hence this study provides an important contribution to our understanding of shifting hydrological regimes and raises awareness of the temporal shifts in both rfmax and pfmax the occurrence date of rfmax in both windward and leeward regions exhibited 2 to 7 years oscillations figs 5 7 these oscillations may be caused by enso or other large atmospheric cycles previous running trend analyses of the magnitude of monthly rainfall extreme precipitation and streamflow have also identified distinct associations with atmospheric oscillations chu et al 2010 clilverd et al 2019 frazier and giambelluca 2017 these oscillations are most likely due to natural oceanic and atmospheric cycles such as the enso chu et al 2010 suggested that more extreme precipitation in the hawaiian islands occur during la niña years while fewer extreme precipitation events happen during el niño years however we found no pronounced relationship between enso and the magnitude of rfmax and pfmax with possible bias due to different methods and study periods instead we discovered that the occurrence date of both rfmax and pfmax likely depends on the enso phase regardless of its strength it is unsurprising that enso impacted the occurrence date of both rfmax and pfmax studies show that enso events delayed the starting time of monsoon in asia e g joseph et al 1994 wang et al 2013 different el niño properties might have led to different starting time of el niño and thus on the timing of rainfall wang et al 2013 wang et al 2019 different mechanisms in occurrences of el niño e g the el niño that had earlier starting time and occurred more frequent from 1901 to 2017 wang et al 2019 possibly contributed to the shift of occurrence date of rfmax and pfmax the shifts in occurrence date observed in this study have important ecological implications for instance the timing of flash floods triggers the migration of native hawaiian stream fishes oʻopu from their coastal nursery grounds to core stream habitats where they mature and reproduce fitzsimons and nishimoto 1995 radtke and kinzie 1996 therefore shifts in the timing of these migratory cues could have consequences for the dispersal and life cycles of native stream species across the hawaiian islands additional research on the sensitivity of peak flow to natural climate oscillations and climate change and the influence on the magnitude and seasonality of rfmax and pfmax is warranted this could be addressed with new stream gauges in watersheds a more extensive rainfall gauge network and support for long term records that would provide more effective streams and rainfall pairs needed to further our understanding of the association between peak flow and rainfall these would improve our understanding of the drivers of observed changes in seasonal peak flow and improve our ability to project future flooding events across the hawaiian islands and the potential impacts on humans and ecosystems 4 5 conclusions we have gained an improved understanding of local changes in peak streamflow and responses to changes in rainfall despite limitations in the availability of long term data our study demonstrated that both annual maximum rainfall and annual peak flow have declined local responses of both extreme rainfall and streamflow were varied and changes in peak streamflow do not necessarily follow the changes in maximum rainfall in addition we conclude that spatial linkages between rainfall and streamflow gauges are important when studying the relationship between peak streamflow and maximum rainfall also the temporal shifts in peak streamflow and rainfall should be considered in understanding changes in extreme events examining the inconsistency between the timing of peak streamflow and annual maximum rainfall is needed and investigating the mechanisms that cause annual maximum rainfall or heavy rainfall could shed light on the subsequent effect on temporal shifts in peak streamflow declaration of competing interest

findings reveal that mhw metrics are above average in most parts of the bering sea with the number of days being more than 50 a year frequencies of mhws are relatively high in the western sectors while durations and intensities are high in the eastern and southern sectors of the bering sea increasing trends in the mhw days are noticed almost everywhere while similar increases in mhw intensities are found in the northern bering sea in addition chukchi sea ice concentrations show a negative correlation with heatwave frequencies and days while the arctic oscillation has no significant connection positive correlations are observed between chukchi sea temperatures and alaskan air temperatures implying influences on the mhw frequencies and days while the annual trends in the mhw frequencies and days peak over several periods the latest decade 2010 2019 has seen the highest of both our findings suggest that the spatiotemporal distribution of mhw metrics is connected with underlying physical processes in the bering sea and neighbouring climatic patterns such as the pacific teleconnections sea ice extent air temperature and its location within the arctic keywords bering sea marine heatwave arctic climate variability temperature 1 introduction anthropogenic warming and its consequent climate impacts have been promulgated in recent studies attracting global attention in climate sciences with continuous research on increasing temperatures drought frequencies and incessant weather spells extreme events have become an important subject in climate change research jentsch et al 2007 shrestha and wang 2020 wang and zhu 2020 zhang et al 2019 one category of extreme events known as heatwaves has been receiving great attention over the years heatwaves are defined as the periods of abnormally hot weather conditions which have been increasing in frequency and intensity hampering human health and ecosystems in the recent decades a similar phenomenon called marine heatwaves mhw has been known to occur in oceans threatening marine ecosystems and productivity selig et al 2010 frölicher and laufkötter 2018 smale et al 2019 this term has also seen updated definitions based on statistical properties and other metrics meehl and tebaldi 2004 fischer et al 2011 perkins and alexander 2013 the latest definition describes mhws as discrete periods of anomalously warm sea surface temperatures ranging for days to months and can extend up to thousands of kilometres hobday et al 2016 notable mhws have occurred in the mediterranean sea sparnocchia et al 2006 olita et al 2007 in the tasman sea off the coast of australia oliver et al 2017 in the northwest atlantic ocean in 2012 mills et al 2013 and in the north pacific including the recent blob bond et al 2015 scannell et al 2016 even with substantial knowledge of global sst changes an investigation of previous occurrences of mhws and associated climate processes are still lacking frölicher and laufkötter 2018 in addition there is still an ongoing debate on recent arctic changes in influencing broader hemispheric weather patterns francis 2017 kretschmer et al 2018 previous studies have indicated that large scale circulation patterns in the northern hemisphere are in some degree influenced by arctic amplification francis and vavrus 2012 on the contrary there are other studies highlighting an insignificant relationship between arctic warming and circulation patterns and waviness in mid latitudes where most of the changes occur due to internal variability or thermodynamic effects in particular seasons screen 2014 blackport and screen 2020 the percentage of sea surface temperature sst change is the highest in the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere for near term and future long term scenarios ruela et al 2020 such changes occur due to the inter decadal variability of upper ocean temperatures which are more prominent in the higher northern latitudes as compared to the tropical oceans wang et al 2010 with marine ecosystems being vulnerable to the consequences of mhws there is a need to assess the extent and prevalence of mhws on regional scales the bering sea among other oceans in the northern hemisphere is expected to have higher changes in ssts in the near future ruela et al 2020 the bering sea and chukchi sea of the arctic are known to have similar patterns in ocean atmospheric warming and have been linked to ocean currents and teleconnections of the pacific carvalho and wang 2020 climate variability in the bering sea is largely heterogeneous and is influenced not only by seasonal patterns but also by sea ice changes air temperature and other meteorological components which are sensitive to the arctic cryosphere wood et al 2015 the pacific arctic region which encompasses the bering chukchi complex has been linked with ocean heat transport and inflows via the bering strait influencing arctic sea ice and global hydrological circulations woodgate et al 2012 in addition the anomalous conditions in the bering sea 1997 1998 studied by yeo et al 2014 indicates no significant relationship of sst sea ice and energy flux between the bering and chukchi seas nevertheless there is still a lack of studies revolving around extreme climates in the bering sea hence a more in depth outlook is desired to explore the occurrence of mhws and associated air sea interactions with the arctic here we will investigate different statistical properties including duration frequency and intensity of mhws since the late 1990s on spatial and temporal scales furthermore the recorded mhws over the time period 1990 2019 will be investigated with other climatic variables in the adjoining high latitudes the mhw annual frequencies and days will be correlated with various variables to decipher possible connections or drivers of mhws in the bering sea details provided in section 2 2 therefore the objective of this study is to explore the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics and occurrence mechanisms of mhws in the bering sea this paper will be organized as follows section 2 will introduce data sources and methods involved in exploring mhw characteristics and occurrence mechanisms section 3 presents an in depth analysis of mhw metrics on spatio temporal scales section 4 provides a thorough discussion on the bering sea mhw variations and connections with the arctic climate section 5 summarizes the main conclusions drawn from this study 2 data and methods 2 1 data sources the standard mhw definition is applied to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa optimum interpolation oi sst v2 and v 2 1 available for 2016 onwards high resolution 1 4 gridded sst data for the period 1982 to 2019 the time period for studying mhw statistics in the bering sea is from 1990 to 2019 fig 1 the bering sea is bounded by russia on the north and west alaska in the east and the aleutian islands in the south the bering sea occupies a geographic location which is susceptible to various oscillation patterns and seasonal extremes niebauer 1988 it is constrained by latitudes 160 e 150 w and longitudes 53 n 60 n the daily oisst data is constructed by combining observations from various platforms satellites ships and floats and interpolated on a global grid reynolds et al 2007 the analysis data contains in situ data as well as the large scale adjustment and corrections of satellite biases the new version v2 1 contains additional significant improvements in arctic observations as well arctic buoys sst improvements as a function of sea ice banzon et al 2020 the mhw analysis will be applied to the bering sea providing a more comprehensive outlook of extremes in the mid high latitudinal sea fig 1 2 2 marine heatwave metrics a marine heatwave is defined as a discrete and prolonged anomalously warm water event and is identified from daily sst time series each of the terms discrete prolonged and anomalously warm has been qualitatively described in a marine context hobday et al 2016 explicitly discrete implies an mhw event with distinct start and end dates prolonged represents a clear mhw count which means a persistence of the event for five consecutive days and anomalously warm indicates that the water temperature is above a climatological threshold defined as the 90th percentile threshold hence the climatological threshold is from 1982 to 2012 which is the acceptable time period for determining the threshold a minimum of 30 years according to hobday et al 2016 the climatological mean and the 90th percentile threshold can be calculated for each day of the year using daily temperatures across all years in each grid the climatological threshold once obtained can be used in the detection of warm and cold spells such definitions have also been implemented in software tools such as r https github com cran rmarineheatwaves and matlab https github com zijiezhaommhw m mhw1 0 therefore mhws are identified as periods that are above a threshold for at least five consecutive days and gaps between events of two or less days with a subsequent five day or more mhw events are also considered as continuous events an mhw can be identified at any point in the ocean from the gridded dataset with the aid of a hierarchical set of metrics table 1 metrics including duration and intensity collectively termed as primary metrics can be calculated these properties are defined as follows duration is the time period between a given start and end date maximum intensity is the maximum temperature recorded relative to a climatological threshold over the duration of the respective event and cumulative intensity is the sum of temperature anomalies for the duration of the event mean intensity is the mean anomalous temperature for the given mhw event mean states and trends can also be calculated for each mhw property frequency is the event counts in each year and days are referred to as the sum of mhw days in each year annual time series can be calculated on temporal scales for each mhw metric 2 3 correlation analysis to understand the bering sea arctic connections statistical analyses of mhws will be carried out climate variables will be correlated with the annual frequency and the annual number of days mhw days recorded in the bering sea the annual mhw frequencies and days are calculated by averaging the respective values over the entire grid area of the bering sea thereby including mhw events on different spatial scales the resultant temporal variations are correlated with the following variables sea surface temperature sst and sea ice concentration sic of the chukchi sea alaskan and russian arctic air temperatures the teleconnection pattern and the arctic oscillation ao here the russian arctic is the geographical region of russia north of 65 n while alaska is the region in the pan arctic containing 13 climate divisions based on vegetation types climate and extreme events bieniek et al 2011 smith et al 2014 the chukchi sea sst and sic data were extracted from the same noaa oi dataset used to examine mhws in the bering sea the air temperature at data was obtained from the era5 dataset which can be accessed through the c3s climate data store cds the era5 dataset contains the latest significant improvements over its predecessors hersbach et al 2020 in particular energy budgets fluxes and higher resolution data make the dataset useful for the study mayer et al 2019 estimates of ocean heat budgets in the era5 dataset are good on an annual mean basis and the improved measurements of air temperatures by radiosonde and other sounding techniques have proved that the dataset has significant improvements on its former predecessors ingleby et al 2016 hersbach et al 2020 the ao data was downloaded from the noaa climate prediction center https www cpc ncep noaa gov to be consistent with the observations and trends the linear trends were removed before calculating the correlation coefficients 3 results 3 1 mhw mean states and trends the number of mhw days is a sum of 40 50 and is seen in most parts of the bering sea fig 2 a the largest number is seen in the eastern bering sea and along the coasts of bristol bay in alaska at approximately 58 mhw days the smallest sum of 22 mhw days is seen along the coasts of kamchatka peninsula in russia the mhw frequencies show a wider range of values across the bering sea fig 2b the map shows a higher number of mhw events in the western bering sea and bering strait moreover 3 or more mhw events are found to occur in the regions of lower bathymetric depths in the bering sea in comparison lesser number of mhw events is observed in the eastern sectors of the sea long mhw durations are seen in the eastern bering sea at 25 days fig 2c whereas most of the bering sea region shows an average of 15 20 days the mhw mean intensities show a notable dipolar spatial pattern fig 2d the mhw mean intensities of 1 8 c are seen in the north with smaller variations along the bordering regions of east russia and alaska and the lower values of 1 1 2 c are seen in the southern sectors of the bering sea the mhw maximum intensities show a similar spatial distribution as mean intensities but with relatively higher values fig 2e maximum mhw intensities appear in the north ranging between 2 4 and 2 7 c while the southern sectors of the bering sea are at values between 1 2 and 1 4 c cumulative mhw intensities ranging from 50 to 65 c days are seen in the eastern bering sea fig 2f other regions show lower values of 15 20 c days significant positive trends in mhw days are found across the entire area of the bering sea fig 3 a the highest decadal trends are found along the central and eastern sectors at 44 days decade a few regions in the central bering sea show comparatively larger values of 55 60 mhw days decade increasing trends in mhw frequencies are also observed along the entire bering sea region except for the parts near the aleutian islands fig 3b comparatively higher trends of 2 3 mhw events decade are observed in the west and along the coasts of the russian far east lower number of 1 mhw event per decade are seen in the bering strait and southern bering sea moreover significant trends in mhw durations are noticed in most of the region except for the coastal areas near the kamchatka peninsula fig 3c longer periods of mhws are seen in the eastern bering sea near the coasts of aleutian islands and bristol bay alaska significant trends in mhw mean intensities are noticed in the eastern bering sea 0 33 c and the bering strait 0 55 c fig 3d similar spatiotemporal trends are seen in maximum mhw intensities fig 3e higher values of 0 7 0 8 c decade are observed in the north while the remaining sector shows lower values of 0 3 0 45 c decade cumulative mhw intensities are significantly higher in the coastal regions of southern alaska with values ranging between 35 and 40 c days decade fig 3f 3 2 interrelationships between mhw characteristics and climate variables two mhw characteristics namely mhw frequency and mhw days are correlated to understand the connections between extreme marine events and regional climate factors mhw frequencies have been increasing at the rate of 3 events per year for the time period 1990 2019 fig 4 furthermore the recent decade 2010 2019 shows the highest mean count of 4 while the first decade 1990 1999 shows the lowest mean count of 2 the highest mhw frequency is observed in 2017 at 7 mhw events the mhw days have also been increasing at the rate of 3 92 4 mhw days per year for the same time period fig 4 while the recent decade 2010 2019 shows the highest mean mhw days of 93 the lowest number is seen in the first decade 1990 1999 at 21 mean mhw days the largest number of mhw days was 172 days in 2018 here we take into account the average of all mhws that occur in the entire gridded dataset covering the bering sea region where mhw days refer to the total number of days in each year we also find that in the first decade 1990 1999 mhw frequencies and days are at record highs in 1997 which is the same year a recorded mhw with maximum intensity of 5 1 c anomalously high atmospheric pressures near the eastern bering sea particularly the alaskan region and seasonal changes in atmospheric circulation patterns in response to the el niño impact on the ecosystems and climate regimes of the bering sea napp and hunt 2001 mhw frequencies and days fig 4 show a triple peaked pattern for the period of 30 years where each decade shows a bell shaped pattern it is interesting to note that these patterns particularly 2000 2005 and 2007 2010 approximately reflect warm and cold events recorded in the eastern bering sea previous study has recorded warm and cold events in the southern bering sea compiling data from st pauls island alaska for the periods 2001 2005 warm and 2007 2010 cold overland et al 2012 based on the climate record of six year warm events followed by four year cold events the mhw frequencies tend to follow a similar temporal distribution pearson correlation coefficients r were estimated to explore the underlying interrelationships between mhw characteristics frequency and days and climate variables table 2 three of the climate variables including chukchi sea sst sic and alaska at show significant correlations p value less than 0 05 with both the mhw frequency and days the other variables i e the russian arctic at and ao do not show a significant correlation with either the mhw frequency or days in particular chukchi sea sst shows an equally strong positive correlation with similar r values when correlated with the mhw frequency r 0 70 and mhw days r 0 68 seasonal behaviour is also depicted with positive correlations in the summers and winters the chukchi sea sic is the only climate variable showing a significant negative correlation with mhw frequencies r 0 67 and mhw days r 0 60 this indicates that the years with lower chukchi sea sic witness more mhw events the same is also true for mhw days the chukchi sea sic shows winter patterns with mhw frequencies r 0 55 and mhw days r 0 64 and shares a summer connection with only mhw frequencies the correlation between chukchi sea sic and mhw days in the winters is low r 0 30 alaska at shows a similar strength of correlation with the mhw frequency r 0 68 as chukchi sea sic and sst but shows a higher level of correlation r 0 74 with mhw days this pattern is corroborated by fig 2a which shows the largest number of mhw days close to the alaskan peninsula there is a strong display of seasonal behaviour as well with significant correlations above 0 50 this seasonal behaviour can be attributed to the influence of the aleutian low pressure patterns the north pacific oscillation npo and the north pacific gyre oscillation npgo previous studies have highlighted the variability in the aleutian low and npo npgo coupling in response to winter ssts in the north eastern pacific rodionov et al 2007 danielson et al 2011 the russian arctic at has no significant correlation with neither mhw frequency r 0 23 nor with mhw days r 0 21 a similar case can be made for the ao as well furthermore the seasonally averaged ao also does not show significant correlations with mhw frequencies and mhw days 4 discussion 4 1 bering sea mhw metrics and variability in this study the bering sea marine heatwave variability was examined on spatial and temporal scales to better understand the air sea interactions the mhw metrics were also correlated with arctic climate variables mhw days are fairly equally distributed throughout the bering sea although there is a larger average number of mhw days observed off the western coast of alaska with the number decreasing towards the south west of the bering sea furthermore certain areas such as the coasts of the aleutian islands and parts of central bering sea have a larger number of 58 days moreover the southern coast of alaska bristol bay and the aleutian islands witness the largest number of mhw days approximately 60 62 days this is due to higher temperatures in southern alaska as compared further north in addition air temperatures along the southern alaskan coasts have been well correlated with teleconnections particularly the pacific decadal oscillation pdo bieniek et al 2011 this manifests that coastal mhw days air temperature interactions are stronger and dependent on the pdo in the eastern bering sea mhw frequencies are lower in the east and higher in the western bering sea the east coast of the russian far east has a higher number of annual events greater than 3 than the alaskan coastline such spatial patterns exemplify the studies where mhw frequencies are greatly enhanced by sst re emergence patterns associated with the thermocline circulation scannell et al 2016 an interesting observation can be made between the spatial distribution of mhw frequencies and durations here we find longer mhw durations and lower frequencies in the east bering sea while the opposite is seen in the western sector we reiterate that the mhw duration refers to the consecutive time period where the temperature exceeds the 90th percentile threshold the spatial patterns observed in fig 2a and 2c show higher number of mhw days and durations near the southern coasts of alaska this is due to the sst variability that exists in the northern pacific where higher sst anomalies are seen in the eastern bering sea and further south along the western american coastline this means that there are higher ssts that persist for many days implying a greater number of mhw days in this region the spatiotemporal distribution of mhw mean and maximum intensities depicts higher values in the north as compared to the southern bering sea the northern bering sea is generally characterised as having high frequency dynamics and spatiotemporal variability as compared with the southern counterpart which shows gradual cold to warm transitions baker et al 2020 while the bering sea shows relatively low mhw cumulative intensities the regions off the western coasts of alaska have higher values greater than 45 c days an interesting spatial pattern to note is the high mhw metrics except frequencies observed in the eastern bering sea and particularly near southern alaska a possibility does arise where the aleutian low in southern alaska may be contributing to seasonal variability and trends in mhw metrics in the bering sea a common spatial feature observed in all panels of fig 2 is that the region of the bering sea south of 58 shows less mhw days and mean intensities on the contrary there is a greater number of mhw days longer durations and higher intensities in the east and further north from this perspective the southern coasts of alaska experience longer mhws with higher intensities as compared to other regions in the bering sea such spatial characteristics can be influenced by north pacific circulation patterns which have often dictated spatial trends in ssts and seasonal teleconnections the sst over the north pacific bears similar resemblances to the higher latitudes particularly gulf of alaska and the nearby south eastern bering sea region yeo et al 2014 such resemblances have been attributed to the npo which exerts a strong influence on the temperatures over central and north east pacific ocean therefore the variability in mhw occurrences and intensities in the south eastern being sea are possibly driven by the npo which in turn influences the oceanic npgo of the pacific ocean furthermore the coastal region of the kamchatka peninsula russia experiences more frequent mhws of very short durations as compared with other regions such shorter duration mhws may be due to a smaller influence of npo and climate variability in the pacific although further studies are suggested in this aspect another explanation for the higher mhw metrics in the eastern bering sea is due to positive phases of the pdo which consequently lead to warmer ssts in the eastern bering sea and colder than normal temperatures in the west hence such teleconnections can act as potential drivers of longer and higher intensity mhws in this region lastly high surface heat fluxes and southeast northwest advection currents have been linked with air temperatures and heat content in the central and southern sectors of the bering sea danielson et al 2011 therefore our findings confirm the south eastern bering sea as an mhw hotspot or an important mhw locale higher positive trends in mhw days occur in the eastern bering sea and along the southern coasts of alaska at greater than 50 days decade similarly positive trends in mhw durations are noticed in the same regions at 25 30 days decade indicating longer periods of mhws the trends in mhw frequencies are similar to mean states a greater number of events per decade is seen along the coasts of russian far east while a smaller number is seen in the southern coasts of alaska trends in mhw intensities also approximately mirror each other in spatial patterns significant mean maximum and cumulative mhw intensity trends are noticed in the eastern sectors of the bering sea fig 3e f these trends are reflective of the mean ssts in this region which are also considered as potential drivers of increasing mhw trends 4 2 mhw temporal variations and connections with the arctic climate mhw events and annual days have been increasing since the 1990s with additional positive excursions also occurring throughout such positive excursions in mhw events occurred in the years 1996 1997 2003 2015 and 2017 while those in mhw days occurred in 1996 2003 and 2018 2019 anomalously low mhw frequency and mhw days occurred in 1999 and 2012 although there was a decreasing trend in the years preceding both of these lows in these multiyear periods with increasing mhw trends such as 2000 2005 and 2014 2018 sea ice was at its minimum in the southern bering shelves certain oceanographic conditions can draw clues to the mhw metrics in the bering sea the years from 2016 to 2019 show a lack of sea ice in the northern and south eastern bering sea shelves and no cold pools in the summers during the same years we find a larger number of mhw days mean of 140 days and mhw events mean of 6 events the years from 1990 to 2015 witness an average of 44 annual mhw days and 4 mhw events therefore warmer years serve as important signs and precursors for extreme ocean temperature anomalies positive correlation in most of the climate variables indicate that mhw frequencies and the number of mhw days are greatly influenced by arctic climate the chukchi sea sst with a high positive correlation hints that the bering sea heatwave frequencies and number of days are strongly related to it it implies that the bering sea mhw metrics may be affected by interannual variability in the sst further north the opposite is seen with ice concentration in the adjoining sea the chukchi sea sic shows a negative correlation with the mhw metrics i e a decrease in sea ice can lead to more mhw days and greater counts per year the recent decades that show increasing mhw frequencies and the number of mhw days are attributed to the decreasing sea ice thickness huge loss in sea ice and reduction of ice cover in the pacific arctic climate simulations have hinted that the reduction in ice concentration has further influenced cryosphere dynamics in the pacific arctic region baker et al 2020 hence this further implicates a decreasing chukchi sic with increasing mhw frequencies and days moreover a high positive correlation with the alaskan at proves that mhw annual counts and days in the bering sea are greatly influenced by air temperatures in alaska lastly no significant correlation of mhw metrics with the russian arctic at and ao states that these variables have negligible or no influence on mhws in the bering sea it is worth mentioning the relationships between ao alaskan at and bering sea mhw metrics while it is proven that ao is negatively correlated with alaskan temperatures the bering sea mhw frequency and annual days are not influenced by ao which brings a distinct characteristic to this relationship the above results bring us to the important question does the arctic climate influence the neighbouring high latitude circulation and atmospheric patterns our study provides evidence supporting the theory that a connection is present between chukchi sea sst sic and the alaskan air temperatures on bering sea extremes marine heatwaves furthermore the long period analysis of this study provides a better understanding of the relationship between the bering sea extremes and the chukchi sea and alaskan climates how is the theorised relationship defined our observations conclude that the chukchi sea sst and alaskan temperatures have a positive correlation with bering sea mhw frequencies and annual mhw days while the chukchi sic presents an inverse relationship with the aforementioned mhw metrics in order to postulate a few theses we follow the hypothesis by francis and vavrus 2012 which states that arctic amplification and subsequent warming may cause persistent weather patterns and extreme weather in near mid latitude environments according to the rossby wave theory slower moving circulation systems which are caused by reduced poleward gradients in the 1000 500 hpa thicknesses tend to weaken the upper zonal flow while sea ice loss and subsequent transfer of heat energy from the ocean into the atmosphere are prominent in the autumn and winters the enhanced warming over alaska leading to snow melt and heating of the chukchi shelf is a common occurrence in the summers decrease in sea ice can also lead to greater ocean temperatures due to the exposure of open waters such a prolongation of weather i e increases in chukchi sea temperatures reduced sea ice loss and high alaskan temperatures can account for extreme weather conditions marine heatwaves in the bering sea this statement is supported by the anomalous warming event of 2015 2016 in the bering sea which was caused by excessive heat content in the gulf of alaska and higher temperatures along the alaskan coasts the slow moving weather patterns can be caused by the enhanced 500 hpa ridging ridge elongation due to large increases in 500 hpa heights and such patterns have also led to extreme weather and heatwaves across europe in recent summers jaeger and seneviratne 2011 questions arise from the above concluded relationship can the chukchi sea climate alone lead to bering sea mhws do the alaskan air temperatures solely contribute to the bering sea mhws as shown in table 2 it is evident that the alaskan at has higher r values in correlation with the mhw metric however future development can bring about more inferences from the same our theses can be summed up in the flowchart shown in fig 5 as mentioned previously the correlations were performed after removing the linear trends slightly higher r values can be found if the mean is removed also similar results can be obtained if the data is not detrended before the correlations are performed 5 summary and conclusions this paper explores the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics and occurrence mechanisms of mhws in the bering sea with emphasis on different key metrics as defined by hobday et al 2016 different metrics are analysed on spatiotemporal scales which provides an in depth analysis of geographic patterns of extremes in the bering sea in addition mhw frequencies and the number of mhw days are correlated with different climate variables further disclosing the underlying connections between the air and sea properties in addition to examining relationships between mhws and climate variables this paper offers a glimpse of arctic cryosphere influences on neighbouring seas at lower latitudes i e the bering sea while a number of studies in understanding marine extremes have been conducted in the recent past it is useful to note that the latest definition of mhws has been used as a key basis in this study further studies based on model experiments would be undertaken to fill in the gaps existing in the marine heatwave knowledge particularly on physical ecological impacts and geographical connections additional in situ analyses and laboratory experiments are also

4358,the conterminous marine system of the bering sea serves as an important connection between the pacific and the arctic surface water temperatures of the northern pacific have been rising over the past decades with associated changes in extremes marine heatwaves mhws this study aims to explore the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics and occurrence mechanisms of mhws in the bering sea our findings reveal that mhw metrics are above average in most parts of the bering sea with the number of days being more than 50 a year frequencies of mhws are relatively high in the western sectors while durations and intensities are high in the eastern and southern sectors of the bering sea increasing trends in the mhw days are noticed almost everywhere while similar increases in mhw intensities are found in the northern bering sea in addition chukchi sea ice concentrations show a negative correlation with heatwave frequencies and days while the arctic oscillation has no significant connection positive correlations are observed between chukchi sea temperatures and alaskan air temperatures implying influences on the mhw frequencies and days while the annual trends in the mhw frequencies and days peak over several periods the latest decade 2010 2019 has seen the highest of both our findings suggest that the spatiotemporal distribution of mhw metrics is connected with underlying physical processes in the bering sea and neighbouring climatic patterns such as the pacific teleconnections sea ice extent air temperature and its location within the arctic keywords bering sea marine heatwave arctic climate variability temperature 1 introduction anthropogenic warming and its consequent climate impacts have been promulgated in recent studies attracting global attention in climate sciences with continuous research on increasing temperatures drought frequencies and incessant weather spells extreme events have become an important subject in climate change research jentsch et al 2007 shrestha and wang 2020 wang and zhu 2020 zhang et al 2019 one category of extreme events known as heatwaves has been receiving great attention over the years heatwaves are defined as the periods of abnormally hot weather conditions which have been increasing in frequency and intensity hampering human health and ecosystems in the recent decades a similar phenomenon called marine heatwaves mhw has been known to occur in oceans threatening marine ecosystems and productivity selig et al 2010 frölicher and laufkötter 2018 smale et al 2019 this term has also seen updated definitions based on statistical properties and other metrics meehl and tebaldi 2004 fischer et al 2011 perkins and alexander 2013 the latest definition describes mhws as discrete periods of anomalously warm sea surface temperatures ranging for days to months and can extend up to thousands of kilometres hobday et al 2016 notable mhws have occurred in the mediterranean sea sparnocchia et al 2006 olita et al 2007 in the tasman sea off the coast of australia oliver et al 2017 in the northwest atlantic ocean in 2012 mills et al 2013 and in the north pacific including the recent blob bond et al 2015 scannell et al 2016 even with substantial knowledge of global sst changes an investigation of previous occurrences of mhws and associated climate processes are still lacking frölicher and laufkötter 2018 in addition there is still an ongoing debate on recent arctic changes in influencing broader hemispheric weather patterns francis 2017 kretschmer et al 2018 previous studies have indicated that large scale circulation patterns in the northern hemisphere are in some degree influenced by arctic amplification francis and vavrus 2012 on the contrary there are other studies highlighting an insignificant relationship between arctic warming and circulation patterns and waviness in mid latitudes where most of the changes occur due to internal variability or thermodynamic effects in particular seasons screen 2014 blackport and screen 2020 the percentage of sea surface temperature sst change is the highest in the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere for near term and future long term scenarios ruela et al 2020 such changes occur due to the inter decadal variability of upper ocean temperatures which are more prominent in the higher northern latitudes as compared to the tropical oceans wang et al 2010 with marine ecosystems being vulnerable to the consequences of mhws there is a need to assess the extent and prevalence of mhws on regional scales the bering sea among other oceans in the northern hemisphere is expected to have higher changes in ssts in the near future ruela et al 2020 the bering sea and chukchi sea of the arctic are known to have similar patterns in ocean atmospheric warming and have been linked to ocean currents and teleconnections of the pacific carvalho and wang 2020 climate variability in the bering sea is largely heterogeneous and is influenced not only by seasonal patterns but also by sea ice changes air temperature and other meteorological components which are sensitive to the arctic cryosphere wood et al 2015 the pacific arctic region which encompasses the bering chukchi complex has been linked with ocean heat transport and inflows via the bering strait influencing arctic sea ice and global hydrological circulations woodgate et al 2012 in addition the anomalous conditions in the bering sea 1997 1998 studied by yeo et al 2014 indicates no significant relationship of sst sea ice and energy flux between the bering and chukchi seas nevertheless there is still a lack of studies revolving around extreme climates in the bering sea hence a more in depth outlook is desired to explore the occurrence of mhws and associated air sea interactions with the arctic here we will investigate different statistical properties including duration frequency and intensity of mhws since the late 1990s on spatial and temporal scales furthermore the recorded mhws over the time period 1990 2019 will be investigated with other climatic variables in the adjoining high latitudes the mhw annual frequencies and days will be correlated with various variables to decipher possible connections or drivers of mhws in the bering sea details provided in section 2 2 therefore the objective of this study is to explore the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics and occurrence mechanisms of mhws in the bering sea this paper will be organized as follows section 2 will introduce data sources and methods involved in exploring mhw characteristics and occurrence mechanisms section 3 presents an in depth analysis of mhw metrics on spatio temporal scales section 4 provides a thorough discussion on the bering sea mhw variations and connections with the arctic climate section 5 summarizes the main conclusions drawn from this study 2 data and methods 2 1 data sources the standard mhw definition is applied to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa optimum interpolation oi sst v2 and v 2 1 available for 2016 onwards high resolution 1 4 gridded sst data for the period 1982 to 2019 the time period for studying mhw statistics in the bering sea is from 1990 to 2019 fig 1 the bering sea is bounded by russia on the north and west alaska in the east and the aleutian islands in the south the bering sea occupies a geographic location which is susceptible to various oscillation patterns and seasonal extremes niebauer 1988 it is constrained by latitudes 160 e 150 w and longitudes 53 n 60 n the daily oisst data is constructed by combining observations from various platforms satellites ships and floats and interpolated on a global grid reynolds et al 2007 the analysis data contains in situ data as well as the large scale adjustment and corrections of satellite biases the new version v2 1 contains additional significant improvements in arctic observations as well arctic buoys sst improvements as a function of sea ice banzon et al 2020 the mhw analysis will be applied to the bering sea providing a more comprehensive outlook of extremes in the mid high latitudinal sea fig 1 2 2 marine heatwave metrics a marine heatwave is defined as a discrete and prolonged anomalously warm water event and is identified from daily sst time series each of the terms discrete prolonged and anomalously warm has been qualitatively described in a marine context hobday et al 2016 explicitly discrete implies an mhw event with distinct start and end dates prolonged represents a clear mhw count which means a persistence of the event for five consecutive days and anomalously warm indicates that the water temperature is above a climatological threshold defined as the 90th percentile threshold hence the climatological threshold is from 1982 to 2012 which is the acceptable time period for determining the threshold a minimum of 30 years according to hobday et al 2016 the climatological mean and the 90th percentile threshold can be calculated for each day of the year using daily temperatures across all years in each grid the climatological threshold once obtained can be used in the detection of warm and cold spells such definitions have also been implemented in software tools such as r https github com cran rmarineheatwaves and matlab https github com zijiezhaommhw m mhw1 0 therefore mhws are identified as periods that are above a threshold for at least five consecutive days and gaps between events of two or less days with a subsequent five day or more mhw events are also considered as continuous events an mhw can be identified at any point in the ocean from the gridded dataset with the aid of a hierarchical set of metrics table 1 metrics including duration and intensity collectively termed as primary metrics can be calculated these properties are defined as follows duration is the time period between a given start and end date maximum intensity is the maximum temperature recorded relative to a climatological threshold over the duration of the respective event and cumulative intensity is the sum of temperature anomalies for the duration of the event mean intensity is the mean anomalous temperature for the given mhw event mean states and trends can also be calculated for each mhw property frequency is the event counts in each year and days are referred to as the sum of mhw days in each year annual time series can be calculated on temporal scales for each mhw metric 2 3 correlation analysis to understand the bering sea arctic connections statistical analyses of mhws will be carried out climate variables will be correlated with the annual frequency and the annual number of days mhw days recorded in the bering sea the annual mhw frequencies and days are calculated by averaging the respective values over the entire grid area of the bering sea thereby including mhw events on different spatial scales the resultant temporal variations are correlated with the following variables sea surface temperature sst and sea ice concentration sic of the chukchi sea alaskan and russian arctic air temperatures the teleconnection pattern and the arctic oscillation ao here the russian arctic is the geographical region of russia north of 65 n while alaska is the region in the pan arctic containing 13 climate divisions based on vegetation types climate and extreme events bieniek et al 2011 smith et al 2014 the chukchi sea sst and sic data were extracted from the same noaa oi dataset used to examine mhws in the bering sea the air temperature at data was obtained from the era5 dataset which can be accessed through the c3s climate data store cds the era5 dataset contains the latest significant improvements over its predecessors hersbach et al 2020 in particular energy budgets fluxes and higher resolution data make the dataset useful for the study mayer et al 2019 estimates of ocean heat budgets in the era5 dataset are good on an annual mean basis and the improved measurements of air temperatures by radiosonde and other sounding techniques have proved that the dataset has significant improvements on its former predecessors ingleby et al 2016 hersbach et al 2020 the ao data was downloaded from the noaa climate prediction center https www cpc ncep noaa gov to be consistent with the observations and trends the linear trends were removed before calculating the correlation coefficients 3 results 3 1 mhw mean states and trends the number of mhw days is a sum of 40 50 and is seen in most parts of the bering sea fig 2 a the largest number is seen in the eastern bering sea and along the coasts of bristol bay in alaska at approximately 58 mhw days the smallest sum of 22 mhw days is seen along the coasts of kamchatka peninsula in russia the mhw frequencies show a wider range of values across the bering sea fig 2b the map shows a higher number of mhw events in the western bering sea and bering strait moreover 3 or more mhw events are found to occur in the regions of lower bathymetric depths in the bering sea in comparison lesser number of mhw events is observed in the eastern sectors of the sea long mhw durations are seen in the eastern bering sea at 25 days fig 2c whereas most of the bering sea region shows an average of 15 20 days the mhw mean intensities show a notable dipolar spatial pattern fig 2d the mhw mean intensities of 1 8 c are seen in the north with smaller variations along the bordering regions of east russia and alaska and the lower values of 1 1 2 c are seen in the southern sectors of the bering sea the mhw maximum intensities show a similar spatial distribution as mean intensities but with relatively higher values fig 2e maximum mhw intensities appear in the north ranging between 2 4 and 2 7 c while the southern sectors of the bering sea are at values between 1 2 and 1 4 c cumulative mhw intensities ranging from 50 to 65 c days are seen in the eastern bering sea fig 2f other regions show lower values of 15 20 c days significant positive trends in mhw days are found across the entire area of the bering sea fig 3 a the highest decadal trends are found along the central and eastern sectors at 44 days decade a few regions in the central bering sea show comparatively larger values of 55 60 mhw days decade increasing trends in mhw frequencies are also observed along the entire bering sea region except for the parts near the aleutian islands fig 3b comparatively higher trends of 2 3 mhw events decade are observed in the west and along the coasts of the russian far east lower number of 1 mhw event per decade are seen in the bering strait and southern bering sea moreover significant trends in mhw durations are noticed in most of the region except for the coastal areas near the kamchatka peninsula fig 3c longer periods of mhws are seen in the eastern bering sea near the coasts of aleutian islands and bristol bay alaska significant trends in mhw mean intensities are noticed in the eastern bering sea 0 33 c and the bering strait 0 55 c fig 3d similar spatiotemporal trends are seen in maximum mhw intensities fig 3e higher values of 0 7 0 8 c decade are observed in the north while the remaining sector shows lower values of 0 3 0 45 c decade cumulative mhw intensities are significantly higher in the coastal regions of southern alaska with values ranging between 35 and 40 c days decade fig 3f 3 2 interrelationships between mhw characteristics and climate variables two mhw characteristics namely mhw frequency and mhw days are correlated to understand the connections between extreme marine events and regional climate factors mhw frequencies have been increasing at the rate of 3 events per year for the time period 1990 2019 fig 4 furthermore the recent decade 2010 2019 shows the highest mean count of 4 while the first decade 1990 1999 shows the lowest mean count of 2 the highest mhw frequency is observed in 2017 at 7 mhw events the mhw days have also been increasing at the rate of 3 92 4 mhw days per year for the same time period fig 4 while the recent decade 2010 2019 shows the highest mean mhw days of 93 the lowest number is seen in the first decade 1990 1999 at 21 mean mhw days the largest number of mhw days was 172 days in 2018 here we take into account the average of all mhws that occur in the entire gridded dataset covering the bering sea region where mhw days refer to the total number of days in each year we also find that in the first decade 1990 1999 mhw frequencies and days are at record highs in 1997 which is the same year a recorded mhw with maximum intensity of 5 1 c anomalously high atmospheric pressures near the eastern bering sea particularly the alaskan region and seasonal changes in atmospheric circulation patterns in response to the el niño impact on the ecosystems and climate regimes of the bering sea napp and hunt 2001 mhw frequencies and days fig 4 show a triple peaked pattern for the period of 30 years where each decade shows a bell shaped pattern it is interesting to note that these patterns particularly 2000 2005 and 2007 2010 approximately reflect warm and cold events recorded in the eastern bering sea previous study has recorded warm and cold events in the southern bering sea compiling data from st pauls island alaska for the periods 2001 2005 warm and 2007 2010 cold overland et al 2012 based on the climate record of six year warm events followed by four year cold events the mhw frequencies tend to follow a similar temporal distribution pearson correlation coefficients r were estimated to explore the underlying interrelationships between mhw characteristics frequency and days and climate variables table 2 three of the climate variables including chukchi sea sst sic and alaska at show significant correlations p value less than 0 05 with both the mhw frequency and days the other variables i e the russian arctic at and ao do not show a significant correlation with either the mhw frequency or days in particular chukchi sea sst shows an equally strong positive correlation with similar r values when correlated with the mhw frequency r 0 70 and mhw days r 0 68 seasonal behaviour is also depicted with positive correlations in the summers and winters the chukchi sea sic is the only climate variable showing a significant negative correlation with mhw frequencies r 0 67 and mhw days r 0 60 this indicates that the years with lower chukchi sea sic witness more mhw events the same is also true for mhw days the chukchi sea sic shows winter patterns with mhw frequencies r 0 55 and mhw days r 0 64 and shares a summer connection with only mhw frequencies the correlation between chukchi sea sic and mhw days in the winters is low r 0 30 alaska at shows a similar strength of correlation with the mhw frequency r 0 68 as chukchi sea sic and sst but shows a higher level of correlation r 0 74 with mhw days this pattern is corroborated by fig 2a which shows the largest number of mhw days close to the alaskan peninsula there is a strong display of seasonal behaviour as well with significant correlations above 0 50 this seasonal behaviour can be attributed to the influence of the aleutian low pressure patterns the north pacific oscillation npo and the north pacific gyre oscillation npgo previous studies have highlighted the variability in the aleutian low and npo npgo coupling in response to winter ssts in the north eastern pacific rodionov et al 2007 danielson et al 2011 the russian arctic at has no significant correlation with neither mhw frequency r 0 23 nor with mhw days r 0 21 a similar case can be made for the ao as well furthermore the seasonally averaged ao also does not show significant correlations with mhw frequencies and mhw days 4 discussion 4 1 bering sea mhw metrics and variability in this study the bering sea marine heatwave variability was examined on spatial and temporal scales to better understand the air sea interactions the mhw metrics were also correlated with arctic climate variables mhw days are fairly equally distributed throughout the bering sea although there is a larger average number of mhw days observed off the western coast of alaska with the number decreasing towards the south west of the bering sea furthermore certain areas such as the coasts of the aleutian islands and parts of central bering sea have a larger number of 58 days moreover the southern coast of alaska bristol bay and the aleutian islands witness the largest number of mhw days approximately 60 62 days this is due to higher temperatures in southern alaska as compared further north in addition air temperatures along the southern alaskan coasts have been well correlated with teleconnections particularly the pacific decadal oscillation pdo bieniek et al 2011 this manifests that coastal mhw days air temperature interactions are stronger and dependent on the pdo in the eastern bering sea mhw frequencies are lower in the east and higher in the western bering sea the east coast of the russian far east has a higher number of annual events greater than 3 than the alaskan coastline such spatial patterns exemplify the studies where mhw frequencies are greatly enhanced by sst re emergence patterns associated with the thermocline circulation scannell et al 2016 an interesting observation can be made between the spatial distribution of mhw frequencies and durations here we find longer mhw durations and lower frequencies in the east bering sea while the opposite is seen in the western sector we reiterate that the mhw duration refers to the consecutive time period where the temperature exceeds the 90th percentile threshold the spatial patterns observed in fig 2a and 2c show higher number of mhw days and durations near the southern coasts of alaska this is due to the sst variability that exists in the northern pacific where higher sst anomalies are seen in the eastern bering sea and further south along the western american coastline this means that there are higher ssts that persist for many days implying a greater number of mhw days in this region the spatiotemporal distribution of mhw mean and maximum intensities depicts higher values in the north as compared to the southern bering sea the northern bering sea is generally characterised as having high frequency dynamics and spatiotemporal variability as compared with the southern counterpart which shows gradual cold to warm transitions baker et al 2020 while the bering sea shows relatively low mhw cumulative intensities the regions off the western coasts of alaska have higher values greater than 45 c days an interesting spatial pattern to note is the high mhw metrics except frequencies observed in the eastern bering sea and particularly near southern alaska a possibility does arise where the aleutian low in southern alaska may be contributing to seasonal variability and trends in mhw metrics in the bering sea a common spatial feature observed in all panels of fig 2 is that the region of the bering sea south of 58 shows less mhw days and mean intensities on the contrary there is a greater number of mhw days longer durations and higher intensities in the east and further north from this perspective the southern coasts of alaska experience longer mhws with higher intensities as compared to other regions in the bering sea such spatial characteristics can be influenced by north pacific circulation patterns which have often dictated spatial trends in ssts and seasonal teleconnections the sst over the north pacific bears similar resemblances to the higher latitudes particularly gulf of alaska and the nearby south eastern bering sea region yeo et al 2014 such resemblances have been attributed to the npo which exerts a strong influence on the temperatures over central and north east pacific ocean therefore the variability in mhw occurrences and intensities in the south eastern being sea are possibly driven by the npo which in turn influences the oceanic npgo of the pacific ocean furthermore the coastal region of the kamchatka peninsula russia experiences more frequent mhws of very short durations as compared with other regions such shorter duration mhws may be due to a smaller influence of npo and climate variability in the pacific although further studies are suggested in this aspect another explanation for the higher mhw metrics in the eastern bering sea is due to positive phases of the pdo which consequently lead to warmer ssts in the eastern bering sea and colder than normal temperatures in the west hence such teleconnections can act as potential drivers of longer and higher intensity mhws in this region lastly high surface heat fluxes and southeast northwest advection currents have been linked with air temperatures and heat content in the central and southern sectors of the bering sea danielson et al 2011 therefore our findings confirm the south eastern bering sea as an mhw hotspot or an important mhw locale higher positive trends in mhw days occur in the eastern bering sea and along the southern coasts of alaska at greater than 50 days decade similarly positive trends in mhw durations are noticed in the same regions at 25 30 days decade indicating longer periods of mhws the trends in mhw frequencies are similar to mean states a greater number of events per decade is seen along the coasts of russian far east while a smaller number is seen in the southern coasts of alaska trends in mhw intensities also approximately mirror each other in spatial patterns significant mean maximum and cumulative mhw intensity trends are noticed in the eastern sectors of the bering sea fig 3e f these trends are reflective of the mean ssts in this region which are also considered as potential drivers of increasing mhw trends 4 2 mhw temporal variations and connections with the arctic climate mhw events and annual days have been increasing since the 1990s with additional positive excursions also occurring throughout such positive excursions in mhw events occurred in the years 1996 1997 2003 2015 and 2017 while those in mhw days occurred in 1996 2003 and 2018 2019 anomalously low mhw frequency and mhw days occurred in 1999 and 2012 although there was a decreasing trend in the years preceding both of these lows in these multiyear periods with increasing mhw trends such as 2000 2005 and 2014 2018 sea ice was at its minimum in the southern bering shelves certain oceanographic conditions can draw clues to the mhw metrics in the bering sea the years from 2016 to 2019 show a lack of sea ice in the northern and south eastern bering sea shelves and no cold pools in the summers during the same years we find a larger number of mhw days mean of 140 days and mhw events mean of 6 events the years from 1990 to 2015 witness an average of 44 annual mhw days and 4 mhw events therefore warmer years serve as important signs and precursors for extreme ocean temperature anomalies positive correlation in most of the climate variables indicate that mhw frequencies and the number of mhw days are greatly influenced by arctic climate the chukchi sea sst with a high positive correlation hints that the bering sea heatwave frequencies and number of days are strongly related to it it implies that the bering sea mhw metrics may be affected by interannual variability in the sst further north the opposite is seen with ice concentration in the adjoining sea the chukchi sea sic shows a negative correlation with the mhw metrics i e a decrease in sea ice can lead to more mhw days and greater counts per year the recent decades that show increasing mhw frequencies and the number of mhw days are attributed to the decreasing sea ice thickness huge loss in sea ice and reduction of ice cover in the pacific arctic climate simulations have hinted that the reduction in ice concentration has further influenced cryosphere dynamics in the pacific arctic region baker et al 2020 hence this further implicates a decreasing chukchi sic with increasing mhw frequencies and days moreover a high positive correlation with the alaskan at proves that mhw annual counts and days in the bering sea are greatly influenced by air temperatures in alaska lastly no significant correlation of mhw metrics with the russian arctic at and ao states that these variables have negligible or no influence on mhws in the bering sea it is worth mentioning the relationships between ao alaskan at and bering sea mhw metrics while it is proven that ao is negatively correlated with alaskan temperatures the bering sea mhw frequency and annual days are not influenced by ao which brings a distinct characteristic to this relationship the above results bring us to the important question does the arctic climate influence the neighbouring high latitude circulation and atmospheric patterns our study provides evidence supporting the theory that a connection is present between chukchi sea sst sic and the alaskan air temperatures on bering sea extremes marine heatwaves furthermore the long period analysis of this study provides a better understanding of the relationship between the bering sea extremes and the chukchi sea and alaskan climates how is the theorised relationship defined our observations conclude that the chukchi sea sst and alaskan temperatures have a positive correlation with bering sea mhw frequencies and annual mhw days while the chukchi sic presents an inverse relationship with the aforementioned mhw metrics in order to postulate a few theses we follow the hypothesis by francis and vavrus 2012 which states that arctic amplification and subsequent warming may cause persistent weather patterns and extreme weather in near mid latitude environments according to the rossby wave theory slower moving circulation systems which are caused by reduced poleward gradients in the 1000 500 hpa thicknesses tend to weaken the upper zonal flow while sea ice loss and subsequent transfer of heat energy from the ocean into the atmosphere are prominent in the autumn and winters the enhanced warming over alaska leading to snow melt and heating of the chukchi shelf is a common occurrence in the summers decrease in sea ice can also lead to greater ocean temperatures due to the exposure of open waters such a prolongation of weather i e increases in chukchi sea temperatures reduced sea ice loss and high alaskan temperatures can account for extreme weather conditions marine heatwaves in the bering sea this statement is supported by the anomalous warming event of 2015 2016 in the bering sea which was caused by excessive heat content in the gulf of alaska and higher temperatures along the alaskan coasts the slow moving weather patterns can be caused by the enhanced 500 hpa ridging ridge elongation due to large increases in 500 hpa heights and such patterns have also led to extreme weather and heatwaves across europe in recent summers jaeger and seneviratne 2011 questions arise from the above concluded relationship can the chukchi sea climate alone lead to bering sea mhws do the alaskan air temperatures solely contribute to the bering sea mhws as shown in table 2 it is evident that the alaskan at has higher r values in correlation with the mhw metric however future development can bring about more inferences from the same our theses can be summed up in the flowchart shown in fig 5 as mentioned previously the correlations were performed after removing the linear trends slightly higher r values can be found if the mean is removed also similar results can be obtained if the data is not detrended before the correlations are performed 5 summary and conclusions this paper explores the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics and occurrence mechanisms of mhws in the bering sea with emphasis on different key metrics as defined by hobday et al 2016 different metrics are analysed on spatiotemporal scales which provides an in depth analysis of geographic patterns of extremes in the bering sea in addition mhw frequencies and the number of mhw days are correlated with different climate variables further disclosing the underlying connections between the air and sea properties in addition to examining relationships between mhws and climate variables this paper offers a glimpse of arctic cryosphere influences on neighbouring seas at lower latitudes i e the bering sea while a number of studies in understanding marine extremes have been conducted in the recent past it is useful to note that the latest definition of mhws has been used as a key basis in this study further studies based on model experiments would be undertaken to fill in the gaps existing in the marine heatwave knowledge particularly on physical ecological impacts and geographical connections additional in situ analyses and laboratory experiments are also beneficial in understanding mhw impacts on ecosystems communities and socioeconomic services credit authorship contribution statement k s carvalho conceptualization methodology validation formal

4359,china suffers frequent and severe floods that result in significant annual casualties and economic losses however as flood vulnerability and resilience varies in different regions and periods it is vital that the temporal and spatial vulnerability and resilience characteristics are known to enable the government to make suitable arrangements for the distribution of relief funds and assist the regions to improve their disaster capabilities therefore to reveal the relative vulnerability and resilience of the research object this paper developed chinese provincial scale flood vulnerability and resilience assessment models from an input output perspective that accounted for socioeconomic flood damage flood driving and environmental factors the super efficiency data envelopment analysis method was applied to the vulnerability assessment research and the super efficiency slacks based measure data envelopment analysis method was applied to the resilience assessment research it was found that high vulnerability high resilience provinces were mainly distributed in the eastern coastal areas high vulnerability low resilience provinces were mainly concentrated around the middle reaches of the yangtze river low vulnerability high resilience provinces were mainly distributed in the western region and low vulnerability low resilience provinces were mainly in the southwest region from 2012 to 2018 the relative flood vulnerability was declining in 36 of the provinces even though they had been under pressure from rising gdp and population densities it was also found that the annual precipitation as the driving factor had a significant impact on provincial flood vulnerabilities the relative flood resilience from 2012 to 2018 was rising declining in 39 of the provinces had almost no change in 29 and was rising in only 11 which indicated that the relative flood resilience in many chinese provinces still needs to be improved with the recovery capacity of the power infrastructure in particular needing to be strengthened based on the spatiotemporal relative flood vulnerability and resilience variations in each province some flood prevention and mitigation suggestions are given keywords flood vulnerability resilience super efficiency data envelopment analysis super efficiency slacks based measure data envelopment analysis 1 introduction flooding one of the most frequent natural disasters in the world seriously affects productivity and lives and causes large economic losses and serious damage to people property and the environment ziegleret al 2012 najibi and devineni 2018 hewawasam and matsui 2020 china is one of the asian countries most afflicted with frequent and severe floods in 2018 floods in china caused 15 2 billion of direct economic and societal losses and affected 1 42 million people which account for more than 40 of all natural disaster losses ministry of emergency management of the people s republic china 2018 as reducing flood vulnerability and strengthening flood resilience are essential to reducing the impact of the flood disasters in china the flood vulnerability and resilience assessments and spatiotemporal variations analysis are vital in providing information that allows authorities to identify and develop flood mitigation plans to reduce the vulnerability and increase the flood resilience in affected regions ali et al 2020a there have been many studies on the flood disasters flood resilience analyses liao 2012 bertilsson et al 2019 flood vulnerability analyses li et al 2013 yang et al 2018 aerts et al 2014 flood risk assessment zou et al 2013 alfieri et al 2015 mojaddadi et al 2017 shen et al 2019 and flood risk management tessler et al 2015 chan et al 2018 however natural hazard resilience and vulnerability assessment research has grown in importance in the past few decades birkmann et al 2013 cutter et al 2014 saja et al 2019 resilience and vulnerability are overlapping but different concepts cutter et al 2008 aven 2011 with disaster resilience being the ability to reduce losses and quickly adapt or recover from a crisis or disaster manyena 2006 norris et al 2008 cutter et al 2008 haimes 2010 wagner and breil 2013 and vulnerability being a susceptibility to hazard events or the characteristics and circumstances of a community system or asset that make it susceptible to the damaging effects of a hazard united nations international strategy for disaster reduction 2009 in sum the vulnerability assessments focus more on exposure and possible damage to the social ecological system yang et al 2018 and the resilience assessments focus more on the ability of the system to recover and adapt cutter et al 2008 although some studies have compared and distinguished vulnerability and resilience concepts and theories few empirical studies have combined them bakkensen et al 2017 johnson et al 2020 many methods have been developed to assess flood resilience and vulnerability the primary flood vulnerability assessment methods can be grouped into the following categories disaster loss data barnard et al 2015 tanoue et al 2016 tomby and zhang 2019 vulnerability index systems chen et al 2019 and vulnerability curves shuna et al 2012 budiyono et al 2015 bivariate and statistical models sahana et al 2020 tien bui et al 2019 wang et al 2019a terme h et al 2018 ali et al 2020b machine learning algorithms bui et al 2019 wang et al 2020 shahabi et al 2020 dodangeh et al 2020 islam et al 2020 hydrological models oeurng et al 2011 getahun and gebre 2015 the primary flood resilience assessment methods can be grouped into two categories those based on resilience index systems van looy et al 2019 bertilsson et al 2019 and those based on resilience curves wang et al 2019b with all having both advantages and limitations flood vulnerability quantitative methods based on the disaster loss data bivariate and statistical models and machine learning algorithms are able to combine various data and therefore have a great deal of information about flood risk however they need very high quality data and the calculations are very complex similar to other developing countries china has a scarcity of good quality flood risk assessment data the index system based methods have been widely used in flood vulnerability and resilience assessment studies however the vulnerability indexes and weightings are complicated further these methods cannot be applied without proper indicator data and because different index systems evaluation methods and weighting methods have different evaluation results this reduces confidence as the vulnerability and resilience curve methods are respectively based on actual damage and recovery surveys they should be relatively accurate and while the methods based upon disaster loss or recovery data are relatively simple they depend on the extensive surveys that take a lot of time and resources further the vulnerability or resilience curve in one region is not necessarily applicable to other regions in addition to the methods mentioned above some recent studies have applied data envelopment analysis dea method and its mend methods to vulnerability and resilience assessments üstün 2016 dea was originally developed to measure the relative efficiencies of different decision making units dmus when the inputs and outputs were measured in their natural units ratick and osleeb 2013 since being introduced in 1978 charnes et al 1978 dea methods have been widely used for the performance efficiency measurements in banks industries companies site selections public transportation health care and education huang et al 2012 relative flood vulnerability estimation methods based on dea methods have good comparability as they take the relative efficiency of the disaster system s inputs and outputs into account and are able to give diverse but consistent analyses over time therefore dea methods are able to compare disaster situations across different spatial and time domains and overcome the subjectivity found in flood vulnerability weighting systems the application of the dea method and its mend methods to natural hazard analysis however is still in its early stage huang et al 2012 at present only a few studies have used these methods such as dea super efficiency dea and network dea ndea to evaluate disaster vulnerabilities or resilience figs 1 and 2 summarize the recent studies on the disaster vulnerability and resilience assessments on typhoons earthquakes geological disasters floods and droughts that have used dea methods hou et al 2016 huang et al 2012 li et al 2013 2015 liu et al 2018 üstün 2016 villano et al 2020 yu et al 2019 yuan et al 2015 however the flood focused research has been mainly focused on flood vulnerability with few studies considering dynamic vulnerability or resilience changes therefore further study is needed on flood resilience evaluations most studies have also ignored the role of the disaster driver and environmental factors that is when the disaster outcomes and losses are the same but the disaster driving factors and environmental factors are different the flood vulnerabilities are different based on the considerations above this paper aims to develop flood vulnerability and resilience assessing models from an input output perspective which considers the disaster driver and environmental factors in it and to evaluate the relative flood vulnerability and resilience objectively in 28 chinese provinces using a super efficiency dea model and a super efficiency slacks based measure dea super efficiency sbm dea model the novelties in this study are as follows 1 unlike previous papers one of the main novelties in this paper is the consideration of both vulnerability and resilience in the study of flood disaster in china this paper also considers the regional differences and the dynamic flood vulnerability and resilience changes in 28 chinese provinces 2 the model proposed in this paper present a new method for the flood vulnerability and resilience assessment this paper is the first to apply a super efficiency sbm dea model to resilience assessment research and to establish flood vulnerability and resilience assessment models from an input output perspective that directly reveal the relative vulnerability and resilience of the research object which is not possible using traditional methods 3 flood disaster drivers and environmental factors are added to the model inputs for the relative flood vulnerability and resilience evaluation therefore as the resilience and vulnerability assessment results consider the influence of the driving factors and environment the results are more accurate and equitable the goal of this paper is to apply the super efficiency dea model and the super efficiency sbm dea model to disaster vulnerability and resilience assessment and distinguish the regions with high flood vulnerability or low flood resilience in the studied area the research results and analysis will provide a scientific basis for regional disaster relief and mitigation planning the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 proposes the flood vulnerability and resilience system section 3 introduces the super efficiency dea and sbm dea method section 4 gives the results for the flood vulnerability and resilience in 28 chinese provinces from 2012 to 2018 section 5 discusses the results and section 6 concludes the study 2 flood vulnerability and resilience system 2 1 flood disaster system a flood disaster system is composed of the disaster drivers the disaster environment the disaster bearers the disaster intensity and the disaster recovery in detail the disaster drivers are the physical earth processes that threaten life and can cause flood disasters such as precipitation the disaster environment is related to the physical environment conditions that aggravate or decrease the effects of hazards such as lakes vegetation slope elevation and soil liu et al 2019 yao et al 2020 and the disaster bearers are all the human activities affected by the floods population agriculture and economy these three flood disaster components the disaster drivers the disaster environment the disaster bearers together result in flood losses which is the disaster intensity and generally includes the social and economic losses the disaster recovery refers to the post flood disaster social and economic recovery processes therefore there is no simple linear function between the disaster drivers the disaster environment the disaster bearer the disaster intensity or the disaster recovery li et al 2013 2 2 input output relationship in a flood system if the flood disaster occurrence process in each region is viewed as an input output system then to determine the input and output variables the generation mechanism and the factors that produce the disaster losses need to be analyzed from which a preliminary flood vulnerability and resilience assessment can be made figs 3 and 4 in other words the flood disaster density with the social economic and agricultural losses as the output factors is the product of the interactions between the regional disaster factors that is the disaster drivers the disaster environment and the disaster bearer factors the relative flood disaster system vulnerability therefore can be determined from the relative efficiency of the multiple inputs the disaster drivers the disaster environment the disaster bearers and outputs the disaster intensity the relative flood disaster system resilience similarly can be determined from the relative efficiency of the multiple inputs the disaster drivers the disaster environment the disaster bearers and outputs the disaster intensity the disaster recovery when a certain region produces relatively more output with relatively less input the vulnerability is high li et al 2013 that is it indicates that under the same disaster drivers environment and bearers the greater the disaster losses are in this region the higher the vulnerability to flood disaster in other words the higher the input output efficiency the higher the regional vulnerability similarly under the same disaster drivers environment and bearers the less the disaster losses the better the disaster recovery in this region and the higher the regional flood resilience if the disaster losses are regarded as unexpected output and the disaster recovery is regarded as expected output the higher the input desirable and undesirable output efficiency the higher the regional resilience 2 3 indicator system for the flood vulnerability and resilience evaluations the index system for the flood vulnerability and resilience evaluations needs to reflect the actual conditions and the flood disaster essentials as floods generally occur in seasons that have more rainfall the flood disaster driver index would include the flood season precipitation pearson s correlation calculations found that the correlation between annual precipitation and flood season precipitation in china was 0 97 which was a strong correlation because of the lack of flood season precipitation data in some provinces annual precipitation was used in this study the geographical environment heavily affects the occurrence of flood disasters for example the presence of forests and lakes could reduce flood severity liu et al 2019 yao et al 2020 more specifically forest areas could reduce runoff and lakes could hold water both of which could reduce peak flood flow farley et al 2005 liu et al 2019 yao et al 2020 therefore the flood disaster environment indicators were forest coverage and water storage per unit area although slope elevation and soil are also important flood disaster environment factors the relationships between these and flood disasters are very complicated therefore these factors were not considered populations the economy and agriculture are the main flood disaster bearer indicators therefore population density economic density and agricultural crop sown area density were taken as the indicators flood disaster intensity was measured with three indicators direct economic loss density human casualties density and crop area disaster affected density as electricity is an important basic resource for life the restoration of power is an important flood recovery aspect further as floods generally cause heavy crop losses and farmers need to resume farming to make up for the losses the proportion of restored farmland can also reflect flood recovery therefore the flood disaster recovery indicators were power restoration and agricultural rehabilitation based on the above analysis these indices were used to analyze the flood vulnerability and resilience in 28 chinese provinces tables 1 and 2 and the descriptions of these indicators for the flood vulnerability and resilience evaluations are as follows the actual conditions and the flood disaster essentials annual precipitation refers to the depth at which liquid or solid after melting water falls from the sky to earth during the year and accumulates on the horizontal surface without evaporation infiltration or loss forest coverage refers to the percentage of forest area in the total land area water storage per unit area refers to the surface water and underground water per unit area population density refers to the number of people living per unit area of land economic density refers to the gross domestic product gdp per unit area of land agricultural crop sown area density refers to the agricultural crop sown area per unit area of land direct economic losses density refer to the economic loss directly caused by the flood disaster per unit area of land human casualties density refer to the number of human casualties caused by the flood disaster per unit area of land crop area disaster affected density refers to the sown area where the actual crop yield has decreased by more than 30 percent compared with the annual yield caused by the flood disaster per unit area of land power restoration refers to the time it takes for people to resume their normal life and production agricultural rehabilitation refers to the proportion of the crop area that is restored and sown in the crop disaster area some indicator data were indirectly calculated from raw data table 3 lists the indicator data calculations in table 3 crop failure area refers to the sown area where the actual crop yield has decreased by more than 80 percent including 80 compared with the annual yield caused by the flood disaster 3 data and methods 3 1 data sources this study aimed to investigate the vulnerability and resilience to floods from a regional macro perspective from 2012 to 2018 with the chinese provinces being the decision making units dmu due to a lack of index data from beijing tianjin shanghai hong kong macau and taiwan these provinces municipalities were excluded from the study area therefore 28 provinces he nan tibet shanxi zhejiang jiangxi guangxi chongqing guizhou shaanxi ningxia sichuan yunnan jilin hainan jiangsu hebei inner mongolia liaoning heilongjiang shandong gansu qinghai anhui fujian hubei hu nan guangdong and xinjiang were selected as the study objects the annual precipitation direct economic losses human casualties and crop area disaster affected data were extracted from china flood and drought disaster bulletins ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2012 2018 the average power outage time data in each province were extracted from the national power reliability annual report national energy administration 2012 2017 national energy administration 2018 the total population gdp administrative area forest coverage and total water resources data were extracted from the china statistical yearbooks national bureau of statistics 2012 2018 and the total crop sown area and the crop failure area data were extracted from the china agricultural yearbook china agricultural yearbook editorial board 2012 2018 3 2 data processing when calculating flood vulnerability the greater the forest coverage and water storage per unit area the higher the regional vulnerability when all other variables are equal however in the super efficiency dea model the greater the input the lower the efficiency when all other variables are equal therefore it was necessary to use a min max standardized method to process these two variables as negative indicators when calculating flood resilience the greater the annual precipitation population density economic density and the agricultural crop sown area density the higher the regional resilience when all other variables are equal however in the super efficiency sbm dea model the greater the input the lower the efficiency when all other variables are equal therefore it was necessary to use a min max standardized method to process these four variables as negative indicators the average power outage time was used to indirectly express power restoration with the longer the average power outage the slower the power restoration therefore it was necessary to use the min max standardized method to process the average power outage time as a negative indicator the super efficiency dea model and super efficiency sbm dea model are applicable to the case that the index data in the input output model is not equal to 0 otherwise it does not conform to the input output principle of production economics specifically when the model selects the input angle the output data in the model is allowed to be 0 but the input data in the model is not allowed to be 0 when the model selects the output angle the input data in the model is allowed to be 0 and the output data in the model is not allowed to be 0 these two models in this paper are output oriented therefore in order to prevent the normalized index value from being 0 the min max normalization method is adopted in this study formula 1 is the standardized processing formula for the negative indicators 1 y ij 0 1 0 9 max x ij x ij max x ij min x ij where x ij is set as the j th index for the i th province and y ij is the standardized value for x ij 3 3 method 3 3 1 super efficiency dea model a traditional dea method was used to evaluate the relative efficiency of multiple units the basic principle behind this method is to set the evaluated units as dmus with each dmu sharing the same multiple inputs and outputs the efficiency value was obtained by estimating the stochastic frontier of the effective production for each dmu xue and harker 2002 however traditional dea method fail to distinguish the dmus with the highest efficiency values of 1 therefore to overcome this problem the super efficiency dea model was proposed which is shown in formula 2 xue and harker 2002 in the flood vulnerability input output model the flood disaster drivers flood disaster environment and flood disaster bearers were the inputs and the flood disaster intensity was the desirable output the super efficiency dea model was then used to calculate the relative flood vulnerability in the 28 chinese provinces from 2012 to 2018 2 min θ s t j 1 j j 0 n x ij λ j x i j 0 j 1 j j 0 n y rj λ j θ y r j 0 j 1 j j 0 n λ j 1 λ j 0 i 1 2 3

the j th dmu y rj is the r th output index value for the j th dmu and λ j is the variable coefficient for the j th dmu θ 0 1 and when θ 1 the dmu input output level is at optimal efficiency otherwise it is not at optimal efficiency inputs and outputs in this model are listed in table 1 and dmus are listed in section 3 1 of the paper 3 3 2 super efficiency sbm dea model to effectively solve the problems caused by the radial angle of traditional dea methods tone 2001 proposed a non radial non angle sbm model that introduced input and output slack variables subsequently tone 2004 comprehensively considered an undesirable output indicator and proposed an sbm model that considered undesirable output in the undesirable output sbm model there was a case where the decision units were 1 at the same time which was not conducive to decision unit comparisons made it impossible to accurately sort the decision unit results therefore tone 2002 revised the slack variables and proposed the super efficient sbm model which is shown in formula 3 in sum the advantage of this model is that it combines the advantages of the super efficiency dea model and the sbm model by considering the undesirable output and revising the slack variables in the flood resilience input output model the flood disaster drivers flood disaster environment and flood disaster bearers were the inputs the flood disaster intensity was the undesirable output and the flood disaster recovery was the desirable output therefore the super efficiency sbm dea model was used to calculate the relative flood resilience in 28 chinese provinces from 2012 to 2018 3 min δ min 1 1 m i 1 m s i x i j 0 1 1 q 1 q 2 r 1 q 1 s r y r j 0 t 1 q 2 s t b b t j 0 s t j 1 j k n x ij λ j s i x i j 0 j 1 j j 0 n y rj

i th input index the slack variables for the r th desirable output index and surplus variables for the t th undesirable output index δ 0 1 and δ 1 indicate that the dmu input output is at optimal efficiency otherwise it is not at optimal efficiency level the inputs and outputs in this model are listed in table 2 and the dmus are listed in section 3 1 of the paper because the maxdea software used to calculate dea methods is already very mature this study used this software for the calculations 4 results 4 1 flood vulnerability 4 1 1 spatial relative vulnerability distribution the overall flood relative vulnerability map is shown in fig 5 from which it can be seen that the flood disaster vulnerabilities in eastern and central china were generally higher than in western china there are three main reasons for this eastern and central china have a summer monsoon climate at which time there is high precipitation there is a primarily plain terrain in these areas so it is prone to flooding and the eastern region has high economic development levels dense populations and a great deal of cultivated land which means that there are greater losses in summary the high flood disaster drivers high flood disaster bearers and high flood disaster intensities in eastern and central china mean that these areas have high flood vulnerability compared with western china therefore the key targets for flood prevention in china are still the eastern and central provinces however there were a few special cases in the other regions for example shanxi shaanxi he nan liaoning and jiangsu in the eastern or central regions were found to be relatively less vulnerable with shanxi shaanxi he nan and liaoning in particular having low flood disaster intensities while jiangsu had high population economic and agricultural crop sown area densities its direct economic loss density was low and although jiangxi has a high crop area disaster affected density its vulnerability was relatively low due to its extremely high precipitation 4 1 2 overview of the relative vulnerability changes fig 6 shows the chinese provincial relative flood vulnerability changes from 2012 to 2018 and table 4 gives a detailed analysis of the relative flood vulnerabilities in the 28 chinese provinces overall from 2012 to 2018 36 of the provinces were declining and only 7 were increasing which indicated that the ability to respond to floods in most provinces was improving however although the southern region forest coverage improved most provinces were facing pressure from rising gdps and population densities it was also found that the annual precipitation as the driving factor had a significant impact on the flood vulnerabilities of provinces 4 2 flood resilience 4 2 1 spatial distribution of relative resilience as can be seen in fig 7 the northwest inland and eastern coastal provinces were found to have higher relative resilience in eastern coastal provinces such as jiangsu fujian guangdong shandong and hainan there is more annual precipitation and higher flood disaster bearer density however while the forest coverage rate the water storage per unit area and flood disaster intensities are low the power restoration is relatively fast therefore these provinces had high flood resilience xinjiang qinghai and tibet in the inland northwest had slow power restoration and extremely low forest coverage rates however as the annual precipitation water storage per unit area flood disaster bearer density and flood disaster intensity were also extremely low they also had high flood resilience the provinces in the central southwest and northeast regions had relatively low flood resilience the central region provinces hubei hu nan anhui and shaanxi all had high agricultural crop sown areas crop area disaster affected and human casualties density but power restoration levels that were slightly higher than average therefore these provinces need to improve their agriculture and population abilities to cope with floods the southwest region provinces chongqing guizhou sichuan yunnan and guangxi had high forest coverage and high water storage per unit area and except for chongqing had low economic direct economic loss and crop area disaster affected densities and the power restoration abilities in guizhou yunnan and guangxi in particular were relatively slow therefore these provinces need to improve their abilities to recover from floods the northeast provinces of jilin and heilongjiang had slower agricultural rehabilitation lower annual precipitation and water storage per unit area higher forest coverage and lower than average economic population and flood disaster intensities therefore these provinces need to strengthen their agricultural rehabilitation capabilities in sum the key targets for flood prevention in china are still the eastern and central provinces 4 2 2 overview of the relative resilience changes fig 8 shows the changes in the provincial relative flood resilience in china from 2012 to 2018 and table 5 gives a detailed analysis of the relative flood resilience in the chinese provinces overall 39 of the provinces were rising declining 29 had almost no change and only 11 had a rising relative flood resilience which indicated that the relative flood resilience in various provinces in china still needs to be improved with the recovery capacity of the power infrastructure in particular needing to be strengthened 4 3 flood vulnerability resilience matrix analysis as can be seen in fig 9 the provinces such as shandong fujian and guangdong that had a high vulnerability and high resilience were mainly from the eastern coastal area the provinces with high vulnerability and low resilience were mainly from the middle reaches of the yangtze river chongqing hubei anhui hu nan and jiangxi the provinces with low vulnerability and high resilience ningxia qinghai and tibet were mainly distributed in the western region and the provinces with low vulnerability and low resilience guangxi yunnan sichuan jilin and guizhou were in the southwest region therefore the key targets for flood prevention in china are the eastern and central provinces 5 discussion flood vulnerability and resilience assessment models were developed from an input output perspective and super efficiency dea and super efficiency sbm dea methods used to evaluate the relative flood vulnerabilities and resilience in 28 chinese provinces from 2012 to 2018 first this was the first paper to apply a super efficiency sbm dea model to resilience assessment research second the impact of the flood disaster drivers and disaster environment on the relative flood vulnerability and resilience was considered third this study analyzed the vulnerability and resilience in 28 chinese provinces from a relative perspective that is when constructing the flood resilience and vulnerability evaluation index systems density was used to measure the indexes the positive and negative indicators were also distinguished and the negative indicator data processed to ensure more accurate and fair evaluation results huang et al 2012 analyzed the exposed population economy and agricultural crop sown area as well as the vulnerabilities of the population and economy to floods based on socio economic data set on chinese historical flood losses during the period 1984 2012 and the vulnerabilities were divided into four grades according to the mean and standard deviation of classification statistics we used this classification method to classify the results of 28 provinces in our research and then we compared the classification results with those of huang et al 2012 it was found that there was about 75 similarity specifically the classifications of inner mongolia hu nan guangxi sichuan he nan shaanxi and xinjiang were different in these two research results there are two possible reasons for the differences on the one hand the research time ranges of the two are different one is from 1984 to 2012 and the other is from 2012 to 2018 the flood vulnerability of various provinces is constantly changing with the development of social economy and environmental changes so the results are inconsistent on the other hand the two consider different factors so the results are different the relative flood vulnerability assessment model established in this paper takes into account flood disaster drivers flood disaster environment flood disaster bearers and flood disaster intensity however the flood vulnerability assessment model established by huang et al 2012 only considered population exposure and economic exposure and disaster losses we conducted an in depth analysis of the flood vulnerabilities in those 7 provinces as follows firstly according to our results the flood vulnerabilities in inner mongolia and hu nan were on a high level while in the huang et al 2012 s research the flood vulnerability in inner mongolia was on a medium level and hu nan on the other hand was on a much more higher level the average vulnerability in inner mongolia from 2015 to 2017 was 0 221 which was on a medium level however the annual precipitation in inner mongolia exceeded 300 mm in 2012 2013 and 2018 leading to a sharp increase in direct economic losses density human casualties density and agricultural crop sown area density therefore the vulnerabilities in these three years were on a very high level which raised the average vulnerability in inner mongolia to a high level from 2012 to 2018 in addition wang et al 2020a analyzed the spatial distribution of typical natural disaster vulnerability in china from 2010 to 2017 and classified the flood vulnerability into five categories using natural breaks hierarchical clustering his research results showed that the flood vulnerability in inner mongolia was also on a high level the annual precipitation in hu nan in 2018 was almost the same as in 2013 but the density of direct economic losses human casualties and agricultural crop sown area areas were only about 19 23 and 29 of those in 2013 therefore the flood vulnerability in hunan in 2018 was on a low level which lowered the flood vulnerability level in hu nan secondly according to our result the flood vulnerabilities in sichuan he nan and guangxi were on a medium level while in huang et al 2012 s research the flood vulnerabilities in sichuan and he nan varies to a high level and that of guangxi on the other hand varies to a much more higher one regarding sichuan its flood vulnerability was on a very high level in 2012 however in the following six years its economic density and population density increased year by year while the direct economic losses density human casualties density and crop area disaster affected density were significantly reduced therefore the flood vulnerability in sichuan was on a low level from 2013 to 2018 which led to its flood vulnerability from 2012 to 2018 was on a medium level regarding he nan its precipitation has been gradually decreasing in the past 50 years wang 2005 for example the average annual precipitation in he nan from 1971 to 2000 was 734 5 mm while the average annual precipitation from 2012 to 2018 was 712 mm in addition the direct economic losses density human casualties density and crop area disaster affected density were decreasing while the population density economic density and agricultural crop sown area density in he nan were gradually increasing as a result the vulnerability to floods was on a medium level rather than a high level regarding guangxi from 2012 to 2018 the direct economic losses density human casualties density and crop area disaster affected density were gradually decreasing while the economic density and population density were increasing year by year therefore the flood vulnerability in guangxi has gradually decreased leading the flood vulnerability in guangxi to a medium level lastly according to our result the flood vulnerabilities in shaanxi and xinjiang were on a low level while in the huang et al 2012 s research the flood vulnerabilities in these two provinces were on a medium level regarding shaanxi from 1978 to 2011 the severity of floods in shaanxi was decreasing konget al 2015 however from 2012 to 2018 shaanxi s annual precipitation increased slightly and the economic density increased by 66 while the flood disaster intensity were relatively small leading its flood vulnerability to a low level regarding xinjiang from 1984 to 2012 the floods in 1999 2007 and 2009 were extremely severe wang et al 2020b so its vulnerability during this period was on a moderate level however from 2012 to 2018 the flood disaster density in xinjiang was on a low level so the vulnerability was on a low level wang et al 2020a found the flood vulnerability in xinjiang was also on a low level this study analyzed the spatial and temporal flood vulnerability and resilience characteristics in 28 chinese provinces which revealed that areas with low vulnerabilities did not necessarily have high resilience that is there was no strong correlation between flood vulnerability and resilience however both flood vulnerability and resilience should be accounted for when formulating flood response measures as most chinese provinces have high economic growth and rising population densities more attention needs to be paid to provinces cities that have a high population and economic densities when developing flood control policies further as people depend on electricity when the power is cut it can significantly affect production and life therefore reducing power infrastructure vulnerabilities and accelerating power infrastructure recovery speeds can assist in flood recovery the vulnerability and resilience flood assessment indicator system established in this paper are simple and the models easily operated therefore assessment methods based on super efficiency dea and super efficiency sbm dea such as those used in this paper could have a high level of transferability to vulnerability and resilience analyses of other disaster types the comparison of the vulnerability and resilience regional and temporal variabilities allowed for the identification of the appropriate actions to be taken to reduce the vulnerabilities and enhance the resilience before any potential damage is realized compared with previous research that only used indicator comprehensive weighted methods as an integrated measure the proposed method based on dea methods eliminated the subjectivity of a priori weighting and was better able to estimate the relative vulnerability and resilience to floods however the calculation of the relative flood vulnerability and resilience estimation was complex therefore it is very important to establish a scientific assessment method as this paper only conducted a preliminary assessment of this new approach for the evaluation of relative flood vulnerability and resilience estimation there still are many questions that need further study for example due to the many provinces include and the long duration studied in this paper not all the necessary data were available such as slope elevation soil flood recovery time and agricultural recovery time while attempts were made to determine this data from news texts due to the lack of flood related news before 2014 the indicator data could not be directly obtained which meant that the power restoration and agricultural rehabilitation were calculated indirectly because of this difficulty in obtaining data only electricity and agriculture were considered in this paper and transportation and economic recovery were not 6 conclusions based on a flood disaster system analysis a flood vulnerability assessment model based on super efficiency dea and a flood resilience assessment model based on a super efficiency sbm dea were developed to assess china s provinces which provide a new way for the flood vulnerability and resilience assessment then based on environmental data flood damage data and physical and socioeconomic statistical data from 28 chinese provinces from 2012 to 2018 the flood vulnerabilities and flood resilience were calculated across multiple periods from which the following conclusions were drawn 1 the flood vulnerabilities in eastern and central china were generally higher than in western china the eastern coastal and northwest inland provinces had high flood resilience and the central southwest and northeast provinces had low flood resilience therefore the provinces with high vulnerability and high resilience were mainly in the eastern coastal area the provinces with high vulnerability and low resilience were mainly the middle reaches of the yangtze river the provinces with low vulnerability and high resilience were mainly in the western region and the provinces with low vulnerability and low resilience were mainly in the southwest 2 from 2012 to 2018 the relative flood vulnerabilities in 36 of the provinces were declining and only 7 were increasing which indicated that most provinces had improved their vulnerabilities however although the forest coverage in the southern provinces had increased most provinces were facing pressure from rising gdp and population densities it was also found that the annual precipitation as the driving factor had a significant impact on the flood vulnerabilities of provinces from 2012 to 2018 the relative flood resilience in 39 of the provinces was rising declining in 29 had almost no change and in only 11 was rising which showed that the relative flood resilience in the various chinese provinces still needed to be improved with the recovery capacity of the power infrastructure in particular needing to be strengthened credit authorship contribution statement yuying yang conceptualization methodology data curation writing original draft

4359,china suffers frequent and severe floods that result in significant annual casualties and economic losses however as flood vulnerability and resilience varies in different regions and periods it is vital that the temporal and spatial vulnerability and resilience characteristics are known to enable the government to make suitable arrangements for the distribution of relief funds and assist the regions to improve their disaster capabilities therefore to reveal the relative vulnerability and resilience of the research object this paper developed chinese provincial scale flood vulnerability and resilience assessment models from an input output perspective that accounted for socioeconomic flood damage flood driving and environmental factors the super efficiency data envelopment analysis method was applied to the vulnerability assessment research and the super efficiency slacks based measure data envelopment analysis method was applied to the resilience assessment research it was found that high vulnerability high resilience provinces were mainly distributed in the eastern coastal areas high vulnerability low resilience provinces were mainly concentrated around the middle reaches of the yangtze river low vulnerability high resilience provinces were mainly distributed in the western region and low vulnerability low resilience provinces were mainly in the southwest region from 2012 to 2018 the relative flood vulnerability was declining in 36 of the provinces even though they had been under pressure from rising gdp and population densities it was also found that the annual precipitation as the driving factor had a significant impact on provincial flood vulnerabilities the relative flood resilience from 2012 to 2018 was rising declining in 39 of the provinces had almost no change in 29 and was rising in only 11 which indicated that the relative flood resilience in many chinese provinces still needs to be improved with the recovery capacity of the power infrastructure in particular needing to be strengthened based on the spatiotemporal relative flood vulnerability and resilience variations in each province some flood prevention and mitigation suggestions are given keywords flood vulnerability resilience super efficiency data envelopment analysis super efficiency slacks based measure data envelopment analysis 1 introduction flooding one of the most frequent natural disasters in the world seriously affects productivity and lives and causes large economic losses and serious damage to people property and the environment ziegleret al 2012 najibi and devineni 2018 hewawasam and matsui 2020 china is one of the asian countries most afflicted with frequent and severe floods in 2018 floods in china caused 15 2 billion of direct economic and societal losses and affected 1 42 million people which account for more than 40 of all natural disaster losses ministry of emergency management of the people s republic china 2018 as reducing flood vulnerability and strengthening flood resilience are essential to reducing the impact of the flood disasters in china the flood vulnerability and resilience assessments and spatiotemporal variations analysis are vital in providing information that allows authorities to identify and develop flood mitigation plans to reduce the vulnerability and increase the flood resilience in affected regions ali

concepts cutter et al 2008 aven 2011 with disaster resilience being the ability to reduce losses and quickly adapt or recover from a crisis or disaster manyena 2006 norris et al 2008 cutter et al 2008 haimes 2010 wagner and breil 2013 and vulnerability being a susceptibility to hazard events or the characteristics and circumstances of a community system or asset that make it susceptible to the damaging effects of a hazard united nations international strategy for disaster reduction 2009 in sum the vulnerability assessments focus more on exposure and possible damage to the social ecological system yang et al 2018 and the resilience assessments focus more on the ability of the system to recover and adapt cutter et al 2008 although some studies have compared and distinguished vulnerability and resilience concepts and theories few empirical studies have combined them bakkensen et al 2017 johnson et al 2020 many methods have been developed to assess flood resilience and vulnerability the primary flood vulnerability assessment methods can be grouped into the following categories disaster loss data barnard et al 2015 tanoue et al 2016 tomby and zhang 2019 vulnerability index systems chen et al 2019 and vulnerability curves shuna et al 2012 budiyono et al 2015 bivariate and statistical models sahana et al 2020 tien bui et al 2019 wang et al 2019a terme h et al 2018 ali et al 2020b machine learning algorithms bui et al 2019 wang et al 2020 shahabi et al 2020 dodangeh et al 2020 islam et al 2020 hydrological models oeurng et al 2011 getahun and gebre 2015 the primary flood resilience assessment methods can be grouped into two categories those based on resilience index systems van looy et al 2019 bertilsson et al 2019 and those based on resilience curves wang et al 2019b with all having both advantages and limitations flood vulnerability quantitative methods based on the disaster loss data bivariate and statistical models and machine learning algorithms are able to combine various data and therefore have a great deal of information about flood risk however they need very high quality data and the calculations are very complex similar to other developing countries china has a scarcity of good quality flood risk assessment data the index system based methods have been widely used in flood vulnerability and resilience assessment studies however the vulnerability indexes and weightings are complicated further these methods cannot be applied without proper indicator data and because different index systems evaluation methods and weighting methods have different evaluation results this reduces confidence as the vulnerability and resilience curve methods are respectively based on actual damage and recovery surveys they should be relatively accurate and while the methods based upon disaster loss or recovery data are relatively simple they depend on the extensive surveys that take a lot of time and resources further the vulnerability or resilience curve in one region is not necessarily applicable to other regions in addition to the methods mentioned above some recent studies have applied data envelopment analysis dea method and its mend methods to vulnerability and resilience assessments üstün 2016 dea was originally developed to measure the relative efficiencies of different decision making units dmus when the inputs and outputs were measured in their natural units ratick and osleeb 2013 since being introduced in 1978 charnes et al 1978 dea methods have been widely used for the performance efficiency measurements in banks industries companies site selections public transportation health care and education huang et al 2012 relative flood vulnerability estimation methods based on dea methods have good comparability as they take the relative efficiency of the disaster system s inputs and outputs into account and are able to give diverse but consistent analyses over time therefore dea methods are able to compare disaster situations across different spatial and time domains and overcome the subjectivity found in flood vulnerability weighting systems the application of the dea method and its mend methods to natural hazard analysis however is still in its early stage huang et al 2012 at present only a few studies have used these methods such as dea super efficiency dea and network dea ndea to evaluate disaster vulnerabilities or resilience figs 1 and 2 summarize the recent studies on the disaster vulnerability and resilience assessments on typhoons earthquakes geological disasters floods and droughts that have used dea methods hou et al 2016 huang et al 2012 li et al 2013 2015 liu et al 2018 üstün 2016 villano et al 2020 yu et al 2019 yuan et al 2015 however the flood focused research has been mainly focused on flood vulnerability with few studies considering dynamic vulnerability or resilience changes therefore further study is needed on flood resilience evaluations most studies have also ignored the role of the disaster driver and environmental factors that is when the disaster outcomes and losses are the same but the disaster driving factors and environmental factors are different the flood vulnerabilities are different based on the considerations above this paper aims to develop flood vulnerability and resilience assessing models from an input output perspective which considers the disaster driver and environmental factors in it and to evaluate the relative flood vulnerability and resilience objectively in 28 chinese provinces using a super efficiency dea model and a super efficiency slacks based measure dea super efficiency sbm dea model the novelties in this study are as follows 1 unlike previous papers one of the main novelties in this paper is the consideration of both vulnerability and resilience in the study of flood disaster in china this paper also considers the regional differences and the dynamic flood vulnerability and resilience changes in 28 chinese provinces 2 the model proposed in this paper present a new method for the flood vulnerability and resilience assessment this paper is the first to apply a super efficiency sbm dea model to resilience assessment research and to establish flood vulnerability and resilience assessment models from an input output perspective that directly reveal the relative vulnerability and resilience of the research object which is not possible using traditional methods 3 flood disaster drivers and environmental factors are added to the model inputs for the relative flood vulnerability and resilience evaluation therefore as the resilience and vulnerability assessment results consider the influence of the driving factors and environment the results are more accurate and equitable the goal of this paper is to apply the super efficiency dea model and the super efficiency sbm dea model to disaster vulnerability and resilience assessment and distinguish the regions with high flood vulnerability or low flood resilience in the studied area the research results and analysis will provide a scientific basis for regional disaster relief and mitigation planning the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 proposes the flood vulnerability and resilience system section 3 introduces the super efficiency dea and sbm dea method section 4 gives the results for the flood vulnerability and resilience in 28 chinese provinces from 2012 to 2018 section 5 discusses the results and section 6 concludes the study 2 flood vulnerability and resilience system 2 1 flood disaster system a flood disaster system is composed of the disaster drivers the disaster environment the disaster bearers the disaster intensity and the disaster recovery in detail the disaster drivers are the physical earth processes that threaten life and can cause flood disasters such as precipitation the disaster environment is related to the physical environment conditions that aggravate or decrease the effects of hazards such as lakes vegetation slope elevation and soil liu et al 2019 yao et al 2020 and the disaster bearers are all the human activities affected by the floods population agriculture and economy these three flood disaster components the disaster drivers the disaster environment the disaster bearers together result in flood losses which is the disaster intensity and generally includes the social and economic losses the disaster recovery refers to the post flood disaster social and economic recovery processes therefore there is no simple linear function between the disaster drivers the disaster environment the disaster bearer the disaster intensity or the disaster recovery li et al 2013 2 2 input output relationship in a flood system if the flood disaster occurrence process in each region is viewed as an input output system then to determine the input and output variables the generation mechanism and the factors that produce the disaster losses need to be analyzed from which a preliminary flood vulnerability and resilience assessment can be made figs 3 and 4 in other words the flood disaster density with the social economic and agricultural losses as the output factors is the product of the interactions between the regional disaster factors that is the disaster drivers the disaster environment and the disaster bearer factors the relative flood disaster system vulnerability therefore can be determined from the relative efficiency of the multiple inputs the disaster drivers the disaster environment the disaster bearers and outputs the disaster intensity the relative flood disaster system resilience similarly can be determined from the relative efficiency of the multiple inputs the disaster drivers the disaster environment the disaster bearers and outputs the disaster intensity the disaster recovery when a certain region produces relatively more output with relatively less input the vulnerability is high li et al 2013 that is it indicates that under the same disaster drivers environment and bearers the greater the disaster losses are in this region the higher the vulnerability to flood disaster in other words the higher the input output efficiency the higher the regional vulnerability similarly under the same disaster drivers environment and bearers the less the disaster losses the better the disaster recovery in this region and the higher the regional flood resilience if the disaster losses are regarded as unexpected output and the disaster recovery is regarded as expected output the higher the input desirable and undesirable output efficiency the higher the regional resilience 2 3 indicator system for the flood vulnerability and resilience evaluations the index system for the flood vulnerability and resilience evaluations needs to reflect the actual conditions and the flood disaster essentials as floods generally occur in seasons that have more rainfall the flood disaster driver index would include the flood season precipitation pearson s correlation calculations found that the correlation between annual precipitation and flood season precipitation in china was 0 97 which was a strong correlation because of the lack of flood season precipitation data in some provinces annual precipitation was used in this study the geographical environment heavily affects the occurrence of flood disasters for example the presence of forests and lakes could reduce flood severity liu et al 2019 yao et al 2020 more specifically forest areas could reduce runoff and lakes could hold water both of which could reduce peak flood flow farley et al 2005 liu et al 2019 yao et al 2020 therefore the flood disaster environment indicators were forest coverage and water storage per unit area although slope elevation and soil are also important flood disaster environment factors the relationships between these and flood disasters are very complicated therefore these factors were not considered populations the economy and agriculture are the main flood disaster bearer indicators therefore population density economic density and agricultural crop sown area density were taken as the indicators flood disaster intensity was measured with three indicators direct economic loss density human casualties density and crop area disaster affected density as electricity is an important basic resource for life the restoration of power is an important flood recovery aspect further as floods generally cause heavy crop losses and farmers need to resume farming to make up for the losses the proportion of restored farmland can also reflect flood recovery therefore the flood disaster recovery indicators were power restoration and agricultural rehabilitation based on the above analysis these indices were used to analyze the flood vulnerability and resilience in 28 chinese provinces tables 1 and 2 and the descriptions of these indicators for the flood vulnerability and resilience evaluations are as follows the actual conditions and the flood disaster essentials annual precipitation refers to the depth at which liquid or solid after melting water falls from the sky to earth during the year and accumulates on the horizontal surface without evaporation infiltration or loss forest coverage refers to the percentage of forest area in the total land area water storage per unit area refers to the surface water and underground water per unit area population density refers to the number of people living per unit area of land economic density refers to the gross domestic product gdp per unit area of land agricultural crop sown area density refers to the agricultural crop sown area per unit area of land direct economic losses density refer to the economic loss directly caused by the flood disaster per unit area of land human casualties density refer to the number of human casualties caused by the flood disaster per unit area of land crop area disaster affected density refers to the sown area where the actual crop yield has decreased by more than 30 percent compared with the annual yield caused by the flood disaster per unit area of land power restoration refers to the time it takes for people to resume their normal life and production agricultural rehabilitation refers to the proportion of the crop area that is restored and sown in the crop disaster area some indicator data were indirectly calculated from raw data table 3 lists the indicator data calculations in table 3 crop failure area refers to the sown area where the actual crop yield has decreased by more than 80 percent including 80 compared with the annual yield caused by the flood disaster 3 data and methods 3 1 data sources this study aimed to investigate the vulnerability and resilience to floods from a regional macro perspective from 2012 to 2018 with the chinese provinces being the decision making units dmu due to a lack of index data from beijing tianjin shanghai hong kong macau and taiwan these provinces municipalities were excluded from the study area therefore 28 provinces he nan tibet shanxi zhejiang jiangxi guangxi chongqing guizhou shaanxi ningxia sichuan yunnan jilin hainan jiangsu hebei inner mongolia liaoning heilongjiang shandong gansu qinghai anhui fujian hubei hu nan guangdong and xinjiang were selected as the study objects the annual precipitation direct economic losses human casualties and crop area disaster affected data were extracted from china flood and drought disaster bulletins ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2012 2018 the average power outage time data in each province were extracted from the national power reliability annual report national energy administration 2012 2017 national energy administration 2018 the total population gdp administrative area forest coverage and total water resources data were extracted from the china statistical yearbooks national bureau of statistics 2012 2018 and the total crop sown area and the crop failure area data were extracted from the china agricultural yearbook china agricultural yearbook editorial board 2012 2018 3 2 data processing when calculating flood vulnerability the greater the forest coverage and water storage per unit area the higher the regional vulnerability when all other variables are equal however in the super efficiency dea model the greater the input the lower the efficiency when all other variables are equal therefore it was necessary to use a min max standardized method to process these two variables as negative indicators when calculating flood resilience the greater the annual precipitation population density economic density and the agricultural crop sown area density the higher the regional resilience when all other variables are equal however in the super efficiency sbm dea model the greater the input the lower the efficiency when all other variables are equal therefore it was necessary to use a min max standardized method to process these four variables as negative indicators the average power outage time was used to indirectly express power restoration with the longer the average power outage the slower the power restoration therefore it was necessary to use the min max standardized method to process the average power outage time as a negative indicator the super efficiency dea model and super efficiency sbm dea model are applicable to the case that the index data in the input output model is not equal to 0 otherwise it does not conform to the input output principle of production economics specifically when the model selects the input angle the output data in the model is allowed to be 0 but the input data in the model is not allowed to be 0 when the model selects the output angle the input data in the model is allowed to be 0 and the output data in the model is not allowed to be 0 these two models in this paper are output oriented therefore in order to prevent the normalized index value from being 0 the min max normalization method is adopted in this study formula 1 is the standardized processing formula for the negative indicators 1 y ij 0 1 0 9 max x ij x ij max x ij min x ij where x ij is set as the j th index for the i th province and y ij is the standardized value for x ij 3 3 method 3 3 1 super efficiency dea model a traditional dea method was used to evaluate the relative efficiency of multiple units the basic principle behind this method is to set the evaluated units as dmus with each dmu sharing the same multiple inputs and outputs the efficiency value was obtained by estimating the stochastic frontier of the effective production for each dmu xue and harker 2002 however traditional dea method fail to distinguish the dmus with the highest efficiency values of 1 therefore to overcome this problem the super efficiency dea model was proposed which is shown in formula 2 xue and harker 2002 in the flood vulnerability input output model the flood disaster drivers flood disaster environment and flood disaster bearers were the inputs and the flood disaster intensity was the desirable output the super efficiency dea model was then used to calculate the relative flood vulnerability in the 28 chinese provinces from 2012 to 2018 2 min θ s t j 1 j j 0 n x ij λ j x i j 0 j 1 j j 0 n y rj λ j θ y r j 0 j 1 j j 0 n λ j 1 λ j 0 i 1 2 3

the j th dmu y rj is the r th output index value for the j th dmu and λ j is the variable coefficient for the j th dmu θ 0 1 and when θ 1 the dmu input output level is at optimal efficiency otherwise it is not at optimal efficiency inputs and outputs in this model are listed in table 1 and dmus are listed in section 3 1 of the paper 3 3 2 super efficiency sbm dea model to effectively solve the problems caused by the radial angle of traditional dea methods tone 2001 proposed a non radial non angle sbm model that introduced input and output slack variables subsequently tone 2004 comprehensively considered an undesirable output indicator and proposed an sbm model that considered undesirable output in the undesirable output sbm model there was a case where the decision units were 1 at the same time which was not conducive to decision unit comparisons made it impossible to accurately sort the decision unit results therefore tone 2002 revised the slack variables and proposed the super efficient sbm model which is shown in formula 3 in sum the advantage of this model is that it combines the advantages of the super efficiency dea model and the sbm model by considering the undesirable output and revising the slack variables in the flood resilience input output model the flood disaster drivers flood disaster environment and flood disaster bearers were the inputs the flood disaster intensity was the undesirable output and the flood disaster recovery was the desirable output therefore the super efficiency sbm dea model was used to calculate the relative flood resilience in 28 chinese provinces from 2012 to 2018 3 min δ min 1 1 m i 1 m s i x i j 0 1 1 q 1 q 2 r 1 q 1 s r y r j 0 t 1 q 2 s t b b t j 0 s t j 1 j k n x ij λ j s i x i j 0 j 1 j j 0 n y rj

efficiency otherwise it is not at optimal efficiency level the inputs and outputs in this model are listed in table 2 and the dmus are listed in section 3 1 of the paper because the maxdea software used to calculate dea methods is already very mature this study used this software for the calculations 4 results 4 1 flood vulnerability 4 1 1 spatial relative vulnerability distribution the overall flood relative vulnerability map is shown in fig 5 from which it can be seen that the flood disaster vulnerabilities in eastern and central china were generally higher than in western china there are three main reasons for this eastern and central china have a summer monsoon climate at which time there is high precipitation there is a primarily plain terrain in these areas so it is prone to flooding and the eastern region has high economic development levels dense populations and a great deal of cultivated land which means that there are greater losses in summary the high flood disaster drivers high flood disaster bearers and high flood disaster intensities in eastern and central china mean that these areas have high flood vulnerability compared with western china therefore the key targets for flood prevention in china are still the eastern and central provinces however there were a few special cases in the other regions for example shanxi shaanxi he nan liaoning and jiangsu in the eastern or central regions were found to be relatively less vulnerable with shanxi shaanxi he nan and liaoning in particular having low flood disaster intensities while jiangsu had high population economic and agricultural crop sown area densities its direct economic loss density was low and although jiangxi has a high crop area disaster affected density its vulnerability was relatively low due to its extremely high precipitation 4 1 2 overview of the relative vulnerability changes fig 6 shows the chinese provincial relative flood vulnerability changes from 2012 to 2018 and table 4 gives a detailed analysis of the relative flood vulnerabilities in the 28 chinese provinces overall from 2012 to 2018 36 of the provinces were declining and only 7 were increasing which indicated that the ability to respond to floods in most provinces was improving however although the southern region forest coverage improved most provinces were facing pressure from rising gdps and population densities it was also found that the annual precipitation as the driving factor had a significant impact on the flood vulnerabilities of provinces 4 2 flood resilience 4 2 1 spatial distribution of relative resilience as can be seen in fig 7 the northwest inland and eastern coastal provinces were found to have higher relative resilience in eastern coastal provinces such as jiangsu fujian guangdong shandong and hainan there is more annual precipitation and higher flood disaster bearer density however while the forest coverage rate the water storage per unit area and flood disaster intensities are low the power restoration is relatively fast therefore these provinces had high flood resilience xinjiang qinghai and tibet in the inland northwest had slow power restoration and extremely low forest coverage rates however as the annual precipitation water storage per unit area flood disaster bearer density and flood disaster intensity were also extremely low they also had high flood resilience the provinces in the central southwest and northeast regions had relatively low flood resilience the central region provinces hubei hu nan anhui and shaanxi all had high agricultural crop sown areas crop area disaster affected and human casualties density but power restoration levels that were slightly higher than average therefore these provinces need to improve their agriculture and population abilities to cope with floods the southwest region provinces chongqing guizhou sichuan yunnan and guangxi had high forest coverage and high water storage per unit area and except for chongqing had low economic direct economic loss and crop area disaster affected densities and the power restoration abilities in guizhou yunnan and guangxi in particular were relatively slow therefore these provinces need to improve their abilities to recover from floods the northeast provinces of jilin and heilongjiang had slower agricultural rehabilitation lower annual precipitation and water storage per unit area higher forest coverage and lower than average economic population and flood disaster intensities therefore these provinces need to strengthen their agricultural rehabilitation capabilities in sum the key targets for flood prevention in china are still the eastern and central provinces 4 2 2 overview of the relative resilience changes fig 8 shows the changes in the provincial relative flood resilience in china from 2012 to 2018 and table 5 gives a detailed analysis of the relative flood resilience in the chinese provinces overall 39 of the provinces were rising declining 29 had almost no change and only 11 had a rising relative flood resilience which indicated that the relative flood resilience in various provinces in china still needs to be improved with the recovery capacity of the power infrastructure in particular needing to be strengthened 4 3 flood vulnerability resilience matrix analysis as can be seen in fig 9 the provinces such as shandong fujian and guangdong that had a high vulnerability and high resilience were mainly from the eastern coastal area the provinces with high vulnerability and low resilience were mainly from the middle reaches of the yangtze river chongqing hubei anhui hu nan and jiangxi the provinces with low vulnerability and high resilience ningxia qinghai and tibet were mainly distributed in the western region and the provinces with low vulnerability and low resilience guangxi yunnan sichuan jilin and guizhou were in the southwest region therefore the key targets for flood prevention in china are the eastern and central provinces 5 discussion flood vulnerability and resilience assessment models were developed from an input output perspective and super efficiency dea and super efficiency sbm dea methods used to evaluate the relative flood vulnerabilities and resilience in 28 chinese provinces from 2012 to 2018 first this was the first paper to apply a super efficiency sbm dea model to resilience assessment research second the impact of the flood disaster drivers and disaster environment on the relative flood vulnerability and resilience was considered third this study analyzed the vulnerability and resilience in 28 chinese provinces from a relative perspective that is when constructing the flood resilience and vulnerability evaluation index systems density was used to measure the indexes the positive and negative indicators were also distinguished and the negative indicator data processed to ensure more accurate and fair evaluation results huang et al 2012 analyzed the exposed population economy and agricultural crop sown area as well as the vulnerabilities of the population and economy to floods based on socio economic data set on chinese historical flood losses during the period 1984 2012 and the vulnerabilities were divided into four grades according to the mean and standard deviation of classification statistics we used this classification method to classify the results of 28 provinces in our research and then we compared the classification results with those of huang et al 2012 it was found that there was about 75 similarity specifically the classifications of inner mongolia hu nan guangxi sichuan he nan shaanxi and xinjiang were different in these two research results there are two possible reasons for the differences on the one hand the research time ranges of the two are different one is from 1984 to 2012 and the other is from 2012 to 2018 the flood vulnerability of various provinces is constantly changing with the development of social economy and environmental changes so the results are inconsistent on the other hand the two consider different factors so the results are different the relative flood vulnerability assessment model established in this paper takes into account flood disaster drivers flood disaster environment flood disaster bearers and flood disaster intensity however the flood vulnerability assessment model established by huang et al 2012 only considered population exposure and economic exposure and disaster losses we conducted an in depth analysis of the flood vulnerabilities in those 7 provinces as follows firstly according to our results the flood vulnerabilities in inner mongolia and hu nan were on a high level while in the huang et al 2012 s research the flood vulnerability in inner mongolia was on a medium level and hu nan on the other hand was on a much more higher level the average vulnerability in inner mongolia from 2015 to 2017 was 0 221 which was on a medium level however the annual precipitation in inner mongolia exceeded 300 mm in 2012 2013 and 2018 leading to a sharp increase in direct economic losses density human casualties density and agricultural crop sown area density therefore the vulnerabilities in these three years were on a very high level which raised the average vulnerability in inner mongolia to a high level from 2012 to 2018 in addition wang et al 2020a analyzed the spatial distribution of typical natural disaster vulnerability in china from 2010 to 2017 and classified the flood vulnerability into five categories using natural breaks hierarchical clustering his research results showed that the flood vulnerability in inner mongolia was also on a high level the annual precipitation in hu nan in 2018 was almost the same as in 2013 but the density of direct economic losses human casualties and agricultural crop sown area areas were only about 19 23 and 29 of those in 2013 therefore the flood vulnerability in hunan in 2018 was on a low level which lowered the flood vulnerability level in hu nan secondly according to our result the flood vulnerabilities in sichuan he nan and guangxi were on a medium level while in huang et al 2012 s research the flood vulnerabilities in sichuan and he nan varies to a high level and that of guangxi on the other hand varies to a much more higher one regarding sichuan its flood vulnerability was on a very high level in 2012 however in the following six years its economic density and population density increased year by year while the direct economic losses density human casualties density and crop area disaster affected density were significantly reduced therefore the flood vulnerability in sichuan was on a low level from 2013 to 2018 which led to its flood vulnerability from 2012 to 2018 was on a medium level regarding he nan its precipitation has been gradually decreasing in the past 50 years wang 2005 for example the average annual precipitation in he nan from 1971 to 2000 was 734 5 mm while the average annual precipitation from 2012 to 2018 was 712 mm in addition the direct economic losses density human casualties density and crop area disaster affected density were decreasing while the population density economic density and agricultural crop sown area density in he nan were gradually increasing as a result the vulnerability to floods was on a medium level rather than a high level regarding guangxi from 2012 to 2018 the direct economic losses density human casualties density and crop area disaster affected density were gradually decreasing while the economic density and population density were increasing year by year therefore the flood vulnerability in guangxi has gradually decreased leading the flood vulnerability in guangxi to a medium level lastly according to our result the flood vulnerabilities in shaanxi and xinjiang were on a low level while in the huang et al 2012 s research the flood vulnerabilities in these two provinces were on a medium level regarding shaanxi from 1978 to 2011 the severity of floods in shaanxi was decreasing konget al 2015 however from 2012 to 2018 shaanxi s annual precipitation increased slightly and the economic density increased by 66 while the flood disaster intensity were relatively small leading its flood vulnerability to a low level regarding xinjiang from 1984 to 2012 the floods in 1999 2007 and 2009 were extremely severe wang et al 2020b so its vulnerability during this period was on a moderate level however from 2012 to 2018 the flood disaster density in xinjiang was on a low level so the vulnerability was on a low level wang et al 2020a found the flood vulnerability in xinjiang was also on a low level this study analyzed the spatial and temporal flood vulnerability and resilience characteristics in 28 chinese provinces which revealed that areas with low vulnerabilities did not necessarily have high resilience that is there was no strong correlation between flood vulnerability and resilience however both flood vulnerability and resilience should be accounted for when formulating flood response measures as most chinese provinces have high economic growth and rising population densities more attention needs to be paid to provinces cities that have a high population and economic densities when developing flood control policies further as people depend on electricity when the power is cut it can significantly affect production and life therefore reducing power infrastructure vulnerabilities and accelerating power infrastructure recovery speeds can assist in flood recovery the vulnerability and resilience flood assessment indicator system established in this paper are simple and the models easily operated therefore assessment methods based on super efficiency dea and super efficiency sbm dea such as those used in this paper could have a high level of transferability to vulnerability and resilience analyses of other disaster types the comparison of the vulnerability and resilience regional and temporal variabilities allowed for the identification of the appropriate actions to be taken to reduce the vulnerabilities and enhance the resilience before any potential damage is realized compared with previous research that only used indicator comprehensive weighted methods as an integrated measure the proposed method based on dea methods eliminated the subjectivity of a priori weighting and was better able to estimate the relative vulnerability and resilience to floods however the calculation of the relative flood vulnerability and resilience estimation was complex therefore it is very important to establish a scientific assessment method as this paper only conducted a preliminary assessment of this new approach for the evaluation of relative flood vulnerability and resilience estimation there still are many questions that need further study for example due to the many provinces include and the long duration studied in this paper not all the necessary data were available such as slope elevation soil flood recovery time and agricultural recovery time while attempts were made to determine this data from news texts due to the lack of flood related news before 2014 the indicator data could not be directly obtained which meant that the power restoration and agricultural rehabilitation were calculated indirectly because of this difficulty in obtaining data only electricity and agriculture were considered in this paper and transportation and economic recovery were not 6 conclusions based on a flood disaster system analysis a flood vulnerability assessment model based on super efficiency dea and a flood resilience assessment model based on a super efficiency sbm dea were developed to assess china s provinces which provide a new way for the flood vulnerability and resilience assessment then based on environmental data flood damage data and physical and socioeconomic statistical data from 28 chinese provinces from 2012 to 2018 the flood vulnerabilities and flood resilience were calculated across multiple periods from which the following conclusions were drawn 1 the flood vulnerabilities in eastern and central china were generally higher than in western china the eastern coastal and northwest inland provinces had high flood resilience and the central southwest and northeast provinces had low flood resilience therefore the provinces with high vulnerability and high resilience were mainly in the eastern coastal area the provinces with high vulnerability and low resilience were mainly the middle reaches of the yangtze river the provinces with low vulnerability and high resilience were mainly in the western region and the provinces with low vulnerability and low resilience were mainly in the southwest 2 from 2012 to 2018 the relative flood vulnerabilities in 36 of the provinces were declining and only 7 were increasing which indicated that most provinces had improved their vulnerabilities however although the forest coverage in the southern provinces had increased most provinces were facing pressure from rising gdp and population densities it was also found that the annual precipitation as the driving factor had a significant impact on the flood vulnerabilities of provinces from 2012 to 2018 the relative flood resilience in 39 of the provinces was rising declining in 29 had almost no change and in only 11 was rising which showed that the relative flood resilience in the various chinese provinces still needed to be improved with the recovery capacity of the power infrastructure in particular needing to be strengthened credit authorship contribution statement yuying yang conceptualization methodology data curation writing original draft
