nature and ranked 13th among the most abundant elements in the earth s crust the primary sources of fluoride contain fluoride containing minerals i e cryolite apatite fluorite amphiboles topaz micas etc ali et al 2018 mainly weathering of these minerals causes mobilization of fluoride in ecosystem which results in fluoride enrichment in water the fluoride mobilization also depends on the groundwater hydrology water with high alkalinity has the high potential to dissolve the fluoride bearing minerals beside the geological sources anthropogenic sources pesticides usage mining and brick kiln also contribute fluoride aqueous ecosystem over 1 2 billion people are suffering lack of clean and safe water shahid and choi 2017 beside other contaminants fluoride contamination in drinking water is a significant point of concern regarding human health based on ingestion amount of fluoride in humans the water intake can causes either positive or negative health effect the consumption of less or high amount of fluoride than that of optimum level can cause the non protective environment for teeth cavities and fluorosis respectively brindha and elango 2011 x yu et al 2018 the adverse effects of fluoride consumption on kidney brain and liver have been reported in early studies wasana et al 2015 although the fluoride level in groundwater varies worldwide some regions of africa and

pattern of crystalline hydroxyapatite the diffraction peaks observed at the 2θ degree of 25 8 28 8 31 9 32 4 33 9 35 4 39 9 43 7 46 6 48 4 49 4 50 4 and 53 were appeared in fine agreement with the crystal planes of hydroxyapatite 002 102 211 112 300 202 130 113 222 132 213 321 and 004 respectively this finding was also found in consistent with earlier studies huang et al 2015 rojas mayorga et al 2013 wang et al 2017 a noticeable difference was observed for the relative intensities of different diffraction peaks the sharper peaks observed in xrd pattern indicates the better crystallinity the sharp peak at 25 8 relates to the crystal development following the c axis of the hydroxyapatite structure siddharthan et al 2006 the diffraction of plane 211 results in the highest intensity 31 9 than all other peaks in obtained pattern xrd pattern did not recognize any specific impurity 3 1 2 bet surface area the n2 physiosorption method was applied to examine the bet surface area of the bc the value of correlation coefficient r2 of the linear regression was found 1 0 the specific surface area total pore volume and the average pore diameter were determined 79 34 m2 g 1 0 041 cm3 g 1 and 2 09 nm respectively the determined surface area and porosity parameters were found better in agreement with earlier studies and even better than some studies i e less than 60 m2 g 1 surface area was also observed in some studies delgadillo velasco et al 2017 granados correa et al 2013 conversely some studies also presented the higher surface area 85 110 m2 g 1 but in those cases the average pore diameter was remarkably high i e 8 14 nm flores cano et al 2016 medellin castillo et al 2007 rojas mayorga et al 2013 3 1 3 ftir study the ftir spectra of bc is given in fig 2 the specific characteristics of hydroxyapatite were indicated by bands at wavelength of 3429 1639 1453 1037 604 and 566 cm 1 the band at 3429 cm 1 indicates the stretching mode of vibrations of oh functional group while the band at 1639 corresponds the symmetric bending mode of vibration oh group the band at wavelength of 1419 and 1453 cm 1 shows the asymmetric stretching vibration between the carbon and oxygen co3 2 group while the band at 875 cm 1 shows the asymmetric bending mode of vibrations for co3 2 these findings were found in consistent with an earlier study rojas mayorga et al 2015b the bands at wavelength 566 and 604 cm 1 indicate the asymmetric bending mode of vibration between phosphorus and oxygen in po4 3 group while the band observed at 962 and 1037 cm 1 constituting a major band in spectra indicates the symmetric stretching mode of vibration the band observed at wavelength 472 cm 1 is also determined as a symmetric bending mode of vibrations in po4 3 uysal et al 2014 the obtained spectra was found in good agreement with reported spectra in available literature bedin et al 2017 jia et al 2018 3 1 4 morphology and elemental analysis of bc fig 3 shows the sem image and eds spectra of the synthesized bc sem images of the bc revealed an agglomerated structure of bc find in good agreement with the reported morphology of bc and synthetic hydroxyapatite arnich et al 2003 camargo et al 2012 the peaks obtained in eds spectra identified phosphorous calcium carbon sodium magnesium and oxygen as the main constituents of bc the elemental chemical analysis revealed the higher share for ca 40 o 37 and p 18 is due to the basic elemental composition of hydroxyapatite the atomic and weight proportion of identified elements is given in table 1 the hydroxyapatite composition is also confirmed by atomic ratio of ca p 23 95 13 99 1 71 which is found in agreement with previously reported data arnich et al 2003 nishikawa et al 2016 wang et al 2003 3 2 adsorption isotherm the results obtained in initial screening of bc synthesized at different temperatures are shown in table 2 and fig 4a b c and d followed by initial screening bc synthesized at 350 c was used in all the experiments the adsorption isotherm for bc synthesized at 350 c is presented in fig 4e and f the initial concentration of the fluoride in the solution was varied from 5 to 50 mg l 1 and the bc quantity was kept 1 g l 1 about 79 38 of the fluoride concentration was adsorbed on 1 g of bc from the solution having 5 mg l 1 initial concentration for the solution having higher initial concentration i e 50 mg l 1 the maximum adsorption quantity was 10 56 mg of fluoride on 1 g of bc as the higher number of fluoride ions exists in the solution with higher concentration the adsorption capacity increases huang et al 2012 table 3 shows the parameters for the langmuir and freundlich isotherms the values of correlation coefficient r2 were found 0 99 and 0 97 for langmuir and freundlich respectively the higher value of r2 shows that experimental data is finely fitted in langmuir indicating the monolayer fluoride adsorption on the surface of bc for the freundlich value of n was 3 11 signifying the heterogeneous layers formation on the adsorbent surface considering the parameters of freundlich and langmuir models it seems that adsorption was govern by both homogeneous and heterogeneous adsorption as the bc is mainly composed of carbon and hydroxyapatite an earlier study stated that phosphate and hydroxyl groups of hydroxyapatite are the only anions which can be replaced by fluoride medellin castillo et al 2014 however in our study very less concentration 0 1 mg l 1 of phosphate was observed in a sample obtained after 12 and 24 h contact time between fluoride solution and bc meanwhile a rapid change in ph was observed and the ph was shifted from 7 to 7 7 it can be stated that the ligand exchange mechanism is mainly governed by the replacement of hydroxyl ions by fluoride the electrostatic interactions between the fluoride ions and the positively charged sites ca oh2 on bc surface can be explained by mentioned below equation flores cano et al 2016 followed by adsorption experiments regeneration of bc with alkaline solution indicates the successful desorption of fluorine it shows that the electrostatic interaction between fluoride and charged surface played significant role in fluoride adsorption ca o h 2 f ca o h 2 f fig 5 shows the comparison between the ftir spectra of bc before and after adsorption of fluoride the intensity of band oh at 3429 cm 1 was decreased from 66 8 to 52 6 indicating the effect of fluoride adsorption this finding also supports the ionic exchange phenomena for hydroxyl functional group and bc rojas mayorga et al 2015a 3 3 adsorption kinetic fig 6 shows the effect of contact time on the fluoride adsorption one gram of bc was added into a solution of 10 mg l 1 initial fluoride concentration bc was found successful to remove 3 177 mg of fluoride from the solution in initial 5 min contact time however maximum 5 3 mg of fluoride was adsorbed on bc surface by end of experiment it shows that the quick adsorption was occurred in the beginning and later the system achieved an equilibrium state the adsorbent nature and the available adsorption sites plays main role in the adsorption process initially fluoride ions occupied all available adsorption sites and later started to diffuse through the internal pores of the bc the diffusion rate highly depends on the fluoride concentration in the solution as the fluoride concentration drops the diffusion rate also drops and finally system reaches the state of an equilibrium hence it can be stated that adsorption is mainly happened in three phases i e surface diffusion pore diffusion and steady state equilibrium rojas mayorga et al 2013 fig 6b and c represents the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic plots for fluoride adsorption on bc the rate constant values for k 1 and k 2 were obtained 5 2 10 3 min 1 and 8 10 4 g mg 1 min 1 respectively subsequently the correlation coefficient r2 value was determined 0 94 and 0 98 for pseudo first order and pseudo second order the higher value of r2 for pseudo second order shows that pseudo first order is more suitable to explain the kinetic data hence it seems that here adsorption is mainly governed by chemisorption phenomena and the adsorption rate is proportional to the doubled number of vacant adsorption sites ismail and abdelkareem 2015 this finding was appeared in consistence with earlier studies azizian 2004 iriel et al 2018 3 4 effect of ph and competing anion fig 7 shows the effect of ph on the fluoride adsorption on bc it was observed that the rate of adsorption remains high at acidic conditions however at higher ph a noticeable drop in adsorption capacity was observed the fluoride adsorption was quite stable at ph 7 mainly the net surface charge plays a significant role in adsorption the adsorption remains low when the surface charge remains at negative side i e basic ph conditions the negative surface charge offers the repulsion for nearby fluoride anions inversely surface charge remains positive at low ph and favors fluoride adsorption this finding were found in consistent with earlier studies z yu et al 2018 different molar concentrations of bicarbonate ion were introduced in the solution but no change was observed in the rate of adsorption for fluoride it shows that carbonate ion does not compete with fluoride ions for adsorption on bc 4 conclusion bc was synthesized from the used cattle bone by thermal treatment in preliminary phase bc was synthesized at different temperatures including 350 c 400 c 500 c 600 c and 700 c based on preliminary batch adsorption experiments bc synthesized at 350 c was exclusively investigated for the adsorptive removal of fluoride from groundwater the fine crystalline structure of hydroxyapatite was confirmed during characterization of bc the ca p ratio total pore volume specific surface area and the average pore diameter of bc were found 1 71 0 041 cm3 g 1 79 34 m2 g 1 and 2 09 nm respectively the effect of initial fluoride concentration ph and contact time on fluoride removal efficiency of bc was examined briefly the maximum fluoride adsorption capacity on bc was determined 10 56 mg g 1 the adsorption data was more closely fitted in langmuir isotherm model as compared with freundlich model the monolayer fluoride adsorption was observed on the surface layer of bc the results indicate potential for practical applications of the bc as fluoride adsorbent bc can be applied in groundwater treatment at the regions having higher fluoride concentration acknowledgement this work

composition is also confirmed by atomic ratio of ca p 23 95 13 99 1 71 which is found in agreement with previously reported data arnich et al 2003 nishikawa et al 2016 wang et al 2003 3 2 adsorption isotherm the results obtained in initial screening of bc synthesized at different temperatures are shown in table 2 and fig 4a b c and d followed by initial screening bc synthesized at 350 c was used in all the experiments the adsorption isotherm for bc synthesized at 350 c is presented in fig 4e and f the initial concentration of the fluoride in the solution was varied from 5 to 50 mg l 1 and the bc quantity was kept 1 g l 1 about 79 38 of the fluoride concentration was adsorbed on 1 g of bc from the solution having 5 mg l 1 initial concentration for the solution having higher initial concentration i e 50 mg l 1 the maximum adsorption quantity was 10 56 mg of fluoride on 1 g of bc as the higher number of fluoride ions exists in the solution with higher concentration the adsorption capacity increases huang et al 2012 table 3 shows the parameters for the langmuir and freundlich isotherms the values of correlation coefficient r2 were found 0 99 and 0 97 for langmuir and freundlich respectively the higher value of r2 shows that experimental data is finely fitted in langmuir indicating the monolayer fluoride adsorption on the surface of bc for the freundlich value of n was 3 11 signifying the heterogeneous layers formation on the adsorbent surface considering the parameters of freundlich and langmuir models it seems that adsorption was govern by both homogeneous and heterogeneous adsorption as the bc is mainly composed of carbon and hydroxyapatite an earlier study stated that phosphate and hydroxyl groups of hydroxyapatite are the only anions which can be replaced by fluoride medellin castillo et al 2014 however in our study very less concentration 0 1 mg l 1 of phosphate was observed in a sample obtained after 12 and 24 h contact time between fluoride solution and bc meanwhile a rapid change in ph was observed and the ph was shifted from 7 to 7 7 it can be stated that the ligand exchange mechanism is mainly governed by the replacement of hydroxyl ions by fluoride the electrostatic interactions between the fluoride ions and the positively charged sites ca oh2 on bc surface can be explained by mentioned below equation flores cano et al 2016 followed by adsorption experiments regeneration of bc with alkaline solution indicates the successful desorption of fluorine it shows that the electrostatic interaction between fluoride and charged surface played significant role in fluoride adsorption ca o h 2 f ca o h 2 f fig 5 shows the comparison between the ftir spectra of bc before and after adsorption of fluoride the intensity of band oh at 3429 cm 1 was decreased from 66 8 to 52 6 indicating the effect of fluoride adsorption this finding also supports the ionic exchange phenomena for hydroxyl functional group and bc rojas mayorga et al 2015a 3 3 adsorption kinetic fig 6 shows the effect of contact time on the fluoride adsorption one gram of bc was added into a solution of 10 mg l 1 initial fluoride concentration bc was found successful to remove 3 177 mg of fluoride from the solution in initial 5 min contact time however maximum 5 3 mg of fluoride was adsorbed on bc surface by end of experiment it shows that the quick adsorption was occurred in the beginning and later the system achieved an equilibrium state the adsorbent nature and the available adsorption sites plays main role in the adsorption process initially fluoride ions occupied all available adsorption sites and later started to diffuse through the internal pores of the bc the diffusion rate highly depends on the fluoride concentration in the solution as the fluoride concentration drops the diffusion rate also drops and finally system reaches the state of an equilibrium hence it can be stated that adsorption is mainly happened in three phases i e surface diffusion pore diffusion and steady state equilibrium rojas mayorga et al 2013 fig 6b and c represents the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic plots for fluoride adsorption on bc the rate constant values for k 1 and k 2 were obtained 5 2 10 3 min 1 and 8 10 4 g mg 1 min 1 respectively subsequently the correlation coefficient r2 value was determined 0 94 and 0 98 for pseudo first order and pseudo second order the higher value of r2 for pseudo second order shows that pseudo first order is more suitable to explain the kinetic data hence it seems that here adsorption is mainly governed by chemisorption phenomena and the adsorption rate is proportional to the doubled number of vacant adsorption sites ismail and abdelkareem 2015 this finding was appeared in consistence with earlier studies azizian 2004 iriel et al 2018 3 4 effect of ph and competing anion fig 7 shows the effect of ph on the fluoride adsorption on bc it was observed that the rate of adsorption remains high at acidic conditions however at higher ph a noticeable drop in adsorption capacity was observed the fluoride adsorption was quite stable at ph 7 mainly the net surface charge plays a significant role in adsorption the adsorption remains low when the surface charge remains at negative side i e basic ph conditions the negative surface charge offers the repulsion for nearby fluoride anions inversely surface charge remains positive at low ph and favors fluoride adsorption this finding were found in consistent with earlier studies z yu et al 2018 different molar concentrations of bicarbonate ion were introduced in the solution but no change was observed in the rate of adsorption for fluoride it shows that carbonate ion does not compete with fluoride ions for adsorption on bc 4 conclusion bc was synthesized from the used cattle bone by thermal treatment in preliminary phase bc was synthesized at different temperatures including 350 c 400 c 500 c 600 c and 700 c based on preliminary batch adsorption experiments bc synthesized at 350 c was exclusively investigated for the adsorptive removal of fluoride from groundwater the fine crystalline structure of hydroxyapatite was confirmed during characterization of bc the ca p ratio total pore volume specific surface area and the average pore diameter of bc were found 1 71 0 041 cm3 g 1 79 34 m2 g 1 and 2 09 nm respectively the effect of initial fluoride concentration ph and contact time on fluoride removal efficiency of bc was examined briefly the maximum fluoride adsorption capacity on bc was determined 10 56 mg g 1 the adsorption data was more closely fitted in langmuir isotherm model as compared with freundlich model the monolayer fluoride adsorption was observed on the surface layer of bc the results indicate potential for practical applications of the bc as fluoride adsorbent bc can be applied in groundwater treatment at the regions having higher fluoride concentration acknowledgement this work

12291,an open and indiscriminate disposal of coal fly ash causes extensive changes in physicochemical properties of soil and water few studies propose that coal fly ash is a potential soil ameliorant that may improve the physical chemical biological properties and nutritional quality of the agricultural soil however several recent studies documented that incorporation of higher dosages of coal fly ash into water and soil releases toxic elements consequently creating soil and groundwater pollution leading to major health environmental and land use problems to assess the environmental impact of hazardous coal fly ash on the ecological system physicochemical and hydrogeochemical analysis of both soil and groundwater are performed x ray diffractograms xrd of soils from agricultural and landfill sites n 8 along with coal fly ash n 2 show the presence of characteristic minerals of coal fly ash and also toxic arsenic mineral phases suggesting the strong influence of hazardous coal fly ash on agricultural soil the hydrogeochemical parameters of groundwater samples n 27 are analyzed which show elevated concentrations of most of the major ions corresponding to higher values than maximum permissible levels of recommended drinking water standards by world health organization who and bureau of indian standards bis the water quality indices wqi suggests poor to unsuitable water for drinking conversely evaluation of various other hydrochemical indices calculated using elemental concentration of the groundwater samples demarcates contamination of water due to the open dumping of coal fly ash and therefore not desirable for drinking purposes keywords coal fly ash xrd hydrogeochemistry water quality index arsenic contamination water pollution 1 introduction coal fly ash is one of the major concerns for the scientific community as it is the foremost waste material produced by combustion of coal in a thermal power plant nayak et al 2015 the physicochemical characteristics of coal fly ash mainly belong to the type of coal and ignition conditions adriano et al 2002 basu et al 2009 the coal fly ash mainly contains si al and fe as a major element concentration along with substantial amount of ca na k and ti adriano et al 2002 asokan et al 2005 kanchan et al 2015 the ca in coal fly ash is found to be the dominant cation followed by mg na and k jala and goyal 2006 sajwan et al 2006 on the other hand al is typically bound in insoluble alumino silicate structures which substantially control the biological toxicity of coal fly ash jala and goyal 2006 olson et al 2017 the high concentration of elements in coal fly ash improves the edaphic characteristics of soil which in turn increases the crop yield blissett and rowson 2012 the coal fly ash has a great impact on agriculture due to its efficacy in the modification of soil health and crop performance by altering soil properties like bulk density soil texture water holding capacity soil ph biological properties and nutrient content gupta et al 2002 basu et al 2009 kaur and goyal 2015 however the utilization of coal fly ash provides some sustainable solutions in agriculture civil and industrial sectors jala and goyal 2006 basu et al 2009 pandey and singh 2010 blissett and rowson 2012 subsequently it also has great adverse effects on environment as it releases substantial amounts of trace metals like mo mn zn and cu along with significant amount of other toxic elements i e as cr co pb ni se which are major source of soil and water pollution sharma and kalra 2006 basu et al 2009 pandey et al 2011 ramya et al 2013 raju et al 2015 raja et al 2015 olson et al 2017 further among all toxic elements reported in coal fly ash arsenic is one of the most hazardous element for the terrestrial and aquatic life that consequently causes ecological problems pandey et al 2011 olson et al 2017 arsenic contamination has turned into a major global concern to researchers dealing with constantly growing pollution of soil water and crops mukherjee et al 2006 a recent study conducted by chandrashekhar et al 2016 on contamination and mobilization of arsenic in the soil and groundwater documents arsenic effect on the agriculture causing lung infections and skin diseases furthermore coal fly ash contains a high amount of soluble salts which support contaminants to move from soils into groundwater through leaching and results in water pollution jala and goyal 2006 thus disposal of huge amount of coal fly ash leads to the release of toxic elements which in turn contaminate soil and groundwater resulting in a potential environmental hazard bilski and alva 1995 ramya et al 2013 since coal fly ash has a great effect on the environment throughout the globe which disturbs the physiochemical properties of soil and alters the groundwater chemistry there is always a need for a study to assess the impact of coal fly ash disposal to alert the officials and to prevent further ecological damages in this regard several studies from the last two decades have been done which reports that the extensive amount of coal fly ash imposes serious environmental threat boyacioglu and boyacioglu 2007 pandey et al 2011 nalawade et al 2012 pomykała and mazurkiewicz 2015 on the other hand extensive research work have also been done to evaluate the hydrogeochemical properties of groundwater ravenscroft et al 2005 ghose et al 2009 umar and alam 2012 bikundia and mohan 2014 zaidi et al 2015 saba et al 2015 disli 2017 khan et al 2017 moreover very few studies have been done on both the soil and groundwater quality assessment in the vicinity of a coal fly ash landfill site ramya et al 2013 spadoni et al 2014 kanchan et al 2015 pal et al 2016 the present study has been carried out around coal fly ash landfill site of harduaganj thermal power station htps aligarh india lying in upper ganga basin aiming i to evaluate the potential impact of coal fly ash disposal on soil and groundwater quality and ii to assess soil composition and to determine hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater for the suitability of irrigational and domestic purposes 2 study area the geological hydrological context the study area 70 km2 specifically covers jawan block aligarh district 140 km away from new delhi and lies between latitude 27 5 to 28 5 n and longitude 78 2 to 78 14 e 178 m above mean sea level fig 1 it is located in an inter stream region where rivers sengar and kali define its western and eastern boundaries respectively the study area falls in a humid subtropical climate zone which is marked by cold winter and hot summer seasons typically of north central india the average minimum 10 c and maximum 45 c temperature persist in winter and summer seasons respectively june to september is marked as maximum rainfall months of the year the mean annual rainfall recorded at aligarh rain gauge station for a period of last 20 years 1998 2017 is 743 mm imd 2017 regardless of average rainfall in the study area greater than 90 water demand fulfilled by groundwater resources cgwb 2017 the agricultural sector of the study area mostly depends on the groundwater as its major source of irrigation water moreover the study area occupies interfluve region between the river yamuna and river ganga in upper ganga plains these rivers along with their tributaries like sengar and kali mainly control the drainage of the region ganga plain is a build up of quaternary alluvium and there is a little elevation change over a distance 170 210 m above mean sea level which makes it a rather flat plain the stratigraphical studies of this plain suggest that it is composed of clay silt sand gravel layers and marked by the presence of varying amount of calcareous nodules of quaternary alluvium sinha et al 2005 the major soil types are clayey silty and sandy mainly alfisol and ultisol order and the top soil is considered good for agricultural practices srivastava et al 2015 on the other hand to describe the hydrogeological setting two cross sections not shown here are drawn along line a b and c d see fig 1 for locations the cross section a b shows that the top clay layer is marked by 5 and 8 m thick towards east and west respectively the second layer is 62 m thick granular zone which acts as the first aquifer the cross section c d shows a generalized and more elaborate picture of the aquifer disposition in the study area the top clay layer varying in thickness from 12 to 7 m persists throughout the area and underlain by a thick granular zone which is approximately 55 m thick this study is restricted to shallow aquifers which are major source of the water requirement of the area for domestic and irrigational purposes 3 materials and methods the physicochemical and mineralogical analysis of coal fly ash n 2 and topsoil n 8 are performed on samples taken from the landfill site and surrounding agriculture fields respectively the coal fly ash and soil samples are oven dried at 60 c for about 24 h and thoroughly homogenized by coning and quartering method and then finely powdered and sieved the electrical conductivity ec and ph of the soil are measured at 1 5 and 1 2 ratio of sample to distilled water respectively this procedure is done with pre calibrated oakton pcs testr 35 the x ray diffraction xrd analysis of the coal fly ash and soil from agriculture and landfill sites along with two standards pure quartz and pure calcite were performed using x pert3 powder x ray diffractometer panalytical at department of earth sciences iit kanpur the measuring conditions are set as a source cu ka λ 1 54 å potential difference 40 kv current 30 ma scan speed 1 min step size 0 05 and 2ө range 5 60 a total of 27 representative groundwater samples are taken in polyethylene bottles after pumping the hand pump shallow aquifer well about a 3 5 minutes the physicochemical analyses are carried out based on the standard methods of the american public health association apha 2012 the major ion analyses are done at department of geology amu aligarh and department of earth sciences iit kanpur the electrical conductivity ec and ph of groundwater samples are determined by portable digital water analysis meter hach sension different methods are followed to measure the major ion and anion concentrations the titration method is used for ca2 and mg2 determination by using ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid edta cl is determinated by using agno3 and hco3 is determined by using hcl and methyl orange the flame emission photometry technique is used for na and k determination the gravimetric method is used for so4 2 whereas colorimetric methods are followed for the no3 using phenol disulphonic acid the total dissolved solids tds are measured by adding the all major ion and anion concentration different hydrochemical indices are calculated and used to evaluate groundwater class and their permissible limits to domestic and irrigational purposes 4 results and discussion 4 1 physicochemical and mineralogical analysis of coal fly ash and soil several physicochemical parameters of soil have a substantial role in sorption desorption of heavy metals in the soil which controls leaching and mobility of heavy metal into groundwater covelo et al 2007 the ph of agricultural soil ranges 6 4 8 0 which is due to probable mixing of basic salts from coal fly ash effluent the electrical conductivity ec values of the agricultural soil range from 3 5 to 16 6 ms cm suggesting the presence of salts in the soil one important aspect to understand soil pollution is characterizing soil mineral composition that affects the porosity permeability and metal retention capacity an attempt has been made to identify mineralogical composition through analysis of coal fly ash from the landfill site and its surrounding agricultural soil the x ray diffractograms of coal fly ash samples are shown in fig 2 which mainly reveals the presence of quartz sio2 peaks at 4 26 å 3 34 å 2 45 å 2 8 å 2 23 å 2 12 å and 1 81 å suggesting that it acts as a dominant primary mineral mixed layer peaks for quartz and mullite al6si2o13 are noticed at 2 28 å 2 23 å and 1 81 å the moderately sharp diffraction peaks for the minor minerals illite kal3si3o10 oh 2 layered aluminosilicate at 9 9 å magnetite fe3o4 at 4 97 å calcite caco3 at 3 85 å and 2 28 å hematite α fe2o3 at 3 75 å anhydrite caso4 at 3 68 å and rutile tio2 at 3 21 å and 2 24 å e g rivera et al 2015 due to the high concentration and intensity of primary minerals other mineral phases are not observed in coal fly ash xrd patterns the presence of carbonate mineral calcite indicates the alkaline nature of coal fly ash which can buffer soil system furthermore xrd analysis has been carried out on agricultural soil samples to infer the presence of coal fly ash in soil mineral phases the representative xrd patterns of bulk soil samples are shown in fig 3 these patterns mainly reveal the presence of quartz peaks at 4 26 å 3 34 å 2 45 å 2 8 å 2 23 å 2 12 å and 1 81 å respectively it is clear from xrd spectra of all the samples that quartz is dominating over all other mineral phases the illite peaks are noticed at 9 9 å 4 3 å and 1 5 å along with minor amounts of kaolinite at 7 71 å and 3 58 å goethite at 4 18 å and 1 71 å magnetite at 2 98 å ferrihydrite at 1 97 å and feldspar at 3 18 å and 2 72 å along with certain similar coal fly ash minerals see fig 2 in almost all soil samples presence of clay minerals illite and kaolinite suggests prominent chemical weathering of feldspar albite or k feldspar and mica muscovite these clay minerals are important for soil fertility and naturally have net negative charged particle surfaces that serve as potential sites for cation adsorption or nutrient storage paul et al 2015 on the other hand presence of moderately expansive clay minerals in the soil suggests high leaching potential and medium to low level of metal retention capacity of soils ljung et al 2006 paul et al 2015 excess leachate from coal fly ash often contains toxic elements mixed with water and soil which have an adverse impact on soil fertility and degrades natural water quality lin et al 2013 water act as a governing agent of mobilization of toxic elements such as arsenic under normal geological conditions according to pandey et al 2011 the arsenic is captured by calcite and hematite minerals also recognized in studied soil samples and forms a stable complex of ca or transition metal of fe hydroxyl arsenate hydrate m2 2fe3 aso4 3 oh 4 10h2o and other toxic compounds certain arsenic phases such as the bearsite be2 aso4 oh 4 h2o claudetite as2o3 and wallisite cu ag t1pbas2s5 are recognized in the studied soil samples see fig 3 suggests arsenic pollution in soil similar observations have also found in paddy soils from manipur india by chandrashekhar et al 2016 since the studied soil xrd spectra show the presence of certain coal fly ash minerals anhydrite rutile mullite and toxic arsenic mineral phases bearsite wallisite and claudetite suggesting a strong influence of coal fly ash disposal on soil which is hazardous to the environment and a matter of great concern to human health 4 2 physicochemical analysis of groundwater results of the physicochemical analysis of the groundwater samples are presented in table 1 the concentration of various elements are compared with the drinking water standards of the world health organization who 2011 and the bureau of indian standards bis 2012 which are given in table 2 the ph ranges from 7 5 to 8 2 average 7 9 suggest the groundwater is slightly alkaline in nature the ec values vary from 715 to 1308 average 999 µs cm indicating the elevated concentration of salt the ec has been referred to an index of salinity hazard wilcox 1955 the higher values of ec in water samples leads to the formation of saline soil in contrast higher sodium concentrations in water form alkaline soil on the basis of ec values wilcox 1955 classified the irrigation water into five classes or groups these are excellent ec 250 good 250 750 permissible 750 2250 doubtful 2250 5000 and unsuitable 5000 in the study area no sample falls under the excellent class and only 15 samples show good water class whereas more than 80 samples are in the range of permissible limits and 4 sample is in the doubtful class for irrigation purpose table 3 the entire sample population has tds 500 average 792 mg l which corresponds to higher tds than desirable limits of drinking water standards this implies that the high tds have a significant impact on the groundwater around the area under investigation after davies and wiest 1966 classification none of the studied water samples is desirable for drinking purpose and only 7 4 of samples are useful for irrigation purpose see table 3 the most probable inference of this is that the elements concentrated in coal fly ash got leached thereby altering the groundwater chemistry on the other hand hardness is a very useful parameter to determine the suitability of water for domestic irrigational and industrial purposes karanth 1987 alam 2014 the hardness of the groundwater samples varies from 196 to 368 average 263 mg l which exceeds the highest desirable level as described by who 2011 and bis 2012 overall the groundwater is hard to very hard suggesting weathering of calcium bearing minerals or input from landfill source according to the total hardness classification 74 and 26 of groundwater samples are hard and very hard respectively which are not considered good for domestic and agricultural use further different alkali cations concentrations show that the most abundant content of na ranging from 24 to 144 average 73 mg l whereas k varies from 6 to 48 average 14 mg l the higher concentration of na is attributed to cation exchange chemical dissolution of minerals and infiltration of salty water gautam et al 2015 rahman et al 2017 the mg2 and ca2 ranges from 26 to 75 average 49 mg l and 11 95 average 53 mg l respectively which are within the highest desirable limit in the studied groundwater samples the so4 2 and cl content varies from 130 to 437 average 286 mg l and 23 128 average 78 mg l respectively indicating the water is within the permissible limit the no3 varies from 3 to 21 average 10 mg l whereas hco3 ranges from 130 to 533 average 236 mg l which is under the maximum permissible level described by who 2011 and bis 2012 furthermore the relationship among the physicochemical parameters are evaluated based on correlation coefficients and are represented in table 4 this shows a strong correlation between tds and other major ions such as mg2 r 0 51 na r 0 64 k r 0 61 and hco3 r 0 73 indicating these are significantly taking part in the degradation of groundwater quality the high positive correlation between tds and mg2 na k and hco3 ions exhibits that the groundwater quality is controlled by these elements nagarajan et al 2010 alam 2014 dhanasekarapandian et al 2016 since the coal fly ash dump site is in the middle of the extensive agricultural land where a fair amount of nitrogen and potassium rich fertilizers are used potassium is held by clay particles in soil and it leaches through soil profile into the groundwater similarly chemical and organic fertilizers contribute nitrate that is likely the main reason for the positive correlation between nitrate and potassium further the high and significant correlation of bicarbonate ions r 0 73 suggests its dominant effect over all other alkali and alkaline earth metal ions which increase the ph value of the groundwater in such a way that the groundwater shows alkaline nature 4 2 1 hydrogeochemical characteristics and facies classification of groundwater the major anions and cations concentrations are plotted in meq l fig 4a 4h to know their relative proportions hco3 vs cl plot fig 4a suggests the abundance of hco3 over cl because almost all the samples 99 tend to cluster above equal concentration line 1 1 whereas relative proportion of cl and so4 2 fig 4b clearly indicates a high abundance of so4 2 in comparison to cl it is evident that the increase in the so4 2 concentration is caused by anthropogenic activities like industrial influents wastewater and organic matter deposition which contains sulphide jakóbczyk karpierz et al 2017 in alkali vs alkaline earth plot fig 4c all alkalis cluster below 1 1 line meaning that higher concentration of ca2 and mg2 this high concentration is more likely due to the presence of ca2 as a dominant cation of coal fly ash and or the occurrence of varying amount of calcareous nodules in aquifer horizons further the molar proportions of cl so4 2 vs hco3 shows the negligible amount of samples are hco3 dominant type water and the majority of samples are cl so4 2 type water fig 4d a general richness of ca2 mg2 is marked in all samples except very few samples which indicate the meteoric character of groundwater fig 4e since stoichio chemistry of carbonate weathering reactions demand that carbonate derived ca2 mg2 should be equal to carbonate derived bicarbonate however the plot of ca2 mg2 vs hco3 shows excess ca2 mg2 over hco3 fig 4e on the other hand the plot of ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 will be closed to 1 1 line if the dissolution of calcite dolomite and gypsum are dominant reactions in a system tiwari and singh 2014 and other references therein the plots of ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 from this study fig 4f shows an excess of hco3 so4 2 over ca2 mg2 therefore based on both the plots figs 4e 4f and geological set up of the study area rules out the role of carbonate weathering moreover alkalis have bonding affinity with cl and to assess their bonding affinities a plot fig 4g have been generated this represents almost all samples excluding a very few are likely found to be more biased towards alkalis as cl will form a complex salt with na k and the rest amount of cl will be there in the groundwater to make bonds with other ionic species saba et al 2015 on the other hand in na k vs so4 2 plot fig 4h almost all the samples exhibit a rich abundance of so4 2 over alkalis based on the dominant ionic concentration the groundwater samples are categorized into various hydrogeochemical facies these hydrogeochemical facies are marked by different zones which are characterized by particular cation and anion concentrations within distinct compositional categories in general these compositional categories correspond to a subdivision of trilinear diagram as given by back 1966 in this study the groundwater samples are classified by utilizing piper s trilinear diagram piper 1944 based on the piper diagram possible two kinds of dominant facies in the study area are mixed type and ca2 mg2 so4 2 type fig 5 the occurrence of these type of groundwater facies can be attributed to the dominance of processes like groundwater recharge irrigation return flow and ion exchange process raju et al 2015 4 2 2 mechanism controlling groundwater geochemistry the groundwater interaction with aquifer lithology rainfall and evaporation have a great control on hydrochemistry vis á vis water quality subramani et al 2010 vasanthavigar et al 2012 this mechanism can be determined by understanding the genesis of water which frequently inferred from gibb s diagram gibbs 1970 this diagram represents the plots of tds mg l vs the weight ratio of cations na k by na k ca2 and anions cl by cl hco3 as ratio 1 and ratio 2 respectively the hydrochemical data of groundwater samples of this study are plotted in gibb s diagram fig 6 the gibb s plot for this study shows that the ratio 1 varies from 0 37 to 0 93 average 0 60 whereas ratio 2 varies from 0 7 to 0 38 average 0 26 the ratio 1 fig 6a described that majority of the groundwater samples are rock dominance type whereas ratio 2 fig 6b suggests that the 85 of water samples are rock dominance and only 15 are of evaporate dominance therefore it can be interpreted that the main cause of rock dominance is due to the groundwater chemistry and which is dominated by the weathering reaction prevailing in the aquifer system 4 3 evaluation of groundwater quality for domestic and irrigation purposes the suitability of water used for domestic and irrigation purposes depends upon the elemental concentration of the water which has the direct impact on human health as well as on the soil fertility and plant growth rahman et al 2017 the following hydrochemical indices have been evaluated using elemental constituent of groundwater 4 3 1 water quality index wqi the wqi is a mathematical function which determines the quality of water in any ecosystem at a given time which denotes the integrated effect of the various parameters initially wqi was developed by horton 1965 taking into consideration of most significantly used variables of physical chemical and biological nature of water in relation to natural water quality wqi has been widely applied in the evaluation of the hydrochemical characteristic of water since last couple of decades in european african and asian countries dunnette 1979 dojlido et al 1994 sahu and sikdar 2008 ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 for wqi determination total 27 groundwater samples are used along with the given standards from who 2011 and bis 2012 a general approach given by vasanthavigar et al 2010 and cude 2001 is followed to calculate the wqi taking into consideration the most common factors which are described in three steps the 1st step is completed by assigning a weight wi factor to each parameter table 5 for the 2nd step a relative weight wi is calculated by the following equation wi wi i 1 n wi where wi is the weight of each parameter wi is relative weight and n is the number of parameters in the last 3rd step a quality rating scale qi to each parameter is assigned by diving its concentration ci in mg l by its respective standard si and multiplied by 100 the qi is calculated by the following equation q i c i s i 100 subsequently another important sub index sii is given to each parameter and finally used in the following equations to calculate wqi for the water samples of the study area si i w i q i wqi si i the wqi of the study area samples ranges from 79 to 120 average 98 3 and their classification is given in table 6 the calculated wqi suggest that the water quality around the landfill site is poor to unsuitable for drinking purposes see fig 7 this directly indicates that the water is contaminating from anthropogenic sources which can proportionally increase the risk of various health problems to mankind proper awareness and relevant corrective measures and regular monitoring must be adopted for sustainable water resources management 4 3 2 sodium adsorption ratio sar it is observed that the higher sodium adsorption ratio is associated with the less suitable water for irrigation richards 1954 the water containing the elevated values of sar is regularly used for irrigation leads to damage soil fertility this effect is documented by karanth 1987 and singh et al 2012 such that the high concentration of sodium in the water disrupts the ca2 and mg2 concentrations in agriculture soil this further destroys soil structure and tilth that leads to a decrease in the capability of soil to form stable soil aggregates increase intake of higher sar value water lowers the infiltration and permeability capacity of the soil which results in a decrease in crop production sar is referred to the index of sodium alkali hazard and commonly used in evaluating the irrigational water quality the sar is defined as per the following relationship by richards 1954 where concentrations are in meq l richards 1954 also described the suitability of water quality for irrigation purposes using ec vs sar values the calculated sar values of this study vary from 0 59 to 3 68 average 1 67 and presented in table 3 sar na ca mg 2 the sar values have been plotted in us salinity laboratory s diagram fig 8 this diagram has 16 subclasses that are used to rate the degree of extent corresponding particular water may prone to salinity problems our results show that the almost all the groundwater samples fall in elevated salinity class c3s1 one of the known sources of this high salinity is due to infiltration of leachate from coal fly ash landfill effluents the excess amount of salt present in water directly affects the permeability structure texture and aeration ability of the soil that corresponds to a reduction in soil fertility and plant growth todd 1980 karanth 1987 these processes create hard soils which are unfavorable for seed germination jameel and sirajudeen 2006 to overcome this type of situation soil amendments may be applied such as the addition of gypsum or lime umar et al 2001 4 3 3 residual sodium carbonate rsc the excess co3 hco3 over ca2 mg2 in groundwater samples affect the suitability of water for irrigation raghunath 1987 the water containing a high level of rsc index does not enhance the osmotic pressure to obstruct the off take of water by the plant roots unlike water having high salinity similarly when dissolved na in comparison with dissolved ca2 and mg2 exceeded in water the plant roots are unable to spread deeper into the soil due to lack of moisture groundwater with excess co3 and or hco3 leads to the precipitation of ca2 and or mg2 that subsequently produces concentrated water in contrast excess amount of nahco3 and co3 causes dissolution of organic matter present in the soil which in turn on drying leaves a black stain on the surface of the soil eaton 1950 the rsc values are calculated following the equation given by eaton 1950 here the concentrations are reported in meq l rsc co3 hco3 ca2 mg2 the classification of groundwater based on rsc values is given in table 3 based on rsc criteria it can be suggested that approximately 96 of the groundwater sample population fall in the safe category and 4 in marginally suitable 4 3 4 magnesium hazard mh magnesium hazard is a significant hydrochemical index to characterize the water quality for irrigation purposes an equilibrium state in most of the waters has been observed between ca2 and mg2 ions bikundia and mohan 2014 if soils have more of these ions which correspond to a reduction in crop production due to an increase in alkalinity of the soil kumar et al 2007 magnesium hazard value for irrigation water can be calculated from the following equation proposed by szabolcs and darab 1964 mh mg2 ca2 mg2 100 here all the ions are expressed in meq l in the present study the mh ratio varies from 42 09 to 91 83 average 59 60 percent table 3 in general the water samples containing mh value greater than 50 are suggested as harmful and unsuitable for agricultural purposes szabolcs and darab 1964 results show that more than 80 samples are unacceptable as permagnesium hazard ratio limit therefore based on the mh ratio the water samples from the study area are considered unsuitable for irrigation purposes 5 conclusion the present study is an attempt to assess the deterioration of agricultural soil and groundwater quality by dumping the coal fly ash in the vicinity of the thermal power plant this research work would provide significant evidence to the scientific community for taking adaptive measures in domestic and irrigation water quality management systems the major conclusions are as follows the physicochemical and mineralogical analysis of coal fly ash and agricultural soil samples collected in the vicinity of landfill site of harduaganj thermal power station aligarh india suggests that the topsoil is receiving an intake of excess elements from some anthropogenic sources the studied soil xrd patterns show the presence of certain coal fly ash minerals anhydrite rutile mullite and toxic arsenic mineral phases bearsite wallisite and claudetite implies the strong influence of coal fly ash disposal on soil which is hazardous to the environment and a matter of great concern to human health the physicochemical parameters of groundwater mostly exceed the concentration limits as suggested by the who 2011 and bis 2012 the water quality indices wqi suggests poor to unsuitable water for drinking various other calculated hydrological indices mainly indicate the water is not suitable for the domestic and irrigation purposes since present study addresses the impact of dumping of coal fly ash on soil and groundwater quality proper understanding and management strategies for coal fly ash disposal must be

12291,an open and indiscriminate disposal of coal fly ash causes extensive changes in physicochemical properties of soil and water few studies propose that coal fly ash is a potential soil ameliorant that may improve the physical chemical biological properties and nutritional quality of the agricultural soil however several recent studies documented that incorporation of higher dosages of coal fly ash into water and soil releases toxic elements consequently creating soil and groundwater pollution leading to major health environmental and land use problems to assess the environmental impact of hazardous coal fly ash on the ecological system physicochemical and hydrogeochemical analysis of both soil and groundwater are performed x ray diffractograms xrd of soils from agricultural and landfill sites n 8 along with coal fly ash n 2 show the presence of characteristic minerals of coal fly ash and also toxic arsenic mineral phases suggesting the strong influence of hazardous coal fly ash on agricultural soil the hydrogeochemical parameters of groundwater samples n 27 are analyzed which show elevated concentrations of most of the major ions corresponding to higher values than maximum permissible levels of recommended drinking water standards by world health organization who and bureau of indian standards bis the water quality indices wqi suggests poor to unsuitable water for drinking conversely evaluation of various other hydrochemical indices calculated using elemental concentration of the groundwater samples demarcates contamination of water due to the open dumping of coal fly ash and therefore not desirable for drinking purposes keywords coal fly ash xrd hydrogeochemistry water quality index arsenic contamination water pollution 1 introduction coal fly ash is one of the major concerns for the scientific community as it is the foremost waste material produced by combustion of coal in a thermal power plant nayak et al 2015 the physicochemical characteristics of coal fly ash mainly belong to the type of coal and ignition conditions adriano et al 2002 basu et al 2009 the coal fly ash mainly contains si al and fe as a major element concentration along with substantial amount of ca na k and ti adriano et al 2002 asokan et al 2005 kanchan et al 2015 the ca in coal fly ash is found to be the dominant cation followed by mg na and k jala and goyal 2006 sajwan et al 2006 on the other hand al is typically bound in insoluble alumino silicate structures which substantially control the biological toxicity of coal fly ash jala and goyal 2006 olson et al 2017 the high concentration of elements in coal fly ash improves the edaphic characteristics of soil which in turn increases the crop yield blissett and rowson 2012 the coal fly ash has a great impact on agriculture due to its efficacy in the modification of soil health and crop performance by altering soil properties like bulk density soil texture water holding capacity soil ph biological properties and nutrient content gupta et al 2002 basu et al 2009 kaur and goyal 2015 however the utilization of coal fly ash provides some sustainable solutions in agriculture civil and industrial sectors jala and goyal 2006 basu et al 2009 pandey and singh 2010 blissett and rowson 2012 subsequently it also has great adverse effects on environment as it releases substantial amounts of trace metals like mo mn zn and cu along with significant amount of other toxic elements i e as cr co pb ni se which are major source of soil and water pollution sharma and kalra 2006 basu et al 2009 pandey et al 2011 ramya et al 2013 raju et al 2015 raja et al 2015 olson et al 2017 further among all toxic elements reported in coal fly ash arsenic is one of the most hazardous element for the terrestrial and aquatic life that consequently causes ecological problems pandey et al 2011 olson et al 2017 arsenic contamination has turned into a major global concern to researchers dealing with constantly growing pollution of soil water and crops mukherjee et al 2006 a recent study conducted by chandrashekhar et al 2016 on contamination and mobilization of arsenic in the soil and groundwater documents arsenic effect on the agriculture causing lung infections and skin diseases furthermore coal fly ash contains a high amount of soluble salts which support contaminants to move from soils into groundwater through leaching and results in water pollution jala and goyal 2006 thus disposal of huge amount of coal fly ash leads to the release of toxic elements which in turn contaminate soil and groundwater resulting in a potential environmental hazard bilski and alva 1995 ramya et al 2013 since coal fly ash has a great effect on the environment throughout the globe which disturbs the physiochemical properties of soil and alters the groundwater chemistry there is always a need for a study to assess the impact of coal fly ash disposal to alert the officials and to prevent further ecological damages in this regard several studies from the last two decades have been done which reports that the extensive amount of coal fly ash imposes serious environmental threat boyacioglu and boyacioglu 2007 pandey et al 2011 nalawade et al 2012 pomykała and mazurkiewicz 2015 on the other hand extensive research work have also been done to evaluate the hydrogeochemical properties of groundwater ravenscroft et al 2005 ghose et al 2009 umar and alam 2012 bikundia and mohan 2014 zaidi et al 2015 saba et al 2015 disli 2017 khan et al 2017 moreover very few studies have been done on both the soil and groundwater quality assessment in the vicinity of a coal fly ash landfill site ramya et al 2013 spadoni et al 2014 kanchan et al 2015 pal et al 2016 the present study has been carried out around coal fly ash landfill site of harduaganj thermal power station htps aligarh india lying in upper ganga basin aiming i to evaluate the potential impact of coal fly ash disposal on soil and groundwater quality and ii to assess soil composition and to determine hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater for the suitability of irrigational and domestic purposes 2 study area the geological hydrological context the study area 70 km2 specifically covers jawan block aligarh district 140 km away from new delhi and lies between latitude 27 5 to 28 5 n and longitude 78 2 to 78 14 e 178 m above mean sea level fig 1 it is located in an inter stream region where rivers sengar and kali define its western and eastern boundaries respectively the study area falls in a humid subtropical climate zone which is marked by cold winter and hot summer seasons typically of north central india the average minimum 10 c and maximum 45 c temperature persist in winter and summer seasons respectively june to september is marked as maximum rainfall months of the year the mean annual rainfall recorded at aligarh rain gauge station for a period of last 20 years 1998 2017 is 743 mm imd 2017 regardless of average rainfall in the study area greater than 90 water demand fulfilled by groundwater resources cgwb 2017 the agricultural sector of the study area mostly depends on the groundwater as its major source of irrigation water moreover the study area occupies interfluve region between the river yamuna and river ganga in upper ganga plains these rivers along with their tributaries like sengar and kali mainly control the drainage of the region ganga plain is a build up of quaternary alluvium and there is a little elevation change over a distance 170 210 m above mean sea level which makes it a rather flat plain the stratigraphical studies of this plain suggest that it is composed of clay silt sand gravel layers and marked by the presence of varying amount of calcareous nodules of quaternary alluvium sinha et al 2005 the major soil types are clayey silty and sandy mainly alfisol and ultisol order and the top soil is considered good for agricultural practices srivastava et al 2015 on the other hand to describe the hydrogeological setting two cross sections not shown here are drawn along line a b and c d see fig 1 for locations the cross section a b shows that the top clay layer is marked by 5 and 8 m thick towards east and west respectively the second layer is 62 m thick granular zone which acts as the first aquifer the cross section c d shows a generalized and more elaborate picture of the aquifer disposition in the study area the top clay layer varying in thickness from 12 to 7 m persists throughout the area and underlain by a thick granular zone which is approximately 55 m thick this study is restricted to shallow aquifers which are major source of the water requirement of the area for domestic and irrigational purposes 3 materials and methods the physicochemical and mineralogical analysis of coal fly ash n 2 and topsoil n 8 are performed on samples taken from the landfill site and surrounding agriculture fields respectively the coal fly ash and soil samples are oven dried at 60 c for about 24 h and thoroughly homogenized by coning and quartering method and then finely powdered and sieved the electrical conductivity ec and ph of the soil are measured at 1 5 and 1 2 ratio of sample to distilled water respectively this procedure is done with pre calibrated oakton pcs testr 35 the x ray diffraction xrd analysis of the coal fly ash and soil from agriculture and landfill sites along with two standards pure quartz and pure calcite were performed using x pert3 powder x ray diffractometer panalytical at department of earth sciences iit kanpur the measuring conditions are set as a source cu ka λ 1 54 å potential difference 40 kv current 30 ma scan speed 1 min step size 0 05 and 2ө range 5 60 a total of 27 representative groundwater samples are taken in polyethylene bottles after pumping the hand pump shallow aquifer well about a 3 5 minutes the physicochemical analyses are carried out based on the standard methods of the american public health association apha 2012 the major ion analyses are done at department of geology amu aligarh and department of earth sciences iit kanpur the electrical conductivity ec and ph of groundwater samples are determined by portable digital water analysis meter hach sension different methods are followed to measure the major ion and anion concentrations the titration method is used for ca2 and mg2 determination by using ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid edta cl is determinated by using agno3 and hco3 is determined by using hcl and methyl orange the flame emission photometry technique is used for na and k determination the gravimetric method is used for so4 2 whereas colorimetric methods are followed for the no3 using phenol disulphonic acid the total dissolved solids tds are measured by adding the all major ion and anion concentration different hydrochemical indices are calculated and used to evaluate groundwater class and their permissible limits to domestic and irrigational purposes 4 results and discussion 4 1 physicochemical and mineralogical analysis of coal fly ash and soil several physicochemical parameters of soil have a substantial role in sorption desorption of heavy metals in the soil which controls leaching and mobility of heavy metal into groundwater covelo et al 2007 the ph of agricultural soil ranges 6 4 8 0 which is due to probable mixing of basic salts from coal fly ash effluent the electrical conductivity ec values of the agricultural soil range from 3 5 to 16 6 ms cm suggesting the presence of salts in the soil one important aspect to understand soil pollution is characterizing soil mineral composition that affects the porosity permeability and metal retention capacity an attempt has been made to identify mineralogical composition through analysis of coal fly ash from the landfill site and its surrounding agricultural soil the x ray diffractograms of coal fly ash samples are shown in fig 2 which mainly reveals the presence of quartz sio2 peaks at 4 26 å 3 34 å 2 45 å 2 8 å 2 23 å 2 12 å and 1 81 å suggesting that it acts as a dominant primary mineral mixed layer peaks for quartz and mullite al6si2o13 are noticed at 2 28 å 2 23 å and 1 81 å the moderately sharp diffraction peaks for the minor minerals illite kal3si3o10 oh 2 layered aluminosilicate at 9 9 å magnetite fe3o4 at 4 97 å calcite caco3 at 3 85 å and 2 28 å hematite α fe2o3 at 3 75 å anhydrite caso4 at 3 68 å and rutile tio2 at 3 21 å and 2 24 å e g rivera et al 2015 due to the high concentration and intensity of primary minerals other mineral phases are not observed in coal fly ash xrd patterns the presence of carbonate mineral calcite indicates the alkaline nature of coal fly ash which can buffer soil system furthermore xrd analysis has been carried out on agricultural soil samples to infer the presence of coal fly ash in soil mineral phases the representative xrd patterns of bulk soil samples are shown in fig 3 these patterns mainly reveal the presence of quartz peaks at 4 26 å 3 34 å 2 45 å 2 8 å 2 23 å 2 12 å and 1 81 å respectively it is clear from xrd spectra of all the samples that quartz is dominating over all other mineral phases the illite peaks are noticed at 9 9 å 4 3 å and 1 5 å along with minor amounts of kaolinite at 7 71 å and 3 58 å goethite at 4 18 å and 1 71 å magnetite at 2 98 å ferrihydrite at 1 97 å and feldspar at 3 18 å and 2 72 å along with certain similar coal fly ash minerals see fig 2 in almost all soil samples presence of clay minerals illite and kaolinite suggests prominent chemical weathering of feldspar albite or k feldspar and mica muscovite these clay minerals are important for soil fertility and naturally have net negative charged particle surfaces that serve as potential sites for cation adsorption or nutrient storage paul et al 2015 on the other hand presence of moderately expansive clay minerals in the soil suggests high leaching potential and medium to low level of metal retention capacity of soils ljung et al 2006 paul et al 2015 excess leachate from coal fly ash often contains toxic elements mixed with water and soil which have an adverse impact on soil fertility and degrades natural water quality lin et al 2013 water act as a governing agent of mobilization of toxic elements such as arsenic under normal geological conditions according to pandey et al 2011 the arsenic is captured by calcite and hematite minerals also recognized in studied soil samples and forms a stable complex of ca or transition metal of fe hydroxyl arsenate hydrate m2 2fe3 aso4 3 oh 4 10h2o and other toxic compounds certain arsenic phases such as the bearsite be2 aso4 oh 4 h2o claudetite as2o3 and wallisite cu ag t1pbas2s5 are recognized in the studied soil samples see fig 3 suggests arsenic pollution in soil similar observations have also found in paddy soils from manipur india by chandrashekhar et al 2016 since the studied soil xrd spectra show the presence of certain coal fly ash minerals anhydrite rutile mullite and toxic arsenic mineral phases bearsite wallisite and claudetite suggesting a strong influence of coal fly ash disposal on soil which is hazardous to the environment and a matter of great concern to human health 4 2 physicochemical analysis of groundwater results of the physicochemical analysis of the groundwater samples are presented in table 1 the concentration of various elements are compared with the drinking water standards of the world health organization who 2011 and the bureau of indian standards bis 2012 which are given in table 2 the ph ranges from 7 5 to 8 2 average 7 9 suggest the groundwater is slightly alkaline in nature the ec values vary from 715 to 1308 average 999 µs cm indicating the elevated concentration of salt the ec has been referred to an index of salinity hazard wilcox 1955 the higher values of ec in water samples leads to the formation of saline soil in contrast higher sodium concentrations in water form alkaline soil on the basis of ec values wilcox 1955 classified the irrigation water into five classes or groups these are excellent ec 250 good 250 750 permissible 750 2250 doubtful 2250 5000 and unsuitable 5000 in the study area no sample falls under the excellent class and only 15 samples show good water class whereas more than 80 samples are in the range of permissible limits and 4 sample is in the doubtful class for irrigation purpose table 3 the entire sample population has tds 500 average 792 mg l which corresponds to higher tds than desirable limits of drinking water standards this implies that the high tds have a significant impact on the groundwater around the area under investigation after davies and wiest 1966 classification none of the studied water samples is desirable for drinking purpose and only 7 4 of samples are useful for irrigation purpose see table 3 the most probable inference of this is that the elements concentrated in coal fly ash got leached thereby altering the groundwater chemistry on the other hand hardness is a very useful parameter to determine the suitability of water for domestic irrigational and industrial purposes karanth 1987 alam 2014 the hardness of the groundwater samples varies from 196 to 368 average 263 mg l which exceeds the highest desirable level as described by who 2011 and bis 2012 overall the groundwater is hard to very hard suggesting weathering of calcium bearing minerals or input from landfill source according to the total hardness classification 74 and 26 of groundwater samples are hard and very hard respectively which are not considered good for domestic and agricultural use further different alkali cations concentrations show that the most abundant content of na ranging from 24 to 144 average 73 mg l whereas k varies from 6 to 48 average 14 mg l the higher concentration of na is attributed to cation exchange chemical dissolution of minerals and infiltration of salty water gautam et al 2015 rahman et al 2017 the mg2 and ca2 ranges from 26 to 75 average 49 mg l and 11 95 average 53 mg l respectively which are within the highest desirable limit in the studied groundwater samples the so4 2 and cl content varies from 130 to 437 average 286 mg l and 23 128 average 78 mg l respectively indicating the water is within the permissible limit the no3 varies from 3 to 21 average 10 mg l whereas hco3 ranges from 130 to 533 average 236 mg l which is under the maximum permissible level described by who 2011 and bis 2012 furthermore the relationship among the physicochemical parameters are evaluated based on correlation coefficients and are represented in table 4 this shows a strong correlation between tds and other major ions such as mg2 r 0 51 na r 0 64 k r 0 61 and hco3 r 0 73 indicating these are significantly taking part in the degradation of groundwater quality the high positive correlation between tds and mg2 na k and hco3 ions exhibits that the groundwater quality is controlled by these elements nagarajan et al 2010 alam 2014 dhanasekarapandian et al 2016 since the coal fly ash dump site is in the middle of the extensive agricultural land where a fair amount of nitrogen and potassium rich fertilizers are used potassium is held by clay particles in soil and it leaches through soil profile into the groundwater similarly chemical and organic fertilizers contribute nitrate that is likely the main reason for the positive correlation between nitrate and potassium further the high and significant correlation of bicarbonate ions r 0 73 suggests its dominant effect over all other alkali and alkaline earth metal ions which increase the ph value of the groundwater in such a way that the groundwater shows alkaline nature 4 2 1 hydrogeochemical characteristics and facies classification of groundwater the major anions and cations concentrations are plotted in meq l fig 4a 4h to know their relative proportions hco3 vs cl plot fig 4a suggests the abundance of hco3 over cl because almost all the samples 99 tend to cluster above equal concentration line 1 1 whereas relative proportion of cl and so4 2 fig 4b clearly indicates a high abundance of so4 2 in comparison to cl it is evident that the increase in the so4 2 concentration is caused by anthropogenic activities like industrial influents wastewater and organic matter deposition which contains sulphide jakóbczyk karpierz et al 2017 in alkali vs alkaline earth plot fig 4c all alkalis cluster below 1 1 line meaning that higher concentration of ca2 and mg2 this high concentration is more likely due to the presence of ca2 as a dominant cation of coal fly ash and or the occurrence of varying amount of calcareous nodules in aquifer horizons further the molar proportions of cl so4 2 vs hco3 shows the negligible amount of samples are hco3 dominant type water and the majority of samples are cl so4 2 type water fig 4d a general richness of ca2 mg2 is marked in all samples except very few samples which indicate the meteoric character of groundwater fig 4e since stoichio chemistry of carbonate weathering reactions demand that carbonate derived ca2 mg2 should be equal to carbonate derived bicarbonate however the plot of ca2 mg2 vs hco3 shows excess ca2 mg2 over hco3 fig 4e on the other hand the plot of ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 will be closed to 1 1 line if the dissolution of calcite dolomite and gypsum are dominant reactions in a system tiwari and singh 2014 and other references therein the plots of ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 from this study fig 4f shows an excess of hco3 so4 2 over ca2 mg2 therefore based on both the plots figs 4e 4f and geological set up of the study area rules out the role of carbonate weathering moreover alkalis have bonding affinity with cl and to assess their bonding affinities a plot fig 4g have been generated this represents almost all samples excluding a very few are likely found to be more biased towards alkalis as cl will form a complex salt with na k and the rest amount of cl will be there in the groundwater to make bonds with other ionic species saba et al 2015 on the other hand in na k vs so4 2 plot fig 4h almost all the samples exhibit a rich abundance of so4 2 over alkalis based on the dominant ionic concentration the groundwater samples are categorized into various hydrogeochemical facies these hydrogeochemical facies are marked by different zones which are characterized by particular cation and anion concentrations within distinct compositional categories in general these compositional categories correspond to a subdivision of trilinear diagram as given by back 1966 in this study the groundwater samples are classified by utilizing piper s trilinear diagram piper 1944 based on the piper diagram possible two kinds of dominant facies in the study area are mixed type and ca2 mg2 so4 2 type fig 5 the occurrence of these type of groundwater facies can be attributed to the dominance of processes like groundwater recharge irrigation return flow and ion exchange process raju et al 2015 4 2 2 mechanism controlling groundwater geochemistry the groundwater interaction with aquifer lithology rainfall and evaporation have a great control on hydrochemistry vis á vis water quality subramani et al 2010 vasanthavigar et al 2012 this mechanism can be determined by understanding the genesis of water which frequently inferred from gibb s diagram gibbs 1970 this diagram represents the plots of tds mg l vs the weight ratio of cations na k by na k ca2 and anions cl by cl hco3 as ratio 1 and ratio 2 respectively the hydrochemical data of groundwater samples of this study are plotted in gibb s diagram fig 6 the gibb s plot for this study shows that the ratio 1 varies from 0 37 to 0 93 average 0 60 whereas ratio 2 varies from 0 7 to 0 38 average 0 26 the ratio 1 fig 6a described that majority of the groundwater samples are rock dominance type whereas ratio 2 fig 6b suggests that the 85 of water samples are rock dominance and only 15 are of evaporate dominance therefore it can be interpreted that the main cause of rock dominance is due to the groundwater chemistry and which is dominated by the weathering reaction prevailing in the aquifer system 4 3 evaluation of groundwater quality for domestic and irrigation purposes the suitability of water used for domestic and irrigation purposes depends upon the elemental concentration of the water which has the direct impact on human health as well as on the soil fertility and plant growth rahman et al 2017 the following hydrochemical indices have been evaluated using elemental constituent of groundwater 4 3 1 water quality index wqi the wqi is a mathematical function which determines the quality of water in any ecosystem at a given time which denotes the integrated effect of the various parameters initially wqi was developed by horton 1965 taking into consideration of most significantly used variables of physical chemical and biological nature of water in relation to natural water quality wqi has been widely applied in the evaluation of the hydrochemical characteristic of water since last couple of decades in european african and asian countries dunnette 1979 dojlido et al 1994 sahu and sikdar 2008 ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 for wqi determination total 27 groundwater samples are used along with the given standards from who 2011 and bis 2012 a general approach given by vasanthavigar et al 2010 and cude 2001 is followed to calculate the wqi taking into consideration the most common factors which are described in three steps the 1st step is completed by assigning a weight wi factor to each parameter table 5 for the 2nd step a relative weight wi is calculated by the following equation wi wi i 1 n wi where wi is the weight of each parameter wi is relative weight and n is the number of parameters in the last 3rd step a quality rating scale qi to each parameter is assigned by diving its concentration ci in mg l by its respective standard si and multiplied by 100 the qi is calculated by the following equation q i c i s i 100 subsequently another important sub index sii is given to each parameter and finally used in the following equations to calculate wqi for the water samples of the study area si i w i q i wqi si i the wqi of the study area samples ranges from 79 to 120 average 98 3 and their classification is given in table 6 the calculated wqi suggest that the water quality around the landfill site is poor to unsuitable for drinking purposes see fig 7 this directly indicates that the water is contaminating from anthropogenic sources which can proportionally increase the risk of various health problems to mankind proper awareness and relevant corrective measures and regular monitoring must be adopted for sustainable water resources management 4 3 2 sodium adsorption ratio sar it is observed that the higher sodium adsorption ratio is associated with the less suitable water for irrigation richards 1954 the water containing the elevated values of sar is regularly used for irrigation leads to damage soil fertility this effect is documented by karanth 1987 and singh et al 2012 such that the high concentration of sodium in the water disrupts the ca2 and mg2 concentrations in agriculture soil this further destroys soil structure and tilth that leads to a decrease in the capability of soil to form stable soil aggregates increase intake of higher sar value water lowers the infiltration and permeability capacity of the soil which results in a decrease in crop production sar is referred to the index of sodium alkali hazard and commonly used in evaluating the irrigational water quality the sar is defined as per the following relationship by richards 1954 where concentrations are in meq l richards 1954 also described the suitability of water quality for irrigation purposes using ec vs sar values the calculated sar values of this study vary from 0 59 to 3 68 average 1 67 and presented in table 3 sar na ca mg 2 the sar values have been plotted in us salinity laboratory s diagram fig 8 this diagram has 16 subclasses that are used to rate the degree of extent corresponding particular water may prone to salinity problems our results show that the almost all the groundwater samples fall in elevated salinity class c3s1 one of the known sources of this high salinity is due to infiltration of leachate from coal fly ash landfill effluents the excess amount of salt present in water directly affects the permeability structure texture and aeration ability of the soil that corresponds to a reduction in soil fertility and plant growth todd 1980 karanth 1987 these processes create hard soils which are unfavorable for seed germination jameel and sirajudeen 2006 to overcome this type of situation soil amendments may be applied such as the addition of gypsum or lime umar et al 2001 4 3 3 residual sodium carbonate rsc the excess co3 hco3 over ca2 mg2 in groundwater samples affect the suitability of water for irrigation raghunath 1987 the water containing a high level of rsc index does not enhance the osmotic pressure to obstruct the off take of water by the plant roots unlike water having high salinity similarly when dissolved na in comparison with dissolved ca2 and mg2 exceeded in water the plant roots are unable to spread deeper into the soil due to lack of moisture groundwater with excess co3 and or hco3 leads to the precipitation of ca2 and or mg2 that subsequently produces concentrated water in contrast excess amount of nahco3 and co3 causes dissolution of organic matter present in the soil which in turn on drying leaves a black stain on the surface of the soil eaton 1950 the rsc values are calculated following the equation given by eaton 1950 here the concentrations are reported in meq l rsc co3 hco3 ca2 mg2 the classification of groundwater based on rsc values is given in table 3 based on rsc criteria it can be suggested that approximately 96 of the groundwater sample population fall in the safe category and 4 in marginally suitable 4 3 4 magnesium hazard mh magnesium hazard is a significant hydrochemical index to characterize the water quality for irrigation purposes an equilibrium state in most of the waters has been observed between ca2 and mg2 ions bikundia and mohan 2014 if soils have more of these ions which correspond to a reduction in crop production due to an increase in alkalinity of the soil kumar et al 2007 magnesium hazard value for irrigation water can be calculated from the following equation proposed by szabolcs and darab 1964 mh mg2 ca2 mg2 100 here all the ions are expressed in meq l in the present study the mh ratio varies from 42 09 to 91 83 average 59 60 percent table 3 in general the water samples containing mh value greater than 50 are suggested as harmful and unsuitable for agricultural purposes szabolcs and darab 1964 results show that more than 80 samples are unacceptable as permagnesium hazard ratio limit therefore based on the mh ratio the water samples from the study area are considered unsuitable for irrigation purposes 5 conclusion the present study is an attempt to assess the deterioration of agricultural soil and groundwater quality by dumping the coal fly ash in the vicinity of the thermal power plant this research work would provide significant evidence to the scientific community for taking adaptive measures in domestic and irrigation water quality management systems the major conclusions are as follows the physicochemical and mineralogical analysis of coal fly ash and agricultural soil samples collected in the vicinity of landfill site of harduaganj thermal power station aligarh india suggests that the topsoil is receiving an intake of excess elements from some anthropogenic sources the studied soil xrd patterns show the presence of certain coal fly ash minerals anhydrite rutile mullite and toxic arsenic mineral phases bearsite wallisite and claudetite implies the strong influence of coal fly ash disposal on soil which is hazardous to the environment and a matter of great concern to human health the physicochemical parameters of groundwater mostly exceed the concentration limits as suggested by the who 2011 and bis 2012 the water quality indices wqi suggests poor to unsuitable water for drinking various other calculated hydrological indices mainly indicate the water is not suitable for the domestic and irrigation purposes since present study addresses the impact of dumping of coal fly ash on soil and groundwater quality proper understanding and management strategies for coal fly ash disposal must be adopted to protect the environmental degradation and ecological system acknowledgments we are thankful to anonymous reviewers and editor in chief for their valuable suggestions and recommendation that

12292,arsenic in the soil environment has gained renewed interest because of the emerging cognizance that arsenic poisoning is a global concern groundwater in the bengal basin is significantly polluted by naturally occurring arsenic as a toxic metalloid which adversely affects human health and among the countries facing as contamination problems india and bangladesh are the most affected in soils and sediments arsenic is often associated with fe iii hydr oxides and multiple processes reactions govern its release into groundwater including abiotic or biotically mediated oxidation reduction and ligand exchange reactions reductive dissolution of arsenic bearing fe iii hydr oxides and as v reduction to as iii are the two main mechanisms controlling arsenic partitioning in soils sediments and groundwater even though arsenic reduction is favourable over a wide range of conditions fe iii reduction in nature is dependent on the biotic systems this review reflects the current state of research for the understanding of arsenic in the soil environment with an emphasis on iron based technologies for its removal it attempts to collate all the relevant literature such that it can be a useful resource for researchers or policy makers to help recognize and explore useful treatment options graphical abstract fx1 keywords bengal basin anoxic phase arsenite oxidation iron arsenic removal 1 introduction the costs of ingestion of arsenic for human health can be extremely serious and may extend from general malaise to death health effects of arsenic arise from its use as a poison its use in medicine its inclusion in various manufactured products accidental exposure from industrial and even from naturally occurring arsenic in soil and water hughes et al 2011 mandal and suzuki 2002 ng et al 2003 hughes 2002 aposhian and aposhian 2006 basu et al 2001 saha et al 1999 kapaj et al 2006 the term arsenicosis characterises the various clinical manifestations caused by chronic arsenic toxicity due to ingestion of arsenic over a long period but there is no standard definition of the symptoms of arsenic poisoning guha mazumder 2003 acute arsenic poisoning can be fatal but sudden demise is hardly ever caused by environmental sources ravenscroft et al 2009 the chronic poisoning impacts health by imposing dermatological effects carcinogenic effects and systemic non carcinogenic effects often only the dermatological manifestations can be traced definitely to arsenic poisoning in individuals the others being inferred from epidemiological studies ravenscroft et al 2009 bangladesh was ranked 12th worldwide on the united nations development programme human poverty index undp 1997 unfortunately the health effects of arsenic exposure increase poverty by decreasing productivity mathieu 2008 for instance arsenic induced skin lesions which primarily form on the hands and feet are painful and make manual labour difficult chronic illnesses such as cancers can make work impossible and ultimately shorten lifespans the net economic benefit of reducing drinking water arsenic concentrations to 50 ppb is 7 month household in west bengal india roy 2008 one main reason is that poor nutrition correlates with a likeliness to show symptoms of arsenic poisoning maharjan et al 2007 islam et al 2004 in addition the poor have less financial means to seek alternative water sources or receive medical treatment for symptoms of arsenic exposure thus the poor suffer most from arsenic poisoning much research has been carried out to understand the precise cause of presence of arsenic in the groundwater bhattacharya et al 1997 ahmed et al 2004 ahmad et al 2017 ravenscroft et al 2005 kocar et al 2008 polizzotto et al 2005 polizzotto et al 2008 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 nickson et al 2000 nickson et al 1998 harvey et al 2002 mcarthur et al 2001 zobrist et al 2000 van geen et al 2004 but there is little clarity in the various approaches adopted or the causes elucidated an attempt has been made here to review the present knowledge base and present it in a very concise manner so as to make the reader aware of the possible causes of arsenic presence in groundwater of poverty stricken areas of bengal basin also various technologies mohan and pittman 2007 sarkar et al 2005 2010 2012 misra et al 2010 padungthon et al 2014 2015 biswas et al 2012 von brömssen et al 2007 hossain et al 2014 ahmad et al 2017 exist for arsenic removal or for availing arsenic free drinking water but their suitability to all locations is not well defined hug et al 2008 sarkar et al 2010 an attempt has been made here to review available technologies for arsenic removal which would be suitable for the rural areas of the bengal basin 2 causes of arsenic retention and release in bengal basin soils and sediments arsenic contamination in the environment is predominantly geologic bhattacharya et al 1997 ahmed et al 2004 but sometimes increased by anthropogenic activity including arsenic containing pesticide application and mining and smelting smedley and kinniburgh 2002 several biogeochemical processes have been hypothesized so far to explain arsenic mobilization into environment including arsenic pyrite oxidation due to fluctuation of the water table chowdhury et al 2000 reductive dissolution of arsenic bearing fe iii hydr oxide minerals smedley and kinniburgh 2002 nickson et al 2000 1998 harvey et al 2002 mcarthur et al 2001 zobrist et al 2000 with concurrent arsenate reduction to arsenite arsenic desorption at high ph 8 5 darland and inskeep 1997 chemical weathering of silicate minerals neumann et al 2010 ion exchange by phosphate darland and inskeep 1997 by carbonate appelo and de vet 2003 by silicic acid waltham and eick 2002 and reduction of fe iii hydr oxide minerals by organic carbon redman et al 2002 the conceptual geochemical models are not yet well understood as arsenic adsorption occurs on many solid phases other than oxyhydroxides like magnetite siderite and apatite neumann et al 2010 swartz et al 2004 polizzotto et al 2006 fe iii hydr oxide minerals are considered as the major arsenic bearing minerals in bengal basin as well as other basins of south and southeast asia ravenscroft et al 2005 kocar et al 2008 polizzotto et al 2005 ahmed et al 2004 bhattacharya et al 1997 polizzotto et al 2008 in contrast geological evidence of very little fe iii hydr oxide minerals deposition in ganges delta sediments was also explained mcarthur et al 2004 the predominance of available experimental evidence supports the oxidation of natural organic matter nom with associated reduction of arsenic bearing fe minerals cause mobilization of arsenic and fe in holocene aquifers smedley and kinniburgh 2002 nickson et al 2000 1998 harvey et al 2002 mcarthur et al 2001 zobrist et al 2000 van geen et al 2004 microbial organic matter decomposition and an anoxic environment are the two preconditions for reductive dissolution of arsenic in holocene sediments hossain et al 2014 biswas et al 2012 an anoxic environment has been generated naturally in holocene aquifers by sediment burial benner and fendorf 2010 once the microbial o2 demand exceeds o2 diffusion rates under flooded conditions this leads to use of alternative electron acceptors starting with nitrate and manganese oxides to arsenic arsenate to arsenite and fe fe iii to fe ii reduction 3 organic carbon and arsenic cycling bengal basin grey aquifer sediments are high in natural organic matter nom content ravenscroft et al 2005 biswas et al 2012 solid phase arsenic content in aquifer sediments is strongly correlated with fe and organic carbon meharg et al 2006 importance of nom in arsenic retention and mobilization has been studied over the last decade the source of nom is still a point of controversy three major hypothesis have been postulated in literature so far i that organic carbon leaching from nearby peat lenses mcarthur et al 2004 ii that surfaced organic carbon from rice field organic rich pond and river sediments is drawn down during groundwater recharge due to groundwater irrigation for agriculture in dry season harvey et al 2002 neumann et al 2010 and iii co deposition of organic carbon and arsenic meharg et al 2006 decomposition and reframing of biogenic matter from plants animals and microbes leads to a complete mixture of varied organic molecules termed as nom wang and mulligan 2006 the properties of nom depend on qualities of the original material and the conditions and processes during its transformation in water nom is found as dissolved molecules colloids and particles and nom can be inter converted among these forms by different chemical processes including dissolution precipitation sorption desorption aggregation disaggregation perdue and ritchie 2003 dissolved organic carbon doc is the water soluble fraction of organic molecules that passes through a 0 45 µm filter doc includes molecules of different molecular weight and chemical structure such as sugars amino acids and refractory humic substances the doc concentration in natural water is highly variable depending on hydrological and biogeochemical conditions dissolved nom comprises majorly of humic substances owing to its recalcitrant nature and functional groups with multifarious properties thus these are important reactive species occurring in natural waters which significantly affects the biogeochemistry of metals and trace elements a low concentration of doc in groundwater 0 7 mg c l compared to river water 6 8 mg c l was also observed perdue and ritchie 2003 4 arsenic redox transformation and organic carbon reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides and oxidation of sulphur containing minerals are the two major redox reaction based hypothesis causing arsenic release from solid phase benner and fendorf 2010 however research findings over the last two decades have transferred the focus to organic carbon driven biogeochemical reduction of arsenic bearing oxyhydroxide minerals with concomitant dissolution of arsenite pollutant degradation and metal speciation are strongly influenced by redox reactions using doc as the electron donor redman et al 2002 redox active functionalities of doc are highly variable in its redox potential under different environmental conditions doc react by reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides with coupled as release harvey et al 2002 mcarthur et al 2004 kumar et al 2016 and therefore are a part of the reactions related to as speciation and transformation the redox speciation of inorganic elements like fe and cr by doc is found in some previous reports redman et al 2002 buschmann et al 2005 2006 palmer et al 2006 the microbial influence in redox reactions releasing as into environment is well documented kumar et al 2016 zobrist et al 2000 van geen et al 2004 rowland et al 2006 mclean et al 2006 the microbial processes require an electron donor such as doc charlet and polya 2006 arsenic release shows positive correlations with doc concentration in the aqueous environment for simulations of microbial action harvey et al 2002 rowland et al 2007 the nature availability and concentration of doc strictly control arsenic mobilization by microbial redox transformation postma et al 2007 in contrast it was also reported that desorption of arsenic from sediments collected from 30 m depth is an abiotic chemical process polizzotto et al 2006 also the variation in colour of the sand sediments from grey to brown due to microbial action on the organic content gave reliable inference regarding the presence or absence of arsenic in the groundwater biswas et al 2012 hossain et al 2014 ahmad et al 2017 5 sorption desorption of arsenic and organic carbon organic carbon is considered to have strong influence on the adsorption desorption of arsenic on clay mineral and metal oxides surfaces causing arsenic mobilization transport in the environment redman et al 2002 bauer blodau 2006 sharma et al 2011 nom functional groups are capable of sorption to fe oxides both in their outer sphere and inner sphere complexes or surfaces of colloidal clay kumar et al 2016 biswas et al 2012 von brömssen et al 2007 humic anion sorption on mineral surfaces restrain arsenic sorption or induces arsenic desorption in the system resulting in arsenic mobilization redman et al 2002 grafe et al 2002 besides this process arsenic association with colloidal particles has also been reported tadanier et al 2005 arsenic distribution in aqueous environment can be controlled by other complexation mechanisms including covalent bonds between arsenic and humic molecules buschman et al 2006 and ternary complexes between nom fe and arsenic redman et al 2002 sharma et al 2011 fe ions in aqueous solution bridging arsenic with nom has been recently studied by sharma et al 2010 2011 who reported 94 arsenic associated with colloidal fe nom and the rest 6 arsenic in the dissolved form 6 community vs domestic arsenic removal technologies an arsenic removal plant arp can be either community scale unit eg amal filter sarkar et al 2005 or a domestic unit eg kanchan filter ngai et al 2007 sono filter hussam and munir 2007 naval materials research laboratory defense research and development organization nmrl drdo filter misra et al 2010 the average total direct indirect water intake in bengal basin is approximately 23 12 l family day hossain et al 2013 the community scale units are generally capable of catering to 200 families daily water requirements sarkar et al 2010 whereas each domestic unit serves only one family thus to cater the same number of families 200 domestic units would have to be installed in developing countries a major issue of installation of treatment plants and their operation and maintenance is the high cost reisinger et al 2005 treatment plants installed by public authorities is an alternative which serves as a centralised facility but the distribution of treated water to each and every user remains the point of concern therefore there is a rising interest in developing low cost treatment units like domestic filters which can be installed at the users locations banerji and chaudhari 2017 while domestic scale units are initially easier to install compared to community scale systems the latter provide a more sustainable solution with respect to robust and regenerable adsorbent media collection and regeneration of exhausted media and ecologically safe containment of removed arsenic in addition to its potential for economic growth sarkar et al 2010 banerji and chaudhari 2017 it is known that domestic units have drawbacks namely bothersome maintenance high costs insufficient treatment rate and or reliance on materials unavailable in remote villages ngai et al 2007 thus regardless of the design system of domestic arsenic removal reliability and quality control is necessary and this can be attained by regular analysis of treated water for ph arsenic tds phosphate etc community scale units would require fewer samples for monitoring compared to domestic units thus water quality monitoring is easier in community scale in comparison to domestic units banerji and chaudhari 2017 also it is comparatively more manageable to introduce modifications and innovations in well head or community scale units for performance improvement sarkar et al 2010 domestic units using adsorbent media or coagulants will always generate arsenic laden sludge or solids bordoloi et al 2013 qiao et al 2012 coordinating collection and safe handling and disposal of sludge or used media from individual households poses a level of intricacy and enforcement effort which is difficult to sustain in far flung villages the community scale systems reduce such management problems sarkar et al 2012 both capital and operating costs of the community scale systems are significantly lower than the total sum of equivalent two hundred or more domestic units sarkar et al 2010 banerji and chaudhari 2017 because of these reasons interviews with a spectrum of stakeholders from government officials to householders have shown that community water treatment systems were preferred to household domestic systems johnston et al 2014 khan and yang 2014 7 technologies for arsenic removal arsenic concentrations in groundwater are greatly variable laterally on large bgs et al 2001 and small van geen et al 2003 spatial scales but exhibit a consistent vertical profile i e high arsenic 50 ppb rarely occurs at depths 150 m below ground surface bgs et al 2001 van geen et al 2003 harvey et al 2002 ravenscroft et al 2005 installing deeper household wells presently most are shallower than 100 m has been suggested as an easy way out that does not require expensive and large infrastructure opar et al 2007 ahmed et al 2006 ahmad et al 2017 deep wells would initially provide low arsenic groundwater and exhibit the least disease risk of domestic alternatives howard et al 2006 though this would provide low arsenic water for the short term arsenic is transported by groundwater and thus arsenic may migrate downward eventually contaminating the deeper water leading to arsenic in drinking water michael and voss 2008 burgess et al 2010 it is also possible to achieve 10 ppb as tot in treated water by simply using the groundwater iron to precipitate along with arsenic and filter the precipitates through a sand filter voegelin et al 2014 nitzsche et al 2015 but this approach would not work in bangladesh and the ganga meghna brambhaputa gmb plain as the average arsenic and phosphate concentrations found in these regions are quite high and the amount of iron required to remove arsenic to 10 ppb is not present in groundwater of this region hug et al 2008 researchers have evaluated arsenic removal by sand filters typically used for iron removal in vietnam and they mentioned that fe as ratios of 50 or 250 were required to ensure arsenic removal to levels below 50 or 10 ppb respectively berg et al 2006 however closer analysis of their data revealed that few of the sand filters could achieve less than 10 ppb for fe as ratio of around 10 thus it seems that in a continuous or semi continuous flow system through granular media possibly there are conditions under which arsenic removal by iron gets enhanced banerji and chaudhari 2017 chaudhari et al 2014 whilst the best solution to the arsenic problem is to switch over to treated surface water which does not have any arsenic contamination but development and maintenance of surface water based drinking water system for the entire population including household connections is costly time consuming requires more cumbersome maintenance and investment intensive sarkar et al 2010 another option can be the demarkation of safe aquifer s that can be drilled for tubewell installation hossain et al 2014 biswas et al 2012 von brömssen et al 2007 ahmad et al 2017 but this option also cannot be safely applied without adequate training and supervision hence with all these complications it is unlikely for developing countries like india and bangladesh to switch over to surface water or demarcate safe groundwater aquifers in a short time thus to meet the drinking water requirements till such a switch is possible construction of arsenic removal plants arps is required the established arsenic removal processes can broadly be classified into three process types co precipitation membrane and adsorption but these methods have inherent problems as outlined in table 1 thus new processes need to be developed which would address these issues 8 iron based arsenic removal system iron has a high affinity for arsenic and in most cases arsenic in nature is present bound to iron minerals iron based arsenic removal technologies make use of the strong natural chemical association of arsenic with iron removing arsenic by adsorption processes yuan et al 2002 sylvester et al 2007 badruzzaman et al 2004 or co precipitation using ferric or ferrous salts fuller et al 1993 meng et al 2000 roberts et al 2004 with many systems reporting 90 arsenic removal from treated water a range of inexpensive iron based water purification technologies have been developed to address the problem of arsenic contamination in groundwater many authors have examined the adsorption of arsenic by iron oxides ahmad et al 2017 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 mohan and pittman 2007 highlighting the tendency of arsenic to strongly bind to hydrous ferric oxides hfo as monodentate or bidentate inner sphere complexes even at very low aqueous arsenic concentrations the term hfo is quite loosely used in literature and it generally means any partially or fully hydrolysed precipitates of fe iii formed in the absence or presence of contaminant wilkie and hering 1996 jang et al 2008 hering et al 1997 a detailed review of the performance of many arsenic removal technologies including those utilizing iron as an adsorbent or precipitant is already in literature mohan and pittman 2007 most iron based treatment methods are more effective in removing as v rather than the more toxic as iii species as in aqueous phase with ph 8 and lowermost as iii exist as neutral molecule h3aso3 and so require oxidation as a pre treatment sorlini and gialdini 2010 the urge to innovate and upgrade has led to designing robust effective and economic devices for household use leading many researchers to examine the use of low cost local and or waste materials such as iron coated sand cast iron filings steel wool minerals and amended blast furnace slag which may be used in filters for arsenic removal joshi and chaudhuri 1996 leupin et al 2005 banerjee et al 2008 only groundwater iron is also being used for arsenic removal in domestic vietnamese sand filters berg et al 2006 voegelin et al 2014 nitzsche et al 2015 many of the adsorbent based technologies do however show significant potential for effective removal of arsenic from contaminated drinking water sarkar et al 2005 misra et al 2010 sarkar et al 2010 sarkar et al 2012 padungthon et al 2014 padungthon et al 2015 ahmad et al 2017 but may need to be relooked at considering the specific requirements of rural areas sengupta et al 2017 hossain et al 2014 9 effects of phosphate silicate and nom on arsenic removal by iron based technologies the arsenic contaminated areas in india are primarily agricultural and as phosphatic fertilizer use is quite abundant it is generally found in the groundwater along with arsenic kinniburgh et al 2003 phosphate and as v are structurally quite similar kish and viola 1999 the affinity of phosphate for sites on fe iii precipitates is similar to arsenate manning and goldberg 1996 ryden et al 1987 gao and mucci 2001 the influence of phosphate on adsorption of as iii and as v on ferrihydrite as a function of ph for p as tot ratios of 1 1 and 10 1 which is within the range reported in bangladesh bgs et al 2001 has been studied jain and loeppert 2000 they found that adsorption of both as v and as iii decreased with increasing po4 p concentration and for as v this was significant over the entire ph range they also report that neutral h3aso3 0 dominant at ph 7 is better able to compete with negatively charged phosphate species other researchers have found similar effects hongshao and stanforth 2001 elias et al 2012 biswas et al 2014 it has been reported that phosphate is the main factor limiting arsenic removal in fe ii co precipitation systems roberts et al 2004 further presence of phosphate would cause requirement of more time for fe ii oxidation as phosphate can complex with ferrous iron pryor and cohen 1951 phosphate adsorption kinetics often follows a complicated pattern with a rapid initial adsorption followed by a slow reaction that does not reach equilibrium up to the end of the experiment torrent et al 1992 during adsorption of phosphate and arsenate on goethite it was found that at a given total anion concentration the amount adsorbed was greater in the mixed ion system than in the single ion samples implying that there were sites on the surface that were specific for each ion as well as some nonspecific sites on which both ions could adsorb hingston et al 1971 as iii and as v removal by adsorption on ferric phosphate has also been reported lenoble et al 2005 but arsenic removal in their system was most probably occurring by chemical equilibrium reactions as phosphate was observed to get leached out silicate adversely affects arsenic removal by fe iii precipitates meng et al 2000 2002 bang et al 2005 biswas et al 2014 the iron oxide hydroxide surface has a strong affinity for silicate sigg and stumm 1981 however silicate adsorption is weaker than as v adsorption swedlund and webster 1999 silicic acid h4sio4 has been shown to effectively compete with arsenic for adsorption sites davis et al 2001 or may polymerize and coat the adsorption sites thereby reducing access to the adsorbate hence reducing the adsorption capacity of iron oxides christl et al 2012 as iii removal is not affected by silicate during co precipitation with fe ii but is negatively affected during co precipitation with fe iii as during co precipitation with fe ii as iii was oxidized and this did not happen during co precipitation with fe iii roberts et al 2004 co precipitation with fe ii is similar to electrocoagulation with fe electrodes ecfe banerji and chaudhari 2016 similarly silicate has very little effect on arsenic removal by ecfe as in this system as iii is oxidized and hence it was not showing any significant effect up to 20 mg l silicate wan et al 2011 banerji and chaudhari 2016 other researchers have reported high concentrations of silica polymerize to physically block access to sorption sites and not through competitive sorption zeng et al 2008 it has also been reported that silica significantly slowed fe ii oxidation to fe iii in aerated water at ph 6 5 rushing et al 2003 natural organic matter nom has been reported to cause reduction in arsenic removal efficiency by zero valent iron based processes giasuddin et al 2007 mak et al 2009 rao et al 2009 mak and lo 2011 tanboonchuy et al 2012 arsenic removal by fe was inhibited in the presence of humic acid ha representative nom compound due to the formation of soluble fe humate in aqueous solutions which suppressed the formation of ferric hydroxide tang et al 2014 more fe was required for arsenic removal when ha concentrations were higher when no more complexation with ha and dissolved fe was possible further fe ii dissolution produced fe iii hydr oxide which adsorbed arsenic giasuddin et al 2007 mak et al 2009 rao et al 2009 oxidation of nom can be achieved by fe iv graham et al 2010 which would reduce as iii oxidation and thus may reduce arsenic removal 10 chemical oxidation of as iii adsorption capacity of fe iii hydr oxide for as v is much higher than as iii hering et al 1996 but significant fraction of as iii occurs in natural ground water mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 leading to reduced arsenic removal and thereby non compliance of drinking water standards moreover as iii is more toxic than as v hence its removal is of prime importance korte and fernando 1991 henceforth as an initial step oxidation of as iii to as v by chemical oxidants has been suggested ghurye and clifford 2004 as iii can be oxidized by strong oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide ozone chlorine potassium permanganate or ferrate kim and nriagu 2000 lee et al 2003 bissen and frimmel 2003 ghurye and clifford 2004 sorlini and gialdini 2010 lescano et al 2011 the possible oxidants along with their benefits and drawbacks are listed in table 2 11 co oxidation of as iii to as v during fe ii oxidation oxidation of as iii to as v was found during the corrosion of iron powder and filings under aerobic conditions within 4 7 5 days manning et al 2002 various studies report that arsenic is oxidized in parallel to the oxidation of dissolved fe ii by do most likely by reactive intermediates such as fe iv hug et al 2001 hug and leupin 2003 roberts et al 2004 studies show that as iii is oxidized during fe 0 corrosion on a time scale of several hours leupin and hug 2005 overall reactions proposed by them include 1 fe 2h2o ½ o2 fe2 h2o 2oh 2 fe2 ¼ o2 h2o fe3 ½ h2o oh 3 fe3 3h2o fe oh 3 3h 4 as3 intermediates oh fe4 as4 5 as4 o2 as5 o2 the fe ii catalyzed as iii oxidation mechanism has been described in detail elsewhere hug and leupin 2003 many other researchers have postulated the formation of fe iv and as iv as intermediates of oxidation of as iii to as v during oxidation of fe ii to fe iii as detailed below the sequence begins with a series of one electron transfers in which molecular oxygen is reduced to superoxide and hydrogen peroxide as fe ii is oxidized to fe iii after fe ii is dissolved from the anode in ecfe or is added in systems with fe ii dosing as outlined in supporting information t1 the reaction of fe ii and fe oh with hydrogen peroxide occurs producing the intermediates int which quickly degrade to form a reactive oxidizing species fe iv the nature of the intermediates has been suggested to be fe oh ho2 h2o 4 and fe iv thought to exist as fe oh 3 h2o 4 bossmann et al 1998 these two species interconvert rapidly enough such that they are in equilibrium at acidic ph the hydroxyl radical is formed along with fe iii rigg et al 1954 since the ph of groundwater is typically higher ph 6 8 fe iv species is of greater importance as the oxidizing radical in the arsenic removal systems using fe based technologies hug and leupin 2003 the fe iv species is less prone to scavenging by dissolved organic species than the hydroxyl radical hug and leupin 2003 another sequence of one electron transfers after the formation of the fe iv species oxidizes as iii to as iv as fe iv is reduced to fe iii and then as iv is oxidized to as v as molecular oxygen is reduced to superoxide or might be more fe iv oxidizes this as iv species to as v as shown in supporting information t1 alternatively the fe iv can also be reduced by fe ii to form fe iii as fe ii is oxidized to fe iii most possible as iii and fe ii oxidation reactions have been tabulated in supporting information t1 oxidizing potential of fe4 aq fe iii aq 1 4 at ph 7 bossmann et al 1998 and the references therein addition of fe ii in multiple doses with sufficient time for fe ii oxidation leads to higher fractions of oxidized as iii than one single addition of the same total amount of fe ii roberts et al 2004 the reason is that fe ii itself consumes oxidizing species and outcompetes as iii at the usually higher fe ii concentrations leupin and hug 2005 thus the effect of fe ii concentration on the overall process is difficult to predict quantitatively the oxidation of as iii is optimal with prolonged low concentrations of fe ii which is continuously oxidized by dissolved oxygen as in ecfe during ecfe as fe ii is continuously added the reactions forming fe iv which led to as iii oxidation are expected banerji and chaudhari 2016 accordingly as iii oxidation during ecfe was negligible if fe ii oxidation was suppressed by the addition of 3 mm 2 2 bipyridine and that in ecfe systems fe iv and not oh is the most likely oxidant for as iii as negligible effect of 2 propanol on as iii oxidation was observed li et al 2012 12 adsorption vs co precipitation literature dealing with arsenic removal using iron based technologies generally refers to two possible routes they use either co precipitation with fe iii precipitates or adsorption onto pre formed adsorbents in co precipitation fe iii precipitates are formed in the presence of arsenic oxyanions leading to incomplete hydrolysis of fe iii i e formation of fractions of feoh2 fe2 oh 2 4 fe oh 2 fe oh 3 and fe oh 4 and these hydrolysed fe iii forms then complexed with arsenic fuller et al 1993 stefánsson 2007 during adsorption onto pre formed adsorbent iron hydr oxides are formed prior to the addition of arsenic the adsorbent ageing period before the arsenic is added allows some time for aggregation of the adsorbent and crystallite growth to occur both processes which tend to decrease the number of adsorption sites fuller et al 1993 waychunas et al 1993 if however a sorbing ion is present in solution during the hydrolysis and precipitation of fe iii hydr oxides as in co precipitation then the ion may sorb to surface sites before aggregates are formed this maximizes the number of available surface sites increasing the sorptive capacity of the fe iii hydr oxides fuller et al 1993 in a situation where there is continuous in situ formation of adsorbent in presence of the adsorbate a situation may arise when the adsorbate due to less concentration starts to adsorb and not co precipitate fuller et al 1993 waychunas et al 1993 crawford et al 1993a b opiso et al 2009 wogelius 2013 chaudhari et al 2014 park et al 2016 it is quite difficult to differentiate at which concentration adsorption predominates and at which concentration co precipitation predominates chaudhari et al 2014 banerji and chaudhari 2016 13 use of zero valent iron for arsenic removal the use of zero valent iron zvi i e fe 0 to remove arsenic has been investigated by many groups farrell et al 2001 manning et al 2002 melitas et al 2002 nikolaidis et al 2003 bang et al 2005 katsoyiannis et al 2008 the exposed surface area of zvi plays a major role in both the removal kinetics and capacities corrosion of zvi and subsequent oxidation of fe ii by dissolved oxygen produces fe iii precipitates which can complex with as v bang et al 2005 arsenic forms mono and bi dentate complexes with iron oxides produced from iron corrosion lackovic et al 2000 farrell et al 2001 kumar et al 2014 the rate of fe iii hydr oxide formation from zvi is directly related to the corrosion rate and higher corrosion rate leads to higher amount of fe iii hydr oxide which leads to more arsenic removal bang et al 2005 once fe ii is produced from zvi the fe ii and as iii oxidation and complexation precipitation reactions are the same as ecfe only difference between ecfe and zvi is that fe ii dissolution in ecfe is controlled by current and is uncontrolled in zvi the arsenic removal rate of zvi is dependent on dissolved oxygen concentration as well as ph with the required contact time for removal increasing significantly as do is decreased or ph is increased bang et al 2005 lackovic et al 2000 it was reported that after 9 h of reaction with 1 g l zvi filings in presence of do 99 8 removal was achieved for initial as v concentrations of 100 µg l at ph 6 while only 55 5 and 2 were removed at ph 7 and 8 respectively and 99 8 of as v was removed at ph 6 in solution open to air compared to only 9 in ph 6 anoxic solution bang et al 2005 under anoxic conditions iron oxide such as magnetite fe3o4 can be formed on the fe 0 particle surface kumar et al 2014 the reduction of as iii and as v to as 0 by zvi is thermodynamically favourable bang et al 2005 however it was also reported that no measurable reduction of as v to as iii was observed farrell et al 2001 manning et al 2002 nanoscale 1 120 nm diameter zero valent iron for rapid first order as iii and as v removal kobs 0 07 1 3 min 1 with inner sphere surface complexation mechanism was synthesized and this rate was found to be about 1000 times faster than that of micron sized iron su and puls 2001 it is important to note that the corrosion rate is very sensitive to surface area in the limit of a low ratio of adsorbing species to adsorption sites the arsenic removal rate is limited by mass transfer to adsorption sites and therefore exhibits first order dependence on arsenic concentration farrell et al 2001 melitas et al 2002 however at high solution concentrations removal becomes limited by the rate of adsorption site generation related to the corrosion rate and fe iii hydr oxide formation rate and is zero order in arsenic concentration farrell et al 2001 melitas et al 2002 with 200 days of operation 18 000 mg arsenic 1 3 ratio of as iii as v was reported to be removed using 400 g zvi filings a capacity of 45 mg as g fe bang et al 2005 however breakthrough of arsenic began to occur after only 100 days indicating that filings would have to be replaced long before the capacity was reached various researchers have also mentioned the possibility of oxidation of as iii during arsenic removal by zvi leupin et al 2005 katsoyiannis et al 2008 banerji and chaudhari 2016 banerji and chaudhari 2017 14 arsenic removal by electrocoagulation with iron electrodes ecfe electrocoagulation using iron electrodes ecfe is an emerging technology which has shown lot of promise for arsenic removal arsenic removal efficiency increases in the sequence aluminium titanium iron when using monopolar electrodes kumar et al 2004 it has been reported by some authors that as iii oxidation is possible in ecfe kumar et al 2004 lakshmipathiraj et al 2010 wan et al 2011 banerji and chaudhari 2016 while others report on the contrary lakshmanan et al 2008 lakshmanan et al 2010 amrose et al 2014 during ecfe fe ii is dissolved from the anode when current is passed this fe ii oxidizes to fe iii in the presence of do during formation of fe ii to fe iii some fe iv might be forming which is an oxidizing radicle and has been reported to be able to oxidize as iii to as iv which is quickly converted to as v in the presence of do hug and leupin 2003 leupin and hug 2005 li et al 2012 amrose et al 2013 banerji and chaudhari 2016 thus oxidation of as iii and its removal can be achieved in ecfe without the addition of any chemicals this method promises to be the most efficient with respect to arsenic removal unit weight of iron added 15 conclusion low income regions in bengal basin face arsenic problems mostly caused by geogenic groundwater contamination this review paper looked into the various theories of geogenic contamination of groundwater by arsenic reduction of fe iii hydr oxide by microorganisms followed by desorption of arsenic from the iron surface has been identified as the main mechanism of arsenic contamination in groundwater in the bengal basin this review also sums up the iron based arsenic removal technologies currently being investigated for drinking waters with a special focus on economically depressed regions these regions need low cost effective technologies that can be readily available at the household or community level based on the simplicity and ease of availability of raw materials a low cost effective user friendly community based filter for arsenic removal based on fe may be developed which can be fitted with a hand pump the treatment technology must be applicable over the broad range of arsenic concentrations found in groundwater and should also be able to achieve as iii oxidation the materials for the treatment should be economical and easily obtainable in indian villages and or suitable for reuse thus zvi and ecfe are two technologies that are showing maximum promise for effective arsenic removal in the economically backward areas of india hence this review has summarized principles of conventional technologies currently described in the literature for arsenic removal that can be used in the developing countries compared them with the ideal technology requirement and discussed their advantages and disadvantages along with a brief analysis of cause of arsenic presence in groundwater appendix a supplementary

12292,arsenic in the soil environment has gained renewed interest because of the emerging cognizance that arsenic poisoning is a global concern groundwater in the bengal basin is significantly polluted by naturally occurring arsenic as a toxic metalloid which adversely affects human health and among the countries facing as contamination problems india and bangladesh are the most affected in soils and sediments arsenic is often associated with fe iii hydr oxides and multiple processes reactions govern its release into groundwater including abiotic or biotically mediated oxidation reduction and ligand exchange reactions reductive dissolution of arsenic bearing fe iii hydr oxides and as v reduction to as iii are the two main mechanisms controlling arsenic partitioning in soils sediments and groundwater even though arsenic reduction is favourable over a wide range of conditions fe iii reduction in nature is dependent on the biotic systems this review reflects the current state of research for the understanding of arsenic in the soil environment with an emphasis on iron based technologies for its removal it attempts to collate all the relevant literature such that it can be a useful resource for researchers or policy makers to help recognize and explore useful treatment options graphical abstract fx1 keywords bengal basin anoxic phase arsenite oxidation iron arsenic removal 1 introduction the costs of ingestion of arsenic for human health can be extremely serious and may extend from general malaise to death health effects of arsenic arise from its use as a poison its use in medicine its inclusion in various manufactured products accidental exposure from industrial and even from naturally occurring arsenic in soil and water hughes et al 2011 mandal and suzuki 2002 ng et al 2003 hughes 2002 aposhian and aposhian 2006 basu et al 2001 saha et al 1999 kapaj et al 2006 the term arsenicosis characterises the various clinical manifestations caused by chronic arsenic toxicity due to ingestion of arsenic over a long period but there is no standard definition of the symptoms of arsenic poisoning guha mazumder 2003 acute arsenic poisoning can be fatal but sudden demise is hardly ever caused by environmental sources ravenscroft et al 2009 the chronic poisoning impacts health by imposing dermatological effects carcinogenic effects and systemic non carcinogenic effects often only the dermatological manifestations can be traced definitely to arsenic poisoning in individuals the others being inferred from epidemiological studies ravenscroft et al 2009 bangladesh was ranked 12th worldwide on the united nations development programme human poverty index undp 1997 unfortunately the health effects of arsenic exposure increase poverty by decreasing productivity mathieu 2008 for instance arsenic induced skin lesions which primarily form on the hands and feet are painful and make manual labour difficult chronic illnesses such as cancers can make work impossible and ultimately shorten lifespans the net economic benefit of reducing drinking water arsenic concentrations to 50 ppb is 7 month household in west bengal india roy 2008 one main reason is that poor nutrition correlates with a likeliness to show symptoms of arsenic poisoning maharjan et al 2007 islam et al 2004 in addition the poor have less financial means to seek alternative water sources or receive medical treatment for symptoms of arsenic exposure thus the poor suffer most from arsenic poisoning much research has been carried out to understand the precise cause of presence of arsenic in the groundwater bhattacharya et al 1997 ahmed et al 2004 ahmad et al 2017 ravenscroft et al 2005 kocar et al 2008 polizzotto et al 2005 polizzotto et al 2008 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 nickson et al 2000 nickson et al 1998 harvey et al 2002 mcarthur et al 2001 zobrist et al 2000 van geen et al 2004 but there is little clarity in the various approaches adopted or the causes elucidated an attempt has been made here to review the present knowledge base and present it in a very concise manner so as to make the reader aware of the possible causes of arsenic presence in groundwater of poverty stricken areas of bengal basin also various technologies mohan and pittman 2007 sarkar et al 2005 2010 2012 misra et al 2010 padungthon et al 2014 2015 biswas et al 2012 von brömssen et al 2007 hossain et al 2014 ahmad et al 2017 exist for arsenic removal or for availing arsenic free drinking water but their suitability to all locations is not well defined hug et al 2008 sarkar et al 2010 an attempt has been made here to review available technologies for arsenic removal which would be suitable for the rural areas of the bengal basin 2 causes of arsenic retention and release in bengal basin soils and sediments arsenic contamination in the environment is predominantly geologic bhattacharya et al 1997 ahmed et al 2004 but sometimes increased by anthropogenic activity including arsenic containing pesticide application and mining and smelting smedley and kinniburgh 2002 several biogeochemical processes have been hypothesized so far to explain arsenic mobilization into environment including arsenic pyrite oxidation due to fluctuation of the water table chowdhury et al 2000 reductive dissolution of arsenic bearing fe iii hydr oxide minerals smedley and kinniburgh 2002 nickson et al 2000 1998 harvey et al 2002 mcarthur et al 2001 zobrist et al 2000 with concurrent arsenate reduction to arsenite arsenic desorption at high ph 8 5 darland and inskeep 1997 chemical weathering of silicate minerals neumann et al 2010 ion exchange by phosphate darland and inskeep 1997 by carbonate appelo and de vet 2003 by silicic acid waltham and eick 2002 and reduction of fe iii hydr oxide minerals by organic carbon redman et al 2002 the conceptual geochemical models are not yet well understood as arsenic adsorption occurs on many solid phases other than oxyhydroxides like magnetite siderite and apatite neumann et al 2010 swartz et al 2004 polizzotto et al 2006 fe iii hydr oxide minerals are considered as the major arsenic bearing minerals in bengal basin as well as other basins of south and southeast asia ravenscroft et al 2005 kocar et al 2008 polizzotto et al 2005 ahmed et al 2004 bhattacharya et al 1997 polizzotto et al 2008 in contrast geological evidence of very little fe iii hydr oxide minerals deposition in ganges delta sediments was also explained mcarthur et al 2004 the predominance of available experimental evidence supports the oxidation of natural organic matter nom with associated reduction of arsenic bearing fe minerals cause mobilization of arsenic and fe in holocene aquifers smedley and kinniburgh 2002 nickson et al 2000 1998 harvey et al 2002 mcarthur et al 2001 zobrist et al 2000 van geen et al 2004 microbial organic matter decomposition and an anoxic environment are the two preconditions for reductive dissolution of arsenic in holocene sediments hossain et al 2014 biswas et al 2012 an anoxic environment has been generated naturally in holocene aquifers by sediment burial benner and fendorf 2010 once the microbial o2 demand exceeds o2 diffusion rates under flooded conditions this leads to use of alternative electron acceptors starting with nitrate and manganese oxides to arsenic arsenate to arsenite and fe fe iii to fe ii reduction 3 organic carbon and arsenic cycling bengal basin grey aquifer sediments are high in natural organic matter nom content ravenscroft et al 2005 biswas et al 2012 solid phase arsenic content in aquifer sediments is strongly correlated with fe and organic carbon meharg et al 2006 importance of nom in arsenic retention and mobilization has been studied over the last decade the source of nom is still a point of controversy three major hypothesis have been postulated in literature so far i that organic carbon leaching from nearby peat lenses mcarthur et al 2004 ii that surfaced organic carbon from rice field organic rich pond and river sediments is drawn down during groundwater recharge due to groundwater irrigation for agriculture in dry season harvey et al 2002 neumann et al 2010 and iii co deposition of organic carbon and arsenic meharg et al 2006 decomposition and reframing of biogenic matter from plants animals and microbes leads to a complete mixture of varied organic molecules termed as nom wang and mulligan 2006 the properties of nom depend on qualities of the original material and the conditions and processes during its transformation in water nom is found as dissolved molecules colloids and particles and nom can be inter converted among these forms by different chemical processes including dissolution precipitation sorption desorption aggregation disaggregation perdue and ritchie 2003 dissolved organic carbon doc is the water soluble fraction of organic molecules that passes through a 0 45 µm filter doc includes molecules of different molecular weight and chemical structure such as sugars amino acids and refractory humic substances the doc concentration in natural water is highly variable depending on hydrological and biogeochemical conditions dissolved nom comprises majorly of humic substances owing to its recalcitrant nature and functional groups with multifarious properties thus these are important reactive species occurring in natural waters which significantly affects the biogeochemistry of metals and trace elements a low concentration of doc in groundwater 0 7 mg c l compared to river water 6 8 mg c l was also observed perdue and ritchie 2003 4 arsenic redox transformation and organic carbon reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides and oxidation of sulphur containing minerals are the two major redox reaction based hypothesis causing arsenic release from solid phase benner and fendorf 2010 however research findings over the last two decades have transferred the focus to organic carbon driven biogeochemical reduction of arsenic bearing oxyhydroxide minerals with concomitant dissolution of arsenite pollutant degradation and metal speciation are strongly influenced by redox reactions using doc as the electron donor redman et al 2002 redox active functionalities of doc are highly variable in its redox potential under different environmental conditions doc react by reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides with coupled as release harvey et al 2002 mcarthur et al 2004 kumar et al 2016 and therefore are a part of the reactions related to as speciation and transformation the redox speciation of inorganic elements like fe and cr by doc is found in some previous reports redman et al 2002 buschmann et al 2005 2006 palmer et al 2006 the microbial influence in redox reactions releasing as into environment is well documented kumar et al 2016 zobrist et al 2000 van geen et al 2004 rowland et al 2006 mclean et al 2006 the microbial processes require an electron donor such as doc charlet and polya 2006 arsenic release shows positive correlations with doc concentration in the aqueous environment for simulations of microbial action harvey et al 2002 rowland et al 2007 the nature availability and concentration of doc strictly control arsenic mobilization by microbial redox transformation postma et al 2007 in contrast it was also reported that desorption of arsenic from sediments collected from 30 m depth is an abiotic chemical process polizzotto et al 2006 also the variation in colour of the sand sediments from grey to brown due to microbial action on the organic content gave reliable inference regarding the presence or absence of arsenic in the groundwater biswas et al 2012 hossain et al 2014 ahmad et al 2017 5 sorption desorption of arsenic and organic carbon organic carbon is considered to have strong influence on the adsorption desorption of arsenic on clay mineral and metal oxides surfaces causing arsenic mobilization transport in the environment redman et al 2002 bauer blodau 2006 sharma et al 2011 nom functional groups are capable of sorption to fe oxides both in their outer sphere and inner sphere complexes or surfaces of colloidal clay kumar et al 2016 biswas et al 2012 von brömssen et al 2007 humic anion sorption on mineral surfaces restrain arsenic sorption or induces arsenic desorption in the system resulting in arsenic mobilization redman et al 2002 grafe et al 2002 besides this process arsenic association with colloidal particles has also been reported tadanier et al 2005 arsenic distribution in aqueous environment can be controlled by other complexation mechanisms including covalent bonds between arsenic and humic molecules buschman et al 2006 and ternary complexes between nom fe and arsenic redman et al 2002 sharma et al 2011 fe ions in aqueous solution bridging arsenic with nom has been recently studied by sharma et al 2010 2011 who reported 94 arsenic associated with colloidal fe nom and the rest 6 arsenic in the dissolved form 6 community vs domestic arsenic removal technologies an arsenic removal plant arp can be either community scale unit eg amal filter sarkar et al 2005 or a domestic unit eg kanchan filter ngai et al 2007 sono filter hussam and munir 2007 naval materials research laboratory defense research and development organization nmrl drdo filter misra et al 2010 the average total direct indirect water intake in bengal basin is approximately 23 12 l family day hossain et al 2013 the community scale units are generally capable of catering to 200 families daily water requirements sarkar et al 2010 whereas each domestic unit serves only one family thus to cater the same number of families 200 domestic units would have to be installed in developing countries a major issue of installation of treatment plants and their operation and maintenance is the high cost reisinger et al 2005 treatment plants installed by public authorities is an alternative which serves as a centralised facility but the distribution of treated water to each and every user remains the point of concern therefore there is a rising interest in developing low cost treatment units like domestic filters which can be installed at the users locations banerji and chaudhari 2017 while domestic scale units are initially easier to install compared to community scale systems the latter provide a more sustainable solution with respect to robust and regenerable adsorbent media collection and regeneration of exhausted media and ecologically safe containment of removed arsenic in addition to its potential for economic growth sarkar et al 2010 banerji and chaudhari 2017 it is known that domestic units have drawbacks namely bothersome maintenance high costs insufficient treatment rate and or reliance on materials unavailable in remote villages ngai et al 2007 thus regardless of the design system of domestic arsenic removal reliability and quality control is necessary and this can be attained by regular analysis of treated water for ph arsenic tds phosphate etc community scale units would require fewer samples for monitoring compared to domestic units thus water quality monitoring is easier in community scale in comparison to domestic units banerji and chaudhari 2017 also it is comparatively more manageable to introduce modifications and innovations in well head or community scale units for performance improvement sarkar et al 2010 domestic units using adsorbent media or coagulants will always generate arsenic laden sludge or solids bordoloi et al 2013 qiao et al 2012 coordinating collection and safe handling and disposal of sludge or used media from individual households poses a level of intricacy and enforcement effort which is difficult to sustain in far flung villages the community scale systems reduce such management problems sarkar et al 2012 both capital and operating costs of the community scale systems are significantly lower than the total sum of equivalent two hundred or more domestic units sarkar et al 2010 banerji and chaudhari 2017 because of these reasons interviews with a spectrum of stakeholders from government officials to householders have shown that community water treatment systems were preferred to household domestic systems johnston et al 2014 khan and yang 2014 7 technologies for arsenic removal arsenic concentrations in groundwater are greatly variable laterally on large bgs et al 2001 and small van geen et al 2003 spatial scales but exhibit a consistent vertical profile i e high arsenic 50 ppb rarely occurs at depths 150 m below ground surface bgs et al 2001 van geen et al 2003 harvey et al 2002 ravenscroft et al 2005 installing deeper household wells presently most are shallower than 100 m has been suggested as an easy way out that does not require expensive and large infrastructure opar et al 2007 ahmed et al 2006 ahmad et al 2017 deep wells would initially provide low arsenic groundwater and exhibit the least disease risk of domestic alternatives howard et al 2006 though this would provide low arsenic water for the short term arsenic is transported by groundwater and thus arsenic may migrate downward eventually contaminating the deeper water leading to arsenic in drinking water michael and voss 2008 burgess et al 2010 it is also possible to achieve 10 ppb as tot in treated water by simply using the groundwater iron to precipitate along with arsenic and filter the precipitates through a sand filter voegelin et al 2014 nitzsche et al 2015 but this approach would not work in bangladesh and the ganga meghna brambhaputa gmb plain as the average arsenic and phosphate concentrations found in these regions are quite high and the amount of iron required to remove arsenic to 10 ppb is not present in groundwater of this region hug et al 2008 researchers have evaluated arsenic removal by sand filters typically used for iron removal in vietnam and they mentioned that fe as ratios of 50 or 250 were required to ensure arsenic removal to levels below 50 or 10 ppb respectively berg et al 2006 however closer analysis of their data revealed that few of the sand filters could achieve less than 10 ppb for fe as ratio of around 10 thus it seems that in a continuous or semi continuous flow system through granular media possibly there are conditions under which arsenic removal by iron gets enhanced banerji and chaudhari 2017 chaudhari et al 2014 whilst the best solution to the arsenic problem is to switch over to treated surface water which does not have any arsenic contamination but development and maintenance of surface water based drinking water system for the entire population including household connections is costly time consuming requires more cumbersome maintenance and investment intensive sarkar et al 2010 another option can be the demarkation of safe aquifer s that can be drilled for tubewell installation hossain et al 2014 biswas et al 2012 von brömssen et al 2007 ahmad et al 2017 but this option also cannot be safely applied without adequate training and supervision hence with all these complications it is unlikely for developing countries like india and bangladesh to switch over to surface water or demarcate safe groundwater aquifers in a short time thus to meet the drinking water requirements till such a switch is possible construction of arsenic removal plants arps is required the established arsenic removal processes can broadly be classified into three process types co precipitation membrane and adsorption but these methods have inherent problems as outlined in table 1 thus new processes need to be developed which would address these issues 8 iron based arsenic removal system iron has a high affinity for arsenic and in most cases arsenic in nature is present bound to iron minerals iron based arsenic removal technologies make use of the strong natural chemical association of arsenic with iron removing arsenic by adsorption processes yuan et al 2002 sylvester et al 2007 badruzzaman et al 2004 or co precipitation using ferric or ferrous salts fuller et al 1993 meng et al 2000 roberts et al 2004 with many systems reporting 90 arsenic removal from treated water a range of inexpensive iron based water purification technologies have been developed to address the problem of arsenic contamination in groundwater many authors have examined the adsorption of arsenic by iron oxides ahmad et al 2017 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 mohan and pittman 2007 highlighting the tendency of arsenic to strongly bind to hydrous ferric oxides hfo as monodentate or bidentate inner sphere complexes even at very low aqueous arsenic concentrations the term hfo is quite loosely used in literature and it generally means any partially or fully hydrolysed precipitates of fe iii formed in the absence or presence of contaminant wilkie and hering 1996 jang et al 2008 hering et al 1997 a detailed review of the performance of many arsenic removal technologies including those utilizing iron as an adsorbent or precipitant is already in literature mohan and pittman 2007 most iron based treatment methods are more effective in removing as v rather than the more toxic as iii species as in aqueous phase with ph 8 and lowermost as iii exist as neutral molecule h3aso3 and so require oxidation as a pre treatment sorlini and gialdini 2010 the urge to innovate and upgrade has led to designing robust effective and economic devices for household use leading many researchers to examine the use of low cost local and or waste materials such as iron coated sand cast iron filings steel wool minerals and amended blast furnace slag which may be used in filters for arsenic removal joshi and chaudhuri 1996 leupin et al 2005 banerjee et al 2008 only groundwater iron is also being used for arsenic removal in domestic vietnamese sand filters berg et al 2006 voegelin et al 2014 nitzsche et al 2015 many of the adsorbent based technologies do however show significant potential for effective removal of arsenic from contaminated drinking water sarkar et al 2005 misra et al 2010 sarkar et al 2010 sarkar et al 2012 padungthon et al 2014 padungthon et al 2015 ahmad et al 2017 but may need to be relooked at considering the specific requirements of rural areas sengupta et al 2017 hossain et al 2014 9 effects of phosphate silicate and nom on arsenic removal by iron based technologies the arsenic contaminated areas in india are primarily agricultural and as phosphatic fertilizer use is quite abundant it is generally found in the groundwater along with arsenic kinniburgh et al 2003 phosphate and as v are structurally quite similar kish and viola 1999 the affinity of phosphate for sites on fe iii precipitates is similar to arsenate manning and goldberg 1996 ryden et al 1987 gao and mucci 2001 the influence of phosphate on adsorption of as iii and as v on ferrihydrite as a function of ph for p as tot ratios of 1 1 and 10 1 which is within the range reported in bangladesh bgs et al 2001 has been studied jain and loeppert 2000 they found that adsorption of both as v and as iii decreased with increasing po4 p concentration and for as v this was significant over the entire ph range they also report that neutral h3aso3 0 dominant at ph 7 is better able to compete with negatively charged phosphate species other researchers have found similar effects hongshao and stanforth 2001 elias et al 2012 biswas et al 2014 it has been reported that phosphate is the main factor limiting arsenic removal in fe ii co precipitation systems roberts et al 2004 further presence of phosphate would cause requirement of more time for fe ii oxidation as phosphate can complex with ferrous iron pryor and cohen 1951 phosphate adsorption kinetics often follows a complicated pattern with a rapid initial adsorption followed by a slow reaction that does not reach equilibrium up to the end of the experiment torrent et al 1992 during adsorption of phosphate and arsenate on goethite it was found that at a given total anion concentration the amount adsorbed was greater in the mixed ion system than in the single ion samples implying that there were sites on the surface that were specific for each ion as well as some nonspecific sites on which both ions could adsorb hingston et al 1971 as iii and as v removal by adsorption on ferric phosphate has also been reported lenoble et al 2005 but arsenic removal in their system was most probably occurring by chemical equilibrium reactions as phosphate was observed to get leached out silicate adversely affects arsenic removal by fe iii precipitates meng et al 2000 2002 bang et al 2005 biswas et al 2014 the iron oxide hydroxide surface has a strong affinity for silicate sigg and stumm 1981 however silicate adsorption is weaker than as v adsorption swedlund and webster 1999 silicic acid h4sio4 has been shown to effectively compete with arsenic for adsorption sites davis et al 2001 or may polymerize and coat the adsorption sites thereby reducing access to the adsorbate hence reducing the adsorption capacity of iron oxides christl et al 2012 as iii removal is not affected by silicate during co precipitation with fe ii but is negatively affected during co precipitation with fe iii as during co precipitation with fe ii as iii was oxidized and this did not happen during co precipitation with fe iii roberts et al 2004 co precipitation with fe ii is similar to electrocoagulation with fe electrodes ecfe banerji and chaudhari 2016 similarly silicate has very little effect on arsenic removal by ecfe as in this system as iii is oxidized and hence it was not showing any significant effect up to 20 mg l silicate wan et al 2011 banerji and chaudhari 2016 other researchers have reported high concentrations of silica polymerize to physically block access to sorption sites and not through competitive sorption zeng et al 2008 it has also been reported that silica significantly slowed fe ii oxidation to fe iii in aerated water at ph 6 5 rushing et al 2003 natural organic matter nom has been reported to cause reduction in arsenic removal efficiency by zero valent iron based processes giasuddin et al 2007 mak et al 2009 rao et al 2009 mak and lo 2011 tanboonchuy et al 2012 arsenic removal by fe was inhibited in the presence of humic acid ha representative nom compound due to the formation of soluble fe humate in aqueous solutions which suppressed the formation of ferric hydroxide tang et al 2014 more fe was required for arsenic removal when ha concentrations were higher when no more complexation with ha and dissolved fe was possible further fe ii dissolution produced fe iii hydr oxide which adsorbed arsenic giasuddin et al 2007 mak et al 2009 rao et al 2009 oxidation of nom can be achieved by fe iv graham et al 2010 which would reduce as iii oxidation and thus may reduce arsenic removal 10 chemical oxidation of as iii adsorption capacity of fe iii hydr oxide for as v is much higher than as iii hering et al 1996 but significant fraction of as iii occurs in natural ground water mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 leading to reduced arsenic removal and thereby non compliance of drinking water standards moreover as iii is more toxic than as v hence its removal is of prime importance korte and fernando 1991 henceforth as an initial step oxidation of as iii to as v by chemical oxidants has been suggested ghurye and clifford 2004 as iii can be oxidized by strong oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide ozone chlorine potassium permanganate or ferrate kim and nriagu 2000 lee et al 2003 bissen and frimmel 2003 ghurye and clifford 2004 sorlini and gialdini 2010 lescano et al 2011 the possible oxidants along with their benefits and drawbacks are listed in table 2 11 co oxidation of as iii to as v during fe ii oxidation oxidation of as iii to as v was found during the corrosion of iron powder and filings under aerobic conditions within 4 7 5 days manning et al 2002 various studies report that arsenic is oxidized in parallel to the oxidation of dissolved fe ii by do most likely by reactive intermediates such as fe iv hug et al 2001 hug and leupin 2003 roberts et al 2004 studies show that as iii is oxidized during fe 0 corrosion on a time scale of several hours leupin and hug 2005 overall reactions proposed by them include 1 fe 2h2o ½ o2 fe2 h2o 2oh 2 fe2 ¼ o2 h2o fe3 ½ h2o oh 3 fe3 3h2o fe oh 3 3h 4 as3 intermediates oh fe4 as4 5 as4 o2 as5 o2 the fe ii catalyzed as iii oxidation mechanism has been described in detail elsewhere hug and leupin 2003 many other researchers have postulated the formation of fe iv and as iv as intermediates of oxidation of as iii to as v during oxidation of fe ii to fe iii as detailed below the sequence begins with a series of one electron transfers in which molecular oxygen is reduced to superoxide and hydrogen peroxide as fe ii is oxidized to fe iii after fe ii is dissolved from the anode in ecfe or is added in systems with fe ii dosing as outlined in supporting information t1 the reaction of fe ii and fe oh with hydrogen peroxide occurs producing the intermediates int which quickly degrade to form a reactive oxidizing species fe iv the nature of the intermediates has been suggested to be fe oh ho2 h2o 4 and fe iv thought to exist as fe oh 3 h2o 4 bossmann et al 1998 these two species interconvert rapidly enough such that they are in equilibrium at acidic ph the hydroxyl radical is formed along with fe iii rigg et al 1954 since the ph of groundwater is typically higher ph 6 8 fe iv species is of greater importance as the oxidizing radical in the arsenic removal systems using fe based technologies hug and leupin 2003 the fe iv species is less prone to scavenging by dissolved organic species than the hydroxyl radical hug and leupin 2003 another sequence of one electron transfers after the formation of the fe iv species oxidizes as iii to as iv as fe iv is reduced to fe iii and then as iv is oxidized to as v as molecular oxygen is reduced to superoxide or might be more fe iv oxidizes this as iv species to as v as shown in supporting information t1 alternatively the fe iv can also be reduced by fe ii to form fe iii as fe ii is oxidized to fe iii most possible as iii and fe ii oxidation reactions have been tabulated in supporting information t1 oxidizing potential of fe4 aq fe iii aq 1 4 at ph 7 bossmann et al 1998 and the references therein addition of fe ii in multiple doses with sufficient time for fe ii oxidation leads to higher fractions of oxidized as iii than one single addition of the same total amount of fe ii roberts et al 2004 the reason is that fe ii itself consumes oxidizing species and outcompetes as iii at the usually higher fe ii concentrations leupin and hug 2005 thus the effect of fe ii concentration on the overall process is difficult to predict quantitatively the oxidation of as iii is optimal with prolonged low concentrations of fe ii which is continuously oxidized by dissolved oxygen as in ecfe during ecfe as fe ii is continuously added the reactions forming fe iv which led to as iii oxidation are expected banerji and chaudhari 2016 accordingly as iii oxidation during ecfe was negligible if fe ii oxidation was suppressed by the addition of 3 mm 2 2 bipyridine and that in ecfe systems fe iv and not oh is the most likely oxidant for as iii as negligible effect of 2 propanol on as iii oxidation was observed li et al 2012 12 adsorption vs co precipitation literature dealing with arsenic removal using iron based technologies generally refers to two possible routes they use either co precipitation with fe iii precipitates or adsorption onto pre formed adsorbents in co precipitation fe iii precipitates are formed in the presence of arsenic oxyanions leading to incomplete hydrolysis of fe iii i e formation of fractions of feoh2 fe2 oh 2 4 fe oh 2 fe oh 3 and fe oh 4 and these hydrolysed fe iii forms then complexed with arsenic fuller et al 1993 stefánsson 2007 during adsorption onto pre formed adsorbent iron hydr oxides are formed prior to the addition of arsenic the adsorbent ageing period before the arsenic is added allows some time for aggregation of the adsorbent and crystallite growth to occur both processes which tend to decrease the number of adsorption sites fuller et al 1993 waychunas et al 1993 if however a sorbing ion is present in solution during the hydrolysis and precipitation of fe iii hydr oxides as in co precipitation then the ion may sorb to surface sites before aggregates are formed this maximizes the number of available surface sites increasing the sorptive capacity of the fe iii hydr oxides fuller et al 1993 in a situation where there is continuous in situ formation of adsorbent in presence of the adsorbate a situation may arise when the adsorbate due to less concentration starts to adsorb and not co precipitate fuller et al 1993 waychunas et al 1993 crawford et al 1993a b opiso et al 2009 wogelius 2013 chaudhari et al 2014 park et al 2016 it is quite difficult to differentiate at which concentration adsorption predominates and at which concentration co precipitation predominates chaudhari et al 2014 banerji and chaudhari 2016 13 use of zero valent iron for arsenic removal the use of zero valent iron zvi i e fe 0 to remove arsenic has been investigated by many groups farrell et al 2001 manning et al 2002 melitas et al 2002 nikolaidis et al 2003 bang et al 2005 katsoyiannis et al 2008 the exposed surface area of zvi plays a major role in both the removal kinetics and capacities corrosion of zvi and subsequent oxidation of fe ii by dissolved oxygen produces fe iii precipitates which can complex with as v bang et al 2005 arsenic forms mono and bi dentate complexes with iron oxides produced from iron corrosion lackovic et al 2000 farrell et al 2001 kumar et al 2014 the rate of fe iii hydr oxide formation from zvi is directly related to the corrosion rate and higher corrosion rate leads to higher amount of fe iii hydr oxide which leads to more arsenic removal bang et al 2005 once fe ii is produced from zvi the fe ii and as iii oxidation and complexation precipitation reactions are the same as ecfe only difference between ecfe and zvi is that fe ii dissolution in ecfe is controlled by current and is uncontrolled in zvi the arsenic removal rate of zvi is dependent on dissolved oxygen concentration as well as ph with the required contact time for removal increasing significantly as do is decreased or ph is increased bang et al 2005 lackovic et al 2000 it was reported that after 9 h of reaction with 1 g l zvi filings in presence of do 99 8 removal was achieved for initial as v concentrations of 100 µg l at ph 6 while only 55 5 and 2 were removed at ph 7 and 8 respectively and 99 8 of as v was removed at ph 6 in solution open to air compared to only 9 in ph 6 anoxic solution bang et al 2005 under anoxic conditions iron oxide such as magnetite fe3o4 can be formed on the fe 0 particle surface kumar et al 2014 the reduction of as iii and as v to as 0 by zvi is thermodynamically favourable bang et al 2005 however it was also reported that no measurable reduction of as v to as iii was observed farrell et al 2001 manning et al 2002 nanoscale 1 120 nm diameter zero valent iron for rapid first order as iii and as v removal kobs 0 07 1 3 min 1 with inner sphere surface complexation mechanism was synthesized and this rate was found to be about 1000 times faster than that of micron sized iron su and puls 2001 it is important to note that the corrosion rate is very sensitive to surface area in the limit of a low ratio of adsorbing species to adsorption sites the arsenic removal rate is limited by mass transfer to adsorption sites and therefore exhibits first order dependence on arsenic concentration farrell et al 2001 melitas et al 2002 however at high solution concentrations removal becomes limited by the rate of adsorption site generation related to the corrosion rate and fe iii hydr oxide formation rate and is zero order in arsenic concentration farrell et al 2001 melitas et al 2002 with 200 days of operation 18 000 mg arsenic 1 3 ratio of as iii as v was reported to be removed using 400 g zvi filings a capacity of 45 mg as g fe bang et al 2005 however breakthrough of arsenic began to occur after only 100 days indicating that filings would have to be replaced long before the capacity was reached various researchers have also mentioned the possibility of oxidation of as iii during arsenic removal by zvi leupin et al 2005 katsoyiannis et al 2008 banerji and chaudhari 2016 banerji and chaudhari 2017 14 arsenic removal by electrocoagulation with iron electrodes ecfe electrocoagulation using iron electrodes ecfe is an emerging technology which has shown lot of promise for arsenic removal arsenic removal efficiency increases in the sequence aluminium titanium iron when using monopolar electrodes kumar et al 2004 it has been reported by some authors that as iii oxidation is possible in ecfe kumar et al 2004 lakshmipathiraj et al 2010 wan et al 2011 banerji and chaudhari 2016 while others report on the contrary lakshmanan et al 2008 lakshmanan et al 2010 amrose et al 2014 during ecfe fe ii is dissolved from the anode when current is passed this fe ii oxidizes to fe iii in the presence of do during formation of fe ii to fe iii some fe iv might be forming which is an oxidizing radicle and has been reported to be able to oxidize as iii to as iv which is quickly converted to as v in the presence of do hug and leupin 2003 leupin and hug 2005 li et al 2012 amrose et al 2013 banerji and chaudhari 2016 thus oxidation of as iii and its removal can be achieved in ecfe without the addition of any chemicals this method promises to be the most efficient with respect to arsenic removal unit weight of iron added 15 conclusion low income regions in bengal basin face arsenic problems mostly caused by geogenic groundwater contamination this review paper looked into the various theories of geogenic contamination of groundwater by arsenic reduction of fe iii hydr oxide by microorganisms followed by desorption of arsenic from the iron surface has been identified as the main mechanism of arsenic contamination in groundwater in the bengal basin this review also sums up the iron based arsenic removal technologies currently being investigated for drinking waters with a special focus on economically depressed regions these regions need low cost effective technologies that can be readily available at the household or community level based on the simplicity and ease of availability of raw materials a low cost effective user friendly community based filter for arsenic removal based on fe may be developed which can be fitted with a hand pump the treatment technology must be applicable over the broad range of arsenic concentrations found in groundwater and should also be able to achieve as iii oxidation the materials for the treatment should be economical and easily obtainable in indian villages and or suitable for reuse thus zvi and ecfe are two technologies that are showing maximum promise for effective arsenic removal in the economically backward areas of india hence this review has summarized principles of conventional technologies currently described in the literature for arsenic removal that can be used in the developing countries compared them with the ideal technology requirement and discussed their advantages and disadvantages along with a brief analysis of cause of arsenic presence in groundwater appendix a supplementary

study the sand column placed at the base of the reservoir as an alternative solution to increase the amount of water recharged into the aquifer in this study numerical modelling was used to explore

groundwater recharge 1 introduction nowadays the amount of clean water required in growing urban areas has increased sharply and in some cases there is a gap between the need of clean water and its availability in nature ashraf et al 2017 biswas et al 2017 taylor et al 2013 a challenge on the future is the scarcity of surface water due to climate uncertainty and therefore groundwater becomes a potential alternative for water sources unfortunately when the groundwater table is continuously decreased due to groundwater extraction some negative effects such as land subsidence sea water intrusion and the decrease of groundwater quality might be encountered aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 badaruddin et al 2017 friedel 2006 in regards to some negative implications of groundwater extraction water conservation efforts have been conducted such as by controlling groundwater exploitation and protecting water sources by recharging more water into aquifer either naturally or artificially döll 2009 hou et al 2016 rozemeijer and broers 2007 some methods of groundwater recharge have been introduced to boost the absorption of water into aquifers such as absorption wells biopore wells and other infiltration techniques despite of the results sometimes are not optimal in increasing the amount of groundwater recharge atta darkwa et al 2013 scanlon et al 2001 sharda et al 2006 tubau et al 2017 willis and black 1996 currently artificial recharge is increasingly applied in supplying water into aquifer storage bakundukize et al 2011 gleeson et al 2016 artificial recharge requires permeable soil if the soil layer is impermeable then trenches or shafts in the unsaturated soil zone can be applied or water can be directly injected into aquifer via recharging wells friedel 2006 to design a system for artificial recharge soil infiltration rate should be determined and the unsaturated zone between the soil surface and the aquifer should be monitored soil permeability must be adequate for recharge and there is no contaminated area around the recharging wells 2 conceptual model one form of artificial method in increasing the volume of water in aquifer is recharge reservoir rr rr is primarily used as a medium for water to infiltrate easily and quickly into the aquifer layers reservoir model is suitable for area with shallow groundwater and wide space viswanathan 1984 the construction of rr is different from the common reservoir rr is built with reservoir bed is hydraulically connected to the aquifer layers via infiltration wells rr essentially can be categorized as single purpose reservoir that focuses in increasing the amount of water stored into aquifer layers but at certain conditions rr may have other functions such as serving as a flood control pedretti et al 2012 the purpose of rr is similar to recharge wells but different in methods and geometry gies 2017 the higher capacity of rr to percolate freshwater compared to ponds or lakes which traditionally functioning as water reservoir is due to the design of rr where the soil layer in rr needs to be more permeable with hydraulic conductivity around 10 3 cm s which is higher than the hydraulic conductivity of clay that ranging around 10 5 cm s hargono 2011 a problem is faced when rr is built in a region with low soil permeability condition where the water becomes very slow to infiltrate and reach the aquifer and at this situation the function of rr will not be optimum regarding this condition it is required to study the use of sand columns in rr as infiltration wells so that the process of groundwater recharge can be optimised recently azis 2013b conducted laboratory physical experiments involving sand columns as infiltration wells that put at the base of rr using a three dimensional 3d sand tank model even though it is too early to come to a conclusion since there is no systematic and comprehensive evaluation conducted in their study azis 2013b still assumed that sand columns can be used as an alternative solution to increase the amount of groundwater recharge into aquifer no groundwater numerical model has been used in their study to quantitatively and systematically explore the effectiveness and the validity of this method in enhancing groundwater recharge and therefore further research is required to fill this research gap this research aims to continue the work of azis 2013b to quantitatively analyse the effectiveness of sand columns placed at the bottom of rr with low permeability soil layer in increasing the amount of groundwater recharge using 3d numerical model the effects of other related parameters i e surface water level above reservoir and semi impermeable layer thickness below reservoir on groundwater recharge are also investigated in the current study the results from numerical model are compared with the results of analytical solution from azis 2013a 3 methods 3 1 analytical solution according to azis et al 2015 the influencing parameters of groundwater recharge was the head difference the number and size of sand column semi impermeable layer thickness and water level above reservoir the amount of groundwater recharge q a is equal to the amount of water entering the aquifer through soil layer q as as well as in the column q sc in the form of following equation 1 q a q as q sc considering the influencing parameters the following equation was obtained 2 qas k 1 h z a 1 4 π d 2 n c where k 1 is soil permeability coefficient h is head difference z is semi impermeable thickness a is surface area of the reservoir d is diameter of sand column and n c is number of sand column meanwhile 3 qsc k 2 h z 1 4 π d 2 n c where k 2 is sand permeability coefficient used in the sand columns then eqs 2 and 3 were substituted to eq 1 and yielding 4 qa k 1 h z a 1 4 π d 2 n c k 2 h z 1 4 π d 2 n c the head difference is the sum of water level above reservoir h w and semi impermeable thickness z minus piezometric aquifer pressure h a the equation as follows 5 h h w z h a from the physical modelling results of azis 2014 coefficient of sand column was obtained and the empirical equation of groundwater recharge is developed from eq 4 6 qa rc k 1 h z a 1 4 π d n c k 2 h z 1 4 π d 2 n c where rc is a sand column coefficient by considering the influence of z x and d x azis 2014 then 7 r c 0 973 0 035 z x 0 044

groundwater flow code modflow lasya and inayathulla 2015 was used to simulate groundwater flow in this study modflow has been validated using several benchmark problems bedekar 2006 and is widely used and thus the governing equations from the user manual are not re written here for brevity jairo avila 2012 the model domain used in the numerical model was in accordance with the dimensions of the sand tank used in azis 2013b as shown in fig 1 model concept were undertaken by azis 2013b to show the applicability of sand columns in rr using a 3d sand tank with the size of 150 cm x 100 cm x 60 cm the schematic picture of the sand tank and the layout of the experiment can be seen in fig 1 dirichlet conditions are used to represent head at the sand tank side boundaries and at the base of reservoir and no flow conditions were assigned to the bottom of the model a uniform grid size of δx 0 5 cm δy 0 5 cm and δz 0 5 cm was used a time step of 0 5 min was employed and the transport step size was set to 0 1 min the aquifer is modelled using 360 columns and 200 rows and the number of aquifer layer is adjusted with the height of model domain the layer type for semi impermeable and aquifer layer is set to be confined unconfined with transmissivity varies type 3 the laboratory scale simulation is run for 2200 min which corresponds to the time where steady state condition is reached in comparing the flow rate obtained from analytical solution relative to the numerical model the lateral flows inside aquifer layer in the numerical model measured about 15 cm from the outflow boundary were calculated in this study 5 variations of water level above reservoir h w i e 5 7 5 10 12 5 and 15 cm 3 variations of semi impermeable layer thickness z i e 30 32 5 and 35 cm and number of sand column n c i e 4 6 and 8 were used the diameter of the sand column of 5 cm is adopted the distance between sand columns x for n c of 8 is 12 22 cm n c of 6 is 17 14 cm and n c of 4 is 26 cm the piezometric aquifer pressure ha was 0 cm parameter of q o1 l3 t q o2 l3 t and q i l3 t in this study represent the overflow from reservoir the water that discharged out from aquifer and the water that flows into reservoir respectively prior to the experiment soil characteristics of the semi impermeable and the aquifer medium were determined from soil permeability test azis et al 2015 found that the hydraulic conductivity k of the semi impermeable layer i e clay is 3 3 10 5 cm s and the sand columns i e sand is 1 9 10 1 cm s and the effective porosity n of the clay is 0 1 and the sand is 0 3 the soil was placed into a sand tank and compacted in layers then drilled using a 5 cm diameter of drilling tool the sand then is inserted into the hole the parameters used in the analytical solution and numerical modelling are listed in table 1 4 results and discussions 4 1 quantitative comparison between analytical solution and numerical modelling based on fig 2 it can be seen a minor deviation between the results of analytical solution and numerical modelling for all semi impermeable layer thickness z where the results of analytical solution always over estimate the results of numerical modelling however in general a reasonable agreement was seen between these two results at z 30 cm the highest deviation of 11 67 occured at h w 7 5 cm n c 4 at z 32 5 cm the highest deviation of 10 51 occured at h w 10 cm n c 6 at z 35 cm the highest deviation of 10 33 occured at h w 5 cm n c 6 this deviation is expected since the analytical solution of azis 2013b is resulted from an empirical equation that involves a statistical approach on their physical modelling results furthermore due to statistical approach and simplification of parameters involved in the empirical solution makes its prediction always over estimates the results of numerical model in response to the deviation observed it is assumed that in this study the flow of water from the soil layer enters the aquifer through the sand column whose discharge is affected by the nc z and hw so it is necessary to analyse by looking at the formula coefficient factor c f which causes the gap for this reason a relationship between c f and n c z and hw functions is made using multiple linear regression analysis models with the following results c f 4 55 4 32 n c 1 77 hw 0 42 z by involving the coefficient factor c f groundwater recharge equation is developed from eq 8 as shown in eqs 9 and 10 below 9 qa c f 0 973 0 035 z x 0 044 d x k 1 h z a 1 4 π d n sc k 2 h z 1 4 π d 2 n sc a regression equation model that takes into account the effect of nc z and hw to c f as follows 10 qa 4 55 4 32 n c 1 77 hw 0 42 z 0 973 0 035 z x 0 044 d x k 1 δ h z a 1 4 π d n c k 2 δ h z 1 4 π d 2 n c thus there are three results of groundwater recharge obtained from eq 8 eq 10 and the results of numerical simulation comparison of the three results can be seen in fig 3 based on the results of groundwater recharge analysis from eq 8 eq 10 and the numerical simulation shown in fig 3 there is a significant difference between the recharge obtained from eqs 8 and 10 in each addition of reservoir s water level fig 3 also shows that the results of eq 10 and numerical simulations are approaching each other this proves the existence of a coefficient factor c f that affects the fitness the correlation between analytical solutions eq 10 and numerical simulation results can be seen in the figure below fig 4 this combined graph follows a linear pattern with a coefficient of determination r2 0 9995 or r 0 999 0 85 and close to 1 this means that the relationship between q from the analytical solution eq 10 and q from numerical solution are correlated 4 2 effect of hw z and nc on the debit of groundwater compensation based on the modelling results there is an increase in groundwater recharge in each additional of water level above reservoir hw for all number of sand columns nc i e 4 6 and 8 this is because the addition of water level above the reservoir hw increases the water pressure to the sand column and causing the discharge to the aquifer layer to increase this result is in accordance with the physical modelling results conducted by azis 2013b conversely groundwater discharge tends to decrease with the increase of semi impermeable thickness z the functional relationship between groundwater recharge discharge and semi impermeable z thickness is an inverse relationship the decreasing trend of groundwater debit rate follows the same pattern as an increase in semi impermeable thickness z this shows that the thicker the semi impermeable thickness z the smaller the pressure to the aquifer layer so the debit decreases this result is consistent with the physical modelling carried out by azis 2013a and in eq 8 shows the groundwater recharge debit is inversely proportional to the semi impermeable z thickness from the simulation results the increasing number of sand columns n c increases the rate of groundwater infiltration in all water levels above the reservoir hw this is due to the increase in the number of sand columns which means the greater the surface area of the sand column and therefore the larger the volume of water enters the soil layer the results of this model are in accordance with eq 8 that the groundwater recharge is directly proportional to the number of sand columns n c 5 conclusions in this study numerical modelling was used to explore the potential of the sand column to increase the volume of water recharged into the aquifer the numerical modelling was compared with a corresponding analytical solution from the previous related study there has never been any research conducting numerical modelling to determine the amount of groundwater recharge through sand column placed in the recharge reservoir the results show that groundwater recharge from the analytical solutionis greater than the results of numerical modelling even though the deviation is not too significant because the highest is only 11 67 which occurs at hw 7 5 cm n c 4 this is because the analytical solution resulting from the empirical equation involves a statistical approach which is different to the results of physical modelling this is also made the statistical approach and simplification of parameters involved in empirical solutions predictions always greater than the results of numerical models analysing the relationship between q a with the functions of n c z and h w using the multiple linear regression analysis model obtained coefficient factor c f which causes the deviation between analytical solution with numerical modelling the results also showed that water level above reservoir semi impermeable thickness and the number of sand columns affect the groundwater recharge numerical modelling results show that the amount of groundwater recharge is increased when the water level above reservoir and the number of sand columns increases semi impermeable thickness affects the volume of recharge in aquifers from the results of the numerical modelling that has been done shows the decrease in groundwater recharge along with the increase in semi impermeable thickness the use of sand columns has a significant effect on the addition of groundwater in various water levels above the reservoir the increase in groundwater recharge is significantly affected by the increasing number of sand columns this is because increasing the sand column s number will widen the surface are of sand column and therefore the debit of water flowing into the aquifer also gets bigger acknowledgements we sincerely thank the director general of strengthening research and development ministry of technology and higher education which has

that sand columns can be used as an alternative solution to increase the amount of groundwater recharge into aquifer no groundwater numerical model has been used in their study to quantitatively and systematically explore the effectiveness and the validity of this method in enhancing groundwater recharge and therefore further research is required to fill this research gap this research aims to continue the work of azis 2013b to quantitatively analyse the effectiveness of sand columns placed at the bottom of rr with low permeability soil layer in increasing the amount of groundwater recharge using 3d numerical model the effects of other related parameters i e surface water level above reservoir and semi impermeable layer thickness below reservoir on groundwater recharge are also investigated in the current study the results from numerical model are compared with the results of analytical solution from azis 2013a 3 methods 3 1 analytical solution according to azis et al 2015 the influencing parameters of groundwater recharge was the head difference the number and size of sand column semi impermeable layer thickness and water level above reservoir the amount of groundwater recharge q a is equal to the amount of water entering the aquifer through soil layer q as as well as in the column q sc in the form of following equation 1 q a q as q sc considering the influencing parameters the following equation was obtained 2 qas k 1 h z a 1 4 π d 2 n c where k 1 is soil permeability coefficient h is head difference z is semi impermeable thickness a is surface area of the reservoir d is diameter of sand column and n c is number of sand column meanwhile 3 qsc k 2 h z 1 4 π d 2 n c where k 2 is sand permeability coefficient used in the sand columns then eqs 2 and 3 were substituted to eq 1 and yielding 4 qa k 1 h z a 1 4 π d 2 n c k 2 h z 1 4 π d 2 n c the head difference is the sum of water level above reservoir h w and semi impermeable thickness z minus piezometric aquifer pressure h a the equation as follows 5 h h w z h a from the physical modelling results of azis 2014 coefficient of sand column was obtained and the empirical equation of groundwater recharge is developed from eq 4 6 qa rc k 1 h z a 1 4 π d n c k 2 h z 1 4 π d 2 n c where rc is a sand column coefficient by considering the influence of z x and d x azis 2014 then 7 r c 0 973 0 035 z x 0 044

groundwater flow code modflow lasya and inayathulla 2015 was used to simulate groundwater flow in this study modflow has been validated using several benchmark problems bedekar 2006 and is widely used and thus the governing equations from the user manual are not re written here for brevity jairo avila 2012 the model domain used in the numerical model was in accordance with the dimensions of the sand tank used in azis 2013b as shown in fig 1 model concept were undertaken by azis 2013b to show the applicability of sand columns in rr using a 3d sand tank with the size of 150 cm x 100 cm x 60 cm the schematic picture of the sand tank and the layout of the experiment can be seen in fig 1 dirichlet conditions are used to represent head at the sand tank side boundaries and at the base of reservoir and no flow conditions were assigned to the bottom of the model a uniform grid size of δx 0 5 cm δy 0 5 cm and δz 0 5 cm was used a time step of 0 5 min was employed and the transport step size was set to 0 1 min the aquifer is modelled using 360 columns and 200 rows and the number of aquifer layer is adjusted with the height of model domain the layer type for semi impermeable and aquifer layer is set to be confined unconfined with transmissivity varies type 3 the laboratory scale simulation is run for 2200 min which corresponds to the time where steady state condition is reached in comparing the flow rate obtained from analytical solution relative to the numerical model the lateral flows inside aquifer layer in the numerical model measured about 15 cm from the outflow boundary were calculated in this study 5 variations of water level above reservoir h w i e 5 7 5 10 12 5 and 15 cm 3 variations of semi impermeable layer thickness z i e 30 32 5 and 35 cm and number of sand column n c i e 4 6 and 8 were used the diameter of the sand column of 5 cm is adopted the distance between sand columns x for n c of 8 is 12 22 cm n c of 6 is 17 14 cm and n c of 4 is 26 cm the piezometric aquifer pressure ha was 0 cm parameter of q o1 l3 t q o2 l3 t and q i l3 t in this study represent the overflow from reservoir the water that discharged out from aquifer and the water that flows into reservoir respectively prior to the experiment soil characteristics of the semi impermeable and the aquifer medium were determined from soil permeability test azis et al 2015 found that the hydraulic conductivity k of the semi impermeable layer i e clay is 3 3 10 5 cm s and the sand columns i e sand is 1 9 10 1 cm s and the effective porosity n of the clay is 0 1 and the sand is 0 3 the soil was placed into a sand tank and compacted in layers then drilled using a 5 cm diameter of drilling tool the sand then is inserted into the hole the parameters used in the analytical solution and numerical modelling are listed in table 1 4 results and discussions 4 1 quantitative comparison between analytical solution and numerical modelling based on fig 2 it can be seen a minor deviation between the results of analytical solution and numerical modelling for all semi impermeable layer thickness z where the results of analytical solution always over estimate the results of numerical modelling however in general a reasonable agreement was seen between these two results at z 30 cm the highest deviation of 11 67 occured at h w 7 5 cm n c 4 at z 32 5 cm the highest deviation of 10 51 occured at h w 10 cm n c 6 at z 35 cm the highest deviation of 10 33 occured at h w 5 cm n c 6 this deviation is expected since the analytical solution of azis 2013b is resulted from an empirical equation that involves a statistical approach on their physical modelling results furthermore due to statistical approach and simplification of parameters involved in the empirical solution makes its prediction always over estimates the results of numerical model in response to the deviation observed it is assumed that in this study the flow of water from the soil layer enters the aquifer through the sand column whose discharge is affected by the nc z and hw so it is necessary to analyse by looking at the formula coefficient factor c f which causes the gap for this reason a relationship between c f and n c z and hw functions is made using multiple linear regression analysis models with the following results c f 4 55 4 32 n c 1 77 hw 0 42 z by involving the coefficient factor c f groundwater recharge equation is developed from eq 8 as shown in eqs 9 and 10 below 9 qa c f 0 973 0 035 z x 0 044 d x k 1 h z a 1 4 π d n sc k 2 h z 1 4 π d 2 n sc a regression equation model that takes into account the effect of nc z and hw to c f as follows 10 qa 4 55 4 32 n c 1 77 hw 0 42 z 0 973 0 035 z x 0 044 d x k 1 δ h z a 1 4 π d n c k 2 δ h z 1 4 π d 2 n c thus there are three results of groundwater recharge obtained from eq 8 eq 10 and the results of numerical simulation comparison of the three results can be seen in fig 3 based on the results of groundwater recharge analysis from eq 8 eq 10 and the numerical simulation shown in fig 3 there is a significant difference between the recharge obtained from eqs 8 and 10 in each addition of reservoir s water level fig 3 also shows that the results of eq 10 and numerical simulations are approaching each other this proves the existence of a coefficient factor c f that affects the fitness the correlation between analytical solutions eq 10 and numerical simulation results can be seen in the figure below fig 4 this combined graph follows a linear pattern with a coefficient of determination r2 0 9995 or r 0 999 0 85 and close to 1 this means that the relationship between q from the analytical solution eq 10 and q from numerical solution are correlated 4 2 effect of hw z and nc on the debit of groundwater compensation based on the modelling results there is an increase in groundwater recharge in each additional of water level above reservoir hw for all number of sand columns nc i e 4 6 and 8 this is because the addition of water level above the reservoir hw increases the water pressure to the sand column and causing the discharge to the aquifer layer to increase this result is in accordance with the physical modelling results conducted by azis 2013b conversely groundwater discharge tends to decrease with the increase of semi impermeable thickness z the functional relationship between groundwater recharge discharge and semi impermeable z thickness is an inverse relationship the decreasing trend of groundwater debit rate follows the same pattern as an increase in semi impermeable thickness z this shows that the thicker the semi impermeable thickness z the smaller the pressure to the aquifer layer so the debit decreases this result is consistent with the physical modelling carried out by azis 2013a and in eq 8 shows the groundwater recharge debit is inversely proportional to the semi impermeable z thickness from the simulation results the increasing number of sand columns n c increases the rate of groundwater infiltration in all water levels above the reservoir hw this is due to the increase in the number of sand columns which means the greater the surface area of the sand column and therefore the larger the volume of water enters the soil layer the results of this model are in accordance with eq 8 that the groundwater recharge is directly proportional to the number of sand columns n c 5 conclusions in this study numerical modelling was used to explore the potential of the sand column to increase the volume of water recharged into the aquifer the numerical modelling was compared with a corresponding analytical solution from the previous related study there has never been any research conducting numerical modelling to determine the amount of groundwater recharge through sand column placed in the recharge reservoir the results show that groundwater recharge from the analytical solutionis greater than the results of numerical modelling even though the deviation is not too significant because the highest is only 11 67 which occurs at hw 7 5 cm n c 4 this is because the analytical solution resulting from the empirical equation involves a statistical approach which is different to the results of physical modelling this is also made the statistical approach and simplification of parameters involved in empirical solutions predictions always greater than the results of numerical models analysing the relationship between q a with the functions of n c z and h w using the multiple linear regression analysis model obtained coefficient factor c f which causes the deviation between analytical solution with numerical modelling the results also showed that water level above reservoir semi impermeable thickness and the number of sand columns affect the groundwater recharge numerical modelling results show that the amount of groundwater recharge is increased when the water level above reservoir and the number of sand columns increases semi impermeable thickness affects the volume of recharge in aquifers from the results of the numerical modelling that has been done shows the decrease in groundwater recharge along with the increase in semi impermeable thickness the use of sand columns has a significant effect on the addition of groundwater in various water levels above the reservoir the increase in groundwater recharge is significantly affected by the increasing number of sand columns this is because increasing the sand column s number will widen the surface are of sand column and therefore the debit of water flowing into the aquifer also gets bigger acknowledgements we sincerely thank the director general of strengthening research and development ministry of technology and higher education which has

12294,mexico city is an example of intense socio ecosystem interactions particularly in water management the groundwater under this city has complex structures and dynamics due to the coexistence of aquifers located at different depths through groundwater extraction the main aquifer supports 71 of the water demand of the city in this research we describe the dynamics between aquifers and the surface particularly in preserved spaces located south of the city the results indicate the presence of a shallow aquifer that is relatively independent to the main one the water of both aquifers has the same origin rainwater and the same water flow direction but it has different recharge areas and residence times apparently there is a strong interaction between the shallow aquifer and the surface in which the small proportion of preserved green spaces 27 km2 in relation to urbanized ones 53 km2 may produce negative consequences on the quality and quantity of groundwater the lack of knowledge about the dynamics of the shallow aquifer leads to its underappreciation for the water management of the city graphical abstract fx1 keywords shallow aquifers pedregal infiltration recharge groundwater 1 introduction cities are complex systems with constant interactions between their social and ecological variables which generate the so called socio ecosystems fischer et al 2015 in these interactions green spaces are relevant because they increase landscape properties hough 2004 that are critical providers of direct and indirect benefits to human well being and health bennett et al 2015 these areas must be properly managed to stimulate inclusive sustainable and resilient cities mcphearson et al 2014 thus there are two approaches used to promote the preservation of these green spaces tallis and lubchenco 2014 the first is the instrumental approach which focuses on the benefits i e ecosystem services that the green spaces provide to the urban population reid 2006 and the second is the intrinsic value approach which is used to preserve biodiversity acosta and esperanza 2011 mexico city is an example of intense interactions between ecological and social variables especially regarding water this city with 22 million inhabitants has a water demand of 77 m3 s mazari hiriart et al 2014 part of this demand 71 is supplied by groundwater extraction through wells from the main aquifer the depth of this aquifer ranges from 70 to 500 m and it is an heterogenous unit with granular materials and fractured volcanic rocks previous studies have divided this aquifer into two sub units due to an increase of clays materials at 150 m of depth the first sub unit at 70 180 m and the second at 180 500 m morales casique et al 2014 the main aquifer is overexploited to satisfy the water demands of human population according to the national commission of water conagua in spanish this overexploitation is reflected in an annual extraction of 1103 98 mm3 which surpasses the amount of water that is infiltrated conagua 2015 these numbers do not consider the water required by ecosystems dynamics and therefore values must be recalculated to have a more realistic understanding of the watershed hydrodynamics rohde et al 2017 the overexploitation of the main aquifer has different consequences such as the draining of shallow aquifers to the main one which can generate land subsidence in different areas of the city and consequently more vulnerable citizens to earthquakes and fissures in superficial water bodies kralisch et al 2012 legorreta 2006 the groundwater system has a complex structure due to the coexistence of aquifers that are located at different depths these aquifers are nourished with water from diverse ecosystems that have multiple types of soil therefore numerous groundwater dynamics are generated tóth 2015 this dynamics diversity starts from the regions in which they are recharged and includes the distance and the speed at which the water travels each rocky area lake woodland or urban region has different fluxes dynamics which generate differences in the quality and quantity of water that is infiltrated into the groundwater system shallow aquifers are the most susceptible of being polluted by surface activities because of their proximity and according to the characteristics of the surface these aquifers are susceptible to different type pollutants however most of these aquifers are interconnected and in consequence pollution can spread throughout the water system and all of them can be affected by the overexploitation of the main aquifer lee et al 2015 the amount of sources of groundwater pollution in mexico city soto et al 2000 increases the urgency of understanding the water flow dynamics among the overexploited aquifers in mexico city the main sources of groundwater pollution are industries solid waste disposal the sewage system gas stations fuel tanks the urban zone and the abandoned water extraction wells soto et al 2000 within mexico city three municipalities are located above the shallow aquifer alvaro obregon coyoacan and tlalpan according to soto et al 2000 these municipalities have several sources of pollution that could affect the groundwater alvaro obregon municipality is mainly affected by pollution and fuel tanks represent a major threat tlalpan municipality is the least affected by pollution and the main risk is generated by solid waste coyoacan municipality has an intermediate level of risk and urbanization is the major threat soto et al 2000 therefore managing the sources of pollution on the surface above the shallow aquifer is crucial due to groundwater susceptibility of pollution in mexico city green spaces have become a cornerstone to provide water source to feed aquifers the pedregal is a good example of a preserved area in mexico city this area was formed by basaltic rock from the xitle volcanic eruption that occurred approximately 1670 years ago and this rocky formation has low presence of soil which explains its name pedregal rocky area the pedregal has an average annual temperature of 16 1 c and an annual accumulated precipitation of 870 2 mm cano santana et al 2009 due to the urban expansion that has occurred over the last century the pedregal has suffered a dramatic fragmentation and area reduction from 80 km2 in 1954 to 40 km2 in 1984 currently there are only two important green spaces within the original extension of the pedregal the reserva ecológica del pedregal de san ángel repsa and the tlalpan s forest the tlalpan s forest does not have the original characteristics of the pedregal because it suffered human related transformations in the creation of this urban park therefore the provision of ecosystem services of the tlalpan s forest has been influenced by humans calderón contreras and quiroz rosas 2017 the repsa is a natural protected area where the pristine characteristics of the pedregal have been preserved calderón contreras and quiroz rosas 2017 currently the repsa is considered the last remaining area of the pedregal with only 2 37 km2 based at the universidad nacional autonoma de méxico unam alvarez sanchez et al 1994 rojo curiel 1994 fig 1 the fragmentation and reduced area of the pedregal has a negative impact on the biodiversity and the ecosystem dynamics however the pedregal still provides ecosystem services to the population of mexico city nava lópez et al 2009 the lack of green spaces can generate a reduction in the amount water infiltration because the soil in urbanized areas is practically impermeable and the rainwater in this area is diverted to sewage systems this often results in floods in the lowlands of the city zambrano et al 2017 despite having a large sewage system the rainwater diversion process in mexico city is inefficient candiani 2014 particularly under extreme storms which will be commoner with climate change zambrano et al 2017 because of the low presence of soil and the characteristics of the subsoil the zone of the pedregal has high hydraulic conductivity since this area promotes a fast water infiltration the repsa provides ecosystem services related to the regulation of water quality and quantity of the aquifer nava lópez et al 2009 the human population living in the pedregal ecosystem has always used water from the shallow aquifer using the scattered springs that occur in the area however this water is underappreciated by managers possibly because of the lack of knowledge on the dynamics of the aquifer for example throughout the entire city it is common to re direct the water from springs to the sewage system once it appears while an infrastructure project is being built the lack of knowledge about the characteristics of the aquifer may result in the detrimental use of water and the pollution of this scarce and valuable resource in the city therefore the objective of this research is to understand the relationship between the aquifers and to evaluate the influence of the surface area of the preserved pedregal in the southern part of mexico city 2 methods geological sections provide stratigraphy information which helps to understand how groundwater moves between aquifers to obtain information from the geological sections the lithological columns from the water extraction wells that surround the repsa were analyzed data from sacmex which stands for water system of mexico city in spanish the lithologies were clustered according to the geological local map of carrillo trueba 1995 twelve lithological columns from wells were used in section i direction northeast to southwest and eleven lithological columns from wells were used in section ii direction west to east fig 1 water sampling was made in june 24 2016 at seven sites within the pedregal fig 1 four of these sites were natural springs in private spaces i e d e f and g and three i e a b and c were water extraction wells that

chromatography laboratory and trace elements were analyzed by inductive coupling plasma icp with an optical emission spectrophotometer oes icp oes in the atomic spectroscopy laboratory institute of geology unam cations and anions had a charge balance error cbe from 0 7 to 5 3 acceptable water analyses have cbe values less than 5 u s g s 2007 samples for stable isotopes d18o and d2h wassenaar et al 2009 were collected and analyzed by laser spectroscopy in the isotopic laboratory of davis university california united states of america the results were expressed as the relative abundance with respect to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow and were compared to the local meteorological line this line was determined based on rain water samples that were obtained from the sierra del ajusco at the top of the basin and complied with the equation d2h 7 95 d18o 11 77 r 0 989 cortés and farvolden 1989 additionally the altitude above medium sea level where the recharge of the groundwater system occurred was calculated and complied with the equation d18o 2 13z 3 2 1000 which was based on isotopic data from cortés and durazo 2001 the topographic elevation of the land was used to establish the altitude of the water table because groundwater moves from high pressure to low pressure areas darcy 1856 domenico and schwartz 1990 tóth 1963 the altitude of the water table was calculated with the equation topography elevation m a s l water table depth m the water table is where the surface water head is equal to the atmospheric pressure freeze and cherry 1979 the altitude of the water table in each well and the topographic elevation in springs were used separately to create isolines the groundwater movement is perpendicular to these isolines therefore flow network was created based on the direction of the groundwater movement and the isolines obtained from wells and springs domenico and schwartz 1990 in addition the value of the flow was determined using the technique of section area and speed at one of the sites site e 3 results geological sections in the study area had three main layers the first was composed of recent basalts where the shallow aquifer was located the second contained fluvio lacustrine sediments and tuffs and the third was based on andesites where the main aquifer is located fig 2 based on these results it is possible to consider two aquifers the shallow and the main one not all the sampled springs have natural origin springs e f and g are outcrops of groundwater as a result of deep excavations spring e outcrops at 40 m depth and springs f and g emerge at 8 m depth with respect to the original natural terrain the average temperature of water in sampled springs was 19 4 c while the temperature of water from wells was 17 0 c ph values of the water samples fluctuated between 6 41 and 8 64 and the highest values were obtained at site d the tds values ranged from 154 mg l to 347 mg l however springs f and g were more similar to the water extraction wells than to the other springs where the values were considerably lower table 1 water from springs and wells has a similar chemical composition based on the concentration of major ions table 2 as can be seen in the piper diagram fig 3 the samples are grouped in the central part due to this chemical similarity stiff diagram fig 4 shows that the water from wells a b c had the same behavior in the preferential cations na k and mg water from springs d e f and g was more enriched in ca than water from wells anion values had a similar behavior while springs had depleted values of cl wells were enriched in addition springs f and g located in the excavated area site have higher concentrations of cl than other springs of the study area isotopic results from water samples are distributed along a trend line corresponding to the evaporation process fig 5 wells a b and c are the closest to the local meteorological line while springs d and e are located furthest away suggesting that the latter two are more influenced by the evaporation process than springs a b and c the direction of water flow was from southwest to northeast in both aquifers shallow and main the flow value obtained only from site e was 77 78 m3 d in dry season and 10 160 64 m3 d in rainy season the results locate the repsa and tlalpan forest in the middle of the shallow aquifer therefore their influence of these green spaces is towards the northeast region fig 6a and b based on these results a synthesis figure was generated to illustrate the position the depth and the distance of both shallow and main aquifers fig 4 the water isotopic values of d2h ranged from 50 4 to 72 9 while the values of d18o ranged from 6 71 to 10 20 fig 4 shows the local meteoric line lml continuous line determined by cortés and farvolden 1989 here isotopic data are aligned following the trend of an evaporation line el dotted line springs d and e showed greater evaporation while the other sampled sites remained close to the lml which suggests that all sites have a common water source water analyzed from wells a b and c was infiltrated at an elevation of 3200 m above sea level fig 7 water from the springs f and g was infiltrated at an elevation of 2800 m above sea level fig 7 the results for springs d and e were not considered due to the apparent high influence of evaporation there were low concentrations of most of the trace elements table 3 and some elements had concentrations lower than the level of determination lod a possible exception is the concentration of fe found in water of the well a which can be interpreted as a consequence of basalt weathering at the site that resulted in clays that are rich in this element hem 1992 with the exception of the mentioned variables there were no other chemical differences between the samples which suggested that all the groundwater was from the same water source 4 discussion after analyzing the isotopic results from springs and wells appendix 2 two different components of the groundwater systems were identified the shallow component and the main one the main groundwater component was reported by morales casique et al 2015 however the shallow component has never been reported before contrary to the main aquifer this shallow component is unconfined a combination of conglomerate tuff and clay layers separate these two components geological sections fig 2 this separation is due to the low hydraulic conductivity in these materials the hydraulic conductivity assigned to clay is 0 000006 m d based on data from fetter 2001 however the aquifers can be hydraulically connected in zones where there is no presence of the layer with low conductivity or its thickness is small in addition results suggest that the main aquifer is recharged at an altitude of 3200 m a s l which corresponds to the foothills of the sierra del ajusco while the shallow aquifer is recharged at the elevation of 2800 m a s l which is in the high areas of the xitle volcano although the soil and subsoil of the original extension of pedregal provide a high infiltration zone the majority of this region is occupied by urban area 63 therefore the main recharge of the shallow aquifer occurs in the area close to xitle volcanic cone however an important part of this infiltration may come also from the preserved green spaces the water tables of both aquifers in the geological sections provide an important tool for understanding aquifer dynamics and interactions through the geological section analysis some characteristics of the shallow aquifer were identified like the shallow aquifer thickness that has an average of approximately 10 m the isotopic and hydrochemical results suggest that both aquifers have the same origin possibly from rainwater infiltration in the southern part of the valley and that both receive the same mineral inputs additionally places of the wells for water extraction i e a b and c are close to the local meteorological line suggesting they are principally originated from rainwater and they are not heavily affected by the evaporation process those places were springs are located are more distant from the local meteorological line suggesting they may be more affected by the evaporation process craig 1961 this high evaporation can explain the results from d and e which are farther than the rest of the sampled springs the level of evaporation suggests that the water from the extraction wells circulates in a deeper component than the water in springs that circulates near the surface this is consistent with spring evaporation e f and g that is shown in the piper diagram the water chemical composition of both aquifers is similar since water interacts with rocks from volcanic origin processes such as water rock interaction could dominate behavior in wells and springs therefore results suggest that wells are more influenced than springs by the water rock interaction process the ionic content is relatively low and similar in both aquifers because springs d and e in the northeastern and southwestern regions respectively have the lowest hydrochemical value it is likely that water was recently infiltrated and had a short course through the subsoil chebotarev 1955 domenico 1972 freeze and cherry 1979 the water flow of the shallow aquifer is contained in the basalt associated with the xitle lava spills delgado et al 1998 siebe 2000 the circulation of groundwater occurs through interconnected fractures vacuoles and lava flow tunnels this generates highly variable groundwater flows most of them at high speeds compared to other groundwater dynamics in the main aquifer the water circulation occurs in two types of rock with high hydraulic conductivity from the quaternary age dacite and andesite arce et al 2015 morales casique et al 2015 the same direction of groundwater flow from southwest to northeast indicates that the water in the strata of both aquifers moves gravitationally from the recharge zones in high topographic areas to the lower areas of the valley these lower regions are located outside of the limit of the shallow aquifer but it is probable that the isolating conglomerate and clay layers are highly reduced here and both aquifers may be hydraulically connected this assumption appears to be confirmed because the basalt strata from the xitle ends in this region leaving only the basalt strata from the ajusco which was under the xitle strata in higher areas to support this there is no record of springs or other type of water discharges from the shallow aquifer to the surface in the border area were xitle strata ends however this potential hydraulic connection should be evaluated in future studies the extension of the shallow aquifer seems to correspond to the original extension of the pedregal 80 km2 and therefore enhances the potential influence of surface activates on the shallow aquifer the land use in this area is divided into two categories urban and green spaces which respectively represent 73 and 27 of the original extension of the pedregal lot and cano santana 2009 additionally green spaces above the shallow aquifer can be divided into two categories green spaces that have suffered human modifications e g parks and green spaces with original characteristics e g urban forests calderón contreras and quiroz rosas 2017 the first type of green spaces built with artificial materials and including exotic vegetation represent 7 of the volcanic influence region and 47 of the green spaces the second type of green spaces represent 8 of the volcanic influence region and 53 of the green spaces based on lot and cano santana 2009 there are also private gardens that have the same characteristics as the urban parks but their size and distribution are unknown and thus they were excluded from the analysis nevertheless because decision makers do not recognize the shallow aquifer there has not been any planning or management strategy related to it kralisch et al 2012 all the management strategies are focused on the main aquifer that it is overexploited and influenced by processes that occurred thousands of years ago while the shallow aquifer is affected by recent events such as urbanization south of the city the absence of management implies short term consequences for the city these consequences are even more relevant since the shallow aquifer could be a complementary source of water supply if it is properly managed in addition due to the depth of the urban shallow aquifers and the types of rock and soil that are above them these aquifers are highly sensitive to pollution from different kinds of sources on the surface like industries disposal of solid waste sewage system gas stations fuel tanks urban zone and abandoned water extraction wells soto et al 2000 therefore the need of a proper planning and management strategy that includes land use green spaces perseveration is needed to prevent and reduce the pollution of both aquifers 5 conclusion the results confirm the presence of a shallow component of the groundwater system in the south of mexico city the shallow aquifer is unconfined and hydraulically independent from the main aquifer but it is possible they have a connection close to the border of the shallow aquifer this aquifer could be considered as a complementary source of the water supply for the city however a deeper analyses of water quality and its relationship with the main aquifer is needed to understand its impact on water supply for the city green spaces located in zones above the shallow aquifer seem to be important for the recharge of the aquifer in urban zones and land use management must consider this interaction around the world the importance of shallow aquifers are increasing for a sustainable hydric management the time scale of their fluxes is short enough to react to human activities and therefore this allows to evaluate the effect of human actions on the water supply on the contrary deeper aquifers have large time scale geological processes implying that the present activities would modify water management thousands of years in the future acknowledgements mc wishes to acknowledge the posgrado en ciencias biológicas of the universidad nacional autónoma de méxico unam and we thank neighbors in the pedregal zone

12294,mexico city is an example of intense socio ecosystem interactions particularly in water management the groundwater under this city has complex structures and dynamics due to the coexistence of aquifers located at different depths through groundwater extraction the main aquifer supports 71 of the water demand of the city in this research we describe the dynamics between aquifers and the surface particularly in preserved spaces located south of the city the results indicate the presence of a shallow aquifer that is relatively independent to the main one the water of both aquifers has the same origin rainwater and the same water flow direction but it has different recharge areas and residence times apparently there is a strong interaction between the shallow aquifer and the surface in which the small proportion of preserved green spaces 27 km2 in relation to urbanized ones 53 km2 may produce negative consequences on the quality and quantity of groundwater the lack of knowledge about the dynamics of the shallow aquifer leads to its underappreciation for the water management of the city graphical abstract fx1 keywords shallow aquifers pedregal infiltration recharge groundwater 1 introduction cities are complex systems with constant interactions between their social and ecological variables which generate the so called socio ecosystems fischer et al 2015 in these interactions green spaces are relevant because they increase landscape properties hough 2004 that are critical providers of direct and indirect benefits to human well being and health bennett et al 2015 these areas must be properly managed to stimulate inclusive sustainable and resilient cities mcphearson et al 2014 thus there are two approaches used to promote the preservation of these green spaces tallis and lubchenco 2014 the first is the instrumental approach which focuses on the benefits i e ecosystem services that the green spaces provide to the urban population reid 2006 and the second is the intrinsic value approach which is used to preserve biodiversity acosta and esperanza 2011 mexico city is an example of intense interactions between ecological and social variables especially regarding water this city with 22 million inhabitants has a water demand of 77 m3 s mazari hiriart et al 2014 part of this demand 71 is supplied by groundwater extraction through wells from the main aquifer the depth of this aquifer ranges from 70 to 500 m and it is an heterogenous unit with granular materials and fractured volcanic rocks previous studies have divided this aquifer into two sub units due to an increase of clays materials at 150 m of depth the first sub unit at 70 180 m and the second at 180 500 m morales casique et al 2014 the main aquifer is overexploited to satisfy the water demands of human population according to the national commission of water conagua in spanish this overexploitation is reflected in an annual extraction of 1103 98 mm3 which surpasses the amount of water that is infiltrated conagua 2015 these numbers do not consider the water required by ecosystems dynamics and therefore values must be recalculated to have a more realistic understanding of the watershed hydrodynamics rohde et al 2017 the overexploitation of the main aquifer has different consequences such as the draining of shallow aquifers to the main one which can generate land subsidence in different areas of the city and consequently more vulnerable citizens to earthquakes and fissures in superficial water bodies kralisch et al 2012 legorreta 2006 the groundwater system has a complex structure due to the coexistence of aquifers that are located at different depths these aquifers are nourished with water from diverse ecosystems that have multiple types of soil therefore numerous groundwater dynamics are generated tóth 2015 this dynamics diversity starts from the regions in which they are recharged and includes the distance and the speed at which the water travels each rocky area lake woodland or urban region has different fluxes dynamics which generate differences in the quality and quantity of water that is infiltrated into the groundwater system shallow aquifers are the most susceptible of being polluted by surface activities because of their proximity and according to the characteristics of the surface these aquifers are susceptible to different type pollutants however most of these aquifers are interconnected and in consequence pollution can spread throughout the water system and all of them can be affected by the overexploitation of the main aquifer lee et al 2015 the amount of sources of groundwater pollution in mexico city soto et al 2000 increases the urgency of understanding the water flow dynamics among the overexploited aquifers in mexico city the main sources of groundwater pollution are industries solid waste disposal the sewage system gas stations fuel tanks the urban zone and the abandoned water extraction wells soto et al 2000 within mexico city three municipalities are located above the shallow aquifer alvaro obregon coyoacan and tlalpan according to soto et al 2000 these municipalities have several sources of pollution that could affect the groundwater alvaro obregon municipality is mainly affected by pollution and fuel tanks represent a major threat tlalpan municipality is the least affected by pollution and the main risk is generated by solid waste coyoacan municipality has an intermediate level of risk and urbanization is the major threat soto et al 2000 therefore managing the sources of pollution on the surface above the shallow aquifer is crucial due to groundwater susceptibility of pollution in mexico city green spaces have become a cornerstone to provide water source to feed aquifers the pedregal is a good example of a preserved area in mexico city this area was formed by basaltic rock from the xitle volcanic eruption that occurred approximately 1670 years ago and this rocky formation has low presence of soil which explains its name pedregal rocky area the pedregal has an average annual temperature of 16 1 c and an annual accumulated precipitation of 870 2 mm cano santana et al 2009 due to the urban expansion that has occurred over the last century the pedregal has suffered a dramatic fragmentation and area reduction from 80 km2 in 1954 to 40 km2 in 1984 currently there are only two important green spaces within the original extension of the pedregal the reserva ecológica del pedregal de san ángel repsa and the tlalpan s forest the tlalpan s forest does not have the original characteristics of the pedregal because it suffered human related transformations in the creation of this urban park therefore the provision of ecosystem services of the tlalpan s forest has been influenced by humans calderón contreras and quiroz rosas 2017 the repsa is a natural protected area where the pristine characteristics of the pedregal have been preserved calderón contreras and quiroz rosas 2017 currently the repsa is considered the last remaining area of the pedregal with only 2 37 km2 based at the universidad nacional autonoma de méxico unam alvarez sanchez et al 1994 rojo curiel 1994 fig 1 the fragmentation and reduced area of the pedregal has a negative impact on the biodiversity and the ecosystem dynamics however the pedregal still provides ecosystem services to the population of mexico city nava lópez et al 2009 the lack of green spaces can generate a reduction in the amount water infiltration because the soil in urbanized areas is practically impermeable and the rainwater in this area is diverted to sewage systems this often results in floods in the lowlands of the city zambrano et al 2017 despite having a large sewage system the rainwater diversion process in mexico city is inefficient candiani 2014 particularly under extreme storms which will be commoner with climate change zambrano et al 2017 because of the low presence of soil and the characteristics of the subsoil the zone of the pedregal has high hydraulic conductivity since this area promotes a fast water infiltration the repsa provides ecosystem services related to the regulation of water quality and quantity of the aquifer nava lópez et al 2009 the human population living in the pedregal ecosystem has always used water from the shallow aquifer using the scattered springs that occur in the area however this water is underappreciated by managers possibly because of the lack of knowledge on the dynamics of the aquifer for example throughout the entire city it is common to re direct the water from springs to the sewage system once it appears while an infrastructure project is being built the lack of knowledge about the characteristics of the aquifer may result in the detrimental use of water and the pollution of this scarce and valuable resource in the city therefore the objective of this research is to understand the relationship between the aquifers and to evaluate the influence of the surface area of the preserved pedregal in the southern part of mexico city 2 methods geological sections provide stratigraphy information which helps to understand how groundwater moves between aquifers to obtain information from the geological sections the lithological columns from the water extraction wells that surround the repsa were analyzed data from sacmex which stands for water system of mexico city in spanish the lithologies were clustered according to the geological local map of carrillo trueba 1995 twelve lithological columns from wells were used in section i direction northeast to southwest and eleven lithological columns from wells were used in section ii direction west to east fig 1 water sampling was made in june 24 2016 at seven sites within the pedregal fig 1 four of these sites were natural springs in private spaces i e d e f and g and three i e a b and c were water extraction wells that were property of sacmex the water field parameters electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds ph temperature t redox potential eh were measured at all sites using multi parameter equipment hanna instruments 9812 water samples were collected to determine the main anions hco3 cl so4 2 no3 po4 3 the main cations na k ca2 mg2 and the trace elements al as ba cd cr cu fe mn na pb and zn at the collection site samples were filtered through 0 45 μm millipore cellulose nitrate filters the samples collected for cation and trace element analyses were also acidified with hno3 to ph 2 appelo and postma 2005 all samples were stored in a cooler at approximately 4 c and transported to the institute of geology at unam anions and cations were analyzed by liquid chromatography in the chromatography laboratory and trace elements were analyzed by inductive coupling plasma icp with an optical emission spectrophotometer oes icp oes in the atomic spectroscopy laboratory institute of geology unam cations and anions had a charge balance error cbe from 0 7 to 5 3 acceptable water analyses have cbe values less than 5 u s g s 2007 samples for stable isotopes d18o and d2h wassenaar et al 2009 were collected and analyzed by laser spectroscopy in the isotopic laboratory of davis university california united states of america the results were expressed as the relative abundance with respect to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow and were compared to the local meteorological line this line was determined based on rain water samples that were obtained from the sierra del ajusco at the top of the basin and complied with the equation d2h 7 95 d18o 11 77 r 0 989 cortés and farvolden 1989 additionally the altitude above medium sea level where the recharge of the groundwater system occurred was calculated and complied with the equation d18o 2 13z 3 2 1000 which was based on isotopic data from cortés and durazo 2001 the topographic elevation of the land was used to establish the altitude of the water table because groundwater moves from high pressure to low pressure areas darcy 1856 domenico and schwartz 1990 tóth 1963 the altitude of the water table was calculated with the equation topography elevation m a s l water table depth m the water table is where the surface water head is equal to the atmospheric pressure freeze and cherry 1979 the altitude of the water table in each well and the topographic elevation in springs were used separately to create isolines the groundwater movement is perpendicular to these isolines therefore flow network was created based on the direction of the groundwater movement and the isolines obtained from wells and springs domenico and schwartz 1990 in addition the value of the flow was determined using the technique of section area and speed at one of the sites site e 3 results geological sections in the study area had three main layers the first was composed of recent basalts where the shallow aquifer was located the second contained fluvio lacustrine sediments and tuffs and the third was based on andesites where the main aquifer is located fig 2 based on these results it is possible to consider two aquifers the shallow and the main one not all the sampled springs have natural origin springs e f and g are outcrops of groundwater as a result of deep excavations spring e outcrops at 40 m depth and springs f and g emerge at 8 m depth with respect to the original natural terrain the average temperature of water in sampled springs was 19 4 c while the temperature of water from wells was 17 0 c ph values of the water samples fluctuated between 6 41 and 8 64 and the highest values were obtained at site d the tds values ranged from 154 mg l to 347 mg l however springs f and g were more similar to the water extraction wells than to the other springs where the values were considerably lower table 1 water from springs and wells has a similar chemical composition based on the concentration of major ions table 2 as can be seen in the piper diagram fig 3 the samples are grouped in the central part due to this chemical similarity stiff diagram fig 4 shows that the water from wells a b c had the same behavior in the preferential cations na k and mg water from springs d e f and g was more enriched in ca than water from wells anion values had a similar behavior while springs had depleted values of cl wells were enriched in addition springs f and g located in the excavated area site have higher concentrations of cl than other springs of the study area isotopic results from water samples are distributed along a trend line corresponding to the evaporation process fig 5 wells a b and c are the closest to the local meteorological line while springs d and e are located furthest away suggesting that the latter two are more influenced by the evaporation process than springs a b and c the direction of water flow was from southwest to northeast in both aquifers shallow and main the flow value obtained only from site e was 77 78 m3 d in dry season and 10 160 64 m3 d in rainy season the results locate the repsa and tlalpan forest in the middle of the shallow aquifer therefore their influence of these green spaces is towards the northeast region fig 6a and b based on these results a synthesis figure was generated to illustrate the position the depth and the distance of both shallow and main aquifers fig 4 the water isotopic values of d2h ranged from 50 4 to 72 9 while the values of d18o ranged from 6 71 to 10 20 fig 4 shows the local meteoric line lml continuous line determined by cortés and farvolden 1989 here isotopic data are aligned following the trend of an evaporation line el dotted line springs d and e showed greater evaporation while the other sampled sites remained close to the lml which suggests that all sites have a common water source water analyzed from wells a b and c was infiltrated at an elevation of 3200 m above sea level fig 7 water from the springs f and g was infiltrated at an elevation of 2800 m above sea level fig 7 the results for springs d and e were not considered due to the apparent high influence of evaporation there were low concentrations of most of the trace elements table 3 and some elements had concentrations lower than the level of determination lod a possible exception is the concentration of fe found in water of the well a which can be interpreted as a consequence of basalt weathering at the site that resulted in clays that are rich in this element hem 1992 with the exception of the mentioned variables there were no other chemical differences between the samples which suggested that all the groundwater was from the same water source 4 discussion after analyzing the isotopic results from springs and wells appendix 2 two different components of the groundwater systems were identified the shallow component and the main one the main groundwater component was reported by morales casique et al 2015 however the shallow component has never been reported before contrary to the main aquifer this shallow component is unconfined a combination of conglomerate tuff and clay layers separate these two components geological sections fig 2 this separation is due to the low hydraulic conductivity in these materials the hydraulic conductivity assigned to clay is 0 000006 m d based on data from fetter 2001 however the aquifers can be hydraulically connected in zones where there is no presence of the layer with low conductivity or its thickness is small in addition results suggest that the main aquifer is recharged at an altitude of 3200 m a s l which corresponds to the foothills of the sierra del ajusco while the shallow aquifer is recharged at the elevation of 2800 m a s l which is in the high areas of the xitle volcano although the soil and subsoil of the original extension of pedregal provide a high infiltration zone the majority of this region is occupied by urban area 63 therefore the main recharge of the shallow aquifer occurs in the area close to xitle volcanic cone however an important part of this infiltration may come also from the preserved green spaces the water tables of both aquifers in the geological sections provide an important tool for understanding aquifer dynamics and interactions through the geological section analysis some characteristics of the shallow aquifer were identified like the shallow aquifer thickness that has an average of approximately 10 m the isotopic and hydrochemical results suggest that both aquifers have the same origin possibly from rainwater infiltration in the southern part of the valley and that both receive the same mineral inputs additionally places of the wells for water extraction i e a b and c are close to the local meteorological line suggesting they are principally originated from rainwater and they are not heavily affected by the evaporation process those places were springs are located are more distant from the local meteorological line suggesting they may be more affected by the evaporation process craig 1961 this high evaporation can explain the results from d and e which are farther than the rest of the sampled springs the level of evaporation suggests that the water from the extraction wells circulates in a deeper component than the water in springs that circulates near the surface this is consistent with spring evaporation e f and g that is shown in the piper diagram the water chemical composition of both aquifers is similar since water interacts with rocks from volcanic origin processes such as water rock interaction could dominate behavior in wells and springs therefore results suggest that wells are more influenced than springs by the water rock interaction process the ionic content is relatively low and similar in both aquifers because springs d and e in the northeastern and southwestern regions respectively have the lowest hydrochemical value it is likely that water was recently infiltrated and had a short course through the subsoil chebotarev 1955 domenico 1972 freeze and cherry 1979 the water flow of the shallow aquifer is contained in the basalt associated with the xitle lava spills delgado et al 1998 siebe 2000 the circulation of groundwater occurs through interconnected fractures vacuoles and lava flow tunnels this generates highly variable groundwater flows most of them at high speeds compared to other groundwater dynamics in the main aquifer the water circulation occurs in two types of rock with high hydraulic conductivity from the quaternary age dacite and andesite arce et al 2015 morales casique et al 2015 the same direction of groundwater flow from southwest to northeast indicates that the water in the strata of both aquifers moves gravitationally from the recharge zones in high topographic areas to the lower areas of the valley these lower regions are located outside of the limit of the shallow aquifer but it is probable that the isolating conglomerate and clay layers are highly reduced here and both aquifers may be hydraulically connected this assumption appears to be confirmed because the basalt strata from the xitle ends in this region leaving only the basalt strata from the ajusco which was under the xitle strata in higher areas to support this there is no record of springs or other type of water discharges from the shallow aquifer to the surface in the border area were xitle strata ends however this potential hydraulic connection should be evaluated in future studies the extension of the shallow aquifer seems to correspond to the original extension of the pedregal 80 km2 and therefore enhances the potential influence of surface activates on the shallow aquifer the land use in this area is divided into two categories urban and green spaces which respectively represent 73 and 27 of the original extension of the pedregal lot and cano santana 2009 additionally green spaces above the shallow aquifer can be divided into two categories green spaces that have suffered human modifications e g parks and green spaces with original characteristics e g urban forests calderón contreras and quiroz rosas 2017 the first type of green spaces built with artificial materials and including exotic vegetation represent 7 of the volcanic influence region and 47 of the green spaces the second type of green spaces represent 8 of the volcanic influence region and 53 of the green spaces based on lot and cano santana 2009 there are also private gardens that have the same characteristics as the urban parks but their size and distribution are unknown and thus they were excluded from the analysis nevertheless because decision makers do not recognize the shallow aquifer there has not been any planning or management strategy related to it kralisch et al 2012 all the management strategies are focused on the main aquifer that it is overexploited and influenced by processes that occurred thousands of years ago while the shallow aquifer is affected by recent events such as urbanization south of the city the absence of management implies short term consequences for the city these consequences are even more relevant since the shallow aquifer could be a complementary source of water supply if it is properly managed in addition due to the depth of the urban shallow aquifers and the types of rock and soil that are above them these aquifers are highly sensitive to pollution from different kinds of sources on the surface like industries disposal of solid waste sewage system gas stations fuel tanks urban zone and abandoned water extraction wells soto et al 2000 therefore the need of a proper planning and management strategy that includes land use green spaces perseveration is needed to prevent and reduce the pollution of both aquifers 5 conclusion the results confirm the presence of a shallow component of the groundwater system in the south of mexico city the shallow aquifer is unconfined and hydraulically independent from the main aquifer but it is possible they have a connection close to the border of the shallow aquifer this aquifer could be considered as a complementary source of the water supply for the city however a deeper analyses of water quality and its relationship with the main aquifer is needed to understand its impact on water supply for the city green spaces located in zones above the shallow aquifer seem to be important for the recharge of the aquifer in urban zones and land use management must consider this interaction around the world the importance of shallow aquifers are increasing for a sustainable hydric management the time scale of their fluxes is short enough to react to human activities and therefore this allows to evaluate the effect of human actions on the water supply on the contrary deeper aquifers have large time scale geological processes implying that the present activities would modify water management thousands of years in the future acknowledgements mc wishes to acknowledge the posgrado en ciencias biológicas of the universidad nacional autónoma de méxico unam and we thank neighbors in the pedregal zone
