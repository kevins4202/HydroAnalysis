295,hydraulic parameters define the water retention θ ψ and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k θ functions these functions are usually obtained by fitting experimental data using inverse modelling the drawback of inverting the hydraulic parameters is that they suffer from non uniqueness and the optimal hydraulic parameters may not be physical to reduce the non uniqueness it is necessary to invert the hydraulic parameters simultaneously from observations of θ ψ and k θ and ensure the measurements cover the full range of θ from saturated to oven dry the challenge of using bimodal θ ψ and k θ compared to unimodal functions is that it requires double the number of parameters one set for the matrix and another set for the macropore domain the objective of this paper is to address this shortcoming by deriving a procedure to reduce the number of parameters to be optimized to obtain a unique physical set of bimodal soil kosugi hydraulic parameters from inverse modelling to achieve this we 1 derive residual volumetric soil water content from the kosugi standard deviation parameter of the soil matrix 2 derive macropore hydraulic parameters from the water pressure head threshold between macropore and matrix flow and 3 dynamically constrain the kosugi hydraulic parameters of the soil matrix the procedure successfully reduces the number of optimized hydraulic parameters and dynamically constrains the hydraulic parameters without compromising the fit of the θ ψ and k θ functions and the derived hydraulic parameters are more physical the robustness of the methodology is demonstrated by deriving the hydraulic parameters exclusively from θ ψ and k s data enabling satisfactory prediction of k θ even when no additional k θ data are available keywords kosugi hydraulic model dual porosity hydraulic parameters inverse modelling non uniqueness 1 introduction running hydrological models that solve the richards equation requires knowledge of physical soil hydraulic parameters the soil hydraulic parameters define the water retention θ ψ and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k θ functions e g brooks and corey 1964 van genuchten 1980 kosugi 1994 the hydraulic parameters are usually obtained by fitting measured values of the θ ψ and k ψ to the corresponding θ ψ and k θ functions however a serious drawback of deriving the hydraulic parameters by inverse modelling is that they suffer from equifinality or non uniqueness ines and droogers 2002 ines and mohanty 2008 pollacco et al 2008b sonkar et al 2019 beven 1993 defines equifinality as when more than one set of parameters give acceptable simulations relative to a given measure of goodness of fit between simulated and measured values pollacco et al 2008b found that to reduce the range equifinality and obtain a unique set of hydraulic parameters it is necessary to invert the hydraulic parameters simultaneously from observations of both θ ψ and k θ and that the measurements must cover the full range of θ from fully saturated to oven dry however it is rarely the case that we have such rich data sets it has been shown that non uniqueness or equifinality problems cause a number of challenges in hydrological modelling pollacco et al 2008a 2008b pollacco and angulo jaramillo 2009 as follows linked parameters of inverted hydraulic parameters pollacco et al 2008b are sets of parameters that have a mathematical relationship between them such that these parameters produce similar objective function values close to those obtained with the optimal parameter set linked parameters cause challenges for the inverse modelling algorithm and the identification of parameters to avoid such problems the mathematical formulations should be properly set up with no inter correlated parameters non uniqueness solution results in sets of optimal hydraulic parameters with some of them exhibiting non physical hydraulic values which detaches the physical relationship between θ ψ and k θ pollacco et al 2013b 2017 this is an important limitation for physically based models that can preclude convergence when solving the richards equation optimal non physical hydraulic parameters cannot be physically interpreted and therefore cannot be used to model hydrological processes for example to derive the impact of tillage practices on the value of the hydraulic parameters describing the pore size distribution drewry et al 2019 in order to address these three potential issues that may arise when the hydraulic parameters are inverted without access to the full range of θ ψ and k θ it is important to derive methods to reduce the probability of obtaining non physical soil hydraulic properties by preventing non physical combinations of hydraulic parameter sets typically most studies perform the fit of observations to unimodal hydraulic functions while bimodal structured soils are more the rule than the exception jarvis 2007 mcleod et al 2008 these soils have both macropores and micropores with two stage drainage e g carrick et al 2010 fast flow macropore flow can occur when the water pressure head exceeds the threshold needed to activate the macropore network adding to the matrix flow below this threshold only the matrix participates in the flow the combination of these two stages is known as bimodal hydraulic behaviour or dual permeability and was the subject of previous characterizations lassabatere et al 2019 2014 by nature these soils have a bimodal pore size distribution and although soil structure is one of the main reasons for this bimodal behaviour could also happen for purely textural reasons e g durner 1994 therefore soils with bimodal pore systems cannot be adequately described by unimodal hydraulic functions in addition to the need to account for dual permeability behaviour a proper choice of θ ψ and k θ should be made to adequately describe each pore size domain macro versus micro matrix the θ ψ and k θ are often expressed as closed form unimodal functions e g brooks and corey 1964 clapp and hornberger 1978 van genuchten 1980 this paper adopts the kosugi 1994 θ ψ and k θ functions because this model presents a physical basis for the description of pore size log normal distribution and their related parameters are physically sound soils have a large variation in pore radius which according to kosugi 1996 follows a log normal probability density function pollacco et al 2017 and romano and nasta 2016 found improvement by using bimodal log normal expressions dual porosity models compared to using unimodal θ ψ and k θ especially for top soils which are biologically more active pollacco et al 2013b showed that the hydraulic parameters of the kosugi model can be constrained by deriving an empirical relationship between them nevertheless the drawback of the pollacco et al 2013b method is that a the derived methodology is purely empirical and may not work universally and b the method was developed for soils with unimodal pore distribution and should be adapted to multi modal soils the challenge of using bimodal or dual permeability functions is that they require double the number of parameters with as many as eight hydraulic parameters to be optimized pollacco et al 2017 which can exacerbate the problems of non uniqueness to enable the use of bimodal hydraulic functions we present new methods to reduce the number of hydraulic parameters by using principles of soil physics such that the optimal set of the optimal hydraulic parameters is within physical limits we reduce the non uniqueness of optimised kosugi hydraulic parameters by deriving the relationship between the parameters from principles of soil physics which we apply to the bimodal θ ψ and k θ functions this paper is organised as follows section 2 presents the bimodal soil kosugi hydraulic functions and outlines the physical set of constraints proposed for the hydraulic parameters to reduce non uniqueness section 3 presents the experimental data and the numerical algorithm used to derive the soil hydraulic parameters section 4 evaluates the performance of the different constraints when deriving θ ψ and k θ under a range of scenarios and shows that the proposed method can also be used to infer k θ when only θ ψ and k s data are available and section 5 summarises the main conclusions 2 theory 2 1 bimodal kosugi hydraulic functions in this study for convenience the water pressure head values are taken to be positive i e ψ 0 for unsaturated soils defining ψ macmat l as the water pressure head threshold between macropore and matrix then fast flow macropore flow can occur when ψ ψ macmat ψ is small enough to activate the macropores and matrix flow soil water moves in the micropores is when ψ ψ macmat the bimodal kosugi log normal probability density function is described by pollacco et al 2017 as 1 θ ψ ψ θ mat ψ ψ θ mac ψ ψ θ mat ψ ψ θ smacmat θ r σ ψ 2 π e ln ψ ln ψ m 2 2 σ 2 θ mac ψ ψ θ s θ smacmat σ mac ψ 2 π e ln ψ ln ψ mmac 2 2 σ mac θ r θ smat θ s where θ l3 l 3 represents the volumetric soil water content splitted between the volumetric soil water content in the soil matrix domain θ mat l3 l 3 and the volumetric soil water content in the soil macropore domain θ mac l3 l 3 and ψ l the water pressure head with ψ 0 for unsaturated soils θ s l3 l 3 and θ r l3 l 3 are the saturated and residual volumetric soil water content respectively ln ψ m l indicating the argument of ln in units of length i e ψ m in l and σ denote the mean and standard deviation of ln ψ l respectively in the soil matrix domain ln ψ mmac l and σ mac denote the mean and standard deviation of ln ψ respectively in the soil macropore domain and θ smacmat l3 l 3 is the saturated volumetric soil water content that differentiates inter aggregate pores structural macropores and matrix domains intra aggregate micropores integrating eq 1 from 0 to ψ yields the kosugi bimodal θ ψ 2 θ ψ θ mat ψ θ mac ψ θ mat ψ 1 2 θ s macmat θ r erfc ln ψ ln ψ m σ 2 θ r θ mac ψ 1 2 θ s θ s macmat erfc ln ψ ln ψ m mac σ mac 2 where erfc is the complementary error function the bimodal unsaturated hydraulic conductivity expressed as a function of the effective saturation k s e can be written according to pollacco et al 2017 as 3 s e θ θ r θ s θ r k s e k mat s e k mac s e k mat s e

denotes the effective saturation such that 0 s e 1 note that the model can be considered as unimodal if the following condition is met 4 θ s θ smacmat 0 01 2 2 constraining the kosugi hydraulic parameters fitting measured θ ψ and k ψ data on eqs 3 and 4 requires optimizing eight soil hydraulic parameters θ s θ r σ ψ m k s θ smacmat σ mac and ψ mmac the simultaneous estimation of all these parameters may cause problems of non uniqueness non unique hydraulic parameters were also obtained even when inverting only five hydraulic parameters using close form unimodal hydraulic functions pollacco et al 2013a 2008b pollacco and mohanty 2012 therefore there is a need to reduce the number of parameters while providing hydraulic parameters that are physically sound 2 2 1 deriving θ r from σ the residual volumetric soil water content θ r is a parameter without strict physical meaning which is usually considered as the minimum amount of water left in the soil when the water pressure head is infinite du 2020 θ r is often set to zero as it has been thought that this merely affects the goodness of fit for θ ψ and k θ clapp and hornberger 1978 pollacco et al 2013a 2008b pollacco and mohanty 2012 nevertheless fixing θ r at a constant value close to zero results in significant errors in the estimation of θ ψ especially for soils with significant clay fraction e g lee and ro 2014 mohammadi and meskini vishkaee 2013 pollacco et al 2020 found that θ r is related to the clay fraction and therefore could be correlated to σ large σ is associated with soils having high clay content therefore a higher ψ is needed for water to be extracted from the smallest pores resulting in higher θ r and vice versa for smaller σ the following empirical expression is based on pollacco et al 2020 which relates θ r to σ is proposed 5 σ σ σ min σ max σ min θ r θ rmax 1 e α 1 σ 1 e α 1 where θ rmax is set to 0 20 which was found by fitting θ ψ and k θ with laboratory data e g fernández gálvez et al 2019 pollacco et al 2020 2017 2013b the maximum value for θ r that was found to be satisfactory α1 15 and α2 4 are two optimized empirical parameters σ is the normalized σ and σ min and σ ma x values are obtained from table 1 the relationship between θ r and σ described in eq 5 is represented in fig 1 for σ values below 4 and the set of empirical parameters as indicated above the shape of the curve shows the increase of θ r with increasing σ while the empirical parameters are responsible for the steepness of the slope before reaching θ rmax using the relationship between θ r and σ described in eq 5 and shown in fig 1 not only reduces the number of optimized parameters but also reduces the non uniqueness of σ by enforcing its physical meaning pollacco et al 2020 2 2 2 deriving ψ mmac and σ mac from ψ macmat structured soils have both matrix inter aggregate pore spaces and macropore intra aggregate pore spaces where ψ macmat is the water pressure head boundary between macropore and matrix thus when the pores are saturated ψ ψ macmat the flow is considered macropore flow and when the soil is desaturated ψ ψ macmat the flow is considered matrix flow carrick et al 2010 found that ψ macmat ranges from 50 to 150 mm with an average of 100 mm also in agreement with other authors e g jarvis 2007 we assume that ψ macmat is a constant parameter and so it is fixed at 100 mm this threshold is also in line with previous studies and values suggested for the tension to be applied for the deactivation of the macropore network e g lassabatere et al 2019 2014 luxmoore 1981 timlin et al 1994 to reduce the number of optimized parameters and due to the narrow range of water pressure head in the macropore domain it is assumed following pollacco et al 2017 eq 15 that 6 ψ mmac e ln ψ macmat 2 ψ macmat moreover we assume that θ mac ψ macmat 0 in eq 2 and since θ ψ is a log normal distribution we derive the following relationship computed with a typical value of p σ 3 establishing ln ψ macmat at a water pressure head higher than ln ψ mmac which is three times the standard deviation of the logarithmic macropore size distribution 7 ln ψ macmat ln ψ mmac σ mac p σ ln ψ macmat 2 σ mac p σ which results in 8 σ mac ln ψ macmat 2 p σ thus by using eqs 6 and 8 with a fixed value of ψ macmat it is possible to compute the kosugi hydraulic parameters of the soil macropore domain without having to include them in the optimization scheme which further reduces the number of parameters to optimize the only macropore hydraulic parameter required is θ smacmat 2 2 3 reducing non uniqueness of the inverted σ and ψm pollacco et al 2013b showed that it is possible to reduce the non uniqueness of the unimodal kosugi hydraulic parameters by constraining the relationship between ψ m and σ taking advantage of the positive linear correlation between ln ψ m and σ such correlation exists because the large median pore size small ψ m which is characteristic of coarsely textured soils is linked to a smaller dispersion in pore size small σ this relationship can be explained by the fact that when ψ m is small the soil tends to have single grain texture monodisperse and so σ tends to be small on the other hand when ψ m increases corresponding to a smaller median pore size which is characteristic of finer material the soil becomes aggregated where the soil is made up of a range of grain sizes polydisperse and so σ tends to be larger pollacco et al 2013b found an empirical relation between these two parameters for a set of soils from the unsoda leij et al 1999 and hypres wösten et al 1999 databases and used it to reduce the non uniqueness of the inverted kosugi hydraulic parameters this relationship was also used by fernández gálvez et al 2019 to reduce the non uniqueness of the hydraulic parameters derived from infiltration tests 9 σ p σ 1 ln ψ m 1 p σ 2 where p σ1 and p σ2 are two fitting parameters 0 1 nevertheless the relationship shown in eq 9 is purely empirical and only applicable to the unimodal kosugi hydraulic functions therefore a physical relationship between ψ m and σ for the bimodal kosugi hydraulic functions is proposed in which the feasible range of ψ m is derived from σ similarly to eq 7 the following expression is set for the matrix pore space domain with p σ 3 10 ln ψ mmac ln ψ m σ p σ ln ψ macmat where isolating ψ m gives 11 e ln ψ mmac σ p σ ψ m e ln ψ macmat σ p σ and using eq 6 gives 12 ψ macmat e σ p σ ψ m ψ macmat e σ p σ for illustration purposes fig 2 shows the relationship between σ and ln ψ m using the dynamic physical range to reduce non uniqueness of the hydraulic parameters eq 12 for the set of studied soils described in section 3 1 and using the additional constraints corresponding to scenario g in table 2 fig 3 illustrates an example of the normalized constrained bimodal hydraulic functions se ψ and k se ψ for three different values of σ 0 75 2 38 and 4 00 and its corresponding feasible range of ψ m derived from eq 12 with s e θ smac 0 85 the feasible range of ψ m determines the shape of the curves with values between the solid and dotted lines corresponding to each of the σ considered the plot of the k se ψ curve for σ 4 and ψ m 15 shows a small artefact next to ln 1 ψ 1 due to the transformation ln 1 ψ in the x axis the dynamic physical feasible range of the optimized bimodal kosugi hydraulic parameters is indicated in table 1 as indicated in section 2 2 2 ψ macmat is considered constant with a value of 100 mm the proposed parsimonious bimodal kosugi θ ψ and k θ model requires only four parameters ψ m σ k s and θ smacmat to be optimized with ψ macmat set as a constant ψ mmac and σ mac derived from ψ macmat using eqs 6 and 8 respectively θ r derived from σ through eq 5 and θ s derived from total porosity moreover the non uniqueness between ψ m and σ is also reduced by eq 12 using the assumption that θ ψ and k θ are log normal distributed therefore the number of hydraulic parameters to be optimized is reduced from eight to four using the principles of soil physics 3 material and methods 3 1 experimental data used to validate the parsimonious bimodal θ ψ and k θ the model is validated with data collected across the canterbury region of new zealand pollacco et al 2020 the dataset has a sample size of n 259 collected from soil profiles at 46 different sites sampled sites include irrigated and non irrigated pastoral farming land rainfall across the sites varies from 550 to 800 mm per year soil parent material is sediments derived from quartzo feldspathic hard sandstone deposited as either river alluvium or windblown loess schmidt et al 2005 all soils in this study have at least 60 cm depth of fine earth soil material with most sites classifying to the pallic soil order in the new zealand soil classification hewitt 2010 correlating in the soil taxonomy to haplusteps and humustepts great groups fourteen sites have younger soils that classify to the recent soil order hewitt 2010 correlating to haplusteps and ustifluvent great groups soil was sampled using undisturbed soil cores of 59 cm3 5 cm diameter by 3 cm depth used for θ ψ measurements and undisturbed soil cores of 589 cm3 10 cm diameter by 7 5 cm depth used for k θ measurements to ensure consistent θ conditions at all sites water was infiltrated two days prior to sampling θ ψ values were measured at 40 70 100 500 1000 2000 4000 10 000 and 150 000 mm measurements less than 1000 mm water pressure head were made on high flow ceramic plates with water pressure head applied by a hanging water column while measurements above 1000 mm water pressure head were made using pressure chambers gradwell and birrell 1979 to measure k ψ the core samples were trimmed saturated and equilibrated to 10 40 70 and 100 mm water pressure head with a buchner funnel apparatus before unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was measured using disc permeameters set to the equivalent water pressure heads for each measurement additional detail about the experimental sites soil sampling and soil physical measurements is given in pollacco et al 2020 3 2 objective function and goodness of

github com robertfeldt blackboxoptim jl written in the julia language this procedure used an objective function and goodness of fit defined below the minimization process between the observed and the fitted values used a weighted objective function wof which includes information from both θ ψ and k θ data the wof is computed as follows 13 wof w i 1 l θ ψ obs i θ ψ si m i 2 i 1 l θ ψ obs i θ ψ obs

this case l 9 and k 4 θ ψ obs i and k θ obs i correspond to the observed data derived from the laboratory and θ ψ si m i and k θ si m i correspond to simulated values of the kosugi model the weighting parameter w rules the relative weight assigned to the fit of the θ ψ and k θ with w set to 0 5 providing the best compromise between the fit of θ ψ and k θ simultaneously the goodness of fit of the measured volumetric water retention data to the simulated θ ψ using the bimodal kosugi model was assessed using the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse θ ψ and the root mean squared error rmse θ

bimodal soil kosugi hydraulic parameters different scenarios tables 2 and 3 presented in the results section to derive the bimodal soil kosugi hydraulic parameters from inverse modelling are considered using the set of constraints described in section 2 2 the scenarios are compared to the reference scenario scenario a where all hydraulic parameters are optimized except for θ s which is derived from total porosity scenario b derives θ r from σ removing one degree of freedom in the optimization scheme scenarios c and d use a fixed value for σ mac or ψ mmac removing two degrees of freedom scenario e fixes simultaneously σ mac and ψ mmac removing three degrees of freedom finally scenarios f and g additionally include dynamically constraining σ and ψ m where θ r is freely optimised or θ r is derived from σ respectively the relevance of the constraints presented in section 2 2 to derive the bimodal kosugi hydraulic parameters is demonstrated by optimizing the parameters exclusively from θ ψ data in order to compare to the corresponding k θ curve a known value of k s is provided from scenario g like in the previous approach degrees of freedom are progressively removed by fixing σ mac and ψ mmac scenario h additionally deriving θ r from σ scenario i and dynamically constraining σ and ψ m with θ r freely optimised and θ r derived from σ scenarios j and k respectively 4 results 4 1 parsimonious kosugi bimodal θ ψ and k θ model this section shows the goodness of fit for θ ψ and k θ for different scenarios where the hydraulic parameters are progressively constrained the sensitivity for each of the constraints is evidenced by the corresponding decrease in the goodness of fit the soil hydraulic parameters θ r σ ψ m k s θ smacmat σ mac and ψ mmac are optimized using the bimodal θ ψ and k θ model described in section 2 1 this is performed by matching the simulated θ ψ and k θ values with the experimentally measured data described in section 3 1 θ s was not optimized but directly derived from total porosity using measured values of the dry bulk density and particle density θ s equals 96 5 of total porosity table 2 summarises the nse coefficients and rmse of the fit between observed and simulated θ ψ and k θ using the different constraints for the hydraulic parameters as described in section 2 2 simulated values for θ ψ and k θ are obtained with the optimized hydraulic parameters in each case scenario a to g in table 2 nse values close to 1 as well as rmse values close to 0 indicate perfect agreement between observed and simulated θ ψ and k θ table 2 shows that the fit of the bimodal kosugi hydraulic functions when optimizing the seven hydraulic parameters scenario a for the entire data set used in pollacco et al 2020 is excellent with a combined nse very close to unity n s e 0 987 and a combined rmse very close to zero r m s e 0 0040 it is expected that reducing the number of optimized hydraulic parameters and constraining them would reduce the goodness of fit first the number of optimized parameters was reduced to six scenario b deriving θ r from σ using eq 5 as presented in section 2 2 1 with a marginal decrease in the goodness of fit compared to the scenario a δ n s e 0 007 and δ r m s e 0 0016 in the next step scenario c only five parameters were optimized by also setting σ mac as a function of ψ macmat through eq 8 with fixed values for ψ macmat and p σ as described in section 2 2 2 the goodness of fit is slightly reduced compared to scenario a δ n s e 0 015 and δ r m s e 0 0018 next scenario d ψ mmac was set as a function of ψ macmat through eq 6 with a fixed value for ψ macmat while σ mac is optimized this required optimizing five parameters leading to a small further decrease in the goodness of fit compared to scenario a δ n s e 0 023 and δ r m s e 0 0020 as expected σ mac is more sensitive than ψ mmac to the fit the combination of the previous two scenarios reduces the number of optimized parameters to four when apart from relating θ r to σ simultaneously setting both σ mac and ψ mmac as a function of ψ macmat scenario e the reduction in the goodness of fit compared to scenario a is still negligible δ n s e 0 027 and δ r m s e 0 0023 to further constrain optimization of the hydraulic parameters the range of feasible values for σ and ψ m is dynamically constrained using eq 12 as described in section 2 2 3 so that the combination of both parameters is physically possible scenario f with five optimized parameters presents the results corresponding to the scenario where σ and ψ m are dynamically constrained with σ mac and ψ mmac set a function of ψ macmat and optimizing θ r freely within its feasible range as indicated in table 1 once again the reduction of the goodness of fit compared to scenario a remains negligible δ n s e 0 063 and δ r m s e 0 0033 finally scenario g also includes deriving θ r from σ reducing to four the number of optimized parameters with satisfactory goodness of fit compared to scenario a δ n s e 0 079 and δ r m s e 0 0036 therefore scenario g allows a reduction of the number of optimized parameters for the bimodal kosugi hydraulic model from seven to four without compromising the goodness of fit and while maintaining the hydraulic parameters within their physical limits although it is well known that the impact of θ r in the goodness of fit is significant this result also highlights the robustness of the constraint associated with this parameter 4 2 deriving a unique set of bimodal kosugi hydraulic parameters from θ ψ data and k s to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed methodology this section shows the relevance of the constraints presented in section 2 2 to derive the bimodal kosugi hydraulic parameters exclusively from θ ψ data the full set of hydraulic parameters also requires k s in order to describe the k θ curve but this value can be independently obtained either by estimating from θ ψ pollacco et al 2017 2013b or measured from infiltration tests fernández gálvez et al 2019 constraining the hydraulic parameters significantly improves the fit of the k θ without using k θ data and at the same time the estimated hydraulic parameters are physically feasible soil hydraulic data sets do not systematically have experimental measurements of both θ ψ and k θ available to fit the full set of hydraulic parameters pollacco et al 2017 the number of experimentally measured data is larger and with less uncertainty for θ ψ than for k θ this is because k θ is technically more challenging to measure and has higher variability for the following scenarios the set of experimental data used in this work did not measure k s therefore the estimated value from scenario g in table 2 was used as the reference value to derive using the constraints presented in section 2 2 the rest of the hydraulic parameters of the bimodal kosugi functions when only θ ψ data and k s are available as shown in section 4 1 computing σ mac and ψ mmac from ψ macmat enables the optimized hydraulic parameters to be more physical and only slightly reduces the goodness of fit therefore in this section we compute σ mac and ψ mmac from ψ macmat the results presented in table 3 are organized similarly to table 2 using different sets of the constraints described in section 2 2 for the optimization of the hydraulic parameters scenario h optimizes four hydraulic parameters with σ mac and ψ mmac set as a function of ψ macmat and optimizing θ r freely within its feasible range in scenario i the number of optimized hydraulic parameters is reduced to three by using the relationship between θ r and σ eq 5 resulting in a small improvement in the goodness of fit for k θ scenario j required optimizing four hydraulic parameters by dynamically constraining σ and ψ m through eq 12 and using an optimized value for θ r resulting in a significant improvement in the goodness of fit finally scenario k optimized three hydraulic parameters similar to scenario j but including the constraint of θ r with σ resulting in further improvement in the fit for k θ as expected the nsle k θ and rmsle k θ are not as good as in table 2 because the fit of the hydraulic parameters does not include k θ data on the other hand using the constraints presented in section 2 2 systematically improved the goodness of fit for the hydraulic parameters while keeping them within their physical range fig 4 compares the optimized σ and ψ m hydraulic parameters estimated from θ ψ and k s data using the constraint scenarios h and k with the values estimated from θ ψ and k θ data using scenario g which was considered as the reference the goodness of fit progressively improves from scenario h to k while the dispersion in the comparison between predicted values to scenario g for σ and ψ m decreases significantly coefficients of determination between predicted values from scenario k and scenario g for σ and ψ m are 0 999 and 0 934 respectively predicted values from scenario k slightly overestimate values obtained from scenario g for σ slope 0 982 and ψ m slope 0 768 5 conclusions we present in this paper a procedure to derive physical and unique soil hydraulic parameters to describe the bimodal kosugi hydraulic functions θ ψ and k θ from inverse modelling the full methodology is only applicable to the kosugi hydraulic model where the representation of the θ ψ and k θ functions is directly related to the pore size distribution in the proposed approach θ s is derived from total porosity θ r is derived from σ ψ macmat is considered constant and σ mac and ψ mmac are derived from ψ macmat we also use a dynamic physical constraint in the relationship between σ and ψ m to reduce non uniqueness the constraint for θ r improves the goodness of fit although the values used in the expression relating θ r with σ rely on the fit of experimental data from a specific new zealand dataset and it would require validation with data collected from other regions we describe how to satisfactorily reduce the number of derived hydraulic parameters from eight to four while ensuring that the derived parameters are physically consistent therefore only σ ψ m θ smacmat and k s are optimized while σ and ψ m are dynamically constrained the methodology is easily implemented in an inverse modelling scheme and the physical constraints also speed up the optimization process the goodness of fit between the measured and simulated values from the estimated hydraulic parameters of θ ψ and k θ shows the relevance of the constraints proposed by progressively constraining the hydraulic parameters we demonstrate the benefit of the optimal combination of constraints without compromising the fit of the θ ψ and k θ functions also the robustness of the methodology is demonstrated by deriving the bimodal kosugi hydraulic parameters exclusively from θ ψ and k s data enabling satisfactory prediction of k θ without having measured k θ data the advantage of deriving optimal hydraulic parameters that are physically sound has a wide range of applications such as the possibility for better predicting the impact of soil management practices on the pore size distribution drewry et al 2019 moreover having a reduced number of hydraulic parameters that are physical reduces uncertainty and allows an improved and faster optimization for characterization of soil hydraulic properties for hydrological and climate modelling the benefits of using the constraints presented in this paper can also be applied when the hydraulic parameters are inverted from time series of soil water content the results for which will be presented in a following paper additional analyses of constraining the kosugi hydraulic parameters will also be performed for k s with methods derived by pollacco et al 2013b and pollacco et al 2017 another benefit of the proposed methodology is that we expect to derive a unique set of hydraulic parameters when the parameters are derived from particle size distribution or infiltration tests e g pollacco et al 2020 author statement jesús fernández gálvez conceptualization methodology

295,hydraulic parameters define the water retention θ ψ and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k θ functions these functions are usually obtained by fitting experimental data using inverse modelling the drawback of inverting the hydraulic parameters is that they suffer from non uniqueness and the optimal hydraulic parameters may not be physical to reduce the non uniqueness it is necessary to invert the hydraulic parameters simultaneously from observations of θ ψ and k θ and ensure the measurements cover the full range of θ from saturated to oven dry the challenge of using bimodal θ ψ and k θ compared to unimodal functions is that it requires double the number of parameters one set for the matrix and another set for the macropore domain the objective of this paper is to address this shortcoming by deriving a procedure to reduce the number of parameters to be optimized to obtain a unique physical set of bimodal soil kosugi hydraulic parameters from inverse modelling to achieve this we 1 derive residual volumetric soil water content from the kosugi standard deviation parameter of the soil matrix 2 derive macropore hydraulic parameters from the water pressure head threshold between macropore and matrix flow and 3 dynamically constrain the kosugi hydraulic parameters of the soil matrix the procedure successfully reduces the number of optimized hydraulic parameters and dynamically constrains the hydraulic parameters without compromising the fit of the θ ψ and k θ functions and the derived hydraulic parameters are more physical the robustness of the methodology is demonstrated by deriving the hydraulic parameters exclusively from θ ψ and k s data enabling satisfactory prediction of k θ even when no additional k θ data are available keywords kosugi hydraulic model dual porosity hydraulic parameters inverse modelling non uniqueness 1 introduction running hydrological models that solve the richards equation requires knowledge of physical soil hydraulic parameters the soil hydraulic parameters define the water retention θ ψ and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k θ functions e g brooks and corey 1964 van genuchten 1980 kosugi 1994 the hydraulic parameters are usually obtained by fitting measured values of the θ ψ and k ψ to the corresponding θ ψ and k θ functions however a serious drawback of deriving the hydraulic parameters by inverse modelling is that they suffer from equifinality or non uniqueness ines and droogers 2002 ines and mohanty 2008 pollacco et al 2008b sonkar et al 2019 beven 1993 defines equifinality as when more than one set of parameters give acceptable simulations relative to a given measure of goodness of fit between simulated and measured values pollacco et al 2008b found that to reduce the range equifinality and obtain a unique set of hydraulic parameters it is necessary to invert the hydraulic parameters simultaneously from observations of both θ ψ and k θ and that the measurements must cover the full range of θ from fully saturated to oven dry however it is rarely the case that we have such rich data sets it has been shown that non uniqueness or equifinality problems cause a number of challenges in hydrological modelling pollacco et al 2008a 2008b pollacco and angulo jaramillo 2009 as follows linked parameters of inverted hydraulic parameters pollacco et al 2008b are sets of parameters that have a mathematical relationship between them such that these parameters produce similar objective function values close to those obtained with the optimal parameter set linked parameters cause challenges for the inverse modelling algorithm and the identification of parameters to avoid such problems the mathematical formulations should be properly set up with no inter correlated parameters non uniqueness solution results in sets of optimal hydraulic parameters with some of them exhibiting non physical hydraulic values which detaches the physical relationship between θ ψ and k θ pollacco et al 2013b 2017 this is an important limitation for physically based models that can preclude convergence when solving the richards equation optimal non physical hydraulic parameters cannot be physically interpreted and therefore cannot be used to model hydrological processes for example to derive the impact of tillage practices on the value of the hydraulic parameters describing the pore size distribution drewry et al 2019 in order to address these three potential issues that may arise when the hydraulic parameters are inverted without access to the full range of θ ψ and k θ it is important to derive methods to reduce the probability of obtaining non physical soil hydraulic properties by preventing non physical combinations of hydraulic parameter sets typically most studies perform the fit of observations to unimodal hydraulic functions while bimodal structured soils are more the rule than the exception jarvis 2007 mcleod et al 2008 these soils have both macropores and micropores with two stage drainage e g carrick et al 2010 fast flow macropore flow can occur when the water pressure head exceeds the threshold needed to activate the macropore network adding to the matrix flow below this threshold only the matrix participates in the flow the combination of these two stages is known as bimodal hydraulic behaviour or dual permeability and was the subject of previous characterizations lassabatere et al 2019 2014 by nature these soils have a bimodal pore size distribution and although soil structure is one of the main reasons for this bimodal behaviour could also happen for purely textural reasons e g durner 1994 therefore soils with bimodal pore systems cannot be adequately described by unimodal hydraulic functions in addition to the need to account for dual permeability behaviour a proper choice of θ ψ and k θ should be made to adequately describe each pore size domain macro versus micro matrix the θ ψ and k θ are often expressed as closed form unimodal functions e g brooks and corey 1964 clapp and hornberger 1978 van genuchten 1980 this paper adopts the kosugi 1994 θ ψ and k θ functions because this model presents a physical basis for the description of pore size log normal distribution and their related parameters are physically sound soils have a large variation in pore radius which according to kosugi 1996 follows a log normal probability density function pollacco et al 2017 and romano and nasta 2016 found improvement by using bimodal log normal expressions dual porosity models compared to using unimodal θ ψ and k θ especially for top soils which are biologically more active pollacco et al 2013b showed that the hydraulic parameters of the kosugi model can be constrained by deriving an empirical relationship between them nevertheless the drawback of the pollacco et al 2013b method is that a the derived methodology is purely empirical and may not work universally and b the method was developed for soils with unimodal pore distribution and should be adapted to multi modal soils the challenge of using bimodal or dual permeability functions is that they require double the number of parameters with as many as eight hydraulic parameters to be optimized pollacco et al 2017 which can exacerbate the problems of non uniqueness to enable the use of bimodal hydraulic functions we present new methods to reduce the number of hydraulic parameters by using principles of soil physics such that the optimal set of the optimal hydraulic parameters is within physical limits we reduce the non uniqueness of optimised kosugi hydraulic parameters by deriving the relationship between the parameters from principles of soil physics which we apply to the bimodal θ ψ and k θ functions this paper is organised as follows section 2 presents the bimodal soil kosugi hydraulic functions and outlines the physical set of constraints proposed for the hydraulic parameters to reduce non uniqueness section 3 presents the experimental data and the numerical algorithm used to derive the soil hydraulic parameters section 4 evaluates the performance of the different constraints when deriving θ ψ and k θ under a range of scenarios and shows that the proposed method can also be used to infer k θ when only θ ψ and k s data are available and section 5 summarises the main conclusions 2 theory 2 1 bimodal kosugi hydraulic functions in this study for convenience the water pressure head values are taken to be positive i e ψ 0 for unsaturated soils defining ψ macmat l as the water pressure head threshold between macropore and matrix then fast flow macropore flow can occur when ψ ψ macmat ψ is small enough to activate the macropores and matrix flow soil water moves in the micropores is when ψ ψ macmat the bimodal kosugi log normal probability density function is described by pollacco et al 2017 as 1 θ ψ ψ θ mat ψ ψ θ mac ψ ψ θ mat ψ ψ θ smacmat θ r σ ψ 2 π e ln ψ ln ψ m 2 2 σ 2 θ mac ψ ψ θ s θ smacmat σ mac ψ 2 π e ln ψ ln ψ mmac 2 2 σ mac θ r θ smat θ s where θ l3 l 3 represents the volumetric soil water content splitted between the volumetric soil water content in the soil matrix domain θ mat l3 l 3 and the volumetric soil water content in the soil macropore domain θ mac l3 l 3 and ψ l the water pressure head with ψ 0 for unsaturated soils θ s l3 l 3 and θ r l3 l 3 are the saturated and residual volumetric soil water content respectively ln ψ m l indicating the argument of ln in units of length i e ψ m in l and σ denote the mean and standard deviation of ln ψ l respectively in the soil matrix domain ln ψ mmac l and σ mac denote the mean and standard deviation of ln ψ respectively in the soil macropore domain and θ smacmat l3 l 3 is the saturated volumetric soil water content that differentiates inter aggregate pores structural macropores and matrix domains intra aggregate micropores integrating eq 1 from 0 to ψ yields the kosugi bimodal θ ψ 2 θ ψ θ mat ψ θ mac ψ θ mat ψ 1 2 θ s macmat θ r erfc ln ψ ln ψ m σ 2 θ r θ mac ψ 1 2 θ s θ s macmat erfc ln ψ ln ψ m mac σ mac 2 where erfc is the complementary error function the bimodal unsaturated hydraulic conductivity expressed as a function of the effective saturation k s e can be written according to pollacco et al 2017 as 3 s e θ θ r θ s θ r k s e k mat s e k mac s e k mat s e k s θ s macmat θ r θ s θ r s e 1 2 erfc erf c 1 2 s e σ 2 2 k mac s e k s θ s θ s macmat θ s θ r s e 1 2 erfc erf c 1 2 s e σ mac 2 2 where k s l t 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and s e denotes the effective saturation such that 0 s e 1 note that the model can be considered as unimodal if the following condition is met 4 θ s θ smacmat 0 01 2 2 constraining the kosugi hydraulic parameters fitting measured θ ψ and k ψ data on eqs 3 and 4 requires optimizing eight soil hydraulic parameters θ s θ r σ ψ m k s θ smacmat σ mac and ψ mmac the simultaneous estimation of all these parameters may cause problems of non uniqueness non unique hydraulic parameters were also obtained even when inverting only five hydraulic parameters using close form unimodal hydraulic functions pollacco et al 2013a 2008b pollacco and mohanty 2012 therefore there is a need to reduce the number of parameters while providing hydraulic parameters that are physically sound 2 2 1 deriving θ r from σ the residual volumetric soil water content θ r is a parameter without strict physical meaning which is usually considered as the minimum amount of water left in the soil when the water pressure head is infinite du 2020 θ r is often set to zero as it has been thought that this merely affects the goodness of fit for θ ψ and k θ clapp and hornberger 1978 pollacco et al 2013a 2008b pollacco and mohanty 2012 nevertheless fixing θ r at a constant value close to zero results in significant errors in the estimation of θ ψ especially for soils with significant clay fraction e g lee and ro 2014 mohammadi and meskini vishkaee 2013 pollacco et al 2020 found that θ r is related to the clay fraction and therefore could be correlated to σ large σ is associated with soils having high clay content therefore a higher ψ is needed for water to be extracted from the smallest pores resulting in higher θ r and vice versa for smaller σ the following empirical expression is based on pollacco et al 2020 which relates θ r to σ is proposed 5 σ σ σ min σ max σ min θ r θ rmax 1 e α 1 σ 1 e α 1 where θ rmax is set to 0 20 which was found by fitting θ ψ and k θ with laboratory data e g fernández gálvez et al 2019 pollacco et al 2020 2017 2013b the maximum value for θ r that was found to be satisfactory α1 15 and α2 4 are two optimized empirical parameters σ is the normalized σ and σ min and σ ma x values are obtained from table 1 the relationship between θ r and σ described in eq 5 is represented in fig 1 for σ values below 4 and the set of empirical parameters as indicated above the shape of the curve shows the increase of θ r with increasing σ while the empirical parameters are responsible for the steepness of the slope before reaching θ rmax using the relationship between θ r and σ described in eq 5 and shown in fig 1 not only reduces the number of optimized parameters but also reduces the non uniqueness of σ by enforcing its physical meaning pollacco et al 2020 2 2 2 deriving ψ mmac and σ mac from ψ macmat structured soils have both matrix inter aggregate pore spaces and macropore intra aggregate pore spaces where ψ macmat is the water pressure head boundary between macropore and matrix thus when the pores are saturated ψ ψ macmat the flow is considered macropore flow and when the soil is desaturated ψ ψ macmat the flow is considered matrix flow carrick et al 2010 found that ψ macmat ranges from 50 to 150 mm with an average of 100 mm also in agreement with other authors e g jarvis 2007 we assume that ψ macmat is a constant parameter and so it is fixed at 100 mm this threshold is also in line with previous studies and values suggested for the tension to be applied for the deactivation of the macropore network e g lassabatere et al 2019 2014 luxmoore 1981 timlin et al 1994 to reduce the number of optimized parameters and due to the narrow range of water pressure head in the macropore domain it is assumed following pollacco et al 2017 eq 15 that 6 ψ mmac e ln ψ macmat 2 ψ macmat moreover we assume that θ mac ψ macmat 0 in eq 2 and since θ ψ is a log normal distribution we derive the following relationship computed with a typical value of p σ 3 establishing ln ψ macmat at a water pressure head higher than ln ψ mmac which is three times the standard deviation of the logarithmic macropore size distribution 7 ln ψ macmat ln ψ mmac σ mac p σ ln ψ macmat 2 σ mac p σ which results in 8 σ mac ln ψ macmat 2 p σ thus by using eqs 6 and 8 with a fixed value of ψ macmat it is possible to compute the kosugi hydraulic parameters of the soil macropore domain without having to include them in the optimization scheme which further reduces the number of parameters to optimize the only macropore hydraulic parameter required is θ smacmat 2 2 3 reducing non uniqueness of the inverted σ and ψm pollacco et al 2013b showed that it is possible to reduce the non uniqueness of the unimodal kosugi hydraulic parameters by constraining the relationship between ψ m and σ taking advantage of the positive linear correlation between ln ψ m and σ such correlation exists because the large median pore size small ψ m which is characteristic of coarsely textured soils is linked to a smaller dispersion in pore size small σ this relationship can be explained by the fact that when ψ m is small the soil tends to have single grain texture monodisperse and so σ tends to be small on the other hand when ψ m increases corresponding to a smaller median pore size which is characteristic of finer material the soil becomes aggregated where the soil is made up of a range of grain sizes polydisperse and so σ tends to be larger pollacco et al 2013b found an empirical relation between these two parameters for a set of soils from the unsoda leij et al 1999 and hypres wösten et al 1999 databases and used it to reduce the non uniqueness of the inverted kosugi hydraulic parameters this relationship was also used by fernández gálvez et al 2019 to reduce the non uniqueness of the hydraulic parameters derived from infiltration tests 9 σ p σ 1 ln ψ m 1 p σ 2 where p σ1 and p σ2 are two fitting parameters 0 1 nevertheless the relationship shown in eq 9 is purely empirical and only applicable to the unimodal kosugi hydraulic functions therefore a physical relationship between ψ m and σ for the bimodal kosugi hydraulic functions is proposed in which the feasible range of ψ m is derived from σ similarly to eq 7 the following expression is set for the matrix pore space domain with p σ 3 10 ln ψ mmac ln ψ m σ p σ ln ψ macmat where isolating ψ m gives 11 e ln ψ mmac σ p σ ψ m e ln ψ macmat σ p σ and using eq 6 gives 12 ψ macmat e σ p σ ψ m ψ macmat e σ p σ for illustration purposes fig 2 shows the relationship between σ and ln ψ m using the dynamic physical range to reduce non uniqueness of the hydraulic parameters eq 12 for the set of studied soils described in section 3 1 and using the additional constraints corresponding to scenario g in table 2 fig 3 illustrates an example of the normalized constrained bimodal hydraulic functions se ψ and k se ψ for three different values of σ 0 75 2 38 and 4 00 and its corresponding feasible range of ψ m derived from eq 12 with s e θ smac 0 85 the feasible range of ψ m determines the shape of the curves with values between the solid and dotted lines corresponding to each of the σ considered the plot of the k se ψ curve for σ 4 and ψ m 15 shows a small artefact next to ln 1 ψ 1 due to the transformation ln 1 ψ in the x axis the dynamic physical feasible range of the optimized bimodal kosugi hydraulic parameters is indicated in table 1 as indicated in section 2 2 2 ψ macmat is considered constant with a value of 100 mm the proposed parsimonious bimodal kosugi θ ψ and k θ model requires only four parameters ψ m σ k s and θ smacmat to be optimized with ψ macmat set as a constant ψ mmac and σ mac derived from ψ macmat using eqs 6 and 8 respectively θ r derived from σ through eq 5 and θ s derived from total porosity moreover the non uniqueness between ψ m and σ is also reduced by eq 12 using the assumption that θ ψ and k θ are log normal distributed therefore the number of hydraulic parameters to be optimized is reduced from eight to four using the principles of soil physics 3 material and methods 3 1 experimental data used to validate the parsimonious bimodal θ ψ and k θ the model is validated with data collected across the canterbury region of new zealand pollacco et al 2020 the dataset has a sample size of n 259 collected from soil profiles at 46 different sites sampled sites include irrigated and non irrigated pastoral farming land rainfall across the sites varies from 550 to 800 mm per year soil parent material is sediments derived from quartzo feldspathic hard sandstone deposited as either river alluvium or windblown loess schmidt et al 2005 all soils in this study have at least 60 cm depth of fine earth soil material with most sites classifying to the pallic soil order in the new zealand soil classification hewitt 2010 correlating in the soil taxonomy to haplusteps and humustepts great groups fourteen sites have younger soils that classify to the recent soil order hewitt 2010 correlating to haplusteps and ustifluvent great groups soil was sampled using undisturbed soil cores of 59 cm3 5 cm diameter by 3 cm depth used for θ ψ measurements and undisturbed soil cores of 589 cm3 10 cm diameter by 7 5 cm depth used for k θ measurements to ensure consistent θ conditions at all sites water was infiltrated two days prior to sampling θ ψ values

hanging water column while measurements above 1000 mm water pressure head were made using pressure chambers gradwell and birrell 1979 to measure k ψ the core samples were trimmed saturated and equilibrated to 10 40 70 and 100 mm water pressure head with a buchner funnel apparatus before unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was measured using disc permeameters set to the equivalent water pressure heads for each measurement additional detail about the experimental sites soil sampling and soil physical measurements is given in pollacco et al 2020 3 2 objective function and goodness of

github com robertfeldt blackboxoptim jl written in the julia language this procedure used an objective function and goodness of fit defined below the minimization process between the observed and the fitted values used a weighted objective function wof which includes information from both θ ψ and k θ data the wof is computed as follows 13 wof w i 1 l θ ψ obs i θ ψ si m i 2 i 1 l θ ψ obs i θ ψ obs

this case l 9 and k 4 θ ψ obs i and k θ obs i correspond to the observed data derived from the laboratory and θ ψ si m i and k θ si m i correspond to simulated values of the kosugi model the weighting parameter w rules the relative weight assigned to the fit of the θ ψ and k θ with w set to 0 5 providing the best compromise between the fit of θ ψ and k θ simultaneously the goodness of fit of the measured volumetric water retention data to the simulated θ ψ using the bimodal kosugi model was assessed using the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse θ ψ and the root mean squared error rmse θ

bimodal soil kosugi hydraulic parameters different scenarios tables 2 and 3 presented in the results section to derive the bimodal soil kosugi hydraulic parameters from inverse modelling are considered using the set of constraints described in section 2 2 the scenarios are compared to the reference scenario scenario a where all hydraulic parameters are optimized except for θ s which is derived from total porosity scenario b derives θ r from σ removing one degree of freedom in the optimization scheme scenarios c and d use a fixed value for σ mac or ψ mmac removing two degrees of freedom scenario e fixes simultaneously σ mac and ψ mmac removing three degrees of freedom finally scenarios f and g additionally include dynamically constraining σ and ψ m where θ r is freely optimised or θ r is derived from σ respectively the relevance of the constraints presented in section 2 2 to derive the bimodal kosugi hydraulic parameters is demonstrated by optimizing the parameters exclusively from θ ψ data in order to compare to the corresponding k θ curve a known value of k s is provided from scenario g like in the previous approach degrees of freedom are progressively removed by fixing σ mac and ψ mmac scenario h additionally deriving θ r from σ scenario i and dynamically constraining σ and ψ m with θ r freely optimised and θ r derived from σ scenarios j and k respectively 4 results 4 1 parsimonious kosugi bimodal θ ψ and k θ model this section shows the goodness of fit for θ ψ and k θ for different scenarios where the hydraulic parameters are progressively constrained the sensitivity for each of the constraints is evidenced by the corresponding decrease in the goodness of fit the soil hydraulic parameters θ r σ ψ m k s θ smacmat σ mac and ψ mmac are optimized using the bimodal θ ψ and k θ model described in section 2 1 this is performed by matching the simulated θ ψ and k θ values with the experimentally measured data described in section 3 1 θ s was not optimized but directly derived from total porosity using measured values of the dry bulk density and particle density θ s equals 96 5 of total porosity table 2 summarises the nse coefficients and rmse of the fit between observed and simulated θ ψ and k θ using the different constraints for the hydraulic parameters as described in section 2 2 simulated values for θ ψ and k θ are obtained with the optimized hydraulic parameters in each case scenario a to g in table 2 nse values close to 1 as well as rmse values close to 0 indicate perfect agreement between observed and simulated θ ψ and k θ table 2 shows that the fit of the bimodal kosugi hydraulic functions when optimizing the seven hydraulic parameters scenario a for the entire data set used in pollacco et al 2020 is excellent with a combined nse very close to unity n s e 0 987 and a combined rmse very close to zero r m s e 0 0040 it is expected that reducing the number of optimized hydraulic parameters and constraining them would reduce the goodness of fit first the number of optimized parameters was reduced to six scenario b deriving θ r from σ using eq 5 as presented in section 2 2 1 with a marginal decrease in the goodness of fit compared to the scenario a δ n s e 0 007 and δ r m s e 0 0016 in the next step scenario c only five parameters were optimized by also setting σ mac as a function of ψ macmat through eq 8 with fixed values for ψ macmat and p σ as described in section 2 2 2 the goodness of fit is slightly reduced compared to scenario a δ n s e 0 015 and δ r m s e 0 0018 next scenario d ψ mmac was set as a function of ψ macmat through eq 6 with a fixed value for ψ macmat while σ mac is optimized this required optimizing five parameters leading to a small further decrease in the goodness of fit compared to scenario a δ n s e 0 023 and δ r m s e 0 0020 as expected σ mac is more sensitive than ψ mmac to the fit the combination of the previous two scenarios reduces the number of optimized parameters to four when apart from relating θ r to σ simultaneously setting both σ mac and ψ mmac as a function of ψ macmat scenario e the reduction in the goodness of fit compared to scenario a is still negligible δ n s e 0 027 and δ r m s e 0 0023 to further constrain optimization of the hydraulic parameters the range of feasible values for σ and ψ m is dynamically constrained using eq 12 as described in section 2 2 3 so that the combination of both parameters is physically possible scenario f with five optimized parameters presents the results corresponding to the scenario where σ and ψ m are dynamically constrained with σ mac and ψ mmac set a function of ψ macmat and optimizing θ r freely within its feasible range as indicated in table 1 once again the reduction of the goodness of fit compared to scenario a remains negligible δ n s e 0 063 and δ r m s e 0 0033 finally scenario g also includes deriving θ r from σ reducing to four the number of optimized parameters with satisfactory goodness of fit compared to scenario a δ n s e 0 079 and δ r m s e 0 0036 therefore scenario g allows a reduction of the number of optimized parameters for the bimodal kosugi hydraulic model from seven to four without compromising the goodness of fit and while maintaining the hydraulic parameters within their physical limits although it is well known that the impact of θ r in the goodness of fit is significant this result also highlights the robustness of the constraint associated with this parameter 4 2 deriving a unique set of bimodal kosugi hydraulic parameters from θ ψ data and k s to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed methodology this section shows the relevance of the constraints presented in section 2 2 to derive the bimodal kosugi hydraulic parameters exclusively from θ ψ data the full set of hydraulic parameters also requires k s in order to describe the k θ curve but this value can be independently obtained either by estimating from θ ψ pollacco et al 2017 2013b or measured from infiltration tests fernández gálvez et al 2019 constraining the hydraulic parameters significantly improves the fit of the k θ without using k θ data and at the same time the estimated hydraulic parameters are physically feasible soil hydraulic data sets do not systematically have experimental measurements of both θ ψ and k θ available to fit the full set of hydraulic parameters pollacco et al 2017 the number of experimentally measured data is larger and with less uncertainty for θ ψ than for k θ this is because k θ is technically more challenging to measure and has higher variability for the following scenarios the set of experimental data used in this work did not measure k s therefore the estimated value from scenario g in table 2 was used as the reference value to derive using the constraints presented in section 2 2 the rest of the hydraulic parameters of the bimodal kosugi functions when only θ ψ data and k s are available as shown in section 4 1 computing σ mac and ψ mmac from ψ macmat enables the optimized hydraulic parameters to be more physical and only slightly reduces the goodness of fit therefore in this section we compute σ mac and ψ mmac from ψ macmat the results presented in table 3 are organized similarly to table 2 using different sets of the constraints described in section 2 2 for the optimization of the hydraulic parameters scenario h optimizes four hydraulic parameters with σ mac and ψ mmac set as a function of ψ macmat and optimizing θ r freely within its feasible range in scenario i the number of optimized hydraulic parameters is reduced to three by using the relationship between θ r and σ eq 5 resulting in a small improvement in the goodness of fit for k θ scenario j required optimizing four hydraulic parameters by dynamically constraining σ and ψ m through eq 12 and using an optimized value for θ r resulting in a significant improvement in the goodness of fit finally scenario k optimized three hydraulic parameters similar to scenario j but including the constraint of θ r with σ resulting in further improvement in the fit for k θ as expected the nsle k θ and rmsle k θ are not as good as in table 2 because the fit of the hydraulic parameters does not include k θ data on the other hand using the constraints presented in section 2 2 systematically improved the goodness of fit for the hydraulic parameters while keeping them within their physical range fig 4 compares the optimized σ and ψ m hydraulic parameters estimated from θ ψ and k s data using the constraint scenarios h and k with the values estimated from θ ψ and k θ data using scenario g which was considered as the reference the goodness of fit progressively improves from scenario h to k while the dispersion in the comparison between predicted values to scenario g for σ and ψ m decreases significantly coefficients of determination between predicted values from scenario k and scenario g for σ and ψ m are 0 999 and 0 934 respectively predicted values from scenario k slightly overestimate values obtained from scenario g for σ slope 0 982 and ψ m slope 0 768 5 conclusions we present in this paper a procedure to derive physical and unique soil hydraulic parameters to describe the bimodal kosugi hydraulic functions θ ψ and k θ from inverse modelling the full methodology is only applicable to the kosugi hydraulic model where the representation of the θ ψ and k θ functions is directly related to the pore size distribution in the proposed approach θ s is derived from total porosity θ r is derived from σ ψ macmat is considered constant and σ mac and ψ mmac are derived from ψ macmat we also use a dynamic physical constraint in the relationship between σ and ψ m to reduce non uniqueness the constraint for θ r improves the goodness of fit although the values used in the expression relating θ r with σ rely on the fit of experimental data from a specific new zealand dataset and it would require validation with data collected from other regions we describe how to satisfactorily reduce the number of derived hydraulic parameters from eight to four while ensuring that the derived parameters are physically consistent therefore only σ ψ m θ smacmat and k s are optimized while σ and ψ m are dynamically constrained the methodology is easily implemented in an inverse modelling scheme and the physical constraints also speed up the optimization process the goodness of fit between the measured and simulated values from the estimated hydraulic parameters of θ ψ and k θ shows the relevance of the constraints proposed by progressively constraining the hydraulic parameters we demonstrate the benefit of the optimal combination of constraints without compromising the fit of the θ ψ and k θ functions also the robustness of the methodology is demonstrated by deriving the bimodal kosugi hydraulic parameters exclusively from θ ψ and k s data enabling satisfactory prediction of k θ without having measured k θ data the advantage of deriving optimal hydraulic parameters that are physically sound has a wide range of applications such as the possibility for better predicting the impact of soil management practices on the pore size distribution drewry et al 2019 moreover having a reduced number of hydraulic parameters that are physical reduces uncertainty and allows an improved and faster optimization for characterization of soil hydraulic properties for hydrological and climate modelling the benefits of using the constraints presented in this paper can also be applied when the hydraulic parameters are inverted from time series of soil water content the results for which will be presented in a following paper additional analyses of constraining the kosugi hydraulic parameters will also be performed for k s with methods derived by pollacco et al 2013b and pollacco et al 2017 another benefit of the proposed methodology is that we expect to derive a unique set of hydraulic parameters when the parameters are derived from particle size distribution or infiltration tests e g pollacco et al 2020 author statement jesús fernández gálvez conceptualization methodology

296,land cover change plays a critical role in influencing hydrological responses change in land cover has impacted runoff across basins with substantial human interference however the impacts in basins with minimal human interference have been studied less in this study we investigated the impacts of directional land cover changes forest to from combined grassland and shrubland in runoff coefficient rc ratio of runoff to precipitation and runoff volume across 603 low human interference reference basins in the conterminous united states conus the results indicate basins with significant p 0 05 increasing trends in runoff and rc were across the northeast and northwest regions of conus and basins with decreasing trends were in the southern conus region a unit percent increase in basin area from grassland and shrubland to forest was associated with a 4 decrease in rc across basins with decreasing rc trends similarly a unit percent increase in basin area from forest to a combined grassland and shrubland was associated with a 1 increase in rc across increasing rc trend basins runoff volume was decreased increased by 25 106 m3 yr 1 9 106 m3 yr 1 across basins with decreasing increasing trends in runoff and rc when relating runoff volume with the area of directional land cover changes each 1 km2 increase in area from grassland and shrubland to forest resulted in a decrease of 530 000 m3 runoff volume across basins with decreasing trends in contrast each 1 km2 increase in area from forest to grassland and shrubland increased runoff volume by 200 000 m3 across increasing trend basins basins in the southern region of conus were more impacted by runoff parameters rc and runoff volume from directional land cover changes than basins in the northern region the findings of this study are useful for planning and managing water availability for sustainable and adaptive water resources management at regional scales keywords forest grassland land cover change reference basins runoff runoff coefficient 1 introduction land cover is one of several factors that play a major role in hydrology by partitioning precipitation into evapotranspiration and runoff forest returns more than half of annual precipitation to the atmosphere as evapotranspiration whereas grassland returns less water to the atmosphere and converts the majority of annual precipitation to infiltration and runoff harsch et al 2009 changes in land cover affect the ratio of precipitation conversion to evapotranspiration and runoff thus altering the hydrological responses at basin scales poff et al 2006 schilling et al 2008 zhou et al 2015 water is lost through evapotranspiration and only the water from runoff and groundwater is available and manageable to fulfill sectoral water demands with expected changes in future precipitation patterns donat et al 2016 wuebbles et al 2014 and land cover hurtt et al 2011 sohl et al 2014 it is crucial to understand the linkage between the changes in land cover and runoff across basins in order to sustain water resources changes in basin runoff associated with land cover change are primarily driven by human interferences human activities such as the conversion of forests to grasslands and croplands decrease evapotranspiration and interception by changing vegetation structure and surface roughness savary et al 2009 thereby contributing to increasing basin runoff mao and cherkauer 2009 scanlon et al 2007 conversely afforestation increases evapotranspiration and reduces basin runoff buendia et al 2016 the extent of runoff reduction varies depending upon tree species age canopy characteristics and rooting depths roberts et al 2001 sun et al 2008 several studies have reported the changes in basin runoff due to human interference in land cover for example mao and cherkauer 2009 applied a hydrological model in the great lakes region of the united states us and reported a 20 30 decrease in total runoff by conversion from prairie grasslands to row agricultural croplands and 10 30 increase in total runoff when deciduous forest converted to wooded grasslands and croplands in the comet river catchment area in central queensland australia runoff increased by about 78 due to the degradation of natural forest to grasslands and croplands siriwardena et al 2006 another modeling study in the upper mississippi river basin a remarkable agricultural intensification basin in the us reported a decrease increase in the annual runoff by up to 9 5 where grasslands forests were converted to croplands and highlighted climate as an important factor for runoff changes frans et al 2013 several previous studies have evaluated climate impacts in basin runoff jiang et al 2015 ryberg et al 2014 tomer and schilling 2009 velpuri and senay 2013 and reported both increases and decreases in basin runoff with varying ranges from 10 chang et al 2015 huang et al 2016 to 90 wu et al 2017 depending on hydroclimate and the extent of changes in climatic variables for long term analysis of basin runoff basin characteristics such as elevation slope soil properties and other static properties remain unchanged unless human interferences and their impact in basin runoff would be consistent over time however land cover changes are dynamic and studies have shown substantial impacts in basin runoff when there are large changes in land cover from human activities during a long period of time tomer and schilling 2009 schilling et al 2008 changes in land cover from human activities can be largely regulated by the development of plans and policies and application of best management practices jia et al 2013 loperfido et al 2014 mishra et al 2007 joshi et al 2019 the effectiveness of such land cover changes for managing basin runoff depends on the subsequent strategies and management practices adopted mcbroom et al 2008 liu et al 2017 several studies have evaluated the impacts of human activities and best management practices in runoff however very few have investigated the land cover changes under natural conditions without or with minimal human interference and associated long term impacts in basin runoff efforts to identify basins with minimal human interference in the us include hydroclimatic data network hcdn watersheds in the early 1990s by slack and landwehr 1992 falcone 2011 classified reference minimal human interference and non reference basins under the geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow version ii gages ii project global scale projects such as the international model parameter estimation experiment have identified several basins throughout the world assumed unaffected by human interference duan et al 2006 wang and hejazi 2011 studies have evaluated the determinants of runoff across minimal human impacted basins for example chang et al 2014 reported the average annual days of measurable precipitation as the most significant determining factor of annual runoff ratio runoff divided by precipitation for both gages ii reference and non reference basins across the conterminous us conus petersen et al 2012 found basin aridity and seasonality index in precipitation as an influencing factor for runoff seasonality across hcdn basins in the western us and moisture and energy cycles in the midwest and peninsular florida basins while studies have identified predictors for variations in runoff across less human impacted basins the linkage between long term changes in runoff with land cover across those basins is still not investigated developing the relationships between runoff and land cover change specifically directional changes such as forests to or from other land covers can help to better understand the runoff generation from such basins and the relationships can be applied as the guideline for planning and managing water availability for a sustainable and adaptive water resources management with the main goal of investigating the relationships between the long term basin runoff characteristics and directional land cover changes across minimal human impacted basins in conus this study addresses three specific questions i are there any long term trends in runoff rates a ratio of runoff to precipitation or runoff coefficient and linkage with directional land cover changes ii what are the impacts of directional land cover changes on the magnitude and direction of runoff coefficient and runoff volume iii how are the relationships between runoff parameters runoff coefficient and runoff volume and directional land cover changes spatially varied across the conus basins with minimal human interference are expected to cover most of their land area with natural vegetation such as forests grasslands and shrublands and the directional changes among these land covers are assumed to impact runoff parameters long term increase or decrease in runoff coefficients and runoff volume are expected to be associated with directional land cover changes of natural vegetation across reference basins we hypothesize that basins with increasing trends in runoff coefficients and runoff volume are associated with land cover change from forest to a combined grassland and shrubland similarly basins with decreasing trends in runoff coefficients and runoff volume are associated with grassland and shrubland conversions to forests gages ii reference basins were considered in the study as these basins have continuous data for recent decades falcone 2011 and national land cover database nlcd maps https www mrlc gov last accessed 15 april 2020 were applied for directional land cover changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study includes gages ii reference basins in conus conterminous united states the gages ii reference basins are considered to have near natural flow conditions with minimal human disturbances such as from modifications by channels or dams road networks impervious surfaces and fragmented or developed land cover falcone 2011 these basins have more than 20 years of flow record between 1950 and 2009 and some of them have a complete record from 1900 to the present further details on gages ii reference basins are available in falcone 2011 out of 2057 reference basins identified by gages ii 603 basins were selected which had a continuous flow record between 1985 and 2017 fig 1 these selected basins are distributed across conus with sizes ranging from approximately 5 km2 to 26 000 km2 and an average of 830 km2 the total area coverage of 603 reference basins is over 500 000 km2 mean 1985 2017 water year october 1 to september 30 hereafter referred to as annual precipitation across these basins was between 264 mm yr 1 and 3931 mm yr 1 with an average of 1175 mm yr 1 2 2 data description 2 2 1 precipitation runoff and runoff coefficient evaluation of runoff response associated with directional land cover changes across 603 gages ii reference basins was based on changes in runoff coefficient rc and runoff volume the analysis was conducted at the annual water year october september scale monthly precipitation data were obtained from parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism daly et al 1994 prism data are considered among the highest quality spatial climate data in the us di luzio et al 2008 and have been applied in previous basin runoff studies petersen et al 2012 velpuri and senay 2013 the monthly prism data used in this study are 4 km 4 km spatial resolution and freely available at the oregon state university prism website http www prism oregonstate edu recent last accessed 16 april 2020 annual precipitation was generated by aggregating monthly precipitation maps from october to september a single value of annual precipitation mm yr 1 for each basin was computed as an average of precipitation for the prism grid cells within each basin daily discharge rates are recorded at gages ii basins and these daily data from 1985 to 2017 were downloaded from the us geological survey usgs national water information system nwis website https waterdata usgs gov nwis last accessed 18 april 2020 from daily discharge rates for each basin an annual discharge was computed as an average of daily discharge from october 1 to september 30 annual discharge m3 s 1 was converted to annual flow volume m3 with a given number of days in each year annual runoff mm yr 1 for each basin was then estimated as a ratio of annual flow volume to the basin area a similar approach of estimating runoff from discharge rates across gages ii basins was also applied in chang et al 2014 to account for spatial variations across basins the annual runoff was normalized by annual precipitation to compute annual rc unitless for each basin during the study period 1985 2017 rc represents the fraction of water available as runoff from given precipitation and typically varies between 0 and 1 indicating no runoff and all precipitation conversion to runoff respectively 2 2 2 directional land cover change land cover maps from the national land cover database nlcd 2016 https www mrlc gov last accessed 20 april 2020 were used to generate the directional land cover change maps nlcd is a comprehensive land cover database for the us and has been providing land cover maps at 30 m spatial resolution since 2001 with nlcd 2001 ncld 2006 nlcd 2011 and nlcd 2016 fry et al 2011 homer et al 2020 homer et al 2015 the recently released nlcd 2016 unlike previous versions provides both land cover and land cover change across 7 epochs from 2001 to 2016 with land cover maps for 2001 2003 2006 2008 2011 2013 and 2016 between 2001 and 2016 nearly 50 of the land cover changes of the conus landscape involved forest homer et al 2020 indicating changes across forest areas as the dominant land cover change type to identify the major directional land cover changes across the selected 603 gages ii reference basins the overall land cover change non directional was computed between 2001 and 2016 directional land cover changes also were computed such as forest to grassland grassland to cropland forest to urban forest to suburban grassland to forest shrubland to forest and others we found about 8 an average of 603 basins total land cover change across reference basins and more than two thirds 68 of the total change involve forest from forest deciduous conifer and mixed forests to grassland forest to shrubland grassland to forest and shrubland to forest thus the directional land cover change maps from forest to grassland and forest to shrubland were aggregated computed percentage of directional land cover change for reference basins that potentially increase runoff similarly changes from grassland to forest and shrubland to forest were aggregated that decrease runoff directional land cover changes based on two time periods such as from 2001 to 2016 is not representative of continuous temporal changes which occurred between the 15 year period 2001 2016 thus the directional land cover changes considered in this study forest to grassland and shrubland and grassland and shrubland to forest were computed sequentially 2001 2003 2003 2006 2006 2008 2008 2011 2011 2013 and 2013 2016 as a percentage of the total area of basins between 7 epochs of nlcd 2016 product this cumulative directional land cover change during 2001 to 2016 were then linked with changes in rc and runoff volume across reference basins 2 3 analysis for identifying the reference basins with trends in runoff and rc the mann kendall mk test mann 1945 kendall 1948 was applied the mk test is a nonparametric test used for detecting monotonic trends increasing decreasing and no trend and has been applied in several runoff studies choi et al 2016 velpuri and senay 2013 yaning et al 2009 to associate runoff parameters rc and runoff volume with directional land cover changes only basins with significant p 0 05 trends in precipitation were excluded to remove the impact of precipitation in runoff parameters trends in runoff and rc were based on data for 1985 2017 however directional land cover change data were not available to match the same time period for runoff and rc thus to match the directional land cover data from 2001 to 2016 rc values were estimated applying slope and intercept from the regression line for 2001 and 2016 for each basin the changes in rc values between 2001 and 2016 were then associated with the percentage of directional land cover changes across reference basins for the runoff volume analysis basins with and without trends in both runoff and rc were identified then mean runoff volume of those basins between 2001 and 2016 consistent with directional land cover change data was compared with long term 1985 2017 mean runoff volume the changes in runoff volume were then aggregated to link with directional land cover changes across reference basins 3 results 3 1 precipitation runoff and runoff coefficient during the study period from 1985 to 2017 the mean annual precipitation across the 603 selected gages ii reference basins was between 264 and 3991 mm yr 1 with an average of 1175 mm yr 1 the annual runoff varied from 0 to 3513 mm yr 1 with an average of 557 mm yr 1 and annual runoff coefficient rc from 0 00 to 1 08 one basin had rc greater than 1 0 with an average of 0 39 larger rc values are across the northeast and northwest regions of the us with values of 0 48 and above fig 1 the single basin with an rc value greater than 1 0 is located in the northwest region and had an rc value of 1 08 this rc value could be due to regional groundwater flow these regions northeast and northwest have higher annual precipitation rates usually greater than 1200 mm yr 1 the larger rc values across these regions are likely due to higher precipitation and lower evapotranspiration rates such that more water is available at the land surface after fulfilling evapotranspiration demand and the remaining water is converted to runoff smaller rc values are in the central and southern regions of the us with values of 0 32 and lower fig 1 where potential evapotranspiration pet rates are higher and precipitation rates are lower than 800 mm yr 1 basins with the smallest rc values 0 16 and lower were across the transition regions between the eastern humid and western semi arid of the us where precipitation rates are between 401 and 800 mm yr 1 fig 1 3 2 impacts of land cover change in runoff coefficient 3 2 1 runoff coefficient trend the mk trend analysis indicated that 155 out of the 603 reference basins had precipitation trends table 1 these basins were excluded to remove the impact of precipitation in rc trends so only 448 basins without precipitation trends were evaluated out of 448 basins 79 basins had trends in rc table 1 among the 79 basins with trends in rc 40 basins had increasing trends and 39 basins had decreasing trends basins with increasing trends in rc were across the northeast and northwest regions fig 2 where precipitation rates are higher than other regions fig 1 the mean annual precipitation and rc for the 40 increasing rc trend basins were 1721 mm yr 1 and 0 61 respectively in contrast most of the reference basins with decreasing rc trends were from the southern region fig 2 the mean annual precipitation across the 39 basins with decreasing trends in rc was 960 mm yr 1 about 44 lower than those basins with increasing trends in rc the mean rc was 0 22 for decreasing trend basins substantially smaller than the basins with increasing trends in rc 0 61 for the basins without rc trends mean rc and precipitation rates were larger smaller than those of basins with decreasing increasing trends in rc table 1 trends in rc were observed when the total land cover change was 8 and above on average table 1 the land cover change of increasing rc trend basins 17 was more than the basins with decreasing rc trends 8 for basins without rc trends land cover change was smaller 7 than basins with rc trends table 1 the average area of basins with decreasing trends in rc was larger by 39 and 45 than those of basins with increasing and without trends in rc respectively table 1 3 2 2 response of runoff coefficient to directional land cover change the comparison of interannual variations of rc and directional land cover changes across reference basins shows that the larger directional land cover changes were associated with basins with increasing and decreasing trends in rc fig 3 basins with directional land cover change of more than 5 on average of their total basin area converted from forest to grassland and shrubland or from grassland and shrubland to forest had increasing or decreasing trends in rc respectively table 2 basins with increasing rc trends had 12 6 48 km2 of their basin area converted from forest to grassland and shrubland and 6 0 29 km2 of the area from grassland and shrubland to forest in contrast directional land cover changes were smaller for decreasing rc trend basins with 5 5 40 km2 of their basin area converted from forest to grassland and shrubland and 5 1 38 km2 of the basin area converted from grassland and shrubland to forest for basins without rc trends directional land cover changes were less than 5 table 2 the changes in rc were more than 9 on average across basins with increasing 9 8 and decreasing 18 2 rc trends table 2 for basins without rc trends the change was less than 3 the impact of directional land cover change in rc was larger for basins with decreasing rc trends than for basins with increasing rc trends a unit percent increase in basin area from grassland and shrubland to forest was associated with a 3 6 decrease in rc across basins with decreasing rc trends for basins with increasing trends in rc a unit percent increase in basin area from forest to grassland and shrubland was associated with a 0 8 increase in rc these results show that the basins with decreasing rc trends in the southern regions of the us fig 2 are more influenced by the directional land cover changes than the basins in the northern regions as expected a larger percentage of directional land cover change from forest to grassland and shrubland was associated with increasing trends in rc table 2 however for basins with decreasing rc trends both directional land cover changes forest to from combined grassland and shrubland were similar at 5 table 2 a slightly larger percent 0 4 from forest to grassland and shrubland is observed than that from shrubland and grassland to forest contrary to the expected directional land cover change one of the reasons could be due to relative differences in rc response from a unit percent change in land cover from grassland and shrubland to forest versus from forest to grassland and shrubland for example deforestation will have an immediate impact in runoff whereas afforestation may take several years to see similar impacts in rc it is possible to evaluate the sensitivity of unit percent land cover change impacts in rc however the main objective of this study was to find the overall trends in rc associated with the directional land cover changes the directional land cover changes are occurring on different basins with increasing and decreasing rc trends from different geographical areas which may subject to different climatic drivers that can impact rc for example the smaller difference i e 0 4 between directional land cover changes with a larger 18 2 rc change across decreasing rc trend basins in drier areas indicates that climate factors such as pet and air temperature may influence rc trends to further evaluate the variation in directional land cover changes across decreasing rc trend basins the temporal coverage was limited between 2001 and 2016 for both land cover and rc after limiting the basins with continuous data from 2001 to 2016 and conducting mk trend analysis a clear signal on the impact of directional land cover change in rc trends is observed fig 4 for example the basins with decreasing rc trends fig 4b had a larger percent change from grassland and shrubland to forest than that from forest to grassland and shrubland which was not observed while considering the basins with continuous data from 1985 to 2017 fig 3f the basins with increasing trends in rc fig 4a had similar results to that with the basins with the 1985 2017 continuous data fig 3d these results support our hypothesis that significant trends in rc across gages ii reference basins are associated with substantial directional land cover changes on forest to or from grassland and shrubland the observed agreement as expected between the land cover change from grassland and shrubland to forest across basins with decreasing rc trends during 2001 2016 compared to 1985 2017 indicates that grassland and shrubland to forest conversion might have occurred in the recent decade grassland and shrubland to forest conversion mostly occurred in the southeast region fig 2 the consistent agreement on the forest to grassland and shrubland conversion across basins with increasing rc trend for both 33 year and 15 year analysis shows that this directional land cover change might have been continuously occurring since the 1980s and 1990s for the basins without rc trend the percentage of forest to grassland and shrubland conversion is larger than that from grassland and shrubland to forest table 2 as most of the basins 448 out of 603 considered in this study had no trend in rc similar continued directional land cover changes across these basins can further decrease in rc without significant changes in precipitation trend and directional land cover forest to from combined grassland and shrubland across reference basins runoff is expected to be lower as most of the basins showed decreasing trends in rc 3 2 3 impact of directional land cover change in runoff volume the number of basins with and without trends in both runoff and rc and associated directional land cover and runoff volume changes are shown in table 3 out of 603 basins after excluding basins with trends in precipitation 444 basins had no trend 15 had increasing and 17 had increasing trend in runoff and rc basins with and without trends in runoff and rc table 3 were subsets of basins with and without trend in rc only table 2 fig 2 relatively fewer basins had trends in both runoff and rc compared to the basins with trends in rc runoff depth was available as a lumped average for the basins whereas gridded 4 km 4 km precipitation accounted the spatial distribution of precipitation such that the normalization of runoff by precipitation resulted in a larger number of basins with trends in rc this result indicates that factors contributing to spatiotemporal variations in runoff should be considered while evaluating long term trends in runoff parameters runoff volume analysis shows that runoff volume increased by 9 106 m3 yr 1 2 2 on average during 2001 2016 423 106 m3 yr 1 compared to 1985 2017 414 106 m3 yr 1 across basins with increasing runoff and rc trends table 3 for basins with decreasing runoff and rc trends runoff volume decreased by 25 106 m3 yr 1 17 9 during 2001 2016 115 106 m3 yr 1 compared to the 1985 2017 average 140 106 m3 yr 1 the decreasing runoff volume was more than twice of the increasing runoff volume for basins without trends in runoff and rc runoff volume was also decreased by 8 106 m3 yr 1 2 6 in 2001 2016 298 106 m3 yr 1 compared to during 1985 2017 306 106 m3 yr 1 table 3 while relating to the area of directional land cover changes the largest area conversion forest to from combined grassland and shrubland corresponded to the basins with decreasing trends in runoff and rc table 3 the smallest area conversion from forest to grassland and shrubland was across the basins without trends in runoff and rc similarly the smallest area conversion from grassland and shrubland to forest was across the basins with increasing trends in runoff and rc each 1 km2 increase in area from forest to grassland and shrubland resulted in a 200 000 m3 increase in runoff volume across basins with increasing trends in runoff and rc in contrast each 1 km2 increase in area from grassland and shrubland to forest resulted in a 530 000 m3 decrease in runoff volume across basins with decreasing runoff and rc trends fig 5 the higher rate of runoff volume from 1 km2 of grassland and shrubland conversion to forest is likely attributable to differences in hydroclimate of decreasing and increasing trend basins table 1 in terms of percentage a unit percent increase in basin area from grassland and shrubland to forest reduced runoff volume by 3 6 and a unit percent increase in basin area from forest to grassland and shrubland increased runoff volume by 0 1 the larger amount of decreasing runoff volume 33 106 m3 yr 1 than increasing runoff volume 9 106 m3 yr 1 from our study indicates that there will be a larger reduction in the runoff volume if similar directional land cover changes continue across reference basins in the future 4 discussion the 1985 2017 evaluation of rc trends across 603 gages ii reference basins shows that the majority of basins have no trend in rc table 1 a smaller number of basins had increasing and decreasing trends in rc increasing and decreasing trends in rc were observed across basins with larger and smaller values of mean rc respectively table 1 basins with rc trends were closely linked with directional land cover changes of those basins figs 3 4 for example a unit percent increase in basin area with directional land cover change from grassland and shrubland to forest forest to grassland and shrubland was associated with a 4 1 decrease increase in rc across basins with decreasing increasing rc trends on average fig 5 as expected for basins without rc trends the change in rc associated with directional land cover changes were much lower than the basins with rc trends table 2 distinct regional differences of rc across basins with larger values in the northeast and northwest region and lower values in the central and southern region of the us fig 1 are similar as reported in a previous study chang et al 2014 the higher lower rc values at regions with higher lower precipitation rates indicate that precipitation is one of the major drivers for regional rc variations table 1 fig 2 however regional variations in runoff and rc depend on several factors for example seasonal runoff in the eastern us depends on monthly moisture and energy cycles whereas basin aridity and precipitation regimes are the dominant factors for determining runoff generation in the western us petersen et al 2012 also basin characteristics can have an impact in runoff parameters chang et al 2014 reported that mean basin slope and compactness are the main predictors of annual rc across gages ii reference and non reference basins respectively although we considered precipitation as the primary determining climatic factor that could impact runoff and rc we also examined the potential impact of another climatic factor pet grass reference et in runoff and rc trends mk trend analysis of pet was conducted results not shown for 39 basins with decreasing trends in rc in the southern regions of conus the mk results show that among the 39 basins 19 basins had no trends and 20 basins had increasing trends in pet we attempted to simulate the runoff that might have occurred without the increasing pet trend assuming that the increased pet had increased actual et and reduced the runoff to adjust the runoff and rc the pet deviation change in pet from one year to the next was added to the runoff of the next year since these basins are in the water limited regions with annual precipitation to pet of 0 82 the use of 100 pet deviation is a conservative high end estimate furthermore almost half of these basins 19 basins out of 39 basins had no trend in pet thus after averaging the adjusted rc change between 2001 and 2016 for 20 basins with pet trend and 19 basins without pet trend results show a lesser impact in runoff and rc change for example if 50 of pet deviation was converted to actual et the difference between the original rc change 18 2 and adjusted rc change 17 3 would be 0 9 thus the relationship between directional land over change and rc change would remain comparable however as we observe that pet could change runoff and rc incorporating pet in addition to precipitation as a climatic factor in runoff and rc analysis will be important in future research the spatial distribution of basins with rc values fig 1 and trends fig 2 suggests that the basins in the higher precipitation regions are getting wetter increasing runoff and the basins in the lower precipitation regions are getting drier decreasing runoff in recent years 1985 2017 this finding is consistent with studies that reported that dry areas are getting drier and wet areas are becoming wetter in recent decades feng and zhang 2015 yang et al 2019 studies have projected a decline in natural land covers including forests and grasslands and an increase in croplands in conus sleeter et al 2012 sohl et al 2014 regionally eastern conus is expected to have the largest proportion of overall land cover change following the great plains and western mountain regions and the western deserts and the mediterranean california regions sleeter et al 2012 in the event of continued significant rc trends across basins with the projected directional land cover changes frequent flooding in the northern basins and droughts in the southern basins could be observed as the basins with significant increase and decrease in precipitation were excluded in this study wetter and drier basins in recent years indicate that the rate of changes on directional land cover was larger in the recent decade than in the 1980s and 1990s across basins with rc trends the land cover maps from land change monitoring assessment and projection lcmap https www usgs gov land resources eros lcmap last accessed 21 april 2020 provide continuous annual land cover change maps were not available at the time of this study since the 1980s and will be useful for the comprehensive evaluation on a year by year basis runoff volume analysis shows that the amount of declining runoff volume from basins with decreasing trends in runoff and rc is substantially larger than that from the increasing runoff volume from basins with increasing trends in runoff and rc table 3 also the basins without runoff and rc trends had decreasing runoff volume in recent years 2001 2016 compared to the 1985 2017 average similar relationships between directional land cover change with rc table 2 and directional land cover change with runoff volume table 3 were observed for basins with and without trends in rc and runoff however there were differences in magnitudes and the number of basins with and without trends the larger number of basins with trends in rc table 2 compared to the number of basins with trends in runoff and rc table 2 was due to the incorporation of spatial variation component of precipitation in rc a larger smaller impact of each km2 area or a unit percent change in land cover was associated with larger smaller rc and runoff volume changes across basins with decreasing increasing trends in runoff and rc about a 4 decrease in runoff volume was associated with a unit percent increase in basins area from grassland and shrubland to forest compared to about a 0 1 increase in runoff volume with a unit percent increase in basin area from forest to grassland and shrubland previous studies frans et al 2013 ekness and randhir 2015 twine et al 2004 have also reported both an increase and decrease of runoff for example mao and cherkauer 2009 reported up to a 30 change in total runoff between 1950 and 2000 in the great lakes region depending on the direction of land cover change overall a large reduction in runoff volume was observed from reference basins an average of 25 106 m3 yr 1 runoff volume is reduced from basins with decreasing trends in runoff and rc in other words 530 000 m3 of runoff water is lost when 1 km2 is converted from grassland and shrubland to forest this rate of runoff water reduction with the directional land cover change represents a substantial loss for a given county for example the state of colorado shows two basins with decreasing trends in runoff and rc and the state has 64 counties with an average area of 4216 km2 if 10 of the average county area or 422 km2 of grassland and shrubland is converted to forest it would result in a 224 106 m3 59 2 billion us gallons decrease in runoff water which is equivalent to 80 of the water supplied by the city of denver colorado for 2017 73 6 billion us gallons https www denverwater org last accessed 8 april 2020 which has a population of over 600 000 in contrast with the rate of 1 km2 conversion from forest to grassland and shrubland resulting in a 200 000 m3 increase in runoff water across basins with runoff and rc increasing trends a 10 of the average county area 422 km2 conversion from forest to grassland and shrubland would increase 84 106 m3 22 2 billion us gallons runoff water which would be equivalent to 30 of the water supplied by the city of denver in 2017 the larger amount of runoff water 59 2 billion us gallons for the same area 10 or 422 km2 increase from grassland and shrubland to forest is most likely due to differences in hydroclimate the amount of runoff water loss or conserve would vary by state for the same percentage 10 of land cover change in relation to the prevailing rainfall runoff relationships although the directional land cover changes were occurring across reference basins billions of gallons of water would have been saved without those land cover changes considered in this study the relationship between the directional land cover changes with runoff and rc from several basins in this study can be useful for developing and implementing regional scale water management plans and policies similar studies can be conducted for developing finer scale relationships to specific basins for managing runoff water at local scales the findings of this study could be useful for several applications however the limitations of this study must be considered while making decisions this study is based on the selected gages ii reference basins with observed data from 1985 to 2017 the analysis was made at the water year october september scale and does not reflect monthly or seasonal variations results for rc are abstracted from basins with and without trends in rc and for runoff volume from basins with and without trends in runoff and rc due to the limited number of basins with trends in runoff and rc the development of relationships of directional land cover changes with rc and runoff volume across different regions of conus was not possible impacts of basin properties such as elevation and slope in runoff and rc are assumed to be consistent as these properties remained constant during the study period the mk test was applied to detect monotonic trends for long term data and may not be representative of extreme values in observed data for a year or few years moreover significant trends in runoff and rc were based on the 5 significance level and the significance level can be changed based on the study objective upon changing the temporal coverage and experimental design for similar studies in the future the results vary with change in the number and spatial distribution of basins uncertainties may exit on nlcd land cover maps a recent accuracy assessment study on the 2011 epoch of the nlcd 2016 product shows an overall accuracy of 83 with producer s and user s accuracies more than 78 and 57 for forests 85 and 82 for grassland and 87 and 86 for shrubland respectively homer et al 2020 the accuracies were more than 80 for all land cover except for mixed forests thus the areas with mixed forest may have added bias in directional land cover change estimations this study considered the directional land cover changes on forest to and from grassland and shrubland which accounted for more than two thirds of the directional land cover changes between 2001 and 2016 other directional land cover changes were assumed to have a minimal impact in rc and runoff volume across less human impacted reference basins the nlcd land cover data from 2001 to 2016 with the intermittent product at every 2 3 years does not reflect year to year variations the continuous annual land cover maps from lcmap will be helpful for the comprehensive year to year evaluation of directional land cover change impact in runoff at finer scales 5 conclusions this study investigated the impacts of directional land cover change in runoff parameters annual rc and runoff volume across 603 gages ii minimal human impacted reference basins in the conus the major directional land cover changes across reference basins were from forest to grassland and shrubland and from grassland and shrubland to forest these land cover changes were associated with changes in rc and runoff volume the main findings of this study are as follows i basins with trends in runoff and rc were associated with large directional land cover changes from forest to or from grassland and shrubland for basins with increasing trends more than 5 40 km2 of the basin area was converted from forest to grassland and shrubland similarly at least 5 22 km2 of the basin area was converted from grassland and shrubland to forest across basins with decreasing trends basins without trends had less than 5 of the basin area with directional land cover changes from forest to or from grassland and shrubland ii a unit percent increase in basin area from grassland and shrubland to forest resulted in a 4 decrease in rc across basins with decreasing rc trends for basins with increasing rc trends a unit percent increase in basin area from forest to grassland and shrubland resulted in a 1 increase in rc runoff volume was decreased increased by 25 106 m3 yr 1 9 106 m3 yr 1 during 2001 2016 than during 1985 2017 across basins with decreasing increasing trends in runoff and rc each 1 km2 increase in area from forest to grassland and shrubland resulted in a 200 000 m3 increase in runoff volume across basins with increasing trends in contrast each 1 km2 increase in area from grassland and shrubland to forest decreased runoff volume by 530 000 m3 across decreasing trend basins observing the expected agreement between the directional land cover change from grassland and shrubland to forest and rc across basins with decreasing rc trend during 2001 2016 compared to 1985 2017 indicated that grassland and shrubland to forest conversion might have occurred in the recent decade iii the larger percent of land cover change from forest to grassland and shrubland occurred in basins with increasing trends in runoff and rc were across higher precipitation areas northeast and northwest regions of the conus in contrast the larger percent of land cover change from grassland and shrubland to forest occurred in basins with decreasing trends in runoff and rc across lower precipitation areas southern region of the conus a larger impact of directional land cover change in rc and runoff volume was across the southern region basins indicating more vulnerability to land cover changes than the basins in the northeast and northwest regions the continuous directional land cover changes across reference basins can lead to more wet increasing runoff basins in the northeast and northwest regions and more dry decreasing runoff basins in the southern region the findings of this study provide a baseline for understanding the impacts of directional land cover change in runoff across reference basins this study included relatively less temporal coverage of land cover data than that of runoff follow up studies will include a longer temporal coverage of land cover change data from lcmap to evaluate the year by year responses of runoff and other hydro climatic variables such as et

296,land cover change plays a critical role in influencing hydrological responses change in land cover has impacted runoff across basins with substantial human interference however the impacts in basins with minimal human interference have been studied less in this study we investigated the impacts of directional land cover changes forest to from combined grassland and shrubland in runoff coefficient rc ratio of runoff to precipitation and runoff volume across 603 low human interference reference basins in the conterminous united states conus the results indicate basins with significant p 0 05 increasing trends in runoff and rc were across the northeast and northwest regions of conus and basins with decreasing trends were in the southern conus region a unit percent increase in basin area from grassland and shrubland to forest was associated with a 4 decrease in rc across basins with decreasing rc trends similarly a unit percent increase in basin area from forest to a combined grassland and shrubland was associated with a 1 increase in rc across increasing rc trend basins runoff volume was decreased increased by 25 106 m3 yr 1 9 106 m3 yr 1 across basins with decreasing increasing trends in runoff and rc when relating runoff volume with the area of directional land cover changes each 1 km2 increase in area from grassland and shrubland to forest resulted in a decrease of 530 000 m3 runoff volume across basins with decreasing trends in contrast each 1 km2 increase in area from forest to grassland and shrubland increased runoff volume by 200 000 m3 across increasing trend basins basins in the southern region of conus were more impacted by runoff parameters rc and runoff volume from directional land cover changes than basins in the northern region the findings of this study are useful for planning and managing water availability for sustainable and adaptive water resources management at regional scales keywords forest grassland land cover change reference basins runoff runoff coefficient 1 introduction land cover is one of several factors that play a major role in hydrology by partitioning precipitation into evapotranspiration and runoff forest returns more than half of annual precipitation to the atmosphere as evapotranspiration whereas grassland returns less water to the atmosphere and converts the majority of annual precipitation to infiltration and runoff harsch et al 2009 changes in land cover affect the ratio of precipitation conversion to evapotranspiration and runoff thus altering the hydrological responses at basin scales poff et al 2006 schilling et al 2008 zhou et al 2015 water is lost through evapotranspiration and only the water from runoff and groundwater is available and manageable to fulfill sectoral water demands with expected changes in future precipitation patterns donat et al 2016 wuebbles et al 2014 and land cover hurtt et al 2011 sohl et al 2014 it is crucial to understand the linkage between the changes in land cover and runoff across basins in order to sustain water resources changes in basin runoff associated with land cover change are primarily driven by human interferences human activities such as the conversion of forests to grasslands and croplands decrease evapotranspiration and interception by changing vegetation structure and surface roughness savary et al 2009 thereby contributing to increasing basin runoff mao and cherkauer 2009 scanlon et al 2007 conversely afforestation increases evapotranspiration and reduces basin runoff buendia et al 2016 the extent of runoff reduction varies depending upon tree species age canopy characteristics and rooting depths roberts et al 2001 sun et al 2008 several studies have reported the changes in basin runoff due to human interference in land cover for example mao and cherkauer 2009 applied a hydrological model in the great lakes region of the united states us and reported a 20 30 decrease in total runoff by conversion from prairie grasslands to row agricultural croplands and 10 30 increase in total runoff when deciduous forest converted to wooded grasslands and croplands in the comet river catchment area in central queensland australia runoff increased by about 78 due to the degradation of natural forest to grasslands and croplands siriwardena et al 2006 another modeling study in the upper mississippi river basin a remarkable agricultural intensification basin in the us reported a decrease increase in the annual runoff by up to 9 5 where grasslands forests were converted to croplands and highlighted climate as an important factor for runoff changes frans et al 2013 several previous studies have evaluated climate impacts in basin runoff jiang et al 2015 ryberg et al 2014 tomer and schilling 2009 velpuri and senay 2013 and reported both increases and decreases in basin runoff with varying ranges from 10 chang et al 2015 huang et al 2016 to 90 wu et al 2017 depending on hydroclimate and the extent of changes in climatic variables for long term analysis of basin runoff basin characteristics such as elevation slope soil properties and other static properties remain unchanged unless human interferences and their impact in basin runoff would be consistent over time however land cover changes are dynamic and studies have shown substantial impacts in basin runoff when there are large changes in land cover from human activities during a long period of time tomer and schilling 2009 schilling et al 2008 changes in land cover from human activities can be largely regulated by the development of plans and policies and application of best management practices jia et al 2013 loperfido et al 2014 mishra et al 2007 joshi et al 2019 the effectiveness of such land cover changes for managing basin runoff depends on the subsequent strategies and management practices adopted mcbroom et al 2008 liu et al 2017 several studies have evaluated the impacts of human activities and best management practices in runoff however very few have investigated the land cover changes under natural conditions without or with minimal human interference and associated long term impacts in basin runoff efforts to identify basins with minimal human interference in the us include hydroclimatic data network hcdn watersheds in the early 1990s by slack and landwehr 1992 falcone 2011 classified reference minimal human interference and non reference basins under the geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow version ii gages ii project global scale projects such as the international model parameter estimation experiment have identified several basins throughout the world assumed unaffected by human interference duan et al 2006 wang and hejazi 2011 studies have evaluated the determinants of runoff across minimal human impacted basins for example chang et al 2014 reported the average annual days of measurable precipitation as the most significant determining factor of annual runoff ratio runoff divided by precipitation for both gages ii reference and non reference basins across the conterminous us conus petersen et al 2012 found basin aridity and seasonality index in precipitation as an influencing factor for runoff seasonality across hcdn basins in the western us and moisture and energy cycles in the midwest and peninsular florida basins while studies have identified predictors for variations in runoff across less human impacted basins the linkage between long term changes in runoff with land cover across those basins is still not investigated developing the relationships between runoff and land cover change specifically directional changes such as forests to or from other land covers can help to better understand the runoff generation from such basins and the relationships can be applied as the guideline for planning and managing water availability for a sustainable and adaptive water resources management with the main goal of investigating the relationships between the long term basin runoff characteristics and directional land cover changes across minimal human impacted basins in conus this study addresses three specific questions i are there any long term trends in runoff rates a ratio of runoff to precipitation or runoff coefficient and linkage with directional land cover changes ii what are the impacts of directional land cover changes on the magnitude and direction of runoff coefficient and runoff volume iii how are the relationships between runoff parameters runoff coefficient and runoff volume and directional land cover changes spatially varied across the conus basins with minimal human interference are expected to cover most of their land area with natural vegetation such as forests grasslands and shrublands and the directional changes among these land covers are assumed to impact runoff parameters long term increase or decrease in runoff coefficients and runoff volume are expected to be associated with directional land cover changes of natural vegetation across reference basins we hypothesize that basins with increasing trends in runoff coefficients and runoff volume are associated with land cover change from forest to a combined grassland and shrubland similarly basins with decreasing trends in runoff coefficients and runoff volume are associated with grassland and shrubland conversions to forests gages ii reference basins were considered in the study as these basins have continuous data for recent decades falcone 2011 and national land cover database nlcd maps https www mrlc gov last accessed 15 april 2020 were applied for directional land cover changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study includes gages ii reference basins in conus conterminous united states the gages ii reference basins are considered to have near natural flow conditions with minimal human disturbances such as from modifications by channels or dams road networks impervious surfaces and fragmented or developed land cover falcone 2011 these basins have more than 20 years of flow record between 1950 and 2009 and some of them have a complete record from 1900 to the present further details on gages ii reference basins are available in falcone 2011 out of 2057 reference basins identified by gages ii 603 basins were selected which had a continuous flow record between 1985 and 2017 fig 1 these selected basins are distributed across conus with sizes ranging from approximately 5 km2 to 26 000 km2 and an average of 830 km2 the total area coverage of 603 reference basins is over 500 000 km2 mean 1985 2017 water year october 1 to september 30 hereafter referred to as annual precipitation across these basins was between 264 mm yr 1 and 3931 mm yr 1 with an average of 1175 mm yr 1 2 2 data description 2 2 1 precipitation runoff and runoff coefficient evaluation of runoff response associated with directional land cover changes across 603 gages ii reference basins was based on changes in runoff coefficient rc and runoff volume the analysis was conducted at the annual water year october september scale monthly precipitation data were obtained from parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism daly et al 1994 prism data are considered among the highest quality spatial climate data in the us di luzio et al 2008 and have been applied in previous basin runoff studies petersen et al 2012 velpuri and senay 2013 the monthly prism data used in this study are 4 km 4 km spatial resolution and freely available at the oregon state university prism website http www prism oregonstate edu recent last accessed 16 april 2020 annual precipitation was generated by aggregating monthly precipitation maps from october to september a single value of annual precipitation mm yr 1 for each basin was computed as an average of precipitation for the prism grid cells within each basin daily discharge rates are recorded at gages ii basins and these daily data from 1985 to 2017 were downloaded from the us geological survey usgs national water information system nwis website https waterdata usgs gov nwis last accessed 18 april 2020 from daily discharge rates for each basin an annual discharge was computed as an average of daily discharge from october 1 to september 30 annual discharge m3 s 1 was converted to annual flow volume m3 with a given number of days in each year annual runoff mm yr 1 for each basin was then estimated as a ratio of annual flow volume to the basin area a similar approach of estimating runoff from discharge rates across gages ii basins was also applied in chang et al 2014 to account for spatial variations across basins the annual runoff was normalized by annual precipitation to compute annual rc unitless for each basin during the study period 1985 2017 rc represents the fraction of water available as runoff from given precipitation and typically varies between 0 and 1 indicating no runoff and all precipitation conversion to runoff respectively 2 2 2 directional land cover change land cover maps from the national land cover database nlcd 2016 https www mrlc gov last accessed 20 april 2020 were used to generate the directional land cover change maps nlcd is a comprehensive land cover database for the us and has been providing land cover maps at 30 m spatial resolution since 2001 with nlcd 2001 ncld 2006 nlcd 2011 and nlcd 2016 fry et al 2011 homer et al 2020 homer et al 2015 the recently released nlcd 2016 unlike previous versions provides both land cover and land cover change across 7 epochs from 2001 to 2016 with land cover maps for 2001 2003 2006 2008 2011 2013 and 2016 between 2001 and 2016 nearly 50 of the land cover changes of the conus landscape involved forest homer et al 2020 indicating changes across forest areas as the dominant land cover change type to identify the major directional land cover changes across the selected 603 gages ii reference basins the overall land cover change non directional was computed between 2001 and 2016 directional land cover changes also were computed such as forest to grassland grassland to cropland forest to urban forest to suburban grassland to forest shrubland to forest and others we found about 8 an average of 603 basins total land cover change across reference basins and more than two thirds 68 of the total change involve forest from forest deciduous conifer and mixed forests to grassland forest to shrubland grassland to forest and shrubland to forest thus the directional land cover change maps from forest to grassland and forest to shrubland were aggregated computed percentage of directional land cover change for reference basins that potentially increase runoff similarly changes from grassland to forest and shrubland to forest were aggregated that decrease runoff directional land cover changes based on two time periods such as from 2001 to 2016 is not representative of continuous temporal changes which occurred between the 15 year period 2001 2016 thus the directional land cover changes considered in this study forest to grassland and shrubland and grassland and shrubland to forest were computed sequentially 2001 2003 2003 2006 2006 2008 2008 2011 2011 2013 and 2013 2016 as a percentage of the total area of basins between 7 epochs of nlcd 2016 product this cumulative directional land cover change during 2001 to 2016 were then linked with changes in rc and runoff volume across reference basins 2 3 analysis for identifying the reference basins with trends in runoff and rc the mann kendall mk test mann 1945 kendall 1948 was applied the mk test is a nonparametric test used for detecting monotonic trends increasing decreasing and no trend and has been applied in several runoff studies choi et al 2016 velpuri and senay 2013 yaning et al 2009 to associate runoff parameters rc and runoff volume with directional land cover changes only basins with significant p 0 05 trends in precipitation were excluded to remove the impact of precipitation in runoff parameters trends in runoff and rc were based on data for 1985 2017 however directional land cover change data were not available to match the same time period for runoff and rc thus to match the directional land cover data from 2001 to 2016 rc values were estimated applying slope and intercept from the regression line for 2001 and 2016 for each basin the changes in rc values between 2001 and 2016 were then associated with the percentage of directional land cover changes across reference basins for the runoff volume analysis basins with and without trends in both runoff and rc were identified then mean runoff volume of those basins between 2001 and 2016 consistent with directional land cover change data was compared with long term 1985 2017 mean runoff volume the changes in runoff volume were then aggregated to link with directional land cover changes across reference basins 3 results 3 1 precipitation runoff and runoff coefficient during the study period from 1985 to 2017 the mean annual precipitation across the 603 selected gages ii reference basins was between 264 and 3991 mm yr 1 with an average of 1175 mm yr 1 the annual runoff varied from 0 to 3513 mm yr 1 with an average of 557 mm yr 1 and annual runoff coefficient rc from 0 00 to 1 08 one basin had rc greater than 1 0 with an average of 0 39 larger rc values are across the northeast and northwest regions of the us with values of 0 48 and above fig 1 the single basin with an rc value greater than 1 0 is located in the northwest region and had an rc value of 1 08 this rc value could be due to regional groundwater flow these regions northeast and northwest have higher annual precipitation rates usually greater than 1200 mm yr 1 the larger rc values across these regions are likely due to higher precipitation and lower evapotranspiration rates such that more water is available at the land surface after fulfilling evapotranspiration demand and the remaining water is converted to runoff smaller rc values are in the central and southern regions of the us with values of 0 32 and lower fig 1 where potential evapotranspiration pet rates are higher and precipitation rates are lower than 800 mm yr 1 basins with the smallest rc values 0 16 and lower were across the transition regions between the eastern humid and western semi arid of the us where precipitation rates are between 401 and 800 mm yr 1 fig 1 3 2 impacts of land cover change in runoff coefficient 3 2 1 runoff coefficient trend the mk trend analysis indicated that 155 out of the 603 reference basins had precipitation trends table 1 these basins were excluded to remove the impact of precipitation in rc trends so only 448 basins without precipitation trends were evaluated out of 448 basins 79 basins had trends in rc table 1 among the 79 basins with trends in rc 40 basins had increasing trends and 39 basins had decreasing trends basins with increasing trends in rc were across the northeast and northwest regions fig 2 where precipitation rates are higher than other regions fig 1 the mean annual precipitation and rc for the 40 increasing rc trend basins were 1721 mm yr 1 and 0 61 respectively in contrast most of the reference basins with decreasing rc trends were from the southern region fig 2 the mean annual precipitation across the 39 basins with decreasing trends in rc was 960 mm yr 1 about 44 lower than those basins with increasing trends in rc the mean rc was 0 22 for decreasing trend basins substantially smaller than the basins with increasing trends in rc 0 61 for the basins without rc trends mean rc and precipitation rates were larger smaller than those of basins with decreasing increasing trends in rc table 1 trends in rc were observed when the total land cover change was 8 and above on average table 1 the land cover change of increasing rc trend basins 17 was more than the basins with decreasing rc trends 8 for basins without rc trends land cover change was smaller 7 than basins with rc trends table 1 the average area of basins with decreasing trends in rc was larger by 39 and 45 than those of basins with increasing and without trends in rc respectively table 1 3 2 2 response of runoff coefficient to directional land cover change the comparison of interannual variations of rc and directional land cover changes across reference basins shows that the larger directional land cover changes were associated with basins with increasing and decreasing trends in rc fig 3 basins with directional land cover change of more than 5 on average of their total basin area converted from forest to grassland and shrubland or from grassland and shrubland to forest had increasing or decreasing trends in rc respectively table 2 basins with increasing rc trends had 12 6 48 km2 of their basin area converted from forest to grassland and shrubland and 6 0 29 km2 of the area from grassland and shrubland to forest in contrast directional land cover changes were smaller for decreasing rc trend basins with 5 5 40 km2 of their basin area converted from forest to grassland and shrubland and 5 1 38 km2 of the basin area converted from grassland and shrubland to forest for basins without rc trends directional land cover changes were less than 5 table 2 the changes in rc were more than 9 on average across basins with increasing 9 8 and decreasing 18 2 rc trends table 2 for basins without rc trends the change was less than 3 the impact of directional land cover change in rc was larger for basins with decreasing rc trends than for basins with increasing rc trends a unit percent increase in basin area from grassland and shrubland to forest was associated with a 3 6 decrease in rc across basins with decreasing rc trends for basins with increasing trends in rc a unit percent increase in basin area from forest to grassland and shrubland was associated with a 0 8 increase in rc these results show that the basins with decreasing rc trends in the southern regions of the us fig 2 are more influenced by the directional land cover changes than the basins in the northern regions as expected a larger percentage of directional land cover change from forest to grassland and shrubland was associated with increasing trends in rc table 2 however for basins with decreasing rc trends both directional land cover changes forest to from combined grassland and shrubland were similar at 5 table 2 a slightly larger percent 0 4 from forest to grassland and shrubland is observed than that from shrubland and grassland to forest contrary to the expected directional land cover change one of the reasons could be due to relative differences in rc response from a unit percent change in land cover from grassland and shrubland to forest versus from forest to grassland and shrubland for example deforestation will have an immediate impact in runoff whereas afforestation may take several years to see similar impacts in rc it is possible to evaluate the sensitivity of unit percent land cover change impacts in rc however the main objective of this study was to find the overall trends in rc associated with the directional land cover changes the directional land cover changes are occurring on different basins with increasing and decreasing rc trends from different geographical areas which may subject to different climatic drivers that can impact rc for example the smaller difference i e 0 4 between directional land cover changes with a larger 18 2 rc change across decreasing rc trend basins in drier areas indicates that climate factors such as pet and air temperature may influence rc trends to further evaluate the variation in directional land cover changes across decreasing rc trend basins the temporal coverage was limited between 2001 and 2016 for both land cover and rc after limiting the basins with continuous data from 2001 to 2016 and conducting mk trend analysis a clear signal on the impact of directional land cover change in rc trends is observed fig 4 for example the basins with decreasing rc trends fig 4b had a larger percent change from grassland and shrubland to forest than that from forest to grassland and shrubland which was not observed while considering the basins with continuous data from 1985 to 2017 fig 3f the basins with increasing trends in rc fig 4a had similar results to that with the basins with the 1985 2017 continuous data fig 3d these results support our hypothesis that significant trends in rc across gages ii reference basins are associated with substantial directional land cover changes on forest to or from grassland and shrubland the observed agreement as expected between the land cover change from grassland and shrubland to forest across basins with decreasing rc trends during 2001 2016 compared to 1985 2017 indicates that grassland and shrubland to forest conversion might have occurred in the recent decade grassland and shrubland to forest conversion mostly occurred in the southeast region fig 2 the consistent agreement on the forest to grassland and shrubland conversion across basins with increasing rc trend for both 33 year and 15 year analysis shows that this directional land cover change might have been continuously occurring since the 1980s and 1990s for the basins without rc trend the percentage of forest to grassland and shrubland conversion is larger than that from grassland and shrubland to forest table 2 as most of the basins 448 out of 603 considered in this study had no trend in rc similar continued directional land cover changes across these basins can further decrease in rc without significant changes in precipitation trend and directional land cover forest to from combined grassland and shrubland across reference basins runoff is expected to be lower as most of the basins showed decreasing trends in rc 3 2 3 impact of directional land cover change in runoff volume the number of basins with and without trends in both runoff and rc and associated directional land cover and runoff volume changes are shown in table 3 out of 603 basins after excluding basins with trends in precipitation 444 basins had no trend 15 had increasing and 17 had increasing trend in runoff and rc basins with and without trends in runoff and rc table 3 were subsets of basins with and without trend in rc only table 2 fig 2 relatively fewer basins had trends in both runoff and rc compared to the basins with trends in rc runoff depth was available as a lumped average for the basins whereas gridded 4 km 4 km precipitation accounted the spatial distribution of precipitation such that the normalization of runoff by precipitation resulted in a larger number of basins with trends in rc this result indicates that factors contributing to spatiotemporal variations in runoff should be considered while evaluating long term trends in runoff parameters runoff volume analysis shows that runoff volume increased by 9 106 m3 yr 1 2 2 on average during 2001 2016 423 106 m3 yr 1 compared to 1985 2017 414 106 m3 yr 1 across basins with increasing runoff and rc trends table 3 for basins with decreasing runoff and rc trends runoff volume decreased by 25 106 m3 yr 1 17 9 during 2001 2016 115 106 m3 yr 1 compared to the 1985 2017 average 140 106 m3 yr 1 the decreasing runoff volume was more than twice of the increasing runoff volume for basins without trends in runoff and rc runoff volume was also decreased by 8 106 m3 yr 1 2 6 in 2001 2016 298 106 m3 yr 1 compared to during 1985 2017 306 106 m3 yr 1 table 3 while relating to the area of directional land cover changes the largest area conversion forest to from combined grassland and shrubland corresponded to the basins with decreasing trends in runoff and rc table 3 the smallest area conversion from forest to grassland and shrubland was across the basins without trends in runoff and rc similarly the smallest area conversion from grassland and shrubland to forest was across the basins with increasing trends in runoff and rc each 1 km2 increase in area from forest to grassland and shrubland resulted in a 200 000 m3 increase in runoff volume across basins with increasing trends in runoff and rc in contrast each 1 km2 increase in area from grassland and shrubland to forest resulted in a 530 000 m3 decrease in runoff volume across basins with decreasing runoff and rc trends fig 5 the higher rate of runoff volume from 1 km2 of grassland and shrubland conversion to forest is likely attributable to differences in hydroclimate of decreasing and increasing trend basins table 1 in terms of percentage a unit percent increase in basin area from grassland and shrubland to forest reduced runoff volume by 3 6 and a unit percent increase in basin area from forest to grassland and shrubland increased runoff volume by 0 1 the larger amount of decreasing runoff volume 33 106 m3 yr 1 than increasing runoff volume 9 106 m3 yr 1 from our study indicates that there will be a larger reduction in the runoff volume if similar directional land cover changes continue across reference basins in the future 4 discussion the 1985 2017 evaluation of rc trends across 603 gages ii reference basins shows that the majority of basins have no trend in rc table 1 a smaller number of basins had increasing and decreasing trends in rc increasing and decreasing trends in rc were observed across basins with larger and smaller values of mean rc respectively table 1 basins with rc trends were closely linked with directional land cover changes of those basins figs 3 4 for example a unit percent increase in basin area with directional land cover change from grassland and shrubland to forest forest to grassland and shrubland was associated with a 4 1 decrease increase in rc across basins with decreasing increasing rc trends on average fig 5 as expected for basins without rc trends the change in rc associated with directional land cover changes were much lower than the basins with rc trends table 2 distinct regional differences of rc across basins with larger values in the northeast and northwest region and lower values in the central and southern region of the us fig 1 are similar as reported in a previous study chang et al 2014 the higher lower rc values at regions with higher lower precipitation rates indicate that precipitation is one of the major drivers for regional rc variations table 1 fig 2 however regional variations in runoff and rc depend on several factors for example seasonal runoff in the eastern us depends on monthly moisture and energy cycles whereas basin aridity and precipitation regimes are the dominant factors for determining runoff generation in the western us petersen et al 2012 also basin characteristics can have an impact in runoff parameters chang et al 2014 reported that mean basin slope and compactness are the main predictors of annual rc across gages ii reference and non reference basins respectively although we considered precipitation as the primary determining climatic factor that could impact runoff and rc we also examined the potential impact of another climatic factor pet grass reference et in runoff and rc trends mk trend analysis of pet was conducted results not shown for 39 basins with decreasing trends in rc in the southern regions of conus the mk results show that among the 39 basins 19 basins had no trends and 20 basins had increasing trends in pet we attempted to simulate the runoff that might have occurred without the increasing pet trend assuming that the increased pet had increased actual et and reduced the runoff to adjust the runoff and rc the pet deviation change in pet from one year to the next was added to the runoff of the next year since these basins are in the water limited regions with annual precipitation to pet of 0 82 the use of 100 pet deviation is a conservative high end estimate furthermore almost half of these basins 19 basins out of 39 basins had no trend in pet thus after averaging the adjusted rc change between 2001 and 2016 for 20 basins with pet trend and 19 basins without pet trend results show a lesser impact in runoff and rc change for example if 50 of pet deviation was converted to actual et the difference between the original rc change 18 2 and adjusted rc change 17 3 would be 0 9 thus the relationship between directional land over change and rc change would remain comparable however as we observe that pet could change runoff and rc incorporating pet in addition to precipitation as a climatic factor in runoff and rc analysis will be important in future research the spatial distribution of basins with rc values fig 1 and trends fig 2 suggests that the basins in the higher precipitation regions are getting wetter increasing runoff and the basins in the lower precipitation regions are getting drier decreasing runoff in recent years 1985 2017 this finding is consistent with studies that reported that dry areas are getting drier and wet areas are becoming wetter in recent decades feng and zhang 2015 yang et al 2019 studies have projected a decline in natural land covers including forests and grasslands and an increase in croplands in conus sleeter et al 2012 sohl et al 2014 regionally eastern conus is expected to have the largest proportion of overall land cover change following the great plains and western mountain regions and the western deserts and the mediterranean california regions sleeter et al 2012 in the event of continued significant rc trends across basins with the projected directional land cover changes frequent flooding in the northern basins and droughts in the southern basins could be observed as the basins with significant increase and decrease in precipitation were excluded in this study wetter and drier basins in recent years indicate that the rate of changes on directional land cover was larger in the recent decade than in the 1980s and 1990s across basins with rc trends the land cover maps from land change monitoring assessment and projection lcmap https www usgs gov land resources eros lcmap last accessed 21 april 2020 provide continuous annual land cover change maps were not available at the time of this study since the 1980s and will be useful for the comprehensive evaluation on a year by year basis runoff volume analysis shows that the amount of declining runoff volume from basins with decreasing trends in runoff and rc is substantially larger than that from the increasing runoff volume from basins with increasing trends in runoff and rc table 3 also the basins without runoff and rc trends had decreasing runoff volume in recent years 2001 2016 compared to the 1985 2017 average similar relationships between directional land cover change with rc table 2 and directional land cover change with runoff volume table 3 were observed for basins with and without trends in rc and runoff however there were differences in magnitudes and the number of basins with and without trends the larger number of basins with trends in rc table 2 compared to the number of basins with trends in runoff and rc table 2 was due to the incorporation of spatial variation component of precipitation in rc a larger smaller impact of each km2 area or a unit percent change in land cover was associated with larger smaller rc and runoff volume changes across basins with decreasing increasing trends in runoff and rc about a 4 decrease in runoff volume was associated with a unit percent increase in basins area from grassland and shrubland to forest compared to about a 0 1 increase in runoff volume with a unit percent increase in basin area from forest to grassland and shrubland previous studies frans et al 2013 ekness and randhir 2015 twine et al 2004 have also reported both an increase and decrease of runoff for example mao and cherkauer 2009 reported up to a 30 change in total runoff between 1950 and 2000 in the great lakes region depending on the direction of land cover change overall a large reduction in runoff volume was observed from reference basins an average of 25 106 m3 yr 1 runoff volume is reduced from basins with decreasing trends in runoff and rc in other words 530 000 m3 of runoff water is lost when 1 km2 is converted from grassland and shrubland to forest this rate of runoff water reduction with the directional land cover change represents a substantial loss for a given county for example the state of colorado shows two basins with decreasing trends in runoff and rc and the state has 64 counties with an average area of 4216 km2 if 10 of the average county area or 422 km2 of grassland and shrubland is converted to forest it would result in a 224 106 m3 59 2 billion us gallons decrease in runoff water which is equivalent to 80 of the water supplied by the city of denver colorado for 2017 73 6 billion us gallons https www denverwater org last accessed 8 april 2020 which has a population of over 600 000 in contrast with the rate of 1 km2 conversion from forest to grassland and shrubland resulting in a 200 000 m3 increase in runoff water across basins with runoff and rc increasing trends a 10 of the average county area 422 km2 conversion from forest to grassland and shrubland would increase 84 106 m3 22 2 billion us gallons runoff water which would be equivalent to 30 of the water supplied by the city of denver in 2017 the larger amount of runoff water 59 2 billion us gallons for the same area 10 or 422 km2 increase from grassland and shrubland to forest is most likely due to differences in hydroclimate the amount of runoff water loss or conserve would vary by state for the same percentage 10 of land cover change in relation to the prevailing rainfall runoff relationships although the directional land cover changes were occurring across reference basins billions of gallons of water would have been saved without those land cover changes considered in this study the relationship between the directional land cover changes with runoff and rc from several basins in this study can be useful for developing and implementing regional scale water management plans and policies similar studies can be conducted for developing finer scale relationships to specific basins for managing runoff water at local scales the findings of this study could be useful for several applications however the limitations of this study must be considered while making decisions this study is based on the selected gages ii reference basins with observed data from 1985 to 2017 the analysis was made at the water year october september scale and does not reflect monthly or seasonal variations results for rc are abstracted from basins with and without trends in rc and for runoff volume from basins with and without trends in runoff and rc due to the limited number of basins with trends in runoff and rc the development of relationships of directional land cover changes with rc and runoff volume across different regions of conus was not possible impacts of basin properties such as elevation and slope in runoff and rc are assumed to be consistent as these properties remained constant during the study period the mk test was applied to detect monotonic trends for long term data and may not be representative of extreme values in observed data for a year or few years moreover significant trends in runoff and rc were based on the 5 significance level and the significance level can be changed based on the study objective upon changing the temporal coverage and experimental design for similar studies in the future the results vary with change in the number and spatial distribution of basins uncertainties may exit on nlcd land cover maps a recent accuracy assessment study on the 2011 epoch of the nlcd 2016 product shows an overall accuracy of 83 with producer s and user s accuracies more than 78 and 57 for forests 85 and 82 for grassland and 87 and 86 for shrubland respectively homer et al 2020 the accuracies were more than 80 for all land cover except for mixed forests thus the areas with mixed forest may have added bias in directional land cover change estimations this study considered the directional land cover changes on forest to and from grassland and shrubland which accounted for more than two thirds of the directional land cover changes between 2001 and 2016 other directional land cover changes were assumed to have a minimal impact in rc and runoff volume across less human impacted reference basins the nlcd land cover data from 2001 to 2016 with the intermittent product at every 2 3 years does not reflect year to year variations the continuous annual land cover maps from lcmap will be helpful for the comprehensive year to year evaluation of directional land cover change impact in runoff at finer scales 5 conclusions this study investigated the impacts of directional land cover change in runoff parameters annual rc and runoff volume across 603 gages ii minimal human impacted reference basins in the conus the major directional land cover changes across reference basins were from forest to grassland and shrubland and from grassland and shrubland to forest these land cover changes were associated with changes in rc and runoff volume the main findings of this study are as follows i basins with trends in runoff and rc were associated with large directional land cover changes from forest to or from grassland and shrubland for basins with increasing trends more than 5 40 km2 of the basin area was converted from forest to grassland and shrubland similarly at least 5 22 km2 of the basin area was converted from grassland and shrubland to forest across basins with decreasing trends basins without trends had less than 5 of the basin area with directional land cover changes from forest to or from grassland and shrubland ii a unit percent increase in basin area from grassland and shrubland to forest resulted in a 4 decrease in rc across basins with decreasing rc trends for basins with increasing rc trends a unit percent increase in basin area from forest to grassland and shrubland resulted in a 1 increase in rc runoff volume was decreased increased by 25 106 m3 yr 1 9 106 m3 yr 1 during 2001 2016 than during 1985 2017 across basins with decreasing increasing trends in runoff and rc each 1 km2 increase in area from forest to grassland and shrubland resulted in a 200 000 m3 increase in runoff volume across basins with increasing trends in contrast each 1 km2 increase in area from grassland and shrubland to forest decreased runoff volume by 530 000 m3 across decreasing trend basins observing the expected agreement between the directional land cover change from grassland and shrubland to forest and rc across basins with decreasing rc trend during 2001 2016 compared to 1985 2017 indicated that grassland and shrubland to forest conversion might have occurred in the recent decade iii the larger percent of land cover change from forest to grassland and shrubland occurred in basins with increasing trends in runoff and rc were across higher precipitation areas northeast and northwest regions of the conus in contrast the larger percent of land cover change from grassland and shrubland to forest occurred in basins with decreasing trends in runoff and rc across lower precipitation areas southern region of the conus a larger impact of directional land cover change in rc and runoff volume was across the southern region basins indicating more vulnerability to land cover changes than the basins in the northeast and northwest regions the continuous directional land cover changes across reference basins can lead to more wet increasing runoff basins in the northeast and northwest regions and more dry decreasing runoff basins in the southern region the findings of this study provide a baseline for understanding the impacts of directional land cover change in runoff across reference basins this study included relatively less temporal coverage of land cover data than that of runoff follow up studies will include a longer temporal coverage of land cover change data from lcmap to evaluate the year by year responses of runoff and other hydro climatic variables such as et

297,at the local scale artificial impounded reservoirs in dry regions exert influence on the surrounding local climate impounded reservoirs have been found to alter precipitation patterns and increase temperature specific humidity and surface evaporation the consequences of impoundment or its related climatic changes on the surrounding vegetation are still not well understood we here examined the potential effect on surrounding tree growth of the impoundment of the ertan reservoir china in 1998 we measured yunnan pine tree rings at three sites on a slope close to the reservoir and two control sites far away from the reservoir we compared the annual radial growth of tree rings at all sites with air temperature precipitation and air humidity in the region we also used cumulative distribution functions to quantify the probability of attributing radial growth changes to background climate variability we find an enhancement of tree growth from 2000 to 2002 right after the reservoir s impounding in experimental and control sites hence the tree growth can initially be explained by favourable conditions benefiting tree growth however we cannot entirely attribute such enhancement to the background climate variability when studying the relationship between tree growth and climatic variables over the 36 years and their probability of occurrence tree growth in the three years following impoundment can only be attributed to the simultaneous effect of favourable regional climate conditions and the reservoir s impoundment in itself these conditions decrease vegetation stress by decreasing air temperature and increasing air relative humidity although the findings of this study shed more light on the environmental and climatic changes induced by the impoundment of reservoirs they also call for the need of monitoring climatic variables in the vicinity of reservoirs keywords hydroclimate change reservoir tree ring vegetation growth 1 introduction water flow regulation via artificial impoundment of reservoirs has expanded during the 20th century biemans et al 2011 more than 16 7 million reservoirs with surface areas larger than 100 m2 currently exist increasing the earth s terrestrial surface water area by more than 305 000 km2 lehner et al 2011 the extent of reservoir impoundment by dam construction in developing countries is expected to continue in the foreseeable future zarfl et al 2015 at the local scale artificial impounded reservoirs in dry regions influence the surrounding local climate degu et al 2011 impounded reservoirs have been found to alter precipitation patterns and air temperature increase specific humidity and surface evaporation degu et al 2011 li et al 2017 song et al 2017 vendrov malik 1965 wang et al 2018 winchester et al 2017 the hydrological basins with several of these reservoirs show a historical increase in the net evaporative ratio at the larger scale suggesting a net increase in water consumption by evaporation destouni et al 2013 jaramillo destouni 2015a 2015b wang hejazi 2011 these climatic effects have been found by analysing observational data and mesoscale modelling to evaluate the reservoirs influence on the climate observational data have included meteorological station data observational atmospheric records and satellite imagery degu et al 2011 durkee et al 2014 while modelling has included back trajectory analysis and mesoscale atmospheric modelling kunstmann knoche 2011 winchester et al 2017 woldemichael et al 2012 woldemichael et al 2014 tree ring data are also a useful proxy that archives fluctuations in ambient environmental conditions corresponding tree widths and densities have been used to understand environmental change when historical records are not available for instance tree ring data are used to track terrace uplift resulting from earthquakes jacoby 1997 jacoby ulan 1983 air pollution from industrial plants barniak krapiec 2016 juknys et al 2002 droughts cook et al 2004 woodhouse lukas 2006 and climatic effects by human activity duan et al 2017 although tree ring data may also be used to track environmental changes driven by reservoir impoundment cook 1987 duan et al 2017 this has only been marginally studied exceptions include the study of grelsson 1988 on the effect of rising groundwater table by reservoirs and that by tremblay and begin 2000 on the reaction of black spruce to the construction of an artificial reservoir the rate and efficiency of photosynthesis and respiration processes determine plant biomass growth dynamics along with local environmental conditions and nutrient requirements tkemaladze makhashvili 2016 environmental drivers affecting these rates include climate nutrient and water availability and mechanical perturbations of vegetation poorter et al 2012 furthermore vegetation growth is limited by extreme climate conditions related to air temperature precipitation and resulting drought mokria et al 2017 pichler oberhuber 2007 wu et al 2018 annual tree ring data worldwide reveals that tree growth in high and low elevations is generally more sensitive to air temperature and moisture availability respectively babst et al 2013 since reservoir impoundment has been found to affect some of these climatic parameters we hypothesise that reservoirs construction can also affect surrounding vegetation growth we aim to indetify the possible effect on the surrounding vegetation of an impounded reservoir in the yalong river basin in southwestern china the ertan reservoir was built in 1998 has a storage volume of 5 8 109 m3 and installed hydroelectric capacity of 3 3 106 kw we sampled yunnan pine tree rings and calculated annual radial growth at three sites on a slope close to the reservoir and two control sites far away from the reservoir our main objective is to determine which hydroclimatic parameters explain the observed tree growth and looking for a signal of the reservoir s impoundment on tree growth 2 materials and methods the procedure to explore the effect of the reservoir on tree growth consisted of five steps all steps focused on exploring if tree growth and their relationship to climatic conditions were different before and after impoundment firstly we compared tree ring width chronologies of the reservoir with those of the control sites secondly we compared the chronologies difference before and after the impoundment of the ertan dam in both experimental and control sites thirdly we analysed the radial growth response to hydroclimatic background parameters such as relative air humidity rh minimum mean and maximum monthly temperature tmax ta tmin respectively and precipitation p at the closest meteorological station called miyi and two other stations located further away for validation fourthly we calculated the probability of occurrence of tree growth in the specific years right after impoundment and corresponding hydroclimatic conditions based on the 36 years we hypothesise that if tree growth probability after impoundment is low and the probability of corresponding climatic conditions is not tree growth should be driven by other drivers such as the reservoir s impoundment fifth we checked based on secondary information if groundwater levels in the reservoir could explain tree growth in the experimental sites and if any difference in soil types between experimental and control sites could explain tree growth after impoundment 2 1 overview of the study area the lower yalong river basin a subbasin of the jinsha river basin is located in the hengduan mountains a set of north south oriented ranges and deeply incised gorges of parallel rivers fan et al 2009b zhang et al 2020 the elevation of the surface water level before the construction of the dam was 1050 m a s l when the reservoir was initially filled in may 1998 the surface water level oscillated in the range of 1155 to 1160 m a s l until may 1999 shu 2006 since then the water level of the reservoir has varied between 1190 and 1200 m a s l the anning river is a tributary of the yalong river li et al 2020 the ertan reservoir yalong river and anning river fig 1 are all located in a dry valley with a dry season that extends from november to may and a wet season from june to october peng et al 2012 vertical climatic gradients dominate the valleys where lower elevations are drier and have less precipitation fan et al 2009a the mean monthly climatic conditions in the meteorological station miyi can be seen in fig a 1 in this station maximum and mean annual temperatures tmax and ta and relative humidity rh have increased significantly p 0 01 for tmax and ta p 0 05 for rh t test since 1980 and annual precipitation p has fluctuated with no significant trend p 0 11 t test recent research in the area has found a sensitivity of radial growth of vegetation to air temperature and air moisture availability in the region fan et al 2009a fan et al 2008 guo et al 2009 lebek et al 2019 shi et al 2017 2 2 tree ring sampling and measurements our sampling sites were located in the lower elevations of dry valleys exhibiting sub arid climates and drought resistance shrubs lin et al 2015 to test if any influence of the reservoir s construction could be identified in the tree ring sites close to the reservoir we divided our sites and samples into two groups the first group was experimental consisting of the sites close to the reservoir and the second called the reference group consisting of two control sites located far away from the reservoir to avoid the influence of the reservoir on tree growth we selected the sampling sites so that the conditions of elevation tree species community characteristics and micro geomorphology would be as similar as possible between the experimental and reference groups besides the experimental group sites locations were chosen at different elevations along the same slope the experimental group consisted of three sites close to the reservoir r1 r2 and r3 and the reference group of two control sites c1 and c2 in the anning river valley the yalong river s tributary yunnan pine pinus yunnanensis franch was selected as the target species since it is commonly found in yunnan and the western sichuan provinces of southwestern china at elevations between 600 and 2100 m a s l tang qi 2015 furthermore we targeted this species to build upon previous research on tree growth climate relationships conducted successfully using this species shen et al 2019 shi et al 2017 yang et al 2018 numerous factors can affect tree growth including age and size climate and soil characteristics micro landforms and disturbances hence to reduce the influence of non climatic factors on tree growth we chose tree communities that resembled natural conditions and were not altered by human disturbance or extreme events such as pests or wildfires the five sites are located on north facing slopes i e north or northeast slopes table 1 to reduce any effects from microclimatologic conditions the experimental and reference sites are in valleys exhibiting distinct dry and warm climates integrated scientific expedition team to qinghai tibet plateau 1992 with drought resistant savanna and succulent thorn shrub vegetation huan cheng mcconchie 2001 we assume that the reservoir does not influence the control sites as they are far from the reservoir and in a neighbouring hydrological basin eutric cambisols are found in all sites according to the classification systems of fao unesco soil hiederer kochy 2011 and red earth by the genetic soil classification of china shi et al 2006 fig a 2 however it is worth mentioning that site c2 appears to have a different nutrient availability than in the other sites field and laboratory procedures were designed according to dendrochronology methodological standards cook kairiukstis 1990 a range of 15 to 24 trees was chosen at each site two cores of each tree were extracted to the pith at 1 3 m above ground liang et al 2015 and then mounted dried and sanded stroke smiley 1968 the tree ring widths were measured under a microscope with the lintab system and the exact date of each ring was determined by cross dating with the program cofecha holmes 1983 we constructed the tree ring width series for each site from the average of the widths of the tree cores the sample depth in a given year indicates the numbers of trees at each site which varies in time fig 2 for each site sample depth increases in its initial decades or close the pithes of trees then keeps stably followed by decrease when approaching to barks of trees 2 3 extraction of climatic signals from tree ring widths and analysis on tree growth climate relationships the tree ring width series rt was considered a linear aggregate of several subseries cook 1987 and calculated with eq 1 1 r t a t c t δ d 1 t δ d 2 t e t the subscript t denotes a specific time at is the age size related trend of the annual radius of the stem ct is the climatic signal width series d1 t accounts for endogenous disturbances e g removal of an individual tree d2 t for exogenous disturbances e g fire and insect infestations and et for largely unexplained year to year variability not related to the other signals at ct and et are always accounted for and d1 t or d2 t may be present δ 1 or absent δ 0 at is the target signal we want to obtain for this study the remaining contributions should be ideally separated and removed d1 t is caused randomly within a stand with sufficient size and an event will not influence all the trees both in space and time cook 1987 makinen vanninen 1999 et may come from the variability of soil type and moisture among trees and measurement errors which can be neglected as trees are close to each other since at indicates common variability among individuals and the endogenous and unexplained noises are reduced when increasing the sample size per site makinen vanninen 1999 d1 t and et can be reduced averaging many samples from a site we chose the yunnan pine communities with less exogenous disturbance to minimise the effect of d2 t generally the increasing trend in at which is age related exhibits an exponential like function due to fast increasing growth in juvenile individuals and slower growths for older trees becoming steady over time sanchez salguero et al 2015 since our sampling tree growth curves fit this pattern we applied a negative exponential or linear function to estimate at ct can be estimated using either the residual rt at or ratio rt at by a detrending procedure the residual method is used here in conjunction with the initial power transformation to avoid ratio bias problems cook peters 1997 on the one hand the tree growth variability is not stable over time between individuals in a site riitters 1990 the biweighted method is used to generate a dimensionless tree ring width index series twi to produce a robust mean tree ring width master chronology variance stabilisation of the chronology was performed using the rbar weighted method osborn et al 1997 we also used an index termed expressed population signal eps to estimate signal and noise between and within individual trees in a community selecting only those indices larger than 0 85 wigley et al 1984 fig 2 data on maximum average and minimum monthly temperatures tmax ta tmin respectively precipitation p and relative humidity rh since 1979 were compared to twi we decided to focus on the period 1979 to 2016 to have equal length periods before and after the ertan dam s impoundment meteorological data was collected from miyi station 1137 m a s l closest to the ertan reservoir and huaping 1231 m a s l and huili 1787 m a s l further away with miyi station located in a dry valley their elevations are similar to those of the sampling sites fig a 6 we chose these stations as they are the nearest to the reservoir although outside of its area of influence sun et al 2019 the pearson correlation was selected to assess the relationships between yunnan pine growth and the meteorological variables to determine which variables control or limit tree growth in all sites the coefficient is widely used to analyse the growth climate relationship in dendroclimatology in the region shen et al 2019 shi et al 2017 sun et al 2020 yang et al 2018 we should note that the meteorological data obtained represents background climate conditions as the stations are far from the reservoir we performed correlational analyses between twi annual and monthly and annual tmax ta tmin p and rh the correlations were also studied between twi of each year and climatic variables of october november and december of the previous year as they may influence tree growth sun et al 2020 the correlations were also evaluated for the entire dry i e from november of the previous year to may of the current year and wet season i e from june to october of the same year 2 4 quantifying the occurrence probability of radial growth and climatic factors we also analysed the cumulative distribution function cdf of the data the cumulative distribution function fx x p x x gives the probability that x takes a value less than or equal to x studying the cdfs of twi and the meteorological variables shows if any annual value of tree growth falls outside of the typical distribution during 1979 2016 pointing to the reservoir s influence on tree growth four standard distribution functions i e normal lognormal gamma and weibull were used to fit the cdf of twi and climatic variables resulting in four possible cdfs for each variable the modified kolmogorov smirnov test massey jr 1951 was conducted to test the goodness of the fit we plotted the function meeting the goodness of fit p value 0 05 and having the least root mean square deviation rmse lastly each point s vertical coordinate in the plot of fx x vs x represents the occurrence probability that the variable has a value of x 3 results 3 1 tree ring width index and its relationship with background climate the annual tree ring width chronologies along the 37 years from 1980 to 2016 i e eighteen years before and after the reservoir s construction show a mild decreasing radial tree growth trend at both reference and reservoir sites fig 3 a c nevertheless the chronologies close to the reservoir show from 2000 to 2002 a sudden increase in twi that crops out from the master chronology fig 3a c the twi peaks in 2001 and 2002 are the largest recorded in r1 and the second largest in r2 the peak is also prominent in reference site c1 although overpassed in 1981 and equalled in 1984 1990 and 1996 for the case of c2 fig 3b d hence it is not evident from the comparison of the master chronologies in experimental and control sites that the reservoir s impoundment is the only reason for increased tree growth from 2000 to 2002 furthermore it can also be arguable that the effect of the impounded reservoir on tree growth should hold in time after impoundment if the water surface provides the conditions necessary for vegetation to enhance growth we find that climatic conditions limit the twi of yunnan pine during the dry season and especially in may fig 4 a and fig a 5 tree ring chronologies correlated negatively with maximum tmax and mean monthly temperature ta in both reservoir and reference sites p 0 05 t test chronologies are also positively correlated with precipitation p and relative humidity rh in may the dry season and october of the previous year p 0 05 t test among these tmax and rh have the highest correlations with the chronologies p 0 01 t test the results of the climate growth relationship from huili and huaping agree with that of miyi station fig a 5 therefore the radial growth of these yunnan pines is generally sensitive to background climate most specifically to tmax and rh when looking at specific annual peaks in the climatic variables fig 4b c we find that regional climatic conditions in 2000 to 2002 specifically high p and rh in may and the dry season are possibly responsible for the peak in tree growth twi in 2002 2002 at both experimental and control sites fig 4 however the highest rh and p during the dry season and the lowest tmax during 1980 2016 occurred in 1990 before the dam s construction this year radial tree growth did not increase as much as during the period 2000 2002 suggesting that favourable climatic conditions such as regional low tmax in the dry season and may and high rh in may the dry season and october of the previous year cannot be the sole explanation of the sudden increase of twi during the period 2000 and 2002 3 2 occurrence probability of radial growth and climatic factors we further analysed the cumulative probability cdf to assess the probability of occurrence of the climatic conditions and tree growth in the three years following the impoundment of the dam 2000 2002 based on the time series 1979 2016 fig 5 and fig a 6 we focused on these years as they follow the dam s impoundment and present the highest tree growth indexes twi firstly the twi values of 2001 2001 and 2002 in the site closest to the dam are located in the highest percentiles ftwi x 0 95 fig 5 a pointing to tree growth in these years as events of very low probability ptwi 1 ftwi x 0 05 secondly twi values for 2001 and 2001 in reference sites c1 and c2 are not considered of low probability only 2002 as twi values are present or overpassed in other years ptwi 0 05 fig 5 b and a 8 thirdly the precipitation and maximum air temperature at miyi station of those years are not of low probability pp 1 fp x 0 05 ptmax ftmax x 0 05 fig 5c d as twi in the reference sites reflects the influence of background climate regional climate change did not generate a sudden increase of tree growth in the reference sites therefore the sudden increase in twi in the reservoir sites in 2000 and 2001 cannot be explained by regional climate hence high twi in the years 2001 and 2001 in r1 and r2 cannot be attributed to extreme climatic conditions and therefore appear to be influenced by other factors most possibly the reservoir s impoundment it is worth noting that the high twi does not hold in time occurring as a one time pulse of high twi after impoundment at least within this short time of analysis from this perspective it appears that the simultaneous occurrence of both reservoir impoundment and exceptional regional climate conditions such as the ones of the period 2000 2002 can explain the observed increase in twi 3 3 influence of non climatic changes on vegetation growth we studied the possibility of increasing groundwater levels to explain the high twi s of the years preceding the ertan reservoir s impoundment it is improbable that the increase in twi after impoundment is due to changes in groundwater levels first of all the experimental sites are located considerably above 56 m table 1 the reservoir s elevation the hydrogeological map of sichuan province p r china http www groundwater cn depicts that both experimental and control sites are located in strata with low permeability consisting of metamorphic rocks in r1 r2 r3 and c1 or magmatic rock in c2 without faults these geologic conditions do not favour the presence of groundwater and the saturated groundwater also lacks favourable conditions to present a considerable rise in the water table diaz alcaide martinez santos 2019 sander 2007 we illustrate this assumption with the example of the guandi reservoir see fig 1 c a reservoir adjacent to the ertan reservoir and similar groundwater permeability liao and zhang 2013 investigated groundwater level change in a slope along the guandi reservoir finding that though the level of surface water of the reservoir increased 80 m after impounding the groundwater levels did not increase that quantity at approximately 100 m from the reservoir shore using the same spatial gradient of lateral increase of groundwater table from the reservoir based on the findings of liao and zhang 2013 and chen et al 2016 i e the gradient of 7 2 line ab in fig 6 a the expected rise in groundwater level in r1 due to the impoundment of the ertan dam would be of about 12 m fig 6 b 44 m below the elevation of the lowest experimental site r1 therefore it is unlikely that the change of groundwater is the reason for the high twi values after impoundment we also studied any possible difference between soil characteristics among sites however they appear to be similar in terms of per cent of sand clay and bulk density fig a 2 we referred to the class of soil qualities for crop production from the harmonized world soil database v 1 2 as shown in fig 7 rooting conditions and oxygen availability to roots in all the sites fall in class 1 with no or slight limitations to vegetation growth in terms of nutrient retention capacity site r3 and c1 are in a different class and in terms of nutrient availability only site c2 shows severe limitations to vegetation growth all sites have similar soil quality although c2 might be more affected by nutrient availability than the other sites vegetation growth in the lower reference site c1 and experimental sites r1 to r3 are all less limited by soil quality which may not sufficiently explain the difference in twi of the experimental and control sites during the period 2000 to 2002 4 discussion 4 1 physiological basis and tree growth potential responses to reservoir impoundment our results show that tree growth of yunnan pine pinus yunnanensis franch is mainly related to maximum air temperature and relative humidity during the dry season especially in may and related to p and rh in may the dry season and october of the previous year these results were found across all stations both in the reservoir and reference sites unfortunately there are no measurements for these variables in the reservoir s vicinity only in a remote station representing background climate variability conditions of high relative humidity and low maximum temperatures are indeed found in 1990 1999 2000 and 2002 which would explain the peak of tree growth during those years the high relative moisture and lower temperatures point to higher water availability both in the atmosphere and in the soil and lower drought stress for vegetation alfieri et al 2008 dodorico et al 2013 dodorico porporato 2004 trees in the hengduan mountains region suffer drought stress during the dry season before the onset of the rain brought by the monsoon fan et al 2008 the cdf analysis shows that a dry season with more moisture due to a combination of extreme climate conditions and the reservoir s impoundment could have increased soil moisture and alleviated drought stress the reduced stress reduces plant respiration and increases the carbohydrate reserves and consequently radial growth jiang et al 2017 promoting tree growth in the following season may is the last month of the dry season with the highest temperature and the lowest monthly precipitation of the year fig a 1 and after may the rainy season is synchronous to the bud and leaf expansion jiang et al 2017 what happens in this month is critical to the growth of vegetation as june marks the beginning of the growing season fan et al 2009a the impoundment of reservoirs in other regions of the world has led to an increase in atmospheric moisture and decreased temperature degu hossain 2012 iakunin et al 2018 vendrov malik 1965 wang et al 2018 the comparisons of tree growth and meteorological variables between reservoir and control sites could point to these effects after the ertan reservoir s impoundment as the differences cannot be fully explained by only background climate hence the ertan reservoir may increase moisture and reduce high temperatures that can ease tree growth stress however local data on the climatic variables is missing to explore such an effect further additionally spatial gradients of convective available potential energy air temperature specific humidity and surface evaporation have been found to extend beyond the shore of the reservoirs up to 100 kilometres in plain surfaces degu et al 2011 friedrich et al 2018 jaramillo destouni 2015b the larger water surface increases air relative humidity and decrease air temperature by increasing latent heat for evaporation degu et al 2011 vendrov malik 1965 a recent study in another reservoir in the hengduan mountains region has also found that an artificial reservoir has a cooling effect as far as two kilometres from the reservoir border during the dry season wang et al 2018 4 2 study limitations and future work although we find evidence suggesting an enhancement of tree growth by the ertan reservoir s impoundment more research is needed to prove such effect fully first of all missing local climatic data is needed to find the direct climatic implications of the impoundment of the reservoir if the local data were available before and after the dam s construction and reservoir impoundment such effects would have been more easily tested and identified a more acceptable spatial resolution of the climatic data is necessary to determine the hydrological processes driving the increase in tree growth from reservoir impoundment for example among many precipitation products the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 3b42v7 dataset with a resolution of 0 25 has the best performance of capturing precipitation in the hengduan mountains chen et al 2018 wang et al 2020 the chinese meteorological forcing cmf dataset with a resolution of 0 1 has been applied to assess the climate change in the three gorges reservoir wang et al 2019 however the spatial resolution of these datasets is not enough to isolate the effects of the reservoir we have also tried to validate tree growth pulse after impoundment with remote sensing data such as the canopy vegetation index ndvi source satellite data like landsat4 5 tm images have a more satisfactory spatial resolution of 30 m our previous research in an adjacent dry valley showed that ndvi responded to climate sensitively in may and july zhou et al 2020 however for the ertan reservoir not all the data in these months cover the pulse period due to dense clouds composite remote sensing products have a coarse spatial resolution 250 m or larger and do not cover the time before 2000 if the reservoir is contributing to the increasing tree growth during the period right after impoundment it is still to wonder why such effects are only recognisable only immediately after impoundment and not from then onwards the explanation may lie in the combination of ideal conditions of moisture availability and temperature enhancing tree growth and the reservoir s impoundment both necessary to boost tree growth as such more reservoirs and sampling sites need to be investigated to verify our findings in other reservoir sites nonetheless our study integrating dendroclimatology into the research on the hydroclimatic effects of reservoirs researchers usually lack reliable and localised climatic data to analyse many reservoirs and only a few use dendroclimatology to study the effects of reservoirs on the surrounding climate e g grelsson 1988 tremblay and begin 2000 in this sense our study proves its use to bridge the studies between hydro climatological change and vegetation dynamics 5 conclusions our results show that radial tree growth of yunnan pine surrounding the reservoir is limited by relative humidity and high air temperatures during the dry season especially in may the tree ring chronologies significantly and negatively correlated with maximum mean and minimum air temperatures and positively correlated with climate related precipitation and relative humidity in may we found a pulse of tree growth right after the ertan reservoir s impoundment that cannot be fully explained by unusual climatic conditions pointing to a possible contributing effect of the reservoir s impoundment the effect cannot be explained by increasing

297,at the local scale artificial impounded reservoirs in dry regions exert influence on the surrounding local climate impounded reservoirs have been found to alter precipitation patterns and increase temperature specific humidity and surface evaporation the consequences of impoundment or its related climatic changes on the surrounding vegetation are still not well understood we here examined the potential effect on surrounding tree growth of the impoundment of the ertan reservoir china in 1998 we measured yunnan pine tree rings at three sites on a slope close to the reservoir and two control sites far away from the reservoir we compared the annual radial growth of tree rings at all sites with air temperature precipitation and air humidity in the region we also used cumulative distribution functions to quantify the probability of attributing radial growth changes to background climate variability we find an enhancement of tree growth from 2000 to 2002 right after the reservoir s impounding in experimental and control sites hence the tree growth can initially be explained by favourable conditions benefiting tree growth however we cannot entirely attribute such enhancement to the background climate variability when studying the relationship between tree growth and climatic variables over the 36 years and their probability of occurrence tree growth in the three years following impoundment can only be attributed to the simultaneous effect of favourable regional climate conditions and the reservoir s impoundment in itself these conditions decrease vegetation stress by decreasing air temperature and increasing air relative humidity although the findings of this study shed more light on the environmental and climatic changes induced by the impoundment of reservoirs they also call for the need of monitoring climatic variables in the vicinity of reservoirs keywords hydroclimate change reservoir tree ring vegetation growth 1 introduction water flow regulation via artificial impoundment of reservoirs has expanded during the 20th century biemans et al 2011 more than 16 7 million reservoirs with surface areas larger than 100 m2 currently exist increasing the earth s terrestrial surface water area by more than 305 000 km2 lehner et al 2011 the extent of reservoir impoundment by dam construction in developing countries is expected to continue in the foreseeable future zarfl et al 2015 at the local scale artificial impounded reservoirs in dry regions influence the surrounding local climate degu et al 2011 impounded reservoirs have been found to alter precipitation patterns and air temperature increase specific humidity and surface evaporation degu et al 2011 li et al 2017 song et al 2017 vendrov malik 1965 wang et al 2018 winchester et al 2017 the hydrological basins with several of these reservoirs show a historical increase in the net evaporative ratio at the larger scale suggesting a net increase in water consumption by evaporation destouni et al 2013 jaramillo destouni 2015a 2015b wang hejazi 2011 these climatic effects have been found by analysing observational data and mesoscale modelling to evaluate the reservoirs influence on the climate observational data have included meteorological station data observational atmospheric records and satellite imagery degu et al 2011 durkee et al 2014 while modelling has included back trajectory analysis and mesoscale atmospheric modelling kunstmann knoche 2011 winchester et al 2017 woldemichael et al 2012 woldemichael et al 2014 tree ring data are also a useful proxy that archives fluctuations in ambient environmental conditions corresponding tree widths and densities have been used to understand environmental change when historical records are not available for instance tree ring data are used to track terrace uplift resulting from earthquakes jacoby 1997 jacoby ulan 1983 air pollution from industrial plants barniak krapiec 2016 juknys et al 2002 droughts cook et al 2004 woodhouse lukas 2006 and climatic effects by human activity duan et al 2017 although tree ring data may also be used to track environmental changes driven by reservoir impoundment cook 1987 duan et al 2017 this has only been marginally studied exceptions include the study of grelsson 1988 on the effect of rising groundwater table by reservoirs and that by tremblay and begin 2000 on the reaction of black spruce to the construction of an artificial reservoir the rate and efficiency of photosynthesis and respiration processes determine plant biomass growth dynamics along with local environmental conditions and nutrient requirements tkemaladze makhashvili 2016 environmental drivers affecting these rates include climate nutrient and water availability and mechanical perturbations of vegetation poorter et al 2012 furthermore vegetation growth is limited by extreme climate conditions related to air temperature precipitation and resulting drought mokria et al 2017 pichler oberhuber 2007 wu et al 2018 annual tree ring data worldwide reveals that tree growth in high and low elevations is generally more sensitive to air temperature and moisture availability respectively babst et al 2013 since reservoir impoundment has been found to affect some of these climatic parameters we hypothesise that reservoirs construction can also affect surrounding vegetation growth we aim to indetify the possible effect on the surrounding vegetation of an impounded reservoir in the yalong river basin in southwestern china the ertan reservoir was built in 1998 has a storage volume of 5 8 109 m3 and installed hydroelectric capacity of 3 3 106 kw we sampled yunnan pine tree rings and calculated annual radial growth at three sites on a slope close to the reservoir and two control sites far away from the reservoir our main objective is to determine which hydroclimatic parameters explain the observed tree growth and looking for a signal of the reservoir s impoundment on tree growth 2 materials and methods the procedure to explore the effect of the reservoir on tree growth consisted of five steps all steps focused on exploring if tree growth and their relationship to climatic conditions were different before and after impoundment firstly we compared tree ring width chronologies of the reservoir with those of the control sites secondly we compared the chronologies difference before and after the impoundment of the ertan dam in both experimental and control sites thirdly we analysed the radial growth response to hydroclimatic background parameters such as relative air humidity rh minimum mean and maximum monthly temperature tmax ta tmin respectively and precipitation p at the closest meteorological station called miyi and two other stations located further away for validation fourthly we calculated the probability of occurrence of tree growth in the specific years right after impoundment and corresponding hydroclimatic conditions based on the 36 years we hypothesise that if tree growth probability after impoundment is low and the probability of corresponding climatic conditions is not tree growth should be driven by other drivers such as the reservoir s impoundment fifth we checked based on secondary information if groundwater levels in the reservoir could explain tree growth in the experimental sites and if any difference in soil types between experimental and control sites could explain tree growth after impoundment 2 1 overview of the study area the lower yalong river basin a subbasin of the jinsha river basin is located in the hengduan mountains a set of north south oriented ranges and deeply incised gorges of parallel rivers fan et al 2009b zhang et al 2020 the elevation of the surface water level before the construction of the dam was 1050 m a s l when the reservoir was initially filled in may 1998 the surface water level oscillated in the range of 1155 to 1160 m a s l until may 1999 shu 2006 since then the water level of the reservoir has varied between 1190 and 1200 m a s l the anning river is a tributary of the yalong river li et al 2020 the ertan reservoir yalong river and anning river fig 1 are all located in a dry valley with a dry season that extends from november to may and a wet season from june to october peng et al 2012 vertical climatic gradients dominate the valleys where lower elevations are drier and have less precipitation fan et al 2009a the mean monthly climatic conditions in the meteorological station miyi can be seen in fig a 1 in this station maximum and mean annual temperatures tmax and ta and relative humidity rh have increased significantly p 0 01 for tmax and ta p 0 05 for rh t test since 1980 and annual precipitation p has fluctuated with no significant trend p 0 11 t test recent research in the area has found a sensitivity of radial growth of vegetation to air temperature and air moisture availability in the region fan et al 2009a fan et al 2008 guo et al 2009 lebek et al 2019 shi et al 2017 2 2 tree ring sampling and measurements our sampling sites were located in the lower elevations of dry valleys exhibiting sub arid climates and drought resistance shrubs lin et al 2015 to test if any influence of the reservoir s construction could be identified in the tree ring sites close to the reservoir we divided our sites and samples into two groups the first group was experimental consisting of the sites close to the reservoir and the second called the reference group consisting of two control sites located far away from the reservoir to avoid the influence of the reservoir on tree growth we selected the sampling sites so that the conditions of elevation tree species community characteristics and micro geomorphology would be as similar as possible between the experimental and reference groups besides the experimental group sites locations were chosen at different elevations along the same slope the experimental group consisted of three sites close to the reservoir r1 r2 and r3 and the reference group of two control sites c1 and c2 in the anning river valley the yalong river s tributary yunnan pine pinus yunnanensis franch was selected as the target species since it is commonly found in yunnan and the western sichuan provinces of southwestern china at elevations between 600 and 2100 m a s l tang qi 2015 furthermore we targeted this species to build upon previous research on tree growth climate relationships conducted successfully using this species shen et al 2019 shi et al 2017 yang et al 2018 numerous factors can affect tree growth including age and size climate and soil characteristics micro landforms and disturbances hence to reduce the influence of non climatic factors on tree growth we chose tree communities that resembled natural conditions and were not altered by human disturbance or extreme events such as pests or wildfires the five sites are located on north facing slopes i e north or northeast slopes table 1 to reduce any effects from microclimatologic conditions the experimental and reference sites are in valleys exhibiting distinct dry and warm climates integrated scientific expedition team to qinghai tibet plateau 1992 with drought resistant savanna and succulent thorn shrub vegetation huan cheng mcconchie 2001 we assume that the reservoir does not influence the control sites as they are far from the reservoir and in a neighbouring hydrological basin eutric cambisols are found in all sites according to the classification systems of fao unesco soil hiederer kochy 2011 and red earth by the genetic soil classification of china shi et al 2006 fig a 2 however it is worth mentioning that site c2 appears to have a different nutrient availability than in the other sites field and laboratory procedures were designed according to dendrochronology methodological standards cook kairiukstis 1990 a range of 15 to 24 trees was chosen at each site two cores of each tree were extracted to the pith at 1 3 m above ground liang et al 2015 and then mounted dried and sanded stroke smiley 1968 the tree ring widths were measured under a microscope with the lintab system and the exact date of each ring was determined by cross dating with the program cofecha holmes 1983 we constructed the tree ring width series for each site from the average of the widths of the tree cores the sample depth in a given year indicates the numbers of trees at each site which varies in time fig 2 for each site sample depth increases in its initial decades or close the pithes of trees then keeps stably followed by decrease when approaching to barks of trees 2 3 extraction of climatic signals from tree ring widths and analysis on tree growth climate relationships the tree ring width series rt was considered a linear aggregate of several subseries cook 1987 and calculated with eq 1 1 r t a t c t δ d 1 t δ d 2 t e t the subscript t denotes a specific time at is the age size related trend of the annual radius of the stem ct is the climatic signal width series d1 t accounts for endogenous disturbances e g removal of an individual tree d2 t for exogenous disturbances e g fire and insect infestations and et for largely unexplained year to year variability not related to the other signals at ct and et are always accounted for and d1 t or d2 t may be present δ 1 or absent δ 0 at is the target signal we want to obtain for this study the remaining contributions should be ideally separated and removed d1 t is caused randomly within a stand with sufficient size and an event will not influence all the trees both in space and time cook 1987 makinen vanninen 1999 et may come from the variability of soil type and moisture among trees and measurement errors which can be neglected as trees are close to each other since at indicates common variability among individuals and the endogenous and unexplained noises are reduced when increasing the sample size per site makinen vanninen 1999 d1 t and et can be reduced averaging many samples from a site we chose the yunnan pine communities with less exogenous disturbance to minimise the effect of d2 t generally the increasing trend in at which is age related exhibits an exponential like function due to fast increasing growth in juvenile individuals and slower growths for older trees becoming steady over time sanchez salguero et al 2015 since our sampling tree growth curves fit this pattern we applied a negative exponential or linear function to estimate at ct can be estimated using either the residual rt at or ratio rt at by a detrending procedure the residual method is used here in conjunction with the initial power transformation to avoid ratio bias problems cook peters 1997 on the one hand the tree growth variability is not stable over time between individuals in a site riitters 1990 the biweighted method is used to generate a dimensionless tree ring width index series twi to produce a robust mean tree ring width master chronology variance stabilisation of the chronology was performed using the rbar weighted method osborn et al 1997 we also used an index termed expressed population signal eps to estimate signal and noise between and within individual trees in a community selecting only those indices larger than 0 85 wigley et al 1984 fig 2 data on maximum average and minimum monthly temperatures tmax ta tmin respectively precipitation p and relative humidity rh since 1979 were compared to twi we decided to focus on the period 1979 to 2016 to have equal length periods before and after the ertan dam s impoundment meteorological data was collected from miyi station 1137 m a s l closest to the ertan reservoir and huaping 1231 m a s l and huili 1787 m a s l further away with miyi station located in a dry valley their elevations are similar to those of the sampling sites fig a 6 we chose these stations as they are the nearest to the reservoir although outside of its area of influence sun et al 2019 the pearson correlation was selected to assess the relationships between yunnan pine growth and the meteorological variables to determine which variables control or limit tree growth in all sites the coefficient is widely used to analyse the growth climate relationship in dendroclimatology in the region shen et al 2019 shi et al 2017 sun et al 2020 yang et al 2018 we should note that the meteorological data obtained represents background climate conditions as the stations are far from the reservoir we performed correlational analyses between twi annual and monthly and annual tmax ta tmin p and rh the correlations were also studied between twi of each year and climatic variables of october november and december of the previous year as they may influence tree growth sun et al 2020 the correlations were also evaluated for the entire dry i e from november of the previous year to may of the current year and wet season i e from june to october of the same year 2 4 quantifying the occurrence probability of radial growth and climatic factors we also analysed the cumulative distribution function cdf of the data the cumulative distribution function fx x p x x gives the probability that x takes a value less than or equal to x studying the cdfs of twi and the meteorological variables shows if any annual value of tree growth falls outside of the typical distribution during 1979 2016 pointing to the reservoir s influence on tree growth four standard distribution functions i e normal lognormal gamma and weibull were used to fit the cdf of twi and climatic variables resulting in four possible cdfs for each variable the modified kolmogorov smirnov test massey jr 1951 was conducted to test the goodness of the fit we plotted the function meeting the goodness of fit p value 0 05 and having the least root mean square deviation rmse lastly each point s vertical coordinate in the plot of fx x vs x represents the occurrence probability that the variable has a value of x 3 results 3 1 tree ring width index and its relationship with background climate the annual tree ring width chronologies along the 37 years from 1980 to 2016 i e eighteen years before and after the reservoir s construction show a mild decreasing radial tree growth trend at both reference and reservoir sites fig 3 a c nevertheless the chronologies close to the reservoir show from 2000 to 2002 a sudden increase in twi that crops out from the master chronology fig 3a c the twi peaks in 2001 and 2002 are the largest recorded in r1 and the second largest in r2 the peak is also prominent in reference site c1 although overpassed in 1981 and equalled in 1984 1990 and 1996 for the case of c2 fig 3b d hence it is not evident from the comparison of the master chronologies in experimental and control sites that the reservoir s impoundment is the only reason for increased tree growth from 2000 to 2002 furthermore it can also be arguable that the effect of the impounded reservoir on tree growth should hold in time after impoundment if the water surface provides the conditions necessary for vegetation to enhance growth we find that climatic conditions limit the twi of yunnan pine during the dry season and especially in may fig 4 a and fig a 5 tree ring chronologies correlated negatively with maximum tmax and mean monthly temperature ta in both reservoir and reference sites p 0 05 t test chronologies are also positively correlated with precipitation p and relative humidity rh in may the dry season and october of the previous year p 0 05 t test among these tmax and rh have the highest correlations with the chronologies p 0 01 t test the results of the climate growth relationship from huili and huaping agree with that of miyi station fig a 5 therefore the radial growth of these yunnan pines is generally sensitive to background climate most specifically to tmax and rh when looking at specific annual peaks in the climatic variables fig 4b c we find that regional climatic conditions in 2000 to 2002 specifically high p and rh in may and the dry season are possibly responsible for the peak in tree growth twi in 2002 2002 at both experimental and control sites fig 4 however the highest rh and p during the dry season and the lowest tmax during 1980 2016 occurred in 1990 before the dam s construction this year radial tree growth did not increase as much as during the period 2000 2002 suggesting that favourable climatic conditions such as regional low tmax in the dry season and may and high rh in may the dry season and october of the previous year cannot be the sole explanation of the sudden increase of twi during the period 2000 and 2002 3 2 occurrence probability of radial growth and climatic factors we further analysed the cumulative probability cdf to assess the probability of occurrence of the climatic conditions and tree growth in the three years following the impoundment of the dam 2000 2002 based on the time series 1979 2016 fig 5 and fig a 6 we focused on these years as they follow the dam s impoundment and present the highest tree growth indexes twi firstly the twi values of 2001 2001 and 2002 in the site closest to the dam are located in the highest percentiles ftwi x 0 95 fig 5 a pointing to tree growth in these years as events of very low probability ptwi 1 ftwi x 0 05 secondly twi values for 2001 and 2001 in reference sites c1 and c2 are not considered of low probability only 2002 as twi values are present or overpassed in other years ptwi 0 05 fig 5 b and a 8 thirdly the precipitation and maximum air temperature at miyi station of those years are not of low probability pp 1 fp x 0 05 ptmax ftmax x 0 05 fig 5c d as twi in the reference sites reflects the influence of background climate regional climate change did not generate a sudden increase of tree growth in the reference sites therefore the sudden increase in twi in the reservoir sites in 2000 and 2001 cannot be explained by regional climate hence high twi in the years 2001 and 2001 in r1 and r2 cannot be attributed to extreme climatic conditions and therefore appear to be influenced by other factors most possibly the reservoir s impoundment it is worth noting that the high twi does not hold in time occurring as a one time pulse of high twi after impoundment at least within this short time of analysis from this perspective it appears that the simultaneous occurrence of both reservoir impoundment and exceptional regional climate conditions such as the ones of the period 2000 2002 can explain the observed increase in twi 3 3 influence of non climatic changes on vegetation growth we studied the possibility of increasing groundwater levels to explain the high twi s of the years preceding the ertan reservoir s impoundment it is improbable that the increase in twi after impoundment is due to changes in groundwater levels first of all the experimental sites are located considerably above 56 m table 1 the reservoir s elevation the hydrogeological map of sichuan province p r china http www groundwater cn depicts that both experimental and control sites are located in strata with low permeability consisting of metamorphic rocks in r1 r2 r3 and c1 or magmatic rock in c2 without faults these geologic conditions do not favour the presence of groundwater and the saturated groundwater also lacks favourable conditions to present a considerable rise in the water table diaz alcaide martinez santos 2019 sander 2007 we illustrate this assumption with the example of the guandi reservoir see fig 1 c a reservoir adjacent to the ertan reservoir and similar groundwater permeability liao and zhang 2013 investigated groundwater level change in a slope along the guandi reservoir finding that though the level of surface water of the reservoir increased 80 m after impounding the groundwater levels did not increase that quantity at approximately 100 m from the reservoir shore using the same spatial gradient of lateral increase of groundwater table from the reservoir based on the findings of liao and zhang 2013 and chen et al 2016 i e the gradient of 7 2 line ab in fig 6 a the expected rise in groundwater level in r1 due to the impoundment of the ertan dam would be of about 12 m fig 6 b 44 m below the elevation of the lowest experimental site r1 therefore it is unlikely that the change of groundwater is the reason for the high twi values after impoundment we also studied any possible difference between soil characteristics among sites however they appear to be similar in terms of per cent of sand clay and bulk density fig a 2 we referred to the class of soil qualities for crop production from the harmonized world soil database v 1 2 as shown in fig 7 rooting conditions and oxygen availability to roots in all the sites fall in class 1 with no or slight limitations to vegetation growth in terms of nutrient retention capacity site r3 and c1 are in a different class and in terms of nutrient availability only site c2 shows severe limitations to vegetation growth all sites have similar soil quality although c2 might be more affected by nutrient availability than the other sites vegetation growth in the lower reference site c1 and experimental sites r1 to r3 are all less limited by soil quality which may not sufficiently explain the difference in twi of the experimental and control sites during the period 2000 to 2002 4 discussion 4 1 physiological basis and tree growth potential responses to reservoir impoundment our results show that tree growth of yunnan pine pinus yunnanensis franch is mainly related to maximum air temperature and relative humidity during the dry season especially in may and related to p and rh in may the dry season and october of the previous year these results were found across all stations both in the reservoir and reference sites unfortunately there are no measurements for these variables in the reservoir s vicinity only in a remote station representing background climate variability conditions of high relative humidity and low maximum temperatures are indeed found in 1990 1999 2000 and 2002 which would explain the peak of tree growth during those years the high relative moisture and lower temperatures point to higher water availability both in the atmosphere and in the soil and lower drought stress for vegetation alfieri et al 2008 dodorico et al 2013 dodorico porporato 2004 trees in the hengduan mountains region suffer drought stress during the dry season before the onset of the rain brought by the monsoon fan et al 2008 the cdf analysis shows that a dry season with more moisture due to a combination of extreme climate conditions and the reservoir s impoundment could have increased soil moisture and alleviated drought stress the reduced stress reduces plant respiration and increases the carbohydrate reserves and consequently radial growth jiang et al 2017 promoting tree growth in the following season may is the last month of the dry season with the highest temperature and the lowest monthly precipitation of the year fig a 1 and after may the rainy season is synchronous to the bud and leaf expansion jiang et al 2017 what happens in this month is critical to the growth of vegetation as june marks the beginning of the growing season fan et al 2009a the impoundment of reservoirs in other regions of the world has led to an increase in atmospheric moisture and decreased temperature degu hossain 2012 iakunin et al 2018 vendrov malik 1965 wang et al 2018 the comparisons of tree growth and meteorological variables between reservoir and control sites could point to these effects after the ertan reservoir s impoundment as the differences cannot be fully explained by only background climate hence the ertan reservoir may increase moisture and reduce high temperatures that can ease tree growth stress however local data on the climatic variables is missing to explore such an effect further additionally spatial gradients of convective available potential energy air temperature specific humidity and surface evaporation have been found to extend beyond the shore of the reservoirs up to 100 kilometres in plain surfaces degu et al 2011 friedrich et al 2018 jaramillo destouni 2015b the larger water surface increases air relative humidity and decrease air temperature by increasing latent heat for evaporation degu et al 2011 vendrov malik 1965 a recent study in another reservoir in the hengduan mountains region has also found that an artificial reservoir has a cooling effect as far as two kilometres from the reservoir border during the dry season wang et al 2018 4 2 study limitations and future work although we find evidence suggesting an enhancement of tree growth by the ertan reservoir s impoundment more research is needed to prove such effect fully first of all missing local climatic data is needed to find the direct climatic implications of the impoundment of the reservoir if the local data were available before and after the dam s construction and reservoir impoundment such effects would have been more easily tested and identified a more acceptable spatial resolution of the climatic data is necessary to determine the hydrological processes driving the increase in tree growth from reservoir impoundment for example among many precipitation products the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 3b42v7 dataset with a resolution of 0 25 has the best performance of capturing precipitation in the hengduan mountains chen et al 2018 wang et al 2020 the chinese meteorological forcing cmf dataset with a resolution of 0 1 has been applied to assess the climate change in the three gorges reservoir wang et al 2019 however the spatial resolution of these datasets is not enough to isolate the effects of the reservoir we have also tried to validate tree growth pulse after impoundment with remote sensing data such as the canopy vegetation index ndvi source satellite data like landsat4 5 tm images have a more satisfactory spatial resolution of 30 m our previous research in an adjacent dry valley showed that ndvi responded to climate sensitively in may and july zhou et al 2020 however for the ertan reservoir not all the data in these months cover the pulse period due to dense clouds composite remote sensing products have a coarse spatial resolution 250 m or larger and do not cover the time before 2000 if the reservoir is contributing to the increasing tree growth during the period right after impoundment it is still to wonder why such effects are only recognisable only immediately after impoundment and not from then onwards the explanation may lie in the combination of ideal conditions of moisture availability and temperature enhancing tree growth and the reservoir s impoundment both necessary to boost tree growth as such more reservoirs and sampling sites need to be investigated to verify our findings in other reservoir sites nonetheless our study integrating dendroclimatology into the research on the hydroclimatic effects of reservoirs researchers usually lack reliable and localised climatic data to analyse many reservoirs and only a few use dendroclimatology to study the effects of reservoirs on the surrounding climate e g grelsson 1988 tremblay and begin 2000 in this sense our study proves its use to bridge the studies between hydro climatological change and vegetation dynamics 5 conclusions our results show that radial tree growth of yunnan pine surrounding the reservoir is limited by relative humidity and high air temperatures during the dry season especially in may the tree ring chronologies significantly and negatively correlated with maximum mean and minimum air temperatures and positively correlated with climate related precipitation and relative humidity in may we found a pulse of tree growth right after the ertan reservoir s impoundment that cannot be fully explained by unusual climatic conditions pointing to a possible contributing effect of the reservoir s impoundment the effect cannot be explained by increasing

298,assessing the impacts of climate change on hydrologic regimes through hydrologic modeling is challenged by data uncertainty predictor selection uncertainty and model uncertainty as well as their interrelationships in this study a multi level factorial ensemble data driven hydrological model mfedhm is developed to quantify the interactive individual and integrative impacts of multiple boundary conditions e g climate conditions on hydrological processes and revealing the spatial heterogeneity of these impacts under various uncertainties and non predictor impacts in the mfedhm multi level factorial analysis is integrated with ensemble prediction i e bayesian model averaging and data driven hydrological model the mfedhm is applied to quantitatively analyze the rainfall runoff relationships of 16 catchments over china results reveal that the multilevel factorial analysis can accurately reveal both individual and interactive impacts of climate variables on hydrologic processes and the impacts of non climatic factors as the most important finding of this study climate change impacts on hydrology show significant spatial heterogeneities over china for instance contemporaneous climatic conditions dominate 57 64 runoff changes and variations in southern china while precedent climate conditions pose significant impacts 20 67 on runoffs in northern china the overall influence of non predictor factors anthropogenic on runoffs may decrease by 0 07 for the catchment area increment of 10000 km2 and ranges from 4 to 27 over china the development of the mfedhm can enhance the reliability of ensemble hydrologic prediction and provide scientific support for climate change impacts assessment and adaptation under complexities keywords ensemble hydrological prediction multi level factorial analysis climate change spatial heterogeneity china 1 introduction for the temporal dynamics of a hydrological or any other natural societal system one driver is that of a series of influencing factors e g precipitation temperature soil moisture catchment topography and landscape structure for hydrological processes anderton et al 2002 schöpfer et al 2007 in the corresponding hydrological modeling studies bermúdez 2017 decharme et al 2013 pappenberger et al 2006 witono and bruckler 1989 these factors are usually defined as boundary conditions and the hydro system feature e g surface runoffs around catchment outlets varying with them is represented as a response or dependent variable meanwhile boundary conditions are spatially heterogeneous especially for large scale hydrological systems quantitative analyses of the impacts of boundary conditions abbreviated as boundary impacts in this study of spatiotemporal variability on hydrological regimes at a range of watershed scales are crucial for developing reliable data driven hydrological model bermúdez et al 2017 previously a series of approaches were proposed to model the boundary impacts in hydrological systems qualitatively or quantitatively bermúdez 2017 jiang 2011 pappenberger et al 2006 among them data driven hydrological modeling through statistics machine learning or other data driven methods cheng 2017 saft et al 2015 examined the variation of a response variable with a combination of boundary conditions without massive computations in physically based modeling fan 2015 a comparison of the modeling results for different combinations built a foundation for quantifying boundary impacts especially the overall or individual impacts of multiple boundary conditions wang et al 2017 for instance pappenberger et al 2006 evaluated the sensitivity of flood inundation predictions to the uncertainty of upstream boundary conditions through glue saft et al 2015 revealed the impact of multiyear droughts on annual rainfall runoff relationships through an analysis of standardized regression coefficients in a linear model bermúdez 2017 highlighted the impacts of rainfall dynamics and uncertain boundary conditions on floods based on a regional simplified physics hydraulic model evans et al 2018 explored the subsurface moisture and flow responses to seasonally and annually varying boundary conditions more recently yan et al 2019 identified the impacts of topography climate land cover and soil on runoffs through machine learning e g random forest gradient boosting and stacking and linear regression quantifying boundary impacts i e the impacts of climatic conditions and other boundary conditions on runoffs based on the aforementioned data driven models has been attempted through various post modeling analyses e g using importance metrics linear correlations or model parameters coefficients in many previous studies bermúdez 2017 decharme et al 2013 pappenberger et al 2006 wang et al 2021a witono and bruckler 1989 however the reliability of these studies is challenged by several complexities in hydrological boundary impact analyses specifically data uncertainty predictor selection uncertainty and model uncertainty may pose significant impacts on data driven hydrological modeling accuracies and results meanwhile it is hardly achievable to represent all boundary conditions of a hydrological system as predictors of a data driven hydrological model due to data limitation but ignoring the non predictor boundary conditions may lead to overestimation of predictor impacts besides most of previous studies focus on the individual or integrative impacts of multiple boundary conditions and merely analyze the interactive impacts of them that widely exist in hydrological systems garcía 2019 wang and huang 2015 moreover few studies are conducted to explore the spatial heterogeneity of the interactive individual and integrative impacts of multiple boundary conditions on hydrological regimes under the uncertainties and non predictor impacts for instance mockler et al 2016 assessed the importance of interactions between parameter and forcing i e precipitation in conceptual hydrological model simulations ali et al 2012 reported the influence of topographic pedologic and climatic interactions on streamflow generation at multiple catchment scales berghuijs et al 2019 assessed the relative importance of precipitation snowmelt and soil moisture excess on flooding and displayed the spatial pattern of them for the 3 777 catchments in europe brunner et al 2019 reported that the spatially heterogeneous of dependence between peak discharge and flood volume can be explained by an interplay of changes in precipitation snowmelt and soil moisture therefore the objective of this study is to develop a multi level factorial ensemble data driven hydrological model mfedhm for quantifying the interactive individual and integrative impacts of multiple boundary conditions e g climate conditions on hydrological processes and revealing the spatial heterogeneity of these impacts under various uncertainties and non predictor impacts in the mfedhm multi level factorial analysis correlation analysis and data driven methods are integrated with ensemble data driven hydrological model specifically i on the basis of correlation based predictor selection an ensemble data driven hydrological model is built through the integration of multiple data driven methods by bayesian model averaging ii multilevel factorial analysis is applied to quantify the interactive individual and integrative impacts of boundary conditions through rigorous statistical inferences based on the ensemble model iii as an extension of ii the spatial heterogeneity of boundary impacts is examined through a series of post modeling analyses to demonstrate and verify methodological reliability the mfedhm is applied to quantitatively analyze the boundary impacts in the rainfall runoff relationships of 16 catchments over china under the aforementioned complexities 2 multi level factorial ensemble hydrological model the impacts of boundary conditions e g precipitation and temperature on hydrological responses e g surface runoffs are temporally defined as boundary impacts in this study to diagnose and quantify the boundary impacts in hydrological systems an advanced method i e mfedhm multi level factorial ensemble data driven hydrological model is developed in this study as shown in fig 1 the mfedhm mainly consists of four modules module 1 screen out the predictors for hydrological modeling i e the data available boundary conditions of potentially significant impacts on runoffs based on data processing and correlation analyses module 2 establish hydrological models to reproduce the relationships between the boundary conditions and runoffs using various data based methods module 3 integrate the diverse advantages of these models through bayesian model averaging to enhance hydro modeling accuracies under model uncertainty resulting in an ensemble data driven hydrological model module 4 quantify the interactive individual and integrative impacts of the boundary conditions through multilevel factorial analyses of the ensemble data driven hydrological model and explore the spatial heterogeneity of these impacts by cross comparisons the representative advantage of the mfedhm is that based on the integration of multiple advanced hydro system analysis methods it can quantify the interactive individual and integrative impacts of multiple boundary conditions e g climate conditions on hydrological processes and reveal the spatial heterogeneity of these impacts under various uncertainties and non predictor impacts module 1 aims to identify the main hydro model predictors by dimension reduction methods many natural or societal factors are influencing streamflow and most of them are related to geographic and climatic conditions previous studies have demonstrated that precipitation posed great effects on both short and long term streamflow temperature e g daily maximum and minimum potential evapotranspiration and relative humidity have also been applied as predictors in streamflow forecasting fan 2015 moreover antecedent climate conditions have been used to represent initial catchment conditions therefore a number of climate variables e g the aforementioned ones in both current and lead months are optional for being the predictors of hydrological modeling the number could be very large and may lead to heavy computational burden in hydrological modeling especially at large scales and high resolutions to address this challenge in module 1 of mfedhm correlation analysis partial correlation analysis principal component analysis or other dimension reduction methods are employed to screen out significant predictors and reduce computational complexities for subsequent hydrological modeling analysis and prediction studies the purpose of module 2 is to build multiple data driven hydrological models various data driven methods are available for hydrological modeling devia et al 2015 solomatine and ostfeld 2008 module 2 of mfedhm focuses on development of multiple data driven for simulating the relationships between boundary conditions e g rainfall evaporation and temperature and streamflow under method uncertainty although the framework of mfedhm is adaptive to both approaches numerous data driven hydrological modeling methods such as statistical regression artificial intelligence and machine learning have been proven to be effective in streamflow modeling and forecasting due to easy and quick calibration ordieres meré et al 2020 solomatine and ostfeld 2008 in the subsequent case study multiple linear regression mlr holder 1985 support vector machine svm han et al 2007 stepwise linear regression steplm and random forest rf yan et al 2019 are employed for hydrological modeling using r packages e1071 and random forest the goal of module 3 is to ensemble the data driven hydrological models by bayesian model averaging multi model ensemble strategies have been proven useful for addressing model uncertainty and maximizing hydro model performances bohn et al 2010 to develop reliable ensemble hydrologic predictions a bayesian model averaging bma scheme is applied to exploit the diversity of skillful predictions and integrate the advantages of different hydrological models duan et al 2007 the bma is a statistical procedure that infers consensus predictions by weighing individual predictions based on their probabilistic likelihood measures specifically the hydrological model of higher accuracies is given higher weights than that of lower ones duan et al 2007 a brief synopsis of the bma approach is provided in the supporting information and methodological details are presented in duan et al 2019 module 4 aims to quantify boundary impacts by multi level factorial the ensemble data driven hydrological model is a large scale black box model of overcomplicated structures equations parameters and stochastics it is hardly achievable to identify the complex impacts of boundary conditions on model outputs e g runoff simulation results through theoretical derivation of linear regression or other simple models to address this issue multi level factorial analysis mfa is incorporated into mfedhm for quantifying the interactive individual and integrative impacts of multiple boundary conditions in the ensemble data driven hydrological model particularly the quantification of the interactive impacts under data uncertainty is achieved through rigorous statistical inferences which is the most representative advantage of mfa over the other sensitivity analysis methods wang et al 2020 duan et al 2020 from perspective of the mfedhm mfa can specify significant boundary conditions and their relationships under data uncertainty advance the in depth understanding of the corresponding hydro system complexities and enhance the reliability of data driven hydrological model and the relevant water resources management practices a detailed introduction about mfa is provided in the supporting information 3 case study rainfall runoff modeling over china with about 20 of the world s population and only 5 to 7 of global freshwater resources qiu 2010 china is heading towards water crises controlled by summer and winter monsoon precipitation patterns vary considerably from season to season for example scarce precipitation is observed mainly in spring and autumn zhang et al 2008 precipitation patterns also show significant spatial heterogeneity over china due to the vast national territorial area complicated topography and variable climate zhai et al 2005 thus the impacts of climate change on runoffs vary with regions and seasons chen 2014 la torre torres et al 2011 liu et al 2014 the river distribution annual precipitation mean annual temperature and population density over china are presented in fig s1 meanwhile the tempo spatial heterogeneity of these impacts for single or few watersheds has been reported in a few of previous studies shi et al 2013 for instance zhang 2011 found linear relationships between the cumulative departure values of precipitation and streamflow in the yellow river the yangtze river and the pearl river basins however the impacts over the whole country are merely explored wang et al 2013 without a systematic understanding of climate change impacts hydrological modeling and forecasting results are hardly reliable and may threaten sustainable socio economic development and eco environmental conservation over china sharma et al 2018 to address this issue the mfehm is applied to gain insights into the rainfall runoff relationships over china and their complexities monthly streamflow observations over china are collected from the global runoff data base www bafg de this dataset contains 33 chinese hydrological stations with different time lengths and data quality subsequently we select 16 stations for which 1 the length of data series is more than 30 years 2 runoff data have the same time period and 3 runoff data have no missing values for the selected period the information of these stations is shown in table 1 and fig 2 the period from 1955 to 1984 is chosen because streamflow in china has been greatly altered by human activities such as dam construction urbanization and land use changes since 1990s gou 2020 due to data availability limitation this study does not cover rivers in western china daily climate data e g daily precipitation and daily temperature are obtained from china meteorological data service center data cma cn to unify the temporal scales of climatic and hydrological data daily climate data are upscaled as monthly details of upscaling processes in the supporting information for instance the average daily precipitation of each month is defined as the mean precipitation i e p of the month the fundamental statistical characteristics of precipitation and streamflow are provided in table 1 and monthly distributions of them are shown in fig s2 the mfedhm is customized in several aspects as shown in fig 3 for systematically analyzing the rainfall runoff relationships over china first the distributions of nine climate variables are tested in data preprocessing the correlations between these variables and runoffs are analyzed to identify significant predictors for hydrological modeling second four statistical models i e linear regression support vector machine stepwise linear regression and random forest are built to simulate rainfall runoff relationships third bma is used for integrating the results of these data driven hydrological models fourth the interactive individual and integrative impacts of climate predictors on runoffs over china are analyzed quantitatively on the basis of ensemble data driven hydrological model percentile sampling and multilevel factorial analysis the spatial heterogeneity of these impacts is investigated by cross comparisons the former 25 years 1955 1979 and the remaining 5 years 1980 1984 are used as hydro model calibration and verification periods respectively the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 is used to evaluate the performances of hydrological models 1 n s e 1 i 1 n q o b s i q s i m i 2 i 1 n q o b s i q s i m i 2 where n is the total number of hydroclimate observations q obs i is the observed flow rate at the ith month q sim i is the simulated flow rate at the ith month q o b s is the mean of all streamflow observations 4 rainfall runoff correlations over china fig 4 presents the correlation matrix of nine monthly climate variables precipitation p air pressure ap wind speed wd mean temperature mt vapour pressure vp mean relative humidity mrh min temperature it max temperature at and min relative humidity irh over china it can be found that the correlations between different pairs of predictors vary significantly for instance three temperature related variables i e mt it and at present significant positive correlations for all stations so mt can be used to represent all of them besides the pairs of mt vp vp it and vp at also show strong stable p 0 05 correlations i e r 0 80 while some others e g ap and the other variables show strong stable p 0 05 negative correlations i e r 0 80 the correlation matrix of the climate variables among three months has similar patterns fig s4 what s more it is shown that the correlation between climate variables weakens with increasing intervals the pearson correlation coefficient expressed as r is used to quantify the degree of linear correlation between any pair of the climate variables the larger the absolute value of r the stronger the correlation is in addition the significance of r is represented as the p value of the correlation analysis generally p 0 05 means r is not statistically significant p 0 05 means low statistical significance and p 0 01 means high statistical significance the correlations between the climate variables and runoffs are shown in table 2 and table s1 and the corresponding p values are shown in table s2 according to these results rainfall runoff correlations decrease with the increase in lead months table 2 the correlation of contemporaneous wd and irh is not statistically significant for many hydrological stations ap shows negative correlations with runoffs while the remaining climate variables are positively correlated with runoffs besides rainfall runoff correlations vary with hydrological stations for instance there is a strong correlation between ap and runoffs the absolute r is large than 0 7 at stations 3 8 and 12 while a weak correlation exists between ap and runoffs the absolute r is less than 0 3 at stations 2 and 4 rainfall runoff correlations at stations 2 8 and 12 are stronger than those at the other stations low correlations can be used to eliminate insignificant climate conditions and reduce hydro modeling computational costs in detail 27 climate variables table s5 are used as the predictors in the subsequent hydrological modeling 5 ensemble data driven hydrological modeling fig 5 presents the verification results of five data driven hydrological models for 16 watersheds over china the prediction performance of bma is superior to any single model which is consistent with previous studies duan et al 2007 huo et al 2019 comparisons of different models during calibration and validation are provided in the supporting material the bma models have good performances nse ranges from 0 90 to 0 98 during calibration which means that the statistical relationship between climate factors and runoff during 1955 1979 is well captured while for validation period the nse of bma models ranges from 8 39 to 0 91 such a difference illustrates the spatial heterogeneity of climatic impacts on runoffs over china which may be attributable to underlying surface e g basin areas vegetation coverage and soil types and human activities e g dam water storage and irrigation water intake chen 2014 jiang 2011 shi et al 2013 it is worth noting that all models have very poor verification performances e g nse from 8 46 to 0 35 for northeast china i e stations 10 13 14 and 15 as shown in formula 1 the negative nse indicates that the simulated streamflow are far from the observations the simulated streamflows are determined by the established linear or non linear statistical function with observed climatic such poor predictive performance and performance differences between two periods i e calibration and validation indicate that the linear or non linear statistical relationship established based on observations from 1955 1979 is not applicable to that of 1980 1984 in watersheds in other words the significant differences of nses between calibration and validation periods fig s5 reflect the nonstationary of rainfall runoff relationships especially in northeast china a linear relationship r2 0 54 between calibration and validation nses is found for bma fig s7 such a relationship indicates that bma is more reliable in modeling nonstationary rainfall runoff relationships than a single data driven hydrological model in the following studies bma is used to simulate and analyze the rainfall runoff relationships over china for the total 30 years fig 6 presents the contribution of predictor combinations to bma modeling performances a general phenomenon is that more predictors result in better bma performances to identify significant predictors minimize the number of predictors and maximize bma model performances the individual main and interactive effects of two factors i e predictors diversity and lead time for each station are analyzed by multilevel factorial analyses as shown in fig 6 b the main effect of both factors varies with stations that of lead time is larger than 50 for ten stations and that of predictor diversity is larger than 50 for one station besides the interaction effect between both factors is larger than 50 for one sation the average main effect of the two factors are 18 and 52 respectively while the average interaction effect between them is 29 these results imply that the influence of antecedent climatic conditions is more significant than that of predictor diversity on runoffs for most stations therefore in the case of limited data it is meaningful and necessary to consider the influence of antecedent climatic conditions in consideration of the performances of bma and the principle of as few predictors as possible the predictors of hydrological models are p daily mean precipitation mt daily mean temperature and vp daily mean vapor pressure for the current and lead one months 6 ensemble model residual analyses to investigate the seasonality of ensemble data driven hydrological modeling the seasonal differences of bma model performances are analyzed fig 7 presents the performance of bma models in different seasons according to nse the performance of bma varies with seasons e g the best for the whole year and the worst in winter the residuals of bma models obey normal distributions fig s8 according to the normality test results table s5 statistical characteristics of residuals for different seasons are shown in table 3 the distribution of simulation residuals at the same station varies significantly with seasons for example the mean of residual distribution fluctuates from 0 08 to 0 80 in summer with an average of 0 24 while that varies from 0 65 to 0 27 in winter with an average of 0 11 this means the model overestimates summer runoffs and underestimates winter runoffs meanwhile the variance of the normal distribution varies from 0 17 to 10 37 in summer with a mean value of 2 95 and that varies from 0 03 to 3 56 in winter with a mean value of 0 88 such results indicate that the uncertainty of the model in summer is higher than that in winter moreover the normal distribution is negatively skewed in summer the different residual distributions in four seasons indicate that the simulation error may be related to the predictors in contrast most previous studies assume the model residuals follow the same distribution and fail to consider such a relationship assuming the same distribution for model residuals increases winter simulation residuals and reduces summer simulation residuals thus the variation of model residuals with seasons and climatic conditions should be taken into account in hydrological modeling and the resulting boundary impact analyses 7 climatic impacts on runoffs over china the individual and interactive impacts of climatic conditions on runoffs for the 16 watersheds over china are quantified by mfa fig 8 presents these impacts results show that climate conditions are dominating i e 73 96 runoff changes and variations over china for instance precipitation i e 1 49 with a mean value of 12 and evaporation 1 46 with a mean value of 18 directly affect the formation and changes of runoffs as the most important finding of this study climate change impacts on hydrology show significant spatial heterogeneities over china for instance contemporaneous climatic conditions dominate 57 64 runoff changes and variations in southern china stations 3 5 6 and 9 while precedent climate conditions pose significant impacts 20 67 with a mean value of 38 on runoffs in northern china stations 10 13 16 the main effect of each climate factor on runoffs varies greatly with watersheds and lead months local climate is the main influencing factor of runoff changes in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and the pearl river delta in south china in the middle reaches of the yellow river and the songhua river in north china antecedent climate conditions have a great influence on runoffs as shown in figs 8 and s10 local precipitation in the current month and one month in advance contributes 28 to the runoff change over the yellow river basin while its contribution decreases to 12 over the yangtze river runoff is affected by the total amount intensity duration and spatial distribution of precipitation yu et al 2020 higher rainfall intensity results in higher rates of infiltration excess runoffs and short term heavy rainfall often results in flooding in terms of evaporation runoff is mainly controlled by air saturated vapor pressure and wind speeds that directly affect evaporation intensity other climate factors such as temperature wind and humidity often affect river runoffs through precipitation and evaporation mfa is compared with a commonly used method i e correlation analysis in quantifying the complex impacts of climate changes on runoffs as shown in fig s9 correlation analysis ca cannot reveal which climate factors contribute more to runoffs and whether there are interactions between climate factors for instance two predictors e g mt and vp that are of same correlations with runoffs may have very different contributions on runoffs fig 8 the correlation between climate factors and runoffs does not reflect the magnitude of climatic impacts on runoffs on one hand ca indicates the consistency of the changing trends of two variables which includes cause and effect relationships and others correlation is not causality on the other hand ca represents the individual impact of one climate factor on runoffs but cannot eliminate the collinearity of multiple cli mate factors lastly ca relies on available data and cannot reflect the impacts of anthropogenic factors instead mfa can overcome the limitations of ca particularly mfa can comprehensively quantify the individual interactive and integrative impacts of climatic conditions on runoffs under various uncertainties anthropogenic impacts and spatial heterogeneity as shown in fig 9 the influence of local precipitation on runoffs decreases r2 0 52 with catchment areas a significant non linear relationship and the influence of temperature increases r2 0 44 with catchment areas a significant linear relationship these results can be explained by the hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration plant transpiration and snow melting previous studies have shown that the dominant factors of runoff characteristics such as flooding have spatial differences and that the sensitivity of streamflow with precipitation changes increases with catchment dryness berghuijs et al 2019 brunner et al 2019 which are consistent with this study it should be noted that the climate data used in this study represent the local climate around hydrological stations the results can only reflect the contribution of local climate to runoffs and watershed scale climate impacts will be studied in the future the unit change of one climate factor may result in the linear or nonlinear change of runoff and the resulting change rely on or interact with another or several other climate factors such an interactive effect is named as the interactive impact of the two climate factors on runoff this effect widely exists in highly complicated systems e g a large scale hydrological system that nonlinearly dynamically varies with various climatic and the other factors according to the mfa results as shown in fig 8 climate factors present significant interactions 4 19 with a mean value of 9 in driving the changes of runoffs over china especially the interactions of two climate factors 3 16 with a mean value of 7 the interactions decrease gradually with the number of climate factors 8 anthropogenic impacts on runoffs over china mfa has been used to quantify the sensitivities of model parameters wang et al 2021b wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 and this study is the first attempt to use it in quantifying the impacts of boundary conditions of a model i e the ensemble hydrological model in this study the similarity of both approaches is that they are achieved through mfa of the modeling results one difference is that model errors representing the impacts of non predictor factors especially human activities on runoffs in this case study are ignored in the former approach however no model can fully reproduce the complicated impacts of climatic anthropogenic and other factors on runoffs due to the limitations of data quality model structures system understandings and cognitive deficiencies chen 2014 in other words model errors are ubiquitous and inevitable climatic impacts would be overestimated and may mislead water resources management if model errors are not involved in mfa this points out the necessity of applying mfa to boundary impact analyses based on error involved hydrological modeling fig 9 presents the change of anthropogenic impacts on streamflow with catchment areas there is a significant p 0 01 linear relationship r2 0 44 between anthropogenic impacts and catchment areas this linear relationship also implies the overall influence of non predictor factors on runoffs decreases by 0 07 for the catchment area increment of 10000 km2 and ranges from 4 to 27 over china besides as shown in fig s11 a negative linear relationship exists between anthropogenic impacts and hydro model accuracies i e nse which verifies the tradeoff between climatic and anthropogenic impacts on runoffs namely a rainfall runoff model and its error reflect the impacts of dominant climate factors as predictors and non predictor factors e g other climate factors underlying surface and human activities on streamflow 9 discussion to quantify the interactive individual and integrative impacts of multiple boundary conditions in the ensemble data driven hydrological model mfa is incorporated into mfedhm in this study the quantification of such impacts under data uncertainty is achieved through rigorous statistical inferences which is the most representative advantage of mfa over the other sensitivity analysis methods fan et al 2020 in addition mfa has the advantage of analyzing the latent interactions of numerical variables e g lead months in fig 6 and non numerical variables e g climatic condition selections in fig 6 as well as their impacts on the modeling response moreover the contribution of error can also be calculated through mfa based on the above benefits mfa has been used widely in many fields such as water resources management wang and huang 2015 wang et al 2016 hydrological model parameters uncertainties zhang et al 2016 water quality management liu 2017 physical schemes screen in regional climate models song et al 2020 and statistical preprocessing of data assimilation experiments wang et al 2018 wang et al 2017 it should be noted that for these complex models without expression equation e g physically based hydrological model or data driven model without expression equation the assumption of applying factorial analysis is that the research system is linear in this study multiple linear regression i e a linear model with expression equation stepwise linear regression i e a linear model with expression equation support vector machine i e a non linear model without expression equation and random forest i e a non linear model without expression equation are used to establish hydrological models to reproduce the relationships between the boundary conditions and runoffs to integrate the diverse advantages of these models bayesian model averaging is applied to enhance hydro modeling accuracies under model uncertainty resulting in an ensemble hydrological model this ensemble hydrological model is a complex non linear model without expression equation the influences of boundary conditions i e model input and their interaction on model forecasting performance are unclear to uncover these influences roughly mfa is applied here under linear assumption the mfa is capable of detecting the curvature in the factor response relationship while it is impossible to reflect such a nonlinear effect with the two level factorial design due to its assumption of linearity over the range of factor levels wang and huang 2015 thus the main effect and interaction effect of multiple boundary conditions on hydrological processes are quantified which can provide insights maybe roughly for advancing the understanding of the ensemble hydrological prediction process to quantify the impact of the predictors to the response variables another strategy could be applying mfa directly to the data i e to the models inputs which is theoretically more straightforward according to montgomery 2017 all possible combinations of the levels of the factors are investigated in each complete trial of a factorial design experiment for example if there are 3 levels i e low medial and high of the six climatic conditions respectively as shown in fig 8 each trial should contain 3 6 729 combinations actually such ideal combinations or the responses of all combinations are hardly to be obtained in the observations especially for climate hydrological system to overcome the lack of all combinations or responses ensemble data driven hydrologic model is built here then the responses of all possible combinations of the levels of the factors can be obtained through the built ensamble model and mfa can be applied to quantify the impact of the predictors to the response variables this maybe one of the benefits of applying mfa on the ensemble data driven hydrology models finally it is worth mentioning that some statements currently included in this manuscript might be different to some extent if it is based on the application of mfa to the observations 10 conclusions the objective of this study was the development of a multi level factorial ensemble data driven hydrological model mfedhm for quantifying the impacts of multiple boundary conditions e g climate conditions on hydrological processes in the mfedhm multi level factorial analysis correlation analysis and data driven methods were integrated with ensemble hydrological modeling the representative advantage of the mfedhm was that based on the integration of multiple advanced hydro system analysis methods it could quantify the interactive individual and integrative impacts of multiple boundary conditions on hydrological processes and reveal the spatial heterogeneity of these impacts under various uncertainties the mfedhm was applied to quantitatively analyze the rainfall runoff relationships of 16 catchments over china results revealed that the errors of ensemble data driven hydrologic modeling mainly originating from anthropogenic impacts on runoffs varied with predictor selections and seasons the statistical inference and factorial analysis revealed the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of rainfall runoff response in china especially the non stationarity of rainfall runoff relationships in northeast china based on the results of applying mfa on the ensemble data driven model the influence of antecedent climatic conditions 52 was more significant than that of the predictor diversity 18 in current month besides climate conditions may dominate 86 runoff changes and variations over china for instance local precipitation 12 and evaporation 18 were more likely to affect the formation and changes of runoffs directly the multi level combined effects of climate predictors were unignorable 9 moreover climate change impacts on hydrology showed significant spatial heterogeneities over china for instance contemporaneous climatic conditions were more likely to dominate 57 64 runoff changes and variations in southern china while precedent climate conditions posed significant impacts 20 67 on runoffs in northern china apart these climate factors the contribution of non predictor factors e g other climate factors underlying surface human activities etc on streamflow was around 4 27 over china the main innovation of this research is the application of multi level factorial analysis in ensemble data driven hydrological model for quantifying the interactive individual and integrative impacts of multiple boundary conditions on hydrological processes and revealing the spatial heterogeneity of these impacts as the most important finding of this study the overall influence of temperature on runoffs may increase by 0 11 for the catchment area increment of 10 000 km2 over china while that of non predictor factors may decrease by 0 07 besides a series of extensions improvements or applications can be conducted in the future studies based on this study for instance the meteorological data used in this study are station data which is closest to the hydrological station studied so the results can only reflect the contribution of local climate factors to station runoff the results may be different for the whole watershed which will be further studied in the following work as mentioned the application of mfa in complex models without expression equation has a linear assumption the influence of this assumption on the results needs to be further explored moreover the influences of dataset accuracy geographical conditions topography vegetation human activities and other potential factors on rainfall runoff responses will be explored although the proposed model has been applied to 16 watersheds in china including semi arid semi humid and humid basins results presented in this paper may updated as more datasets cases become available and included our analysis can be strengthened by focusing on more catchments where more data are available an obvious future step will also be the inclusion of the global catchments rather than just in

298,assessing the impacts of climate change on hydrologic regimes through hydrologic modeling is challenged by data uncertainty predictor selection uncertainty and model uncertainty as well as their interrelationships in this study a multi level factorial ensemble data driven hydrological model mfedhm is developed to quantify the interactive individual and integrative impacts of multiple boundary

factorial analysis is integrated with ensemble prediction i e bayesian model averaging and data driven hydrological model the mfedhm is applied to quantitatively analyze the rainfall runoff relationships of 16 catchments over china results reveal that the multilevel factorial analysis can accurately reveal both individual and interactive impacts of climate variables on hydrologic processes and the impacts of non climatic factors as the most important finding of this study climate change impacts on hydrology show significant spatial heterogeneities over china for instance contemporaneous climatic conditions dominate 57 64 runoff changes and variations in southern china while precedent climate conditions pose significant impacts 20 67 on runoffs in northern china the overall influence of non predictor factors anthropogenic on runoffs may decrease by 0 07 for the catchment area increment of 10000 km2 and ranges from 4 to 27 over china the development of the mfedhm can enhance the reliability of ensemble hydrologic prediction and provide scientific support for climate change impacts assessment and adaptation under complexities keywords ensemble hydrological prediction multi level factorial analysis climate change spatial heterogeneity china 1 introduction for the temporal dynamics of a hydrological or any other natural societal system one driver is that of a series of influencing factors e g precipitation temperature soil moisture catchment topography and landscape structure for hydrological processes anderton et al 2002 schöpfer et al 2007 in the corresponding hydrological modeling studies bermúdez 2017 decharme et al 2013 pappenberger et al 2006 witono and bruckler 1989 these factors are usually defined as boundary conditions and the hydro system feature e g surface runoffs around catchment outlets varying with them is represented as a response or dependent variable meanwhile boundary conditions are spatially heterogeneous especially for large scale hydrological systems quantitative analyses of the impacts of boundary conditions abbreviated as boundary impacts in this study of spatiotemporal variability on hydrological regimes at a range of watershed scales are crucial for developing reliable data driven hydrological model bermúdez et al 2017 previously a series of approaches were proposed to model the boundary impacts in hydrological systems qualitatively or quantitatively bermúdez 2017 jiang 2011 pappenberger et al 2006 among them data driven hydrological modeling through statistics machine learning or other data driven methods cheng 2017 saft et al 2015 examined the variation of a response variable with a combination of boundary conditions without massive computations in physically based modeling fan 2015 a comparison of the modeling results for different combinations built a foundation for quantifying boundary impacts especially the overall or individual impacts of multiple boundary conditions wang et al 2017 for instance pappenberger et al 2006 evaluated the sensitivity of flood inundation predictions to the uncertainty of upstream boundary conditions through glue saft et al 2015 revealed the impact of multiyear droughts on annual rainfall runoff relationships through an analysis of standardized regression coefficients in a linear model bermúdez 2017 highlighted the impacts of rainfall dynamics and uncertain boundary conditions on floods based on a regional simplified physics hydraulic model evans et al 2018 explored the subsurface moisture and flow responses to seasonally and annually varying boundary conditions more recently yan et al 2019 identified the impacts of topography climate land cover and soil on runoffs through machine learning e g random forest gradient boosting and stacking and linear regression quantifying boundary impacts i e the impacts of climatic conditions and other boundary conditions on runoffs based on the aforementioned data driven models has been attempted through various post modeling analyses e g using importance metrics linear correlations or model parameters coefficients in many previous studies bermúdez 2017 decharme et al 2013 pappenberger et al 2006 wang et al 2021a witono and bruckler 1989 however the reliability of these studies is challenged by several complexities in hydrological boundary impact analyses specifically data uncertainty predictor selection uncertainty and model uncertainty may pose significant impacts on data driven hydrological modeling accuracies and results meanwhile it is hardly achievable to represent all boundary conditions of a hydrological system as predictors of a data driven hydrological model due to data limitation but ignoring the non predictor boundary conditions may lead to overestimation of predictor impacts besides most of previous studies focus on the individual or integrative impacts of multiple boundary conditions and merely analyze the interactive impacts of them that widely exist in hydrological systems garcía 2019 wang and huang 2015 moreover few studies are conducted to explore the spatial heterogeneity of the interactive individual and integrative impacts of multiple boundary conditions on hydrological regimes under the uncertainties and non predictor impacts for instance mockler et al 2016 assessed the importance of interactions between parameter and forcing i e precipitation in conceptual hydrological model simulations ali et al 2012 reported the influence of topographic pedologic and climatic interactions on streamflow generation at multiple catchment scales berghuijs et al 2019 assessed the relative importance of precipitation snowmelt and soil moisture excess on flooding and displayed the spatial pattern of them for the 3 777 catchments in europe brunner et al 2019 reported that the spatially heterogeneous of dependence between peak discharge and flood volume can be explained by an interplay of changes in precipitation snowmelt and soil moisture therefore the objective of this study is to develop a multi level factorial ensemble data driven hydrological model mfedhm for quantifying the interactive individual and integrative impacts of multiple boundary conditions e g climate conditions on hydrological processes and revealing the spatial heterogeneity of these impacts under various uncertainties and non predictor impacts in the mfedhm multi level factorial analysis correlation analysis and data driven methods are integrated with ensemble data driven hydrological model specifically i on the basis of correlation based predictor selection an ensemble data driven hydrological model is built through the integration of multiple data driven methods by bayesian model averaging ii multilevel factorial analysis is applied to quantify the interactive individual and integrative impacts of boundary conditions through rigorous statistical inferences based on the ensemble model iii as an extension of ii the spatial heterogeneity of boundary impacts is examined through a series of post modeling analyses to demonstrate and verify methodological reliability the mfedhm is applied to quantitatively analyze the boundary impacts in the rainfall runoff relationships of 16 catchments over china under the aforementioned complexities 2 multi level factorial ensemble hydrological model the impacts of boundary

hydrological systems an advanced method i e mfedhm multi level factorial ensemble data driven hydrological model is developed in this study as shown in fig 1 the mfedhm mainly consists of four modules module 1 screen out the predictors for hydrological modeling i e the data available boundary conditions of potentially significant impacts on runoffs based on data processing and correlation analyses module 2 establish hydrological models to reproduce the relationships between the boundary conditions and runoffs using various data based methods module 3 integrate the diverse advantages of these models through bayesian model averaging to enhance hydro modeling accuracies under model uncertainty resulting in an ensemble data driven hydrological model module 4 quantify the interactive individual and integrative impacts of the boundary conditions through multilevel factorial analyses of the ensemble data driven hydrological model and explore the spatial heterogeneity of these impacts by cross comparisons the representative advantage of the mfedhm is that based on the integration of multiple advanced hydro system analysis methods it can quantify the interactive individual and integrative impacts of multiple boundary conditions e g climate conditions on hydrological processes and reveal the spatial heterogeneity of these impacts under various uncertainties and non predictor impacts module 1 aims to identify the main hydro model predictors by dimension reduction methods many natural or societal factors are influencing streamflow and most of them are related to geographic and climatic conditions previous studies have demonstrated that precipitation posed great effects on both short and long term streamflow temperature e g daily maximum and minimum potential evapotranspiration and relative humidity have also been applied as predictors in streamflow forecasting fan 2015 moreover antecedent climate conditions have been used to represent initial catchment conditions therefore a number of climate variables e g the aforementioned ones in both current and lead months are optional for being the predictors of hydrological modeling the number could be very large and may lead to heavy computational burden in hydrological modeling especially at large scales and high resolutions to address this challenge in module 1 of mfedhm correlation analysis partial correlation analysis principal component analysis or other dimension reduction methods are employed to screen out significant predictors and reduce computational complexities for subsequent hydrological modeling analysis and prediction studies the purpose of module 2 is to build multiple data driven hydrological models various data driven methods are available for hydrological modeling devia et al 2015 solomatine and ostfeld 2008 module 2 of mfedhm focuses on development of multiple data driven for simulating the relationships between boundary conditions e g rainfall evaporation and temperature and streamflow under method uncertainty although the framework of mfedhm is adaptive to both approaches numerous data driven hydrological modeling methods such as statistical regression artificial intelligence and machine learning have been proven to be effective in streamflow modeling and forecasting due to easy and quick calibration ordieres meré et al 2020 solomatine and ostfeld 2008 in the subsequent case study multiple linear regression mlr holder 1985 support vector machine svm han et al 2007 stepwise linear regression steplm and random forest rf yan et al 2019 are employed for hydrological modeling using r packages e1071 and random forest the goal of module 3 is to ensemble the data driven hydrological models by bayesian model averaging multi model ensemble strategies have been proven useful for addressing model uncertainty and maximizing hydro model performances bohn et al 2010 to develop reliable ensemble hydrologic predictions a bayesian model averaging bma scheme is applied to exploit the diversity of skillful predictions and integrate the advantages of different hydrological models duan et al 2007 the bma is a statistical procedure that infers consensus predictions by weighing individual predictions based on their probabilistic likelihood measures specifically the hydrological model of higher accuracies is given higher weights than that of lower ones duan et al 2007 a brief synopsis of the bma approach is provided in the supporting information and methodological details are presented in duan et al 2019 module 4 aims to quantify boundary impacts by multi level factorial the ensemble data driven hydrological model is a large scale black box model of overcomplicated structures equations parameters and stochastics it is hardly achievable to identify the complex impacts of boundary conditions on model outputs e g runoff simulation results through theoretical derivation of linear regression or other simple models to address this issue multi level factorial analysis mfa is incorporated into mfedhm for quantifying the interactive individual and integrative impacts of multiple boundary conditions in the ensemble data driven hydrological model particularly the quantification of the interactive impacts under data uncertainty is achieved through rigorous statistical inferences which is the most representative advantage of mfa over the other sensitivity analysis methods wang et al 2020 duan et al 2020 from perspective of the mfedhm mfa can specify significant boundary conditions and their relationships under data uncertainty advance the in depth understanding of the corresponding hydro system complexities and enhance the reliability of data driven hydrological model and the relevant water resources management practices a detailed introduction about mfa is provided in the supporting information 3 case study rainfall runoff modeling over china with about 20 of the world s population and only 5 to 7 of global freshwater resources qiu 2010 china is heading towards water crises controlled by summer and winter monsoon precipitation patterns vary considerably from season to season for example scarce precipitation is observed mainly in spring and autumn zhang et al 2008 precipitation patterns also show significant spatial heterogeneity over china due to the vast national territorial area complicated topography and variable climate zhai et al 2005 thus the impacts of climate change on runoffs vary with regions and seasons chen 2014 la torre torres et al 2011 liu et al 2014 the river distribution annual precipitation mean annual temperature and population density over china are presented in fig s1 meanwhile the tempo spatial heterogeneity of these impacts for single or few watersheds has been reported in a few of previous studies shi et al 2013 for instance zhang 2011 found linear relationships between the cumulative departure values of precipitation and streamflow in the yellow river the yangtze river and the pearl river basins however the impacts over the whole country are merely explored wang et al 2013 without a systematic understanding of climate change impacts hydrological modeling and forecasting results are hardly reliable and may threaten sustainable socio economic development and eco environmental conservation over china sharma et al 2018 to address this issue the mfehm is applied to gain insights into the rainfall runoff relationships over china and their complexities monthly streamflow observations over china are collected from the global runoff data base www bafg de this dataset contains 33 chinese hydrological stations with different time lengths and data quality subsequently we select 16 stations for which 1 the length of data series is more than 30 years 2 runoff data have the same time period and 3 runoff data have no missing values for the selected period the information of these stations is shown in table 1 and fig 2 the period from 1955 to 1984 is chosen because streamflow in china has been greatly altered by human activities such as dam construction urbanization and land use changes since 1990s gou 2020 due to data availability limitation this study does not cover rivers in western china daily climate data e g daily precipitation and daily temperature are obtained from china meteorological data service center data cma cn to unify the temporal scales of climatic and hydrological data daily climate data are upscaled as monthly details of upscaling processes in the supporting information for instance the average daily precipitation of each month is defined as the mean precipitation i e p of the month the fundamental statistical characteristics of precipitation and streamflow are provided in table 1 and monthly distributions of them are shown in fig s2 the mfedhm is customized in several aspects as shown in fig 3 for systematically analyzing the rainfall runoff relationships over china first the distributions of nine climate variables are tested in data preprocessing the correlations between these variables and runoffs are analyzed to identify significant predictors for hydrological modeling second four statistical models i e linear regression support vector machine stepwise linear regression and random forest are built to simulate rainfall runoff relationships third bma is used for integrating the results of these data driven hydrological models fourth the interactive individual and integrative impacts of climate predictors on runoffs over china are analyzed quantitatively on the basis of ensemble data driven hydrological model percentile sampling and multilevel factorial analysis the spatial heterogeneity of these impacts is investigated by cross comparisons the former 25 years 1955 1979 and the remaining 5 years 1980 1984 are used as hydro model calibration and verification periods respectively the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 is used to evaluate the performances of hydrological models 1 n s e 1 i 1 n q o b s i q s i m i 2 i 1 n q o b s i q s i m i 2 where n is the total number of hydroclimate observations q obs i is the observed flow rate at the ith month q sim i is the simulated flow rate at the ith month q o b s is the mean of all streamflow observations 4 rainfall runoff correlations over china fig 4 presents the correlation matrix of nine monthly climate variables precipitation p air pressure ap wind speed wd mean temperature mt vapour pressure vp mean relative humidity mrh min temperature it max temperature at and min relative humidity irh over china it can be found that the correlations between different pairs of predictors vary significantly for instance three temperature related variables i e mt it and at present significant positive correlations for all stations so mt can be used to represent all of them besides the pairs of mt vp vp it and vp at also show strong stable p 0 05 correlations i e r 0 80 while some others e g ap and the other variables show strong stable p 0 05 negative correlations i e r 0 80 the correlation matrix of the climate variables among three months has similar patterns fig s4 what s more it is shown that the correlation between climate variables weakens with increasing intervals the pearson correlation coefficient expressed as r is used to quantify the degree of linear correlation between any pair of the climate variables the larger the absolute value of r the stronger the correlation is in addition the significance of r is represented as the p value of the correlation analysis generally p 0 05 means r is not statistically significant p 0 05 means low statistical significance and p 0 01 means high statistical significance the correlations between the climate variables and runoffs are shown in table 2 and table s1 and the corresponding p values are shown in table s2 according to these results rainfall runoff correlations decrease with the increase in lead months table 2 the correlation of contemporaneous wd and irh is not statistically significant for many hydrological stations ap shows negative correlations with runoffs while the remaining climate variables are positively correlated with runoffs besides rainfall runoff correlations vary with hydrological stations for instance there is a strong correlation between ap and runoffs the absolute r is large than 0 7 at stations 3 8 and 12 while a weak correlation exists between ap and runoffs the absolute r is less than 0 3 at stations 2 and 4 rainfall runoff correlations at stations 2 8 and 12 are stronger than those at the other stations low correlations can be used to eliminate insignificant climate conditions and reduce hydro modeling computational costs in detail 27 climate variables table s5 are used as the predictors in the subsequent hydrological modeling 5 ensemble data driven hydrological modeling fig 5 presents the verification results of five data driven hydrological models for 16 watersheds over china the prediction performance of bma is superior to any single model which is consistent with previous studies duan et al 2007 huo et al 2019 comparisons of different models during calibration and validation are provided in the supporting material the bma models have good performances nse ranges from 0 90 to 0 98 during calibration which means that the statistical relationship between climate factors and runoff during 1955 1979 is well captured while for validation period the nse of bma models ranges from 8 39 to 0 91 such a difference illustrates the spatial heterogeneity of climatic impacts on runoffs over china which may be attributable to underlying surface e g basin areas vegetation coverage and soil types and human activities e g dam water storage and irrigation water intake chen 2014 jiang 2011 shi et al 2013 it is worth noting that all models have very poor verification performances e g nse from 8 46 to 0 35 for northeast china i e stations 10 13 14 and 15 as shown in formula 1 the negative nse indicates that the simulated streamflow are far from the observations the simulated streamflows are determined by the established linear or non linear statistical function with observed climatic such poor predictive performance and performance differences between two periods i e calibration and validation indicate that the linear or non linear statistical relationship established based on observations from 1955 1979 is not applicable to that of 1980 1984 in watersheds in other words the significant differences of nses between calibration and validation periods fig s5 reflect the nonstationary of rainfall runoff relationships especially in northeast china a linear relationship r2 0 54 between calibration and validation nses is found for bma fig s7 such a relationship indicates that bma is more reliable in modeling nonstationary rainfall runoff relationships than a single data driven hydrological model in the following studies bma is used to simulate and analyze the rainfall runoff relationships over china for the total 30 years fig 6 presents the contribution of predictor combinations to bma modeling performances a general phenomenon is that more predictors result in better bma performances to identify significant predictors minimize the number of predictors and maximize bma model performances the individual main and interactive effects of two factors i e predictors diversity and lead time for each station are analyzed by multilevel factorial analyses as shown in fig 6 b the main effect of both factors varies with stations that of lead time is larger than 50 for ten stations and that of predictor diversity is larger than 50 for one station besides the interaction effect between both factors is larger than 50 for one sation the average main effect of the two factors are 18 and 52 respectively while the average interaction effect between them is 29 these results imply that the influence of antecedent climatic conditions is more significant than that of predictor diversity on runoffs for most stations therefore in the case of limited data it is meaningful and necessary to consider the influence of antecedent climatic conditions in consideration of the performances of bma and the principle of as few predictors as possible the predictors of hydrological models are p daily mean precipitation mt daily mean temperature and vp daily mean vapor pressure for the current and lead one months 6 ensemble model residual analyses to investigate the seasonality of ensemble data driven hydrological modeling the seasonal differences of bma model performances are analyzed fig 7 presents the performance of bma models in different seasons according to nse the performance of bma varies with seasons e g the best for the whole year and the worst in winter the residuals of bma models obey normal distributions fig s8 according to the normality test results table s5 statistical characteristics of residuals for different seasons are shown in table 3 the distribution of simulation residuals at the same station varies significantly with seasons for example the mean of residual distribution fluctuates from 0 08 to 0 80 in summer with an average of 0 24 while that varies from 0 65 to 0 27 in winter with an average of 0 11 this means the model overestimates summer runoffs and underestimates winter runoffs meanwhile the variance of the normal distribution varies from 0 17 to 10 37 in summer with a mean value of 2 95 and that varies from 0 03 to 3 56 in winter with a mean value of 0 88 such results indicate that the uncertainty of the model in summer is higher than that in winter moreover the normal distribution is negatively skewed in summer the different residual distributions in four seasons indicate that the simulation error may be related to the predictors in contrast most previous studies assume the model residuals follow the same distribution and fail to consider such a relationship assuming the same distribution for model residuals increases winter simulation residuals and reduces summer simulation residuals thus the variation of model residuals with seasons and climatic conditions should be taken into account in hydrological modeling and the resulting boundary impact analyses 7 climatic impacts on runoffs over china the individual and interactive impacts of climatic conditions on runoffs for the 16 watersheds over china are quantified by mfa fig 8 presents these impacts results show that climate conditions are dominating i e 73 96 runoff changes and variations over china for instance precipitation i e 1 49 with a mean value of 12 and evaporation 1 46 with a mean value of 18 directly affect the formation and changes of runoffs as the most important finding of this study climate change impacts on hydrology show significant spatial heterogeneities over china for instance contemporaneous climatic conditions dominate 57 64 runoff changes and variations in southern china stations 3 5 6 and 9 while precedent climate conditions pose significant impacts 20 67 with a mean value of 38 on runoffs in northern china stations 10 13 16 the main effect of each climate factor on runoffs varies greatly with watersheds and lead months local climate is the main influencing factor of runoff changes in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and the pearl river delta in south china in the middle reaches of the yellow river and the songhua river in north china antecedent climate conditions have a great influence on runoffs as shown in figs 8 and s10 local precipitation in the current month and one month in advance contributes 28 to the runoff change over the yellow river basin while its contribution decreases to 12 over the yangtze river runoff is affected by the total amount intensity duration and spatial distribution of precipitation yu et al 2020 higher rainfall intensity results in higher rates of infiltration excess runoffs and short term heavy rainfall often results in flooding in terms of evaporation runoff is mainly controlled by air saturated vapor pressure and wind speeds that directly affect evaporation intensity other climate factors such as temperature wind and humidity often affect river runoffs through precipitation and evaporation mfa is compared with a commonly used method i e correlation analysis in quantifying the complex impacts of climate changes on runoffs as shown in fig s9 correlation analysis ca cannot reveal which climate factors contribute more to runoffs and whether there are interactions between climate factors for instance two predictors e g mt and vp that are of same correlations with runoffs may have very different contributions on runoffs fig 8 the correlation between climate factors and runoffs does not reflect the magnitude of climatic impacts on runoffs on one hand ca indicates the consistency of the changing trends of two variables which includes cause and effect relationships and others correlation is not causality on the other hand ca represents the individual impact of one climate factor on runoffs but cannot eliminate the collinearity of multiple cli mate factors lastly ca relies on available data and cannot reflect the impacts of anthropogenic factors instead mfa can overcome the limitations of ca particularly mfa can comprehensively quantify the individual interactive and integrative impacts of climatic conditions on runoffs under various uncertainties anthropogenic impacts and spatial heterogeneity as shown in fig 9 the influence of local precipitation on runoffs decreases r2 0 52 with catchment areas a significant non linear relationship and the influence of temperature increases r2 0 44 with catchment areas a significant linear relationship these results can be explained by the hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration plant transpiration and snow melting previous studies have shown that the dominant factors of runoff characteristics such as flooding have spatial differences and that the sensitivity of streamflow with precipitation changes increases with catchment dryness berghuijs et al 2019 brunner et al 2019 which are consistent with this study it should be noted that the climate data used in this study represent the local climate around hydrological stations the results can only reflect the contribution of local climate to runoffs and watershed scale climate impacts will be studied in the future the unit change of one climate factor may result in the linear or nonlinear change of runoff and the resulting change rely on or interact with another or several other climate factors such an interactive effect is named as the interactive impact of the two climate factors on runoff this effect widely exists in highly complicated systems e g a large scale hydrological system that nonlinearly dynamically varies with various climatic and the other factors according to the mfa results as shown in fig 8 climate factors present significant interactions 4 19 with a mean value of 9 in driving the changes of runoffs over china especially the interactions of two climate factors 3 16 with a mean value of 7 the interactions decrease gradually with the number of climate factors 8 anthropogenic impacts on runoffs over china mfa has been used to quantify the sensitivities of model parameters wang et al 2021b wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 and this study is the first attempt to use it in quantifying the impacts of boundary conditions of a model i e the ensemble hydrological model in this study the similarity of both approaches is that they are achieved through mfa of the modeling results one difference is that model errors representing the impacts of non predictor factors especially human activities on runoffs in this case study are ignored in the former approach however no model can fully reproduce the complicated impacts of climatic anthropogenic and other factors on runoffs due to the limitations of data quality model structures system understandings and cognitive deficiencies chen 2014 in other words model errors are ubiquitous and inevitable climatic impacts would be overestimated and may mislead water resources management if model errors are not involved in mfa this points out the necessity of applying mfa to boundary impact analyses based on error involved hydrological modeling fig 9 presents the change of anthropogenic impacts on streamflow with catchment areas there is a significant p 0 01 linear relationship r2 0 44 between anthropogenic impacts and catchment areas this linear relationship also implies the overall influence of non predictor factors on runoffs decreases by 0 07 for the catchment area increment of 10000 km2 and ranges from 4 to 27 over china besides as shown in fig s11 a negative linear relationship exists between anthropogenic impacts and hydro model accuracies i e nse which verifies the tradeoff between climatic and anthropogenic impacts on runoffs namely a rainfall runoff model and its error reflect the impacts of dominant climate factors as predictors and non predictor factors e g other climate factors underlying surface and human activities on streamflow 9 discussion to quantify the interactive individual and integrative impacts of multiple boundary conditions in the ensemble data driven hydrological model mfa is incorporated into mfedhm in this study the quantification of such impacts under data uncertainty is achieved through rigorous statistical inferences which is the most representative advantage of mfa over the other sensitivity analysis methods fan et al 2020 in addition mfa has the advantage of analyzing the latent interactions of numerical variables e g lead months in fig 6 and non numerical variables e g climatic condition selections in fig 6 as well as their impacts on the modeling response moreover the contribution of error can also be calculated through mfa based on the above benefits mfa has been used widely in many fields such as water resources management wang and huang 2015 wang et al 2016 hydrological model parameters uncertainties zhang et al 2016 water quality management liu 2017 physical schemes screen in regional climate models song et al 2020 and statistical preprocessing of data assimilation experiments wang et al 2018 wang et al 2017 it should be noted that for these complex models without expression equation e g physically based hydrological model or data driven model without expression equation the assumption of applying factorial analysis is that the research system is linear in this study multiple linear regression i e a linear model with expression equation stepwise linear regression i e a linear model with expression equation support vector machine i e a non linear model without expression equation and random forest i e a non linear model without expression equation are used to establish hydrological models to reproduce the relationships between the boundary conditions and runoffs to integrate the diverse advantages of these models bayesian model averaging is applied to enhance hydro modeling accuracies under model uncertainty resulting in an ensemble hydrological model this ensemble hydrological model is a complex non linear model without expression equation the influences of boundary conditions i e model input and their interaction on model forecasting performance are unclear to uncover these influences roughly mfa is applied here under linear assumption the mfa is capable of detecting the curvature in the factor response relationship while it is impossible to reflect such a nonlinear effect with the two level factorial design due to its assumption of linearity over the range of factor levels wang and huang 2015 thus the main effect and interaction effect of multiple boundary conditions on hydrological processes are quantified which can provide insights maybe roughly for advancing the understanding of the ensemble hydrological prediction process to quantify the impact of the predictors to the response variables another strategy could be applying mfa directly to the data i e to the models inputs which is theoretically more straightforward according to montgomery 2017 all possible combinations of the levels of the factors are investigated in each complete trial of a factorial design experiment for example if there are 3 levels i e low medial and high of the six climatic conditions respectively as shown in fig 8 each trial should contain 3 6 729 combinations actually such ideal combinations or the responses of all combinations are hardly to be obtained in the observations especially for climate hydrological system to overcome the lack of all combinations or responses ensemble data driven hydrologic model is built here then the responses of all possible combinations of the levels of the factors can be obtained through the built ensamble model and mfa can be applied to quantify the impact of the predictors to the response variables this maybe one of the benefits of applying mfa on the ensemble data driven hydrology models finally it is worth mentioning that some statements currently included in this manuscript might be different to some extent if it is based on the application of mfa to the observations 10 conclusions the objective of this study was the development of a multi level factorial ensemble data driven hydrological model mfedhm for quantifying the impacts of multiple boundary conditions e g climate conditions on hydrological processes in the mfedhm multi level factorial analysis correlation analysis and data driven methods were integrated with ensemble hydrological modeling the representative advantage of the mfedhm was that based on the integration of multiple advanced hydro system analysis methods it could quantify the interactive individual and integrative impacts of multiple boundary conditions on hydrological processes and reveal the spatial heterogeneity of these impacts under various uncertainties the mfedhm was applied to quantitatively analyze the rainfall runoff relationships of 16 catchments over china results revealed that the errors of ensemble data driven hydrologic modeling mainly originating from anthropogenic impacts on runoffs varied with predictor selections and seasons the statistical inference and factorial analysis revealed the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of rainfall runoff response in china especially the non stationarity of rainfall runoff relationships in northeast china based on the results of applying mfa on the ensemble data driven model the influence of antecedent climatic conditions 52 was more significant than that of the predictor diversity 18 in current month besides climate conditions may dominate 86 runoff changes and variations over china for instance local precipitation 12 and evaporation 18 were more likely to affect the formation and changes of runoffs directly the multi level combined effects of climate predictors were unignorable 9 moreover climate change impacts on hydrology showed significant spatial heterogeneities over china for instance contemporaneous climatic conditions were more likely to dominate 57 64 runoff changes and variations in southern china while precedent climate conditions posed significant impacts 20 67 on runoffs in northern china apart these climate factors the contribution of non predictor factors e g other climate factors underlying surface human activities etc on streamflow was around 4 27 over china the main innovation of this research is the application of multi level factorial analysis in ensemble data driven hydrological model for quantifying the interactive individual and integrative impacts of multiple boundary conditions on hydrological processes and revealing the spatial heterogeneity of these impacts as the most important finding of this study the overall influence of temperature on runoffs may increase by 0 11 for the catchment area increment of 10 000 km2 over china while that of non predictor factors may decrease by 0 07 besides a series of extensions improvements or applications can be conducted in the future studies based on this study for instance the meteorological data used in this study are station data which is closest to the hydrological station studied so the results can only reflect the contribution of local climate factors to station runoff the results may be different for the whole watershed which will be further studied in the following work as mentioned the application of mfa in complex models without expression equation has a linear assumption the influence of this assumption on the results needs to be further explored moreover the influences of dataset accuracy geographical conditions topography vegetation human activities and other potential factors on rainfall runoff responses will be explored although the proposed model has been applied to 16 watersheds in china including semi arid semi humid and humid basins results presented in this paper may updated as more datasets cases become available and included our analysis can be strengthened by focusing on more catchments where more data are available an obvious future step will also be the inclusion of the global catchments rather than just in

299,the discrete fracture model dfm has been widely used to simulate fluid flow in fractured porous media traditional dfm is considered to be limited on conforming meshes hence significant difficulty may arise in generating high quality unstructured meshes due to the complexity of the fracture networks recently xu and yang reinterpreted dfm and demonstrated that it can actually be extended to non conforming meshes without any essential changes however the continuous galerkin cg method was applied and the local mass conservation was missing this paper is a follow up work and we apply the interior penalty discontinuous galerkin ipdg method and enriched galerkin eg method for the pressure equation with the numerical fluxes the local mass is conservative as an application we combine the reinterpreted dfm rdfm with the incompressible miscible displacements in porous media the bound preserving techniques are applied to the coupled system we can theoretically guarantee that the concentration is between 0 and 1 finally several numerical experiments are given to demonstrate the good performance of the rdfm based on the above two methods on non conforming meshes and the effectiveness of the bound preserving technique keywords reinterpreted discrete fracture model non conforming meshes incompressible miscible displacements interior penalty discontinuous galerkin method enriched galerkin method bound preserving 1 introduction numerical simulation of fluid flow in fractured porous media is of great significance for improving oil recovery in naturally fractured reservoirs contaminant transport in fractured rocks and underground radioactive waste reservoirs due to the high conductivity and complexity of the fracture networks it is critical but still challenging to accurately establish the effect of fractures on the flow in fractured media in recent decades as one of the most important models of the flow simulation in fractured porous media the discrete fracture model dfm has been intensively analyzed in 1982 noorishad and mehran 1982 introduced the first dfm for a single phase flow subsequently baca et al 1984 studied dfm for the heat and solute transport in fractured media on conforming meshes the basic idea was to treat the flow in one dimensional fractures and two dimensional matrix respectively by using the hybrid dimensional method and then coupled them with the fracture system multiplied by the fracture thickness as a dimensional homogeneity factor according to the principle of superposition later kim and deo 1999 2000 karimi fard and firoozabadi 2001 used the galerkin finite element methods to solve the multiphase flow combined with dfm in addition finite volume methods were also explored e g box dfm monteagudo and firoozabadi 2004 reichenberger et al 2006 monteagudo and firoozabadi 2007b 2007a zhang et al 2016 and the cell centered finite volume dfm cc dfm karimi fard et al 2003 sandve et al 2012 ahmed et al 2015 gläser et al 2017 fang et al 2018 moreover hoteit and firoozabadi 2005 2006 2008 moortgat and firoozabadi 2013a b zidane and firoozabadi 2014 and moortgat et al 2016 obtained the local mass conservation and high accuracy of the flow and transport equations in fractured media by combining the mixed finite element mfe and the discontinuous galerkin dg methods in dfm for other methods of dfm we can refer to xu and yang 2020 and the references therein unfortunately the above methods can only be applied to conforming meshes i e fractures must be located at the edges of the triangular retangular elements it is very difficult to generate high quality meshes especially when the fracture network is complex and the distances or angles among fractures are small to overcome this shortcoming the embedded discrete fracture model edfm li and lee 2008 moinfar 2013 yan et al 2016 ţene et al 2017 jiang and younis 2017 hosseinimehr et al 2018 xu et al 2019 was proposed as an alternative in the edfm all fractures are discretized into segments by the background matrix mesh forming the so called fracture cells in contrast with the matrix cells and the cells of both types are assigned with separate degrees of freedom dof the key idea of edfm is to define the non neighboring connections nncs between different cells i e the connections between a fracture cell and the matrix cell it penetrates connected fracture cells in neighboring matrix cells and intersecting fracture cells in the same matrix cell then we can compute the mass transfer in each nnc pair for instance the mass transfer between the fracture matrix nnc pair is determined by the average normal distance between the fracture cell and the matrix cell the mass transfer between other nnc pairs is evaluated accordingly see moinfar 2013 for more details though eliminates the constraint of conforming meshes the edfm requires a large amount of computation on the transmissibility factors of nncs in the pre processing and the special treatment when several fractures intersect at the same point the number of nncs and dof increase rapidly as the fracture networks are getting more and more complicated in addition many other methods were proposed such as the non conforming finite element method köppel et al 2019a 2019b schädle et al 2019 based on lagrange multipliers the extended finite element discrete fracture model xfem dfm fumagalli and scotti 2014 ter et al 2019 martin et al 2005 salimzadeh and khalili 2015 angot et al 2009 angot 2003 huang et al 2011 alboin et al 2000 flemisch et al 2016 hansbo and hansbo 2002 and the cutfem burman et al 2019 however these methods have some disadvantages such as high computational cost or not suitable for complex fracture networks recently xu and yang 2020 reinterpreted the dfm and proposed the mathematical expression in 2020 the reinterpreted dfm rdfm illustrates that the traditional dfm kim and deo 1999 2000 karimi fard and firoozabadi 2001 is actually not limited on conforming meshes the authors proposed a hybrid dimensional representation of the permeability tensor describing the fracture as a one dimensional line dirac δ functions contained in the permeability tensor by using the traditional continuous galerkin cg finite element methods the rdfm for single phase flow on non conforming meshes was derived numerical experiments showed the advantages of the rdfm however the local mass conservation is missing to fix this gap we construct the numerical fluxes in the scheme and would like to apply the dg methods dg methods employ finite element spaces containing elementwise discontinuous functions and develop special numerical techniques to control the jumps of numerical approximations as well as the nonlinearity of the convection term a commonly used dg method for convection diffusion equations and elliptic equations is the interior penalty dg ipdg method rivière 2008 the ipdg method in this paper is a symmetric form i e symmetric interior penalty galerkin sipg sun and wheeler 2005b in antonietti et al 2019 p antonietti et al proposed a dg approximation of flows in fractured porous media on polytopic grids though the dg methods can preserve local mass conservation compared to the cg methods there are more dof in view of this situation becker et al 2003 first proposed the enriched galerkin eg finite element method for solving the time independent convection diffusion and stokes problems the basic idea is to enrich the continuous galerkin finite element space with elementwise constant functions later sun and liu 2009 applied high order eg methods to the coupled system of flow and transport equations and constructed conservative fluxes eg and dg methods are both locally mass conservative but the dof of eg method is slightly larger than that of cg method and much less than that of dg method recently the eg method has been developed to solve general elliptic and parabolic problems with dynamic mesh adaptivity lee and wheeler 2017 lee et al 2018 and jump condition rupp and lee 2020 lee et al 2016a and extended to multiphase fluid flow problems lee and wheeler 2020 2018 kadeethum et al 2020b poroelastic problems choo and lee 2018 kadeethum et al 2020a 2021 phase field fracture problems wheeler et al 2020 lee et al 2016b 2018 shallow water equations hauck et al 2020 in lee and wheeler 2020 lee and wheeler used eg method to simulate two phase flow in propagating fractures with relative permeability and capillary pressure subsequently kadeethum et al 2020b employed eg method for fluid flow in porous media with low dimensional fractures moreover rupp and lee 2020 constructed a novel eg finite element method by enriching the cg space with not only piecewise constants but also piecewise polynomials with an arbitrary order as an application we apply the rdfm given in xu and yang 2020 to contaminant transportation and study the miscible displacements in porous media in douglas et al 1983b a douglas et al first proposed the mixed finite element method for incompressible miscible displacements the compressible problems were also developed in douglas and roberts 1983 and chou and li 1991 in recent years the dg methods have been widely used for solving the compressible miscible displacements cui 2008 yang 2011 guo and zhang 2015 guo et al 2017 and incompressible miscible displacements bartels et al 2009 guo et al 2014 yu et al 2017 kumar 2012 sun et al 2002 sun and wheeler 2005a in porous media as another important aspect of dg methods the bound preserving technique has been widely studied which can obtain physically relevant approximations in zhang and shu 2010 zhang and shu first constructed the genuinely maximum principle satisfying high order dg and finite volume methods if the exact solution has only one lower bound 0 then the technique is also called positivity preserving technique however few papers focused on bound preserving techniques for the miscible displacements in many actual problems physical parameters are closely related to the concentration c if c is out of the interval 0 to 1 we might not obtain the parameters used in the system and the numerical approximations may blow up in some extreme cases guo and yang 2017 in guo and yang 2017 guo and yang proposed the first bound preserving dg methods for the coupled system of the two component compressible miscible displacements the basic idea is as follows 1 use the pressure equation to subtract the concentration equation to obtain the concentration of the second component 2 apply the positivity preserving techniques to both c 1 and c 2 c i is the concentration of the i th component of the flow respectively 3 enforce c 1 c 2 1 by choosing consistent numerical fluxes see definition 2 1 in the pressure and concentration equations in guo and yang 2017 the authors theoretically proved that the above algorithm can yield physically relevant numerical cell averages then a slope limiter can be applied to make the numerical approximations to be within the desired bounds later in chuenjarern et al 2019 chuenjarern et al extended the idea to multi component miscible displacements and proposed high order bound preserving dg methods on triangular mesh and proved that the limiter does not affect the accuracy the bound preserving finite difference methods were also discussed in guo et al 2020 in this paper we first apply the rdfm in xu and yang 2020 to the incompressible miscible displacements in fractured porous media there are two main contributions 1 we derive the eg scheme and ipdg scheme for the flow equation and the ipdg scheme for the transport equation and construct conservative fluxes leading to local mass conservation 2 we theoretically construct the bound preserving technique by using the eg method and ipdg method for solving the pressure and concentration equations respectively we state that this paper is very different from the previous works firstly different from xu and yang 2020 the numerical methods in this paper are locally conservative by design while the cg method in xu and yang 2020 is not moreover due to the discontinuity nature of the numerical method the contribution of the dirac δ function in the numerical fluxes has to be treated effectively in fact we substitute the expressions of the normal component of velocity into the scheme of concentration and calculate the integral of the δ function exactly to obtain the numerical fluxes at the cell interfaces intersecting with fractures secondly different from guo and yang 2017 and chuenjarern et al 2019 where dg methods were used to solve both the pressure and concentration equations the bound preserving technique studied in this paper combines the eg and ipdg method in guo and yang 2017 and chuenjarern et al 2019 we subtract the scheme of the concentration equation form that of the pressure equation to obtain that of the second concentration by using consistent flux pairs however in this paper it is impossible to obtain the numerical scheme for the second concentration by subtracting schemes for the pressure and concentration equations due to the mismatch of the finite element spaces though the discrete spaces of the two methods are different we only need to analyze the cell averages in fact with the physically relevant numerical cell averages the bounds of the numerical approximations can be preserved by applying suitable slope limiters to preserve the bounds of the numerical cell averages we only need the consistent flux pairs see the definition 2 1 and the positivity preserving technique finally we claim that all the algorithms demonstrated in this paper can be extended to compressible flows with some minor changes following guo and yang 2017 and chuenjarern et al 2019 in addition to the above the computational cost in our pre processing is much less since we only need to compute the intersection between fractures and cell interfaces rather than the average normal distance between fracture cells and matrix cells and it is not necessary to consider flux interchange between intersecting fractures moreover the dof in our method keeps the same as the number of fractures increases for more information about the computational cost we can refer to xu and yang 2020 the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the model of incompressible miscible displacements in fractured porous media and derive the eg scheme and ipdg scheme for the flow equation as well as the ipdg scheme for the transport equation in section 3 we discuss the bound preserving techniques numerical experiments are given in section 4 finally we end in section 5 with concluding remarks 2 governing equations and numerical schemes 2 1 governing equations in this paper we consider the incompressible miscible displacements in fractured porous media let ω 0 1 0 1 be a bounded rectangular domain in r 2 we consider the fluid mixture with two components and the flow eq 2 1 and transport eq 2 2 have the following forms 2 1 k p u q x y ω 0 t t 2 2 ϕ c t u c d u c c q x y ω 0 t t where the unknown variables p u and c are the pressure of the fluid mixture the darcy velocity of the mixture and the volumetric concentration of interested species respectively ϕ is the porosity of the rock q is the external volumetric flow rate c is the concentration of the fluid in the external flow c must be specified at points where injection q 0 takes place and is assumed to be equal to c at production points q 0 the diffusion coefficient d is symmetric and arises from two aspects molecular diffusion which is rather small for field scale problems and dispersion which is velocity dependent it takes the form 2 3 d u ϕ x y d m o l i d l o n g u e d t r a n u e where e a 2 2 matrix represents the orthogonal projection along the velocity vector and is given by e u i j u i u j u 2 1 i j 2 u u 1 u 2 and e i e is the orthogonal complement the diffusion coefficient d l o n g measures the dispersion in the direction of the flow and d t r a n shows that transverse to the flow to ensure the stability of the scheme in almost all of the previous works d is assumed to be strictly positive definite in this paper we assume d to be positive semidefinite therefore we have d 11 0 d 22 0 and d 12 d 21 moreover the pressure is uniquely determined up to a constant thus we assume ω p d x d y 0 to ensure the uniqueness however this assumption is not essential in this paper we consider a two component displacement only and the relationship of components can be stated as follows c c 1 1 c 2 where c i is the concentration of the i th component of the fluid mixture k is the permeability tensor following xu and yang 2020 for fractured porous media k can be expressed as follows 2 4 k k m ϵ k f δ η η 0 1 ξ 1 ξ ξ 2 ν ν t where k m ϵ and k f are the permeability tensor of matrix the thickness of the fracture and the tangential permeability of the fracture respectively 1 is the indicator function defined as 1 expr equals 1 if expr is true while equals 0 otherwise ν is the tangential unit vector of the fracture for variable η and ξ see fig 1 ξ o η and x o y are local coordinate system associated with the fracture l and global coordinate system respectively we notice that δ η η 0 1 ξ 1 ξ ξ 2 contains the information of position of the fracture for any point m ω the transformation between its local coordinates ξ m η m and global coordinates x m y m is given as ξ m η m cos θ sin θ sin θ cos θ x m y m where θ is the angle of the fracture by the coordinates transformation the expression of k under global coordinates x o y is 2 5 k k m ϵ k f δ sin θ x cos θ y η 0 1 ξ 1 cos θ x sin θ y ξ 2 ν ν t following xu and yang 2020 we call the expression k in 2 5 the hybrid dimensional representation of permeability tensor because the matrix part k m in 2 5 is of rank 2 and has a 2d support while the fracture part ϵ k f δ 1 ν ν t is of rank 1 and has a 1d support the expression above is only for fractured media with single fracture but can be extended to a fracture network as 2 6 k k m i 1 l ϵ i k f i δ i 1 i ν i ν i t where l is the number of fractures δ i and 1 i are the shorthands of their full expressions in 2 4 and 2 5 ϵ i k f i and ν i are the thickness the tangential permeability and the tangential unit vector of the i th fracture respectively see xu and yang 2020 for more information about k which is an important reinterpretation and extension of dfm in this paper we consider the mixed boundary condition for the flow equation 2 7 p p d x γ d ω u n k p n p n x γ n ω γ d for the transport equation we consider the following boundary conditions 2 8 u c d u c n c i n u n x γ i n 2 9 d u c n 0 x ω γ i n where n is the unit outer normal vector of the boundary ω γ i n x γ d u n 0 is the inflow boundary for convenience we assume p n 0 and γ d γ in γ out in this paper where γ o u t x γ d u n 0 is the outflow boundary in fact if p n 0 γ n is also a member of the inflow boundary if p n 0 γ n is the outflow boundary therefore this assumption is not essential moreover the initial concentration is given as 2 10 c x y 0 c 0 x y x y ω 2 2 basic notations we demonstrate the notations to be used throughout the paper we consider rectangular meshes only the techniques for triangular meshes can be obtained following the same lines given in sun and liu 2009 and chuenjarern et al 2019 with some minor changes let 0 x 1 2 x n x 1 2 1 and 0 y 1 2 y n y 1 2 1 be the grid points in the x and y directions respectively define i i x i 1 2 x i 1 2 and j j y j 1 2 y j 1 2 let k i j i i j j be a partition of ω and denote ω h i j k i j for simplicity we use k to denote a typical cell we use γ for all the cell interfaces and γ 0 γ ω is the set of interior edges for any e γ denote e to be the length of e moreover we define n e n x 1 0 if e is parallel to the y axis while n e n y 0 1 if e is parallel to the x axis furthermore we denote ω e ω n n e where n is the unit outer normal of ω and ω ω ω the mesh size in the x and y directions are given δ x i x i 1 2 x i 1 2 and δ y j y j 1 2 y j 1 2 respectively for simplicity we assume uniform meshes and denote δ x δ x i and δ y δ y j however this assumption is not essential the finite element space is chosen as w h k z z k q k k k ω h where q k k denotes the space of tensor product polynomials of degrees at most k in k we choose β 1 1 t to be a fixed vector that is not parallel to any normal of the element interfaces as we know e γ 0 is shared by two elements k ℓ and k r where β n ℓ 0 and β n r 0 with n ℓ and n r being the outward normals of k ℓ and k r for any z w h k z and z represent the values taken from k ℓ and k r respectively furthermore we use z z z and z 1 2 z z as the jump and average of z at the cell interfaces respectively 2 3 eg and ipdg methods for the flow equation in this subsection we use eg and ipdg methods for the flow equation both preserves the local mass conservation furthermore the eg method combines the advantages of both cg and dg methods this method preserves the local mass conservation of dg method while the degree of freedom is close to that of cg method moreover the eg method has a similar weak formulation as for the dg method yet whose implementation is simpler and more efficient now we first define the space of continuous piecewise polynomials w h k c w h k c ω where c ω represents the set of continuous functions in ω then we define w h k c 0 w h k c w h 0 which is called eg space by enriching the cg approximation space with piecewise constant functions for simplicity if not otherwise stated we use p u c as the numerical approximations from now on then the eg scheme for 2 1 is to find p w h k c 0 such that for any ξ w h k c 0 we have 2 11 a 0 p ξ a d p ξ f ξ where 2 12 a 0 p ξ k p ξ e γ 0 e k p n e ξ d s e γ 0 σ e e β e p ξ d s e γ 0 α e e γ e δ 1 p

vector of edge e at x y based on 2 15 2 18 we can obtain the final version of the eg scheme for 2 1 in fractured porous media find p w h k c 0 such that for any ξ w h k c 0 2 19 a 0 p ξ a d p ξ a l p

smaller than that of dg method especially for low order approximations for example for q 1 polynomials in a 2 dimensional rectangular mesh with n x n y elements the dg scheme has 4 n x n y dof while eg scheme only has n x 1 n y 1 n x n y 1 dof detailed information about dof can be found in sun and liu 2009 as a contrast we introduce ipdg scheme in fact we just replace w h k c 0 by w h k in 2 19 in section 4 we numerically simulate the pressure equation with the above two methods obviously eg and ipdg schemes with 2 11 or 2 19 are both symmetric to be more precise we use symmetric interior penalty galerkin sipg method sun and wheeler 2005b with different discrete spaces 2 4 ipdg method for the transport equation after obtaining the pressure p from 2 19 by eg or ipdg method we can calculate the velocity u as follows 2 22 u k p x k ω h 2 23 u n k p n σ e e β p k i p k j α e e γ δ 1 p k i p k j ν n x e k i k j a n d n e x t e r i o r t o k i 2 24 u n p n x γ n 2 25 u n k p n σ e

will be used in the transport equation now we state the following theorem for the local mass conservation of the scheme theorem 2 1 numerical scheme 2 19 2 25 defined above is locally conservative proof numerical solution u is locally conservative if 2 26 k u n k d s k q d s in scheme 2 11 we take the test function ξ 1 w h k c 0 or w h k in each element k then we will obtain 2 26 the proof of the theorem is complete for the transport equation we can employ ipdg method to obtain the numerical solution of concentration by seeking r w h k such that for any ζ w h k 2 27 r t ζ l c u c ζ l d u c

2 27 is also a symmetric form now we introduce the following definition that will be used in the bound preserving technique guo and yang 2017 definition 2 1 we say two fluxes u c u are consistent if u c u by taking c 1 in ω this definition was first introduced in guo and yang 2017 and was used to constructed the bound preserving technique from the definition it is easy to obtain the following lemma lemma 2 2 the numerical flux pair u n e u c n e given in 2 23 and 2 33 are consistent next we deal with u in the ipdg scheme for concentration c similar to the treatment of δ function in scheme of

the shape of fracture l actually can be a curve and the thickness ϵ and tangential permeability k f of the fracture can be a scalar function defined along l for the quadrature rule used for line integrals on l one can refer to the remark 4 3 in xu and yang 2020 note that if the fracture is straight and ϵ k f are constant the midpoint rule is enough for q 1 elements in the case of fracture

preserving in this section we consider euler forward time discretization and apply the bound preserving technique to construct second order physically relevant numerical approximations in r 2 we first discuss the techniques for cells away from ω and the boundary cells can be analyzed following the same lines we use o i j for the numerical approximation o in k i j and the cell average is o i j moreover we use o n to represent the solution o at time level n before analyzing the bound preserving schemes we would like to demonstrate the following key points 1 approximate r ϕ c directly instead of c due to the existence of ϕ in 2 2 we cannot extract the cell averages of c by simply taking the test function to be 1 2 take the l 2 projection of ϕ into w h k denoted as φ which is the approximation of the porosity 3 construct a limiter to maintain the cell average r i j and modify the numerical approximations of r i j such that 0 r i j φ which further yields c i j p k r i j φ 0 1 where p k is the l 2 projection into w h k if k 2 while p 1 c k is the interpolation of c at the four vertices of cell k in 2 27 we take ζ 1 in k i j k i j away from ω to obtain the equation satisfied by the cell average of r 3 1 r i j n 1 h c r u c h x d r u c h y d r u c h s r c ˇ q where 3 2 h c r u c 1 3 r i j n λ i i c u n e i j 1 2 c u n e i j 1 2 d x j j c u n e i 1 2 j c u n e i 1 2 j d y 3

quadrature points on i i and j j are denoted by x i 1 x i 2 and y j 1 y j 2 respectively the corresponding weights on the interval 1 2 1 2 are defined as w 1 and w 2 we will prove that if δ t is sufficiently small then h c h x d h y d h s are all positive and the results are given in the following three lemmas for simplicity of presentation if the denominator in a fraction is zero then the value of the fraction is defined as lemma 3 1 suppose r n 0 c n 0 then h s r c ˇ q 0 under the condition 3 6 δ t φ m 3 q m where 3 7 φ m min x y φ x y q m max i j β γ q x i β y j γ 0 lemma 3 2 suppose

u x y d 12 m max x y ω d 12 u x y λ 1 δ t δ x 2 similarly we have h y d r u c 0 if 3 13 α δ x β 2 δ y d 22 m 3 δ x β 1 d 21 m 3 14 d 22 m λ 2 2 α δ x β 1 d 21 m λ 1 12 φ m where 3 15 d 22 m max x y ω d 22 u x y d 21 m max x y ω d 21 u x y λ 2 δ t δ y 2 we can find the proofs of lemma 3 1 and lemma 3 2 in appendix b and appendix c respectively for the diffusion terms h x d r u c and h y d r u c we can follow the same analysis in guo and yang 2017 with some minor changes therefore we skip the proof of lemma 3 3 next base on the above three lemmas we can state the following theorem theorem 3 1 suppose r n 0 c n 0 and the parameters α satisfy 3 10 3 11 3 13 and 3 14 then r i j n 1 0 under the conditions 3 6 and 3 8 now for these cells away from ω we have r i j n 1 0 to obtain r i j n 1 φ we only need to prove r 2 i j n 1 0 firstly substituting 2 22 2 25 into 2 11 yields the following equation 3 16 u ξ e γ 0 e u n e ξ d s e γ d e u n e d ξ d s e γ 0 e k ξ n e p d s e γ d e k ξ n e d p d s q ξ e γ n e p n ξ d s e γ d e k ξ n e d p d d s next let ξ 1 in 3 16 and ζ 1 in 2 27 then subtract 2 27 from 3 16 and use lemma 2 2 to obtain 3 17 r 2 i j n 1 h c r 2 u c 2 h x d r 2 u c 2 h y d r 2 u c 2 h s r 2 c ˇ 2 q where r 2 φ r c ˇ 2 1 c ˇ we can observe that the above equation is similar to 3 1 therefore following the same analysis above we conclude that r 2 i j n 1 0 for these cells away from ω and the result is given below theorem 3 2 suppose 0 r i j n φ and the conditions in theorem 3 1 are satisfied then 0 r i j n 1 φ next we study the cells near ω the boundary cells can be analyzed following the same lines with some minor changes except that the convection term is treated slightly differently because of the existence of the boundary without loss of generality we take the last cell denoted as k as an example to illustrate this point let the left and lower boundaries of the last cell k are the interior interfaces the upper boundary is the neumann boundary for pressure equation and the right boundary is the outflow boundary we take ζ 1 in k in 2 27 to obtain the equation satisfied by the cell average of r 3 18 r k n 1 h b c r u c h x b d r u c h y b d r u c h s r c ˇ q where 3 19 h b c r u c 1 3 r i j n λ i i c u n e i j 1 2 c p n i j 1 2 d x λ j j c u n e i 1 2 j c u n e o u t i 1 2 j d y 3 20 h x b d r u c 1 6 r i j n λ j j d 11 c x d 12 c y i 1 2 j α

can be analyzed following the same lines with some minor changes in guo and yang 2017 hence we only focus on the convection part and we have the following conclusion for h b c r u c 3 22 h b c r u c 0 if 3 23 δ t δ x δ t δ y a where a min β φ i 1 2 j β 6 u n e o u t i 1 2 j β φ i j 1 2 β 6 max β p n i j 1 2 β 0 φ i j 1 2 β 6 max u n e i j 1 2 β 0 φ i 1 2 j β 6 max u n e i 1 2 j β 0 we put the proof of 3 22 in appendix d moreover similar to the construction of 3 17 we can conclude that the cell average expression for r 2 is similar to the cell average for r therefore 0 r φ for boundary cells remark 3 1 the treatment of r 2 is different from that in guo and yang 2017 and chuenjarern et al 2019 in these two works we subtract the scheme of the concentration equation from that of the pressure equation to obtain that of the second concentration however with the combination of eg and dg it is impossible to subtract 3 16 and 2 27 due to the mismatch of the finite element spaces however what we want is not the full scheme but the cell averages therefore we took the test function to be 1 before we perform the subtraction 3 2 slope limiter with theorem 3 2 we can guarantee the numerical cell averages r to be physically relevant however the numerical approximation r may be negative or larger than φ therefore we need to apply a limiter to modify r as discussed in chuenjarern et al 2019 the procedure is given in the following steps 1 define s x k r x 0 take r r θ r φ φ r θ max x s r x φ r φ x r x φ 0 2 set r 2 φ r and repeat the above step for r 2 3 take r φ r 2 as the new approximation remark 3 2 after the above three steps we have 0 r φ it is easy to check that the limiter does not change the numerical cell average i e k r x d x k r x d x moreover it is proved that the limiter does not affect the accuracy see chuenjarern et al 2019 for more information 3 3 high order time discretization in this subsection we introduce third order strong stability preserving ssp time discretization to solve the ode system o t l o which is a convex combination of euler forward time discretization we consider the ssp runge kutta method 3 24 o 1 o n δ t l o n t n o 2 3 4 o n 1 4 o 1 δ t l o 1 t n 1 o n 1 1 3 o n 2 3 o 2 δ t l o 2 t n δ t 2 and the multi step method 3 25 o n 1 16 27 o n 3 δ t l o n t n 11 27 o n 3 12 11 δ t l o n 3 t n 3 more details of these time discretizations can be found in gottlieb et al 2001 2009 shu 1988 4 numerical experiments in this section we provide numerical examples to illustrate the convergence and accuracy of rdfm based on the eg and ipdg methods on non conforming meshes and effectiveness of the bound preserving technique we use the third order ssp runge kutta method 3 24 for the sake of simplicity the flows in these tests are driven by boundary conditions instead of source term i e q 0 in example 4 1 we use q 1 polynomials and q 2 polynomials to construct the finite element space respectively and test the accuracy of eg method for solving rdfm in example 4 2 q 1 polynomials are used to test the effectiveness of the bound preserving technique we simulate the example with without the bound preserving limiter for incompressible miscible displacements in fractured porous media and compare the results example 4 3 is a realistic case in flemisch et al 2018 where q 1 polynomials are used to simulate contaminant propagation in fractured porous media example 4 1 accuracy test of eg method in this example we test the accuracy of eg method by solving the following problem k p 0 x ω π π π π where k i 2 δ sin θ x cos θ y cos 2 θ sin θ cos θ sin θ cos θ sin 2 θ θ is an arbitrary fixed number the exact solution for any fixed θ is p x y sin cos θ x sin θ y e sin θ x cos θ y and the corresponding dirichlet boundary conditions are used the product of thickness and permeability is ϵ k f 2 and permeability of porous matrix is k m 1 by choosing different θ s meshes and polynomial degrees k in the finite element space we can test accuracy of eg method for dfm comprehensively we take three tests with different settings of θ s on rectangular meshes in which θ 5 3 is randomly chosen to make the fracture intersecting with gridcells non conformingly see fig 2 for illustration of settings of fracture and mesh the numerical results are given in table 1 and table 2 from the tables we can conclude that the eg method for the discrete fracture model is convergent moreover we find the rates of convergence are optimal on conforming meshes and o h on non conforming meshes example 4 2 bound preserving test we use this example to show the significance of the bound preserving technique in the simulation of miscible displacements in porous media let ω 0 2 π 0 2 π the initial concentrations c 0 is c 0 1 0 x π 2 3 π 4 y 5 π 4 0 o t h e r w i s e the left and right endpoints of the fracture are π 2 π 15 π 8 π respectively see fig 3 for details of settings of fracture and concentration at t 0 on 40 40 mesh other parameters are taken as ϕ 1 k m i ϵ k f 10 5 d 0 1 i c i n 0 moreover for pressure equation the left right boundaries are dirichlet boundaries with pressure p d l e f t 2 p d r i g h t 0 while the bottom top boundaries are neumann boundaries with p n 0 the left boundary is the inflow boundary with c i n 0 the right boundary is the outflow boundary we compute the concentration c at time t 0 1 0 5 0 9 s with n x n y 40 and δ t 0 001 h 2 h 2 π 40 the numerical results are shown in fig 4 from the figures we can see that the concentration c is between 0 and 1 to test the effectiveness of the bound preserving technique we simulate the example without the bound preserving limiter and the numerical results are shown in fig 5 we can conclude that the boundary preserving technique is effective example 4 3 a realistic case this example is a benchmark problem in flemisch et al 2018 modified from a real set of fractures from an interpreted outcrop in the sotra island the test case is a complex fracture network containing 63 fractures with different lengths and connectivity for simplicity the domain is uniformly shrunk to ω 0 1 4 0 1 2 with permeability k m 1 the fractures on 70 60 mesh are shown in fig 6 with ϵ k f 10 the detailed geometric data of fractures can be found in htt 0000 and xu and yang 2020 while we just scale down the geometry uniformly we simulate two cases one case is that the contaminant propagates from top to bottom and the other case is that the contaminant propagates from left to right moreover eg method and ipdg method introduced in section 2 are used to solve pressure p respectively the contour plots of numerical results for pressure equation are presented in figs 7 and 8 case 1 for pressure equation the left right boundaries are neumann boundaries with p n 0 while the top bottom boundaries are dirichlet boundaries with p d t o p 1 p d b o t t o m 0 respectively for concentration equation the upper boundary is inflow boundary with c i n 1 the lower boundary is outflow boundary with c c and the initial concentration is zero the other parameters are taken as ϕ 1 d 0 005 u i we compute the concentration c at time t 0 01 0 02 0 03 0 05 0 08 0 1 with n x 70 n y 60 and δ t 0 0005 h 2 h 0 02 the numerical results are shown as figs 9 and 10 respectively case 2 for pressure equation the top bottom boundaries are neumann boundaries with p n 0 while the left right boundaries are dirichlet boundaries with p d l e f t 1 p d r i g h t 0 for concentration equation the left boundary is inflow boundary with c i n 1 the right boundary is outflow boundary with c c and the initial concentration is zero the numerical results are shown as figs 11 and 12 respectively through the numerical simulation of above two cases we can conclude that the numerical approximation of the concentration c is between 0 and 1 and the contaminants propagate along the fractures which is in line with the relevant physical significance in addition the simulation results of eg method and ipdg method are almost the same but the degree of freedom of the eg method is smaller than that of the ipdg method 5 concluding remarks in this paper we combined the reinterpreted discrete fracture model with incompressible miscible displacements in porous media we have derived the eg scheme and ipdg scheme for the flow equation and the ipdg scheme for the transport equation and constructed conservative numerical fluxes yielding local mass conservation moreover the bound preserving technique was applied by combining eg method and ipdg method theoretical analysis and numerical experiments showed effectiveness of the bound preserving technique and good performance of rdfm based on the above two methods on non conforming meshes in addition to the above the explicit time method is used in this paper which leads to small time step size we can apply the implicit time methods such as the implicit pressure explicit saturation impes method and this is our future work we will also discuss the multiphase flow coupled hydro mechanical problems and other similar problems in 3d in the future credit authorship contribution statement hui guo conceptualization resources

299,the discrete fracture model dfm has been widely used to simulate fluid flow in fractured porous media traditional dfm is considered to be limited on conforming meshes hence significant difficulty may arise in generating high quality unstructured meshes due to the complexity of the fracture networks recently xu and yang reinterpreted dfm and demonstrated that it can actually be extended to non conforming meshes without any essential changes however the continuous galerkin cg method was applied and the local mass conservation was missing this paper is a follow up work and we apply the interior penalty discontinuous galerkin ipdg method and enriched galerkin eg method for the pressure equation with the numerical fluxes the local mass is conservative as an application we combine the reinterpreted dfm rdfm with the incompressible miscible displacements in porous media the bound preserving techniques are applied to the coupled system we can theoretically guarantee that the concentration is between 0 and 1 finally several numerical experiments are given to demonstrate the good performance of the rdfm based on the above two methods on non conforming meshes and the effectiveness of the bound preserving technique keywords reinterpreted discrete fracture model non conforming meshes incompressible miscible displacements interior penalty discontinuous galerkin method enriched galerkin method bound preserving 1 introduction numerical simulation of fluid flow in fractured porous media is of great significance for improving oil recovery in naturally fractured reservoirs contaminant transport in fractured rocks and underground radioactive waste reservoirs due to the high conductivity and complexity of the fracture networks it is critical but still challenging to accurately establish the effect of fractures on the flow in fractured media in recent decades as one of the most important models of the flow simulation in fractured porous media the discrete fracture model dfm has been intensively analyzed in 1982 noorishad and mehran 1982 introduced the first dfm for a single phase flow subsequently baca et al 1984 studied dfm for the heat and solute transport in fractured media on conforming meshes the basic idea was to treat the flow in one dimensional fractures and two dimensional matrix respectively by using the hybrid dimensional method and then coupled them with the fracture system multiplied by the fracture thickness as a dimensional homogeneity factor according to the principle of superposition later kim and deo 1999 2000 karimi fard and firoozabadi 2001 used the galerkin finite element methods to solve the multiphase flow combined with dfm in addition finite volume methods were also explored e g box dfm monteagudo and firoozabadi 2004 reichenberger et al 2006 monteagudo and firoozabadi 2007b 2007a zhang et al 2016 and the cell centered finite volume dfm cc dfm karimi fard et al 2003 sandve et al 2012 ahmed et al 2015 gläser et al 2017 fang et al 2018 moreover hoteit and firoozabadi 2005 2006 2008 moortgat and firoozabadi 2013a b zidane and firoozabadi 2014 and moortgat et al 2016 obtained the local mass conservation and high accuracy of the flow and transport equations in fractured media by combining the mixed finite element mfe and the discontinuous galerkin dg methods in dfm for other methods of dfm we can refer to xu and yang 2020 and the references therein unfortunately the above methods can only be applied to conforming meshes i e fractures must be located at the edges of the triangular retangular elements it is very difficult to generate high quality meshes especially when the fracture network is complex and the distances or angles among fractures are small to overcome this shortcoming the embedded discrete fracture model edfm li and lee 2008 moinfar 2013 yan et al 2016 ţene et al 2017 jiang and younis 2017 hosseinimehr et al 2018 xu et al 2019 was proposed as an alternative in the edfm all fractures are discretized into segments by the background matrix mesh forming the so called fracture cells in contrast with the matrix cells and the cells of both types are assigned with separate degrees of freedom dof the key idea of edfm is to define the non neighboring connections nncs between different cells i e the connections between a fracture cell and the matrix cell it penetrates connected fracture cells in neighboring matrix cells and intersecting fracture cells in the same matrix cell then we can compute the mass transfer in each nnc pair for instance the mass transfer between the fracture matrix nnc pair is determined by the average normal distance between the fracture cell and the matrix cell the mass transfer between other nnc pairs is evaluated accordingly see moinfar 2013 for more details though eliminates the constraint of conforming meshes the edfm requires a large amount of computation on the transmissibility factors of nncs in the pre processing and the special treatment when several fractures intersect at the same point the number of nncs and dof increase rapidly as the fracture networks are getting more and more complicated in addition many other methods were proposed such as the non conforming finite element method köppel et al 2019a 2019b schädle et al 2019 based on lagrange multipliers the extended finite element discrete fracture model xfem dfm fumagalli and scotti 2014 ter et al 2019 martin et al 2005 salimzadeh and khalili 2015 angot et al 2009 angot 2003 huang et al 2011 alboin et al 2000 flemisch et al 2016 hansbo and hansbo 2002 and the cutfem burman et al 2019 however these methods have some disadvantages such as high computational cost or not suitable for complex fracture networks recently xu and yang 2020 reinterpreted the dfm and proposed the mathematical expression in 2020 the reinterpreted dfm rdfm illustrates that the traditional dfm kim and deo 1999 2000 karimi fard and firoozabadi 2001 is actually not limited on conforming meshes the authors proposed a hybrid dimensional representation of the permeability tensor describing the fracture as a one dimensional line dirac δ functions contained in the permeability tensor by using the traditional continuous galerkin cg finite element methods the rdfm for single phase flow on non conforming meshes was derived numerical experiments showed the advantages of the rdfm however the local mass conservation is missing to fix this gap we construct the numerical fluxes in the scheme and would like to apply the dg methods dg methods employ finite element spaces containing elementwise discontinuous functions and develop special numerical techniques to control the jumps of numerical approximations as well as the nonlinearity of the convection term a commonly used dg method for convection diffusion equations and elliptic equations is the interior penalty dg ipdg method rivière 2008 the ipdg method in this paper is a symmetric form i e symmetric interior penalty galerkin sipg sun and wheeler 2005b in antonietti et al 2019 p antonietti et al proposed a dg approximation of flows in fractured porous media on polytopic grids though the dg methods can preserve local mass conservation compared to the cg methods there are more dof in view of this situation becker et al 2003 first proposed the enriched galerkin eg finite element method for solving the time independent convection diffusion and stokes problems the basic idea is to enrich the continuous galerkin finite element space with elementwise constant functions later sun and liu 2009 applied high order eg methods to the coupled system of flow and transport equations and constructed conservative fluxes eg and dg methods are both locally mass conservative but the dof of eg method is slightly larger than that of cg method and much less than that of dg method recently the eg method has been developed to solve general elliptic and parabolic problems with dynamic mesh adaptivity lee and wheeler 2017 lee et al 2018 and jump condition rupp and lee 2020 lee et al 2016a and extended to multiphase fluid flow problems lee and wheeler 2020 2018 kadeethum et al 2020b poroelastic problems choo and lee 2018 kadeethum et al 2020a 2021 phase field fracture problems wheeler et al 2020 lee et al 2016b 2018 shallow water equations hauck et al 2020 in lee and wheeler 2020 lee and wheeler used eg method to simulate two phase flow in propagating fractures with relative permeability and capillary pressure subsequently kadeethum et al 2020b employed eg method for fluid flow in porous media with low dimensional fractures moreover rupp and lee 2020 constructed a novel eg finite element method by enriching the cg space with not only piecewise constants but also piecewise polynomials with an arbitrary order as an application we apply the rdfm given in xu and yang 2020 to contaminant transportation and study the miscible displacements in porous media in douglas et al 1983b a douglas et al first proposed the mixed finite element method for incompressible miscible displacements the compressible problems were also developed in douglas and roberts 1983 and chou and li 1991 in recent years the dg methods have been widely used for solving the compressible miscible displacements cui 2008 yang 2011 guo and zhang 2015 guo et al 2017 and incompressible miscible displacements bartels et al 2009 guo et al 2014 yu et al 2017 kumar 2012 sun et al 2002 sun and wheeler 2005a in porous media as another important aspect of dg methods the bound preserving technique has been widely studied which can obtain physically relevant approximations in zhang and shu 2010 zhang and shu first constructed the genuinely maximum principle satisfying high order dg and finite volume methods if the exact solution has only one lower bound 0 then the technique is also called positivity preserving technique however few papers focused on bound preserving techniques for the miscible displacements in many actual problems physical parameters are closely related to the concentration c if c is out of the interval 0 to 1 we might not obtain the parameters used in the system and the numerical approximations may blow up in some extreme cases guo and yang 2017 in guo and yang 2017 guo and yang proposed the first bound preserving dg methods for the coupled system of the two component compressible miscible displacements the basic idea is as follows 1 use the pressure equation to subtract the concentration equation to obtain the concentration of the second component 2 apply the positivity preserving techniques to both c 1 and c 2 c i is the concentration of the i th component of the flow respectively 3 enforce c 1 c 2 1 by choosing consistent numerical fluxes see definition 2 1 in the pressure and concentration equations in guo and yang 2017 the authors theoretically proved that the above algorithm can yield physically relevant numerical cell averages then a slope limiter can be applied to make the numerical approximations to be within the desired bounds later in chuenjarern et al 2019 chuenjarern et al extended the idea to multi component miscible displacements and proposed high order bound preserving dg methods on triangular mesh and proved that the limiter does not affect the accuracy the bound preserving finite difference methods were also discussed in guo et al 2020 in this paper we first apply the rdfm in xu and yang 2020 to the incompressible miscible displacements in fractured porous media there are two main contributions 1 we derive the eg scheme and ipdg scheme for the flow equation and the ipdg scheme for the transport equation and construct conservative fluxes leading to local mass conservation 2 we theoretically construct the bound preserving technique by using the eg method and ipdg method for solving the pressure and concentration equations respectively we state that this paper is very different from the previous works firstly different from xu and yang 2020 the numerical methods in this paper are locally conservative by design while the cg method in xu and yang 2020 is not moreover due to the discontinuity nature of the numerical method the contribution of the dirac δ function in the numerical fluxes has to be treated effectively in fact we substitute the expressions of the normal component of velocity into the scheme of concentration and calculate the integral of the δ function exactly to obtain the numerical fluxes at the cell interfaces intersecting with fractures secondly different from guo and yang 2017 and chuenjarern et al 2019 where dg methods were used to solve both the pressure and concentration equations the bound preserving technique studied in this paper combines the eg and ipdg method in guo and yang 2017 and chuenjarern et al 2019 we subtract the scheme of the concentration equation form that of the pressure equation to obtain that of the second concentration by using consistent flux pairs however in this paper it is impossible to obtain the numerical scheme for the second concentration by subtracting schemes for the pressure and concentration equations due to the mismatch of the finite element spaces though the discrete spaces of the two methods are different we only need to analyze the cell averages in fact with the physically relevant numerical cell averages the bounds of the numerical approximations can be preserved by applying suitable slope limiters to preserve the bounds of the numerical cell averages we only need the consistent flux pairs see the definition 2 1 and the positivity preserving technique finally we claim that all the algorithms demonstrated in this paper can be extended to compressible flows with some minor changes following guo and yang 2017 and chuenjarern et al 2019 in addition to the above the computational cost in our pre processing is much less since we only need to compute the intersection between fractures and cell interfaces rather than the average normal distance between fracture cells and matrix cells and it is not necessary to consider flux interchange between intersecting fractures moreover the dof in our method keeps the same as the number of fractures increases for more information about the computational cost we can refer to xu and yang 2020 the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the model of incompressible miscible displacements in fractured porous media and derive the eg scheme and ipdg scheme for the flow equation as well as the ipdg scheme for the transport equation in section 3 we discuss the bound preserving techniques numerical experiments are given in section 4 finally we end in section 5 with concluding remarks 2 governing equations and numerical schemes 2 1 governing equations in this paper we consider the incompressible miscible displacements in fractured porous media let ω 0 1 0 1 be a bounded rectangular domain in r 2 we consider the fluid mixture with two components and the flow eq 2 1 and transport eq 2 2 have the following forms 2 1 k p u q x y ω 0 t t 2 2 ϕ c t u c d u c c q x y ω 0 t t where the unknown variables p u and c are the pressure of the fluid mixture the darcy velocity of the mixture and the volumetric concentration of interested species respectively ϕ is the porosity of the rock q is the external volumetric flow rate c is the concentration of the fluid in the external flow c must be specified at points where injection q 0 takes place and is assumed to be equal to c at production points q 0 the diffusion coefficient d is symmetric and arises from two aspects molecular diffusion which is rather small for field scale problems and dispersion which is velocity dependent it takes the form 2 3 d u ϕ x y d m o l i d l o n g u e d t r a n u e where e a 2 2 matrix represents the orthogonal projection along the velocity vector and is given by e u i j u i u j u 2 1 i j 2 u u 1 u 2 and e i e is the orthogonal complement the diffusion coefficient d l o n g measures the dispersion in the direction of the flow and d t r a n shows that transverse to the flow to ensure the stability of the scheme in almost all of the previous works d is assumed to be strictly positive definite in this paper we assume d to be positive semidefinite therefore we have d 11 0 d 22 0 and d 12 d 21 moreover the pressure is uniquely determined up to a constant thus we assume ω p d x d y 0 to ensure the uniqueness however this assumption is not essential in this paper we consider a two component displacement only and the relationship of components can be stated as follows c c 1 1 c 2 where c i is the concentration of the i th component of the fluid mixture k is the permeability tensor following xu and yang 2020 for fractured porous media k can be expressed as follows 2 4 k k m ϵ k f δ η η 0 1 ξ 1 ξ ξ 2 ν ν t where k m ϵ and k f are the permeability tensor of matrix the thickness of the fracture and the tangential permeability of the fracture respectively 1 is the indicator function defined as 1 expr equals 1 if expr is true while equals 0 otherwise ν is the tangential unit vector of the fracture for variable η and ξ see fig 1 ξ o η and x o y are local coordinate system associated with the fracture l and global coordinate system respectively we notice that δ η η 0 1 ξ 1 ξ ξ 2 contains the information of position of the fracture for any point m ω the transformation between its local coordinates ξ m η m and global coordinates x m y m is given as ξ m η m cos θ sin θ sin θ cos θ x m y m where θ is the angle of the fracture by the coordinates transformation the expression of k under global coordinates x o y is 2 5 k k m ϵ k f δ sin θ x cos θ y η 0 1 ξ 1 cos θ x sin θ y ξ 2 ν ν t following xu and yang 2020 we call the expression k in 2 5 the hybrid dimensional representation of permeability tensor because the matrix part k m in 2 5 is of rank 2 and has a 2d support while the fracture part ϵ k f δ 1 ν ν t is of rank 1 and has a 1d support the expression above is only for fractured media with single fracture but can be extended to a fracture network as 2 6 k k m i 1 l ϵ i k f i δ i 1 i ν i ν i t where l is the number of fractures δ i and 1 i are the shorthands of their full expressions in 2 4 and 2 5 ϵ i k f i and ν i are the thickness the tangential permeability and the tangential unit vector of the i th fracture respectively see xu and yang 2020 for more information about k which is an important reinterpretation and extension of dfm in this paper we consider the mixed boundary condition for the flow equation 2 7 p p d x γ d ω u n k p n p n x γ n ω γ d for the transport equation we consider the following boundary conditions 2 8 u c d u c n c i n u n x γ i n 2 9 d u c n 0 x ω γ i n where n is the unit outer normal vector of the boundary ω γ i n x γ d u n 0 is the inflow boundary for convenience we assume p n 0 and γ d γ in γ out in this paper where γ o u t x γ d u n 0 is the outflow boundary in fact if p n 0 γ n is also a member of the inflow boundary if p n 0 γ n is the outflow boundary therefore this assumption is not essential moreover the initial concentration is given as 2 10 c x y 0 c 0 x y x y ω 2 2 basic notations we demonstrate the notations to be used throughout the paper we consider rectangular meshes only the techniques for triangular meshes can be obtained following the same lines given in sun and liu 2009 and chuenjarern et al 2019 with some minor changes let 0 x 1 2 x n x 1 2 1 and 0 y 1 2 y n y 1 2 1 be the grid points in the x and y directions respectively define i i x i 1 2 x i 1 2 and j j y j 1 2 y j 1 2 let k i j i i j j be a partition of ω and denote ω h i j k i j for simplicity we use k to denote a typical cell we use γ for all the cell interfaces and γ 0 γ ω is the set of interior edges for any e γ denote e to be the length of e moreover we define n e n x 1 0 if e is parallel to the y axis while n e n y 0 1 if e is parallel to the x axis furthermore we denote ω e ω n n e where n is the unit outer normal of ω and ω ω ω the mesh size in the x and y directions are given δ x i x i 1 2 x i 1 2 and δ y j y j 1 2 y j 1 2 respectively for simplicity we assume uniform meshes and denote δ x δ x i and δ y δ y j however this assumption is not essential the finite element space is chosen as w h k z z k q k k k ω h where q k k denotes the space of tensor product polynomials of degrees at most k in k we choose β 1 1 t to be a fixed vector that is not parallel to any normal of the element interfaces as we know e γ 0 is shared by two elements k ℓ and k r where β n ℓ 0 and β n r 0 with n ℓ and n r being the outward normals of k ℓ and k r for any z w h k z and z represent the values taken from k ℓ and k r respectively furthermore we use z z z and z 1 2 z z as the jump and average of z at the cell interfaces respectively 2 3 eg and ipdg methods for the flow equation in this subsection we use eg and ipdg methods for the flow equation both preserves the local mass conservation furthermore the eg method combines the advantages of both cg and dg methods this method preserves the local mass conservation of dg method while the degree of freedom is close to that of cg method moreover the eg method has a similar weak formulation as for the dg method yet whose implementation is simpler and more efficient now we first define the space of continuous piecewise polynomials w h k c w h k c ω where c ω represents the set of continuous functions in ω then we define w h k c 0 w h k c w h 0 which is called eg space by enriching the cg approximation space with piecewise constant functions for simplicity if not otherwise stated we use p u c as the numerical approximations from now on then the eg scheme for 2 1 is to find p w h k c 0 such that for any ξ w h k c 0 we have 2 11 a 0 p ξ a d p ξ f ξ where 2 12 a 0 p ξ k p ξ e γ 0 e k p n e ξ d s e γ 0 σ e e β e p ξ d s e γ 0 α e e γ e δ 1 p

s here γ 0 represents the set of interior edges γ d and γ n represent the sets of dirichlet and neumann boundaries respectively σ e and α e are two positive constants on each edges e n e d is the unit outer normal vector of e γ d β and γ are two positive constants usually greater than or equal to 1 u v k ω h k u v d x d y e g d s is a line integral with respect to g for 2 d case using the hybrid dimensional representation of k established in 2 5 we have 2 15 k p ξ k m p ξ ϵ k f δ 1 p ν ξ ν 2 16 k p n e k m p n e ϵ k f δ 1 p ν ν n e following lemma 4 1 in xu and yang 2020 2 17 ω δ 1 g x y d x d y l g x y d s where the line segment l is the support of δ 1 as shown in fig 1 notice that there is no fracture intersects the boundary so k k m on ω for e γ 0 e δ 1 g x y d s we have the following lemma whose proof will be given in appendix a lemma 2 1 let δ and 1 be the shorthands of their full expression in 2 4 and 2 5 for any continuous function g on ω we have 2 18 e δ 1 g x y d s g x y 1 ν n where x y is the coordinate of intersection point between the fracture l and curve e ν is the unit tangential vector of fracture l and n is the unit normal vector of curve e at x y with the lemma we can get e γ 0 e δ 1 g x y d s x y x f g x y 1 ν n immediately where x f represents the set of intersection points between the fracture and all the cell interior interfaces and n is the unit normal vector of edge e at x y based on 2 15 2 18 we can obtain the final version of the eg scheme for 2 1 in fractured porous media find p w h k c 0 such that for any ξ w h k c 0 2 19 a 0 p ξ a d p ξ a l p

γ p ξ x y a d p ξ and f ξ can be found in 2 13 and 2 14 respectively the existence and uniqueness of the eg solution is similar to those of dg method sun and wheeler 2005b the dof of eg method is much smaller than that of dg method especially for low order approximations for example for q 1 polynomials in a 2 dimensional rectangular mesh with n x n y elements the dg scheme has 4 n x n y dof while eg scheme only has n x 1 n y 1 n x n y 1 dof detailed information about dof can be found in sun and liu 2009 as a contrast we introduce ipdg scheme in fact we just replace w h k c 0 by w h k in 2 19 in section 4 we numerically simulate the pressure equation with the above two methods obviously eg and ipdg schemes with 2 11 or 2 19 are both symmetric to be more precise we use symmetric interior penalty galerkin sipg method sun and wheeler 2005b with different discrete spaces 2 4 ipdg method for the transport equation after obtaining the pressure p from 2 19 by eg or ipdg method we can calculate the velocity u as follows 2 22 u k p x k ω h 2 23 u n k p n σ e e β p k i p k j α e e γ δ 1 p k i p k j ν n x e k i k j a n d n e x t e r i o r t o k i 2 24 u n p n x γ n 2 25 u n k p n σ e e β p p d x γ d we note that u is defined at interior point in each element while only the normal component of velocity u n is defined on element interfaces and domain boundaries the above velocity will be used in the transport equation now we state the following theorem for the local mass conservation of the scheme theorem 2 1 numerical scheme 2 19 2 25 defined above is locally conservative proof numerical solution u is locally conservative if 2 26 k u n k d s k q d s in scheme 2 11 we take the test function ξ 1 w h k c 0 or w h k in each element k then we will obtain 2 26 the proof of

2 27 is also a symmetric form now we introduce the following definition that will be used in the bound preserving technique guo and yang 2017 definition 2 1 we say two fluxes u c u are consistent if u c u by taking c 1 in ω this definition was first introduced in guo and yang 2017 and was used to constructed the bound preserving technique from the definition it is easy to obtain the following lemma lemma 2 2 the numerical flux pair u n e u c n e given in 2 23 and 2 33 are consistent next we deal with u in the ipdg scheme for concentration c similar to the treatment of δ function in scheme of

the shape of fracture l actually can be a curve and the thickness ϵ and tangential permeability k f of the fracture can be a scalar function defined along l for the quadrature rule used for line integrals on l one can refer to the remark 4 3 in xu and yang 2020 note that if the fracture is straight and ϵ k f are constant the midpoint rule is enough for q 1 elements in the case of fracture

preserving in this section we consider euler forward time discretization and apply the bound preserving technique to construct second order physically relevant numerical approximations in r 2 we first discuss the techniques for cells away from ω and the boundary cells can be analyzed following the same lines we use o i j for the numerical approximation o in k i j and the cell average is o i j moreover we use o n to represent the solution o at time level n before analyzing the bound preserving schemes we would like to demonstrate the following key points 1 approximate r ϕ c directly instead of c due to the existence of ϕ in 2 2 we cannot extract the cell averages of c by simply taking the test function to be 1 2 take the l 2 projection of ϕ into w h k denoted as φ which is the approximation of the porosity 3 construct a limiter to maintain the cell average r i j and modify the numerical approximations of r i j such that 0 r i j φ which further yields c i j p k r i j φ 0 1 where p k is the l 2 projection into w h k if k 2 while p 1 c k is the interpolation of c at the four vertices of cell k in 2 27 we take ζ 1 in k i j k i j away from ω to obtain the equation satisfied by the cell average of r 3 1 r i j n 1 h c r u c h x d r u c h y d r u c h s r c ˇ q where 3 2 h c r u c 1 3 r i j n λ i i c u n e i j 1 2 c u n e i j 1 2 d x j j c u n e i 1 2 j c u n e i 1 2 j d y 3

quadrature points on i i and j j are denoted by x i 1 x i 2 and y j 1 y j 2 respectively the corresponding weights on the interval 1 2 1 2 are defined as w 1 and w 2 we will prove that if δ t is sufficiently small then h c h x d h y d h s are all positive and the results are given in the following three lemmas for simplicity of presentation if the denominator in a fraction is zero then the value of the fraction is defined as lemma 3 1 suppose r n 0 c n 0 then h s r c ˇ q 0 under the condition 3 6 δ t φ m 3 q m where 3 7 φ m min x y φ x y q m max i j β γ q x i β y j γ 0 lemma 3 2 suppose

d 22 u x y d 21 m max x y ω d 21 u x y λ 2 δ t δ y 2 we can find the proofs of lemma 3 1 and lemma 3 2 in appendix b and appendix c respectively for the diffusion terms h x d r u c and h y d r u c we can follow the same analysis in guo and yang 2017 with some minor changes therefore we skip the proof of lemma 3 3 next base on the above three lemmas we can state the following theorem theorem 3 1 suppose r n 0 c n 0 and the parameters α satisfy 3 10 3 11 3 13 and 3 14 then r i j n 1 0 under the conditions 3 6 and 3 8 now for these cells away from ω we have r i j n 1 0 to obtain r i j n 1 φ we only need to prove r 2 i j n 1 0 firstly substituting 2 22 2 25 into 2 11 yields the following equation 3 16 u ξ e γ 0 e u n e ξ d s e γ d e u n e d ξ d s e γ 0 e k ξ n e p d s e γ d e k ξ n e d p d s q ξ e γ n e p n ξ d s e γ d e k ξ n e d p d d s next let ξ 1 in 3 16 and ζ 1 in 2 27 then subtract 2 27 from 3 16 and use lemma 2 2 to obtain 3 17 r 2 i j n 1 h c r 2 u c 2 h x d r 2 u c 2 h y d r 2 u c 2 h s r 2 c ˇ 2 q where r 2 φ r c ˇ 2 1 c ˇ we can observe that the above equation is similar to 3 1 therefore following the same analysis above we conclude that r 2 i j n 1 0 for these cells away from ω and the result is given below theorem 3 2 suppose 0 r i j n φ and the conditions in theorem 3 1 are satisfied then 0 r i j n 1 φ next we study the cells near ω the boundary cells can be analyzed following the same lines with some minor changes except that the convection term is treated slightly differently because of the existence of the boundary without loss of generality we take the last cell denoted as k as an example to illustrate this point let the left and lower boundaries of the last cell k are the interior interfaces the upper boundary is the neumann boundary for pressure equation and the right boundary is the outflow boundary we take ζ 1 in k in 2 27 to obtain the equation satisfied by the cell average of r 3 18 r k n 1 h b c r u c h x b d r u c h y b d r u c h s r c ˇ q where 3 19 h b c r u c 1 3 r i j n λ i i c u n e i j 1 2 c p n i j 1 2 d x λ j j c u n e i 1 2 j c u n e o u t i 1 2 j d y 3 20 h x b d r u c 1 6 r i j n λ j j d 11 c x d 12 c y i 1 2 j α

can be analyzed following the same lines with some minor changes in guo and yang 2017 hence we only focus on the convection part and we have the following conclusion for h b c r u c 3 22 h b c r u c 0 if 3 23 δ t δ x δ t δ y a where a min β φ i 1 2 j β 6 u n e o u t i 1 2 j β φ i j 1 2 β 6 max β p n i j 1 2 β 0 φ i j 1 2 β 6 max u n e i j 1 2 β 0 φ i 1 2 j β 6 max u n e i 1 2 j β 0 we put the proof of 3 22 in appendix d moreover similar to the construction of 3 17 we can conclude that the cell average expression for r 2 is similar to the cell average for r therefore 0 r φ for boundary cells remark 3 1 the treatment of r 2 is different from that in guo and yang 2017 and chuenjarern et al 2019 in these two works we subtract the scheme of the concentration equation from that of the pressure equation to obtain that of the second concentration however with the combination of eg and dg it is impossible to subtract 3 16 and 2 27 due to the mismatch of the finite element spaces however what we want is not the full scheme but the cell averages therefore we took the test function to be 1 before we perform the subtraction 3 2 slope limiter with theorem 3 2 we can guarantee the numerical cell averages r to be physically relevant however the numerical approximation r may be negative or larger than φ therefore we need to apply a limiter to modify r as discussed in chuenjarern et al 2019 the procedure is given in the following steps 1 define s x k r x 0 take r r θ r φ φ r θ max x s r x φ r φ x r x φ 0 2 set r 2 φ r and repeat the above step for r 2 3 take r φ r 2 as the new approximation remark 3 2 after the above three steps we have 0 r φ it is easy to check that the limiter does not change the numerical cell average i e k r x d x k r x d x moreover it is proved that the limiter does not affect the accuracy see chuenjarern et al 2019 for more information 3 3 high order time discretization in this subsection we introduce third order strong stability preserving ssp time discretization to solve the ode system o t l o which is a convex combination of euler forward time discretization we consider the ssp runge kutta method 3 24 o 1 o n δ t l o n t n o 2 3 4 o n 1 4 o 1 δ t l o 1 t n 1 o n 1 1 3 o n 2 3 o 2 δ t l o 2 t n δ t 2 and the multi step method 3 25 o n 1 16 27 o n 3 δ t l o n t n 11 27 o n 3 12 11 δ t l o n 3 t n 3 more details of these time discretizations can be found in gottlieb et al 2001 2009 shu 1988 4 numerical experiments in this section we provide numerical examples to illustrate the convergence and accuracy of rdfm based on the eg and ipdg methods on non conforming meshes and effectiveness of the bound preserving technique we use the third order ssp runge kutta method 3 24 for the sake of simplicity the flows in these tests are driven by boundary conditions instead of source term i e q 0 in example 4 1 we use q 1 polynomials and q 2 polynomials to construct the finite element space respectively and test the accuracy of eg method for solving rdfm in example 4 2 q 1 polynomials are used to test the effectiveness of the bound preserving technique we simulate the example with without the bound preserving limiter for incompressible miscible displacements in fractured porous media and compare the results example 4 3 is a realistic case in flemisch et al 2018 where q 1 polynomials are used to simulate contaminant propagation in fractured porous media example 4 1 accuracy test of eg method in this example we test the accuracy of eg method by solving the following problem k p 0 x ω π π π π where k i 2 δ sin θ x cos θ y cos 2 θ sin θ cos θ sin θ cos θ sin 2 θ θ is an arbitrary fixed number the exact solution for any fixed θ is p x y sin cos θ x sin θ y e sin θ x cos θ y and the corresponding dirichlet boundary conditions are used the product of thickness and permeability is ϵ k f 2 and permeability of porous matrix is k m 1 by choosing different θ s meshes and polynomial degrees k in the finite element space we can test accuracy of eg method for dfm comprehensively we take three tests with different settings of θ s on rectangular meshes in which θ 5 3 is randomly chosen to make the fracture intersecting with gridcells non conformingly see fig 2 for illustration of settings of fracture and mesh the numerical results are given in table 1 and table 2 from the tables we can conclude that the eg method for the discrete fracture model is convergent moreover we find the rates of convergence are optimal on conforming meshes and o h on non conforming meshes example 4 2 bound preserving test we use this example to show the significance of the bound preserving technique in the simulation of miscible displacements in porous media let ω 0 2 π 0 2 π the initial concentrations c 0 is c 0 1 0 x π 2 3 π 4 y 5 π 4 0 o t h e r w i s e the left and right endpoints of the fracture are π 2 π 15 π 8 π respectively see fig 3 for details of settings of fracture and concentration at t 0 on 40 40 mesh other parameters are taken as ϕ 1 k m i ϵ k f 10 5 d 0 1 i c i n 0 moreover for pressure equation the left right boundaries are dirichlet boundaries with pressure p d l e f t 2 p d r i g h t 0 while the bottom top boundaries are neumann boundaries with p n 0 the left boundary is the inflow boundary with c i n 0 the right boundary is the outflow boundary we compute the concentration c at time t 0 1 0 5 0 9 s with n x n y 40 and δ t 0 001 h 2 h 2 π 40 the numerical results are shown in fig 4 from the figures we can see that the concentration c is between 0 and 1 to test the effectiveness of the bound preserving technique we simulate the example without the bound preserving limiter and the numerical results are shown in fig 5 we can conclude that the boundary preserving technique is effective example 4 3 a realistic case this example is a benchmark problem in flemisch et al 2018 modified from a real set of fractures from an interpreted outcrop in the sotra island the test case is a complex fracture network containing 63 fractures with different lengths and connectivity for simplicity the domain is uniformly shrunk to ω 0 1 4 0 1 2 with permeability k m 1 the fractures on 70 60 mesh are shown in fig 6 with ϵ k f 10 the detailed geometric data of fractures can be found in htt 0000 and xu and yang 2020 while we just scale down the geometry uniformly we simulate two cases one case is that the contaminant propagates from top to bottom and the other case is that the contaminant propagates from left to right moreover eg method and ipdg method introduced in section 2 are used to solve pressure p respectively the contour plots of numerical results for pressure equation are presented in figs 7 and 8 case 1 for pressure equation the left right boundaries are neumann boundaries with p n 0 while the top bottom boundaries are dirichlet boundaries with p d t o p 1 p d b o t t o m 0 respectively for concentration equation the upper boundary is inflow boundary with c i n 1 the lower boundary is outflow boundary with c c and the initial concentration is zero the other parameters are taken as ϕ 1 d 0 005 u i we compute the concentration c at time t 0 01 0 02 0 03 0 05 0 08 0 1 with n x 70 n y 60 and δ t 0 0005 h 2 h 0 02 the numerical results are shown as figs 9 and 10 respectively case 2 for pressure equation the top bottom boundaries are neumann boundaries with p n 0 while the left right boundaries are dirichlet boundaries with p d l e f t 1 p d r i g h t 0 for concentration equation the left boundary is inflow boundary with c i n 1 the right boundary is outflow boundary with c c and the initial concentration is zero the numerical results are shown as figs 11 and 12 respectively through the numerical simulation of above two cases we can conclude that the numerical approximation of the concentration c is between 0 and 1 and the contaminants propagate along the fractures which is in line with the relevant physical significance in addition the simulation results of eg method and ipdg method are almost the same but the degree of freedom of the eg method is smaller than that of the ipdg method 5 concluding remarks in this paper we combined the reinterpreted discrete fracture model with incompressible miscible displacements in porous media we have derived the eg scheme and ipdg scheme for the flow equation and the ipdg scheme for the transport equation and constructed conservative numerical fluxes yielding local mass conservation moreover the bound preserving technique was applied by combining eg method and ipdg method theoretical analysis and numerical experiments showed effectiveness of the bound preserving technique and good performance of rdfm based on the above two methods on non conforming meshes in addition to the above the explicit time method is used in this paper which leads to small time step size we can apply the implicit time methods such as the implicit pressure explicit saturation impes method and this is our future work we will also discuss the multiphase flow coupled hydro mechanical problems and other similar problems in 3d in the future credit authorship contribution statement hui guo conceptualization resources
