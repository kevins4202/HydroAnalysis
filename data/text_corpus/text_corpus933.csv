4665,this study aims to address a series of problems with agricultural irrigation water shortages and the poor efficiency of irrigation water use in severely colder irrigation areas in china for this purpose a support vector machine model based on the improved gray wolf optimization algorithm igwo svm was proposed to improve the accuracy of the evaluation of the resilience of the water resource system in the irrigation areas the results showed that the overall resilience of the selected irrigation areas was u shaped from 2007 to 2016 from a spatial perspective the results revealed that the resilience level of the western songnen plain irrigation area was less robust than that of the eastern sanjiang plain irrigation area a comparison with the svm model and svm models optimized by the gray wolf optimization algorithm gwo svm and the gravity search algorithm gsa svm showed that the mean square error of the igwo svm model was reduced by 7 69 12 19 and 25 the r2 was 0 33 1 11 and 2 73 and the accuracy was 2 32 4 74 and 16 03 respectively the running time of igwo svm was 278 42 s 498 63 s faster than those of gwo svm and gsa svm on average respectively the improvement in the results suggested that the igwo svm model was stable and could be used to evaluate water resource system resilience keywords sustainable development irrigation area resilience svm china 1 introduction water resources are an important part of natural resources and water resources in irrigation areas are an important basic resource for supporting the sustainable development of agricultural regions miniotti et al 2016 mao et al 2017 constructing irrigation areas can improve the efficiency of farmland irrigation promote regional rural economic construction and improve poverty in rural economies nechifor and winning 2017 bekchanov and lamers 2016 kumar et al 2018 however the lack of agricultural irrigation water insufficient irrigation water management and poor efficiency of irrigation water use li et al 2019 2020b seriously constrain the sustainable development of irrigation water resources to solve this problem scholars from various countries have proposed different theories in 1973 holling et al 1973 first introduced the concept of resilience into the field of ecology to express the ability of ecosystems to recover after being subjected to external pressure introducing resilience theory into irrigation areas can strengthen the scientific rigor of the analysis of water resource systems in irrigation areas which can subsequently solve the problems of regional macroscopic perspectives imperfect methodologies and insufficient targeted control schemes in regional sustainable development assessment gong 2017 the term resilience originates from the latin resilo used in the sense of things jumping and rebounding alexander 2013 since then the concept of resilience has migrated into the fields of economics meteorology and environmental science giannakis and bruggeman 2019 thomas and waring 2015 gönnert and gerkensmeier 2015 scott et al 2014 proved that irrigation efficiency affects the resilience of regional watersheds by comparing three regions with similar climatic conditions in central chile the southwestern united states and central and southern spain liu et al 2019c used a coupled model of the weighted mahalanobis distance and the approximate ideal solution ranking method to evaluate the resilience of water and land resources of 15 farms in jiansanjiang administration of heilongjiang province and proposed measures and countermeasures such as the improved utilization of water and soil resources returning farmland to forest and improving the level and effectiveness of agricultural mechanization based on the research trends of irrigation area and water resource resilience although the current research has a wider focus on water resource resilience from the carrier there is less research on the irrigation area level moreover research on the resilience of irrigation areas mostly targets the resilience of surrounding watersheds from a research process perspective most research has concentrated on improving the models while research on the variability of the influencing factors and the adjustment mechanism is relatively weak from the research method perspective most research adopts a single method for evaluating system resilience therefore conducting resilience research is highly significant to the water resource system in irrigation areas resilience is a basic attribute that describes the operating status of regional agricultural systems expressing it quantitatively is the most important issue for solving the problem of resilience of water resources in irrigation areas to reduce the impact of natural disasters in the coastal areas of the philippines orencio and fujii 2013 used the analytic hierarchy process ahp to compare the elements that can be applied to improve disaster resilience the results showed that both the environment and natural management are important liu et al 2019b used wind driven algorithms to optimize the improved projection pursuit model to evaluate the flood disaster resilience of 12 farms in the hongxinglong administration of heilongjiang province and found that the key factors to improve the regional flood disaster resilience are to strengthen the forest coverage rate paddy field coverage rate and protective forest area ratio compared with the ahp which is too subjective in the weighting process and is easily affected by the preferences of experts zhao and tang 2019 projection pursuit cannot guarantee that the projection value can extract the maximum variation information of the original data qian et al 2019 the support vector machine svm model was first proposed by vapnik et al 1994 and has been widely used in clean energy biochemistry agricultural water management and other fields li et al 2020a wang et al 2020 mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 zhang et al 2019b solved the ecological environmental damage caused by urbanization and improved the city s disaster resistance the support vector machine model was used to evaluate the resilience of 57 streets in shenzhen china it is concluded that the comprehensive resilience of streets with much rain complex terrain and weak infrastructure is poor providing government assistance could strengthen the city s social services and infrastructure management however the classification and regression accuracy of the svm model depends largely on the choice of the penalty parameter c and the kernel function parameter σ and the prediction performance will vary greatly depending on the choices of these parameters the traditional svm model uses k fold cross validation in the libsvm toolbox in matlab to optimize the parameters but the data in the test set for each verification are too small thus it is difficult to obtain an accurate false alarm rate classical optimization algorithms such as particle swarm optimization pso are prone to become trapped in a local optimum to select the optimal parameters and improve the accuracy and speed of svm models the improved gray wolf optimization algorithm igwo is often used to optimize svm the gray wolf optimization algorithm gwo was first proposed by mirjalili et al 2014 in 2014 in the article gray wolf optimizer this algorithm simulates the hierarchical system and hunting mechanism of gray wolves in nature due to its simple and efficient advantages it has been widely used in various fields yu and lu 2018 used the combination of projection pursuit and gray wolf algorithm to analyze the water consumption of the songhua river basin and the results provided a certain reference value for the optimal allocation of water resources and other cross basin integrated management tikhamarine et al 2019 and others combined the gray wolf algorithm with ai to evaluate the 130 year monthly historical natural flow of the aswan high dam in the nile river basin the results verify the accuracy of the gwo model in terms of forecasting results and provide help for extreme conditions such as floods and droughts and long term water resource management however the original gwo is prone to problems such as local optimization low precision and poor robustness for high dimensional multipeak function and multiobjective optimization problems deng et al 2019 proposed the differential evolution gray wolf optimization algorithm de gwo theory of combining the differential evolution algorithm and the gray wolf optimization algorithm to solve gwo s comparative disadvantages after updating the position of the wolf pack this approach performs differential evolution operations and selects mutations crossovers and other operations to create better individuals for the next generation de gwo helps the gwo algorithm avoid falling into local extrema and improves its overall search capabilities in view of this in this paper the initial evaluation index is screened by constructing the complex correlation coefficient r clustering coefficient of variation ccc rc cv model and the final evaluation index system is obtained combining the igwo and svm to solve the problem of selecting the optimal parameters for the traditional svm model improves svm performance makes resilience of water resources system in irrigation area rwrsia measurement research more scientific and provides more accurate evaluation models for similar research and feasibility suggestions for regional sustainable development the research objectives are as follows 1 construct an evaluation index system based on the ccc rc cv model 2 construct a rwrsia quantitative model based on igwo svm and analyze its temporal and spatial evolution characteristics and causes 3 evaluate the performance of the igwo svm model and explore the adaptive cycle path of rwrsia 2 materials and methodology 2 1 research area heilongjiang province is located in northeastern china at geographic coordinates of 121 11 135 05 east longitude and 43 25 53 33 north latitude it covers an area of 473 000 km2 the main rivers flowing through the province are heilong songhua nen wusuli and suifen which together fully constitute the surface water and groundwater resources in heilongjiang province the annual average temperature in the province ranges mostly between 5 c and 5 c decreasing from south to north the annual precipitation is mostly between 400 mm and 650 mm agricultural production in heilongjiang province occupies a special position in china providing 9 million tons of commodity grain to the country every year with the sanjiang plain and the songnen plain providing 90 however due to the one sided pursuit of increased grain production unreasonable water use and fertilization models have caused a series of ecological and environmental problems such as groundwater overexploitation and water environment deterioration li and singh 2020 zhang et al 2019a 2020 faiz et al 2020 the country attaches great importance to the food security and sustainable development of these two great plains in 2013 it proposed the overall plan for the comprehensive reform of modern agriculture supporting reforms in the two great plains of heilongjiang province research on the resilience of water resource systems in irrigation areas can reasonably regulate the number of motor wells relieve the pressure of groundwater overdraft enhance the anti seepage ability of channels and improve the water use efficiency of irrigation areas it can provide effective help for the sustainable development of water resources in the two plains and solve food security problems based on the principle that the selected irrigation areas include four types of large medium and small wells and that the spatial distribution of the selected irrigation areas is as uniform as possible this article uses four irrigation areas on the songnen plain in heilongjiang province and eight irrigation areas on the sanjiang plain as sample irrigation areas to study the rwrsia in heilongjiang province the specific administrative divisions are as follows fig 1 2 2 data sources from the heilongjiang reclamation statistical yearbook 2007 2016 qiqihar administration comprehensive water conservancy annual report 2007 2016 jiansanjiang administration comprehensive water conservancy annual report 2007 2016 through collation calculation and analysis we obtained natural economic ecological and social development indicator data corresponding to the 12 irrigation areas from 2007 to 2016 3 methodology this chapter explains in detail the process of index screening in section 3 1 from the construction of the preliminary collection to the use of the ccc rc cv model to screen the indicators in section 3 2 the support vector machine model igwo svm based on the improved gray wolf algorithm will be explained and the model mechanism of svm gwo and igwo will be explained in detail to express this process intuitively part of the flowchart of the methodology is attached as shown in fig 2 3 1 index screening 3 1 1 build a preliminary set of indicators combined with the explanation of the resilience of water resources yu 2007 the resilience of the water resource system of the irrigation area is now defined as follows the water resource system at the level of the irrigation area is stimulated by the outside world the ability to gradually recover to structural stability resource supply and ecological regulation through the joint action of itself and the outside world it can be seen from the above definition that in addition to its own effects external stresses are also a crucial factor affecting the resilience of the irrigation area s water resources system external forces such as nature and ecology are integrated into the ecological environment system the impact of economic factors on the water resource system of the irrigation area is integrated into the socioeconomic system the factors closely related to the agricultural water and soil of the irrigation area are integrated into the agricultural system and the field supporting facilities that affect the water resource system of the irrigation area are integrated into the technical management system therefore the criterion level is divided into the water resource system socioeconomic system ecological environment system agricultural system and technical management system various research indicators such as flood disaster resilience liu et al 2019a sustainable agricultural development wang et al 2019 and irrigation area water resource evaluation gao et al 2006 liu et al 2020 were collected according to the classification principle for the above criterion layer the indexes affecting the water resource recovery of the irrigation area were allocated to each layer forming a preliminary selection set with a total of 43 indicators as shown in fig 3 and the ccc rc cv model is used for quantitative screening 3 1 2 complex correlation coefficient r clustering coefficient of variation ccc rc cv model relative to the other variables the partial correlation coefficient is fixed focusing solely on the correlation between the two variables pearson s correlation coefficient only focuses on the correlation between distance variables the multiple correlation coefficient focuses on the correlation between one variable and multiple variables it can effectively control the correlation between indicators in the same indicator system which is very suitable for the first step of the indicator screening system then r clustering is performed on the evaluation indicators of the same indicator layer and the rationality of the classification is verified through the kw test finally as the method of selecting the largest difference and the largest information content among similar data the coefficient of variation has the characteristics of convenient calculation relative to factor analysis and cumulative information contribution rate therefore the ccc rc cv model is chosen to screen the indicators step 1 standardize data before index screening to eliminate the influences of different index data and their dimensions on the index selection work and facilitate the comparison between the indexes we used the extreme value method to standardize the data li et al 2020c 1 y ij x ij min 1 j m x ij max 1 j m x ij min 1 j m x ij j j 1 max 1 j m x ij x ij max 1 j m x ij min 1 j m x ij j j 2 in the formula j1 represents a positive index that is the larger the index value the stronger the promoting effect on resilience j2 represents a negative index that is the larger the index value the stronger the inhibitory effect on resilience step 2 complex correlation coefficient first define the critical value e of the complex correlation coefficient if the complex correlation coefficient is 0 9 the correlation between the indicators is considered to be strong wang 2010 therefore the critical value is set to 0 9 then separately calculate the complex correlation coefficient between the indicators in the same criterion layer assuming that the maximum value of the complex correlation coefficient of all indicators in a certain criterion layer is ρ max a ρ max e indicates that the indicator corresponding to the maximum value overlaps with other indicators in the same criterion layer and therefore the indicator corresponding to ρ max should be eliminated next recalculate the complex correlation coefficient in the criterion layer for the remaining indicators when the maximum value of the complex correlation coefficient in the same criterion layer is less than the critical value e this loop is terminated and screening is complete step 3 r clustering by calculating the total sum of the square deviations of the indicators in each criterion layer and r clustering the evaluation indexes when the total sum of square deviations is the smallest the final number of indexes is determined suppose n evaluation indicators are each in one category si is the sum of squared deviations of ith evaluation indicators i 1 2 m ni is the number of ith evaluation indicators yi j is the standardized sample value vector of the jth evaluation index in the ith category j 1 2 m yi is the sample mean vector of the ith index calculated as follows sum of squared deviations for each category of indicators 2 s i j 1 n i y i j y i y i j y i sum of squared deviations of all categories 3 s i 1 k j 1 n i y i j y i y i j y i step 4 r clustering number rationality verification note that the number of r clusters is set artificially and has a certain level of subjectivity the nonparametric kw test method is used to test each criterion layer after clustering if the significant difference level of the index test results of each criterion layer is sig 0 05 guo 2005 then no obvious difference exists between the indicators after clustering the number of clusters must be both reasonable and effective step 5 coefficient of variation finally the clustered index data are introduced into formula 4 to calculate the coefficient of variation leaving the index with the largest coefficient of variation in each category as the final key index 4 v j 1 n i 1 n x ij x j 2 x j in the formula vj is the coefficient of variation of the jth indicator n is the number of objects evaluated x j is the average value of the data of each year of the jth evaluation indicator and xij is the value of the jth year of the ith indicator 3 2 support vector machine model based on the improved gray wolf algorithm 3 2 1 basic principles of the svm model the main goal of an svm is to build a classification hyperplane to distinguish different samples and maximize the classification interval specifically the kernel function maps feature vectors from low dimensional space to high dimensional space to establish a discriminant function the required hyperplane is expressed by the following formula 5 ω ψ x b 0 in the formula ω is a high dimensional vector composed of weights and b is an offset since the actual situation most of the data are linear and inseparable therefore the relaxation variable ζ i 0 is introduced for each sample so the linear support vector machine is transformed into the following convex quadratic programming problem which is expressed by the formula as 6 min 1 2 ω 2 c i 1 n ζ i 0 s t y i ω t ψ x i b 1 ζ i ζ i 0 in the formula c 0 is the penalty parameter ζ i is the relaxation variable introducing lagrange multipliers to transform equation 6 into a dual problem the final hyperplane can be expressed as 7 i 1 n α i y i k x x i b 0 in the formula α i represents the lagrange coefficient and k x x i is the kernel function the commonly used kernel functions mainly include linear kernel functions polynomial kernel functions radial basis kernel functions sigmoid kernel functions and fourier kernel functions the radial basis kernel function has better learning ability and is more commonly used this study uses the radial basis function as the kernel function karimi et al 2020 8 k x j x i exp x j x i 2 2 σ 2 the major influences on the results of the hyperplane solution are the penalty parameter c and the kernel function parameter σ c represents the penalty for exceeding the error range and is used to adjust the fit of the data and σ controls the radial action range of the kernel function when the value is too small overfitting may occur and when the value is too large the learning ability is adversely affected because the choices of the values of the parameters c and σ crucially influence the results the igwo is used to optimize these parameters to improve model accuracy 3 2 2 standard gray wolf optimization algorithm the gwo is a group optimization algorithm that iteratively finds the optimal value by simulating the hierarchy and predation strategy of the wolf pack the first level of the hierarchy is called α and is the leader of the population the second layer is called β this layer is mainly responsible for assisting with work in the population and acting as a bridge the third layer is called σ this layer is mainly responsible for investigation guard duty and other tasks the α and β wolves with poor adaptability will be reduced to σ wolves the bottom layer is called ω and is mainly responsible for maintaining a balance within the population the formula is as follows 9 d c x p t x t x t 1 x p t a d in the formula a and c are coefficient vectors t is the number of iterations and xp and x represent the position vectors of the prey and gray wolf respectively the expressions of coefficient vectors a and c are as follows 10 a 2 a r 1 a c 2 r 2 in the formula r1 and r2 are random vectors in the range 0 1 a is the convergence factor and decreases linearly from 2 to 0 as the number of iterations increases after starting the hunting process gray wolves identify prey locations and surround the prey when the gray wolf recognizes the position of the prey β and σ guide the wolf pack to surround the prey under the leadership of α in gwo it is assumed that the positions of the α β and σ wolves are most likely to be the position of prey that is the optimal solution for the wolf pack search during the search and optimization process α β and σ wolves are regarded as the three optimal search solutions while the remaining wolves are regarded as ω wolves the algorithm updates the positions of ω wolves according to the positions of the first three leadership level wolves and the distance formula is used to effectively adjust the position of the ω wolves the mathematical model is as follows 11 d α c 1 x α x d β c 2 x β x d σ c 3 x σ x in the formula x α x β and x σ represent the current position of α β and the σ wolf respectively d α d β and d σ represent the distance between the current wolf and other individuals c1 c2 and c3 are random vectors x is the current gray wolf s position xα 12 x 1 x α a 1 d α x 2 x β a 2 d β x 3 x σ a 3 d σ 13 x t 1 x 1 x 2 x 3 3 equation 12 defines the steps and directions of the ω individuals in the wolves towards α β and advance and equation 13 defines the final position of ω 3 2 3 improved gray wolf optimization algorithm evolving the wolves in a better direction is the basis for ensuring the competitiveness of the population the ideal vector mutation factor is the basis for ensuring that the gwo algorithm evolves toward the optimal solution thus the more competitive individuals are selected to be parents in the evolutionary population therefore the difference vectors of the two wolves β and σ are determined and a dynamic scaling factor is superimposed with the wolf α to construct a mutation factor for the gwo algorithm based on differential evolution its variation factor vector function expression is 14 v i t 1 x α t w x β t x σ t in the formula w is a dynamically changing scaling factor and its value is as follows 15 w f max f min t max t 1 t max f min in the formula fmin and fmax are the minimum and maximum scaling factors tmax is the maximum number of iterations and t is the current number of iterations dynamically changing the scaling factor w to target the defect that the basic gwo algorithm is prone to fall into local extrema in the early search stage the differential vector is dynamically adjusted by increasing the scaling factor to improve the global exploration ability of the gwo algorithm during the early search stage by reducing the scaling factor the gwo algorithm has a strong local development ability in the later search period which improves its search accuracy the target individual x i t in the wolf pack is crossed with the resulting mutation vector v i t 1 to generate an intermediate individual u i t 1 by randomly selecting at least one gene in u i t 1 provided by v i t 1 the mutation of x i t can be guaranteed its crossover operation is 16 u i t 1 x ij s r a n d j a n d j r a n d i v ij i 1 s r a n d j o r j r a n d i in the formula s represents the cross probability constant a proper selection of the crossover probability s not only improves the convergence speed and local search ability of the algorithm but also accelerates its global search speed and solution diversity then the intermediate individuals u i t 1 and x i t generated by the mutation and crossover operations are assessed and the individuals with good fitness are selected as the next generation of wolves as follows 17 x i t 1 x i t f x i t f v i t 1 v i t 1 f x i t f v i t 1 in the formula f is the fitness function constructed the distance between the individuals in the wolves is less than fclose and its value is 18 f close 1 2 k i 0 k f i max f i min 2 in the formula k is the number of objective functions f i max and f i min are the maximum and minimum values of the ith objective function and the good fitness value in x i t and v i t 1 is selected as the t 1th generation individual 4 results and discussion 4 1 index optimization through the ccc rc cv model we identified 13 indicators see table 1 and table 2 below after calculating the complex correlation coefficients the water resource system values were all below 0 9 so no additional screening was necessary except for b7 and b8 in the first round of the technical management system they were all above 0 9 the calculation continued after the maximum value of 0 998 b1 was screened out after five rounds of calculation the remaining index complex correlation coefficients were all 0 9 and the indicators b3 b5 b7 and b8 were obtained through a similar process the obtained agricultural system screening indicators were c1 c3 c6 c7 c8 c10 c11 and c12 the ecological environment system screening indicators were d2 d3 and d5 and the social economic system screening indicators were e1 e4 e6 e7 e9 e11 e12 and e13 then the category was determined column 3 of table 2 where a kw test sig 0 05 indicates that the number of clusters is reasonable column 4 of table 2 finally the coefficient of variation of each indicator in the same category was calculated and the largest value was chosen to represent the category the final screening indicators were a1 a3 a5 b3 b7 c1 c7 c10 d3 d5 e1 e12 and e13 note that 1 due to the larger number of indicators in the single indicator layer of the agricultural system and the social economic system if the unified calculation is prone to the situation that multiple indicator values are 1 it is not suitable to judge the screening items thus spss 22 0 was used to perform the following calculation by dividing them into two subindex layers c1 c6 becomes one category c7 c12 is another category e1 e6 becomes a category and e7 e13 becomes a category then the complex correlation coefficient is calculated 2 when the index of the clustering category alone represents an aspect of the evaluation system it is directly selected such as index a5 of the water resources system the same logic holds for b3 and d5 4 2 level simulation interval determination based on relevant scholarly research we set the evaluation standard of the resilience grade to 4 levels sun et al 2011 li 2010 for indicators without grading standards the average value of china was used as the passing threshold and the average value of developed countries was used as the optimal value the equal ratio method was used to allocate each node reasonably for example the coefficient of the effective use of irrigation water is 0 9 in israel and 0 55 in china ministry of water resources of the prc 2019 the characteristic nodes of each index are shown in table 3 bringing the threshold of each indicator into the igwo svm model use the original data set to randomly generate training samples and test samples according to table 3 and 4 standard intervals of water resource system resilience in the irrigation area are obtained and 400 sets of samples are generated in each interval a total of 1600 sets of samples were generated shuffle the order randomly select 1200 groups as the training set and 400 groups as the test set to train the model the resilience of the water resource system in the heilongjiang irrigation area is divided into 4 intervals see table 4 below for details 4 3 evaluation of the resilience of water resource systems in irrigation areas 4 3 1 analysis of time variation characteristics and driving factors we substituted the summation data of the indicators of the 12 irrigation areas from 2007 to 2016 into the igwo svm model to obtain an interannual change chart as shown in fig 4 the broken line is the calculation curve and the dotted line is the fitting curve the results showed that the overall resilience first showed an upward trend and then a downward trend in 2007 and 2008 the resilience reached the upper range of level iv in 2010 it was at the lower range of level ii and in 2009 and 2011 2014 it was at the upper range of level iii then from 2015 to 2016 it was at the lower range of level iii the weight of the indicator is determined by calculating the w absolute value of each index then the importance of each indicator to the evaluation result is analyzed and the key driving factors affecting the rwrsia in 12 irrigation areas are revealed the results are shown in fig 5 where it can be seen that rainfall is the most important factor affecting the rwrsia in addition the per capita cultivated land area the effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water the annual average humidity the annual average temperature the proportion of the water surface area and the anti seepage rate of the main canal system are important factors that affect the rwrsia comparing chen et al s 2014 research on the resilience of the water resource system in the hanjiang river basin and yu s 2007 research on the resilience of the water resource system in shanxi province it is found that the determination of rainfall as the most critical driving factor is the same as the above research results indicating that rainfall is the most critical factor for the resilience of water resources the conclusions of the driving factors are more reliable makropoulos et al 2018 also obtained key indicators such as temperature and rainfall when studying the resilience of urban water resource systems in the netherlands this is the same as the key driver analysis results of this article compared with the above research results this article also notes that the driving factors that are obviously characteristic of irrigation areas such as the effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water and the per capita arable land area in the agricultural system and the anti seepage rate of the backbone canal system in the technical management system are also important for the resilience of the irrigation area s water resources system and play a vital role therefore the key driving factors of water resource system resilience in irrigation areas obtained in this paper reflect reasonable results in 2007 and 2008 due to insufficient annual rainfall the humidity was insufficient the utilization efficiency of farmland irrigation water was not high and anti seepage work on the backbone canal system was not yet in place other comprehensive factors restricted the overall level of resilience in those two years which resulted in the level iv state after 2009 the resilience gradually stabilized fluctuating basically among the lower level ii and upper level iii states in addition to objective reasons such as abundant rainfall completed infrastructure improved the efficiency of irrigation water utilization and the enhancement of canal system impermeability was also crucial however in 2015 and 2016 due to the serious annual shortage of rainfall in the 12 irrigation areas the levels reached only 463 8 mm and 493 5 mm respectively the single index reached only level iv which is far below the average level although considerable progress has been made in water resource utilization in the irrigation area the annual average rainfall still has a greater impact on rwrsia thus the water resource resilience gradually returned to the lower range of level iii however due to the relatively flat rainfall in 2008 and 2016 table 5 shows that the resilience index in 2016 increased by 9 32 compared to 2008 therefore with less restriction of the important natural factors the improvement of the supporting facilities of rwrsia in heilongjiang province caused the overall resilience level of the region to follow an upward trend 4 3 2 analysis of the characteristics of spatiotemporal variation because 2008 and 2016 are the obvious time variable points of the calculation curve and 2012 is the lowest point of the fitting curve the three time nodes of 2008 2012 and 2016 were analyzed as typical years and the data of each irrigation area for 3 years were substituted into the igwo svm model to analyze the spatial differences of the 12 irrigation areas the overall average value of the two great plains in the current year was used to facilitate the comparative analysis of the 4 irrigation areas under the songnen plain in the west and the 8 irrigation areas under the sanjiang plain in the east as table 5 shows in 2008 among the study areas the resilience of the erdaohe and xingkaihu irrigation areas is grade ii the chahayang fuyu jiangchuan and suibin irrigation areas are grade iv and the remaining 6 irrigation areas have a resilience level of grade iii the resilience index of the fuyu irrigation area reached a minimum of 3 713 which was 1 705 lower than that of the erdaohe irrigation area which had the highest resilience index in 2012 compared with 2008 the resilience increased by 15 4 and 12 irrigation areas improved since 2008 among these the jiangchuan irrigation area increased by up to 53 9 except for the fuyu irrigation area which is still grade iv and the chahayang tailai and qixing irrigation areas which are grade iii the remaining seven irrigation areas all reached grade ii and the jiangchuan irrigation area even jumped to grade i however the jiangchuan irrigation area with the highest resilience index is 2 1069 higher than the lowest fuyu irrigation area which is an obvious gap in 2016 compared with 2008 this is an increase of 9 3 but compared with 2012 it is a decrease of 6 7 among the study areas the resilience index of 6 irrigation areas fell compared with 2012 the tailai and jiangchuan irrigation areas had the most obvious drops reaching 17 5 and 75 9 respectively mainly due to rainfall reduction the rainfall in the jiangchuan irrigation area reached 838 4 mm in 2012 compared with 454 4 mm and 569 8 mm in 2008 and 2016 respectively overall the 6 irrigation areas with an increased resilience index are not as good as the 6 irrigation areas with a decrease resulting in the overall decline in 2016 from the irrigation area perspective jiangchuan yi an erdaohe xingkaihu and daxing have a high overall resilience index among these the jiangchuan irrigation area had high rainfall in 2012 and its overall resilience level was high the resilience in the xingkaihu irrigation area is mainly due to its large water surface area and abundant surface water resources which makes its overall resilience level high while the other three irrigation areas in smaller irrigation districts use sprinkler irrigation methods and apply drip rather than flood irrigation which greatly increases the irrigation water utilization coefficient and results in a higher water resource resilience index to visually express the temporal and spatial evolution of the 12 irrigation areas and the two great plains as a whole we plotted the rwrsia level spatial change graph and rate graph of each time node according to the data in table 5 superimposed dem can reflect the topographic features of heilongjiang province it can also be shown that the irrigation area selected in this article is on the sanjiang plain and songnen plain at the same time it can be seen that the water vapor and climatic conditions of the sanjiang plain and the songnen plain are different and some comparative analysis can be done bing et al 2017 the resilience levels of different periods are superimposed on dem to obtain the spatial changes and rate of change of water resilience levels of 12 irrigation areas in heilongjiang province in 2008 2012 and 2016 as fig 6 shows the resilience of the songnen plain irrigation area in the west of heilongjiang province is generally lower than that in the sanjiang plain irrigation area in the east the main reason is that the western irrigation areas consist largely of dry fields the land surface does not store water and generally does not require seasonal irrigation most of the crops planted in this area are less water intensive during the growth cycle such as corn and wheat the irrigation areas in the east are dominated by rice paddy fields especially along the rivers where abundant surface water and groundwater resources exist almost every year there is seasonal water accumulation poor land storage capacity is the fundamental reason why the western irrigation area is not as resilient as the eastern irrigation area although the irrigation areas in the east are all paddy fields their degree of resilience also varies among them the jiangchuan and wutonghe irrigation areas are distributed on both banks of the songhua river and have approximately the same total amount of irrigation water the results show that the resilience level of water resources in these areas is roughly similar the qixing and daxing irrigation areas are near the administration bureau basically in the inland area however because daxing is a well irrigation area it has abundant groundwater resources and is superior to qixing in terms of its irrigation water effective utilization coefficient and backbone canal system seepage prevention rate therefore the overall resilience of the daxing irrigation area is higher than that of qixing the erdaohe irrigation area is close to the 859 irrigation area and close to the bielahong river surface water resources are abundant and rainfall has been abundant for many years therefore from the results the resilience of these two irrigation areas has been at relatively high levels the xingkaihu irrigation area is located in the southeastern region of heilongjiang province because of its proximity to xingkai lake the proportion of its water surface area is the largest among the 12 irrigation areas and its resilience has remained relatively stable in the lower range of level ii and the upper range of level iii for many years from the change rate chart the most obvious changes occur in the jiangchuan irrigation area which further highlights the large impact of rainfall on the resilience of the water resource system in that irrigation area closely followed by the suibin irrigation area because the growth rate is higher than the decline rate the overall recovery force index is on the rise the chahayang fuyu yi an qixing and daxing irrigation areas show an increasing trend in both stages the remaining 7 irrigation areas first increased and then declined but no irrigation area showed a downward trend in either stage among the study areas the growth rate of the fuyu and daxing irrigation areas in the 2012 2016 stage exceeded that in the 2008 2012 stage indicating that the resilience index of these two irrigation areas has steadily accelerated three of the five irrigated areas that have grown in both stages are located in the songnen plain indicating that although the overall resilience index of the songnen plain is not as good as that of the sanjiang plain it still shows a positive trend although the overall resilience level of the songnen plain irrigation area in the west is lower than that in the sanjiang plain irrigation area in the east it has been improving the irrigation water resilience level of the irrigation area along the river is significantly higher than that of the inland area the irrigation area has a larger proportion of water surface area and the level of resilience is relatively stable small well irrigated areas are generally superior to large and medium sized irrigated areas 4 4 igwo svm model performance test to test the performance of the igwo svm model we used the svm gsa svm and gwo svm models to evaluate the resilience of the water resource system in 12 sample irrigation areas from 2007 to 2016 among these models the traditional svm model uses the libsvm model created by professor lin chin jen of taiwan university for calculation chang and lin 2011 we set the number of iterations of gsa svm gwo svm igwo svm to 50 the model evaluation is divided into two parts accuracy and efficiency and the accuracy is divided into classification accuracy calculated by c svc and mean square error and determination coefficient r2 of regression analysis by ε svr the efficiency mainly addresses the running time of algorithm t seconds to avoid the effects of randomness the four models were executed 50 times each and their average values are listed in table 6 as table 6 shows igwo svm is better than gwo svm gsa svm and svm in all aspects compared with the gwo svm gsa svm and svm models igwo svm reduced the mean square error by 7 69 12 19 and 25 improved the r2 by 0 33 1 11 and 2 73 and improved the accuracy rate by 2 32 4 74 and 16 03 respectively moreover in terms of running time igwo svm is also faster than gwo svm and gsa svm by 278 42 s and 498 63 s on average respectively therefore the igwo svm model has both accuracy and efficiency advantages 4 5 reliability analysis of the igwo svm model to test the reliability of the igwo svm model we took 2016 as an example and evaluated the 12 irrigation areas with the svm gsa svm gwo svm and igwo svm models the results are shown in table 7 in table 7 compared with other traditional models the igwo svm model obtains 10 identical evaluation results its similarity rate is as high as 83 3 only the erdaohe and 859 irrigation areas have slightly different evaluation levels its results are identical to the evaluation results of the gwo svm model and differ from the gsa svm model evaluation result only in the 859 irrigation area and from the svm model evaluation result only in the erdaohe and 859 irrigation areas through further analysis of the resilience index obtained by each model combined with the key driving factors the three most weighted indicators of rainfall per capita arable land area and irrigation water effective utilization coefficient in the erdaohe irrigation area are slightly smaller than those in daxing irrigation area among the key driving factors only the key canal system has an anti seepage rate in the erdaohe irrigation area which is higher than that in the daxing irrigation area based on the above the resilience index of the erdaohe irrigation area should be slightly larger than that of the daxing irrigation area and the evaluation results of the svm model and igwo svm model are more consistent except for the indicator of the water surface area ratio the other indicators are relatively close in the 859 irrigation area and the jiangchuan irrigation area however the water surface area ratio of the 859 irrigation area is approximately 5 higher than that of the jiangchuan irrigation area the resilience index of the irrigation area should be slightly smaller than that of the jiangchuan irrigation area only the evaluation results of the gwo svm and igwo svm models are more consistent with the above situation in summary the igwo svm model is reliable from the grade evaluation results in combination with the analysis of key driving factors the igwo svm results in the evaluation of the resilience index are more in line with the actual situation therefore the igwo svm model is more reliable 4 6 research on the adaptive circulation paths of irrigation areas based on the typical year 2016 the overall resilience level of the 12 irrigation areas is at level iii which is still some distance away from level i therefore we calculated the w absolute value of the 13 indicators in 2016 to determine the weights of the indicators combined them with the key driving factors of various irrigation areas and proposed a path for differentiated resilience construction some reasonable suggestions for improving rwrsia in heilongjiang province are provided for reference the calculation results are shown in table 8 where the values in brackets are the weight rankings of the indicators in the irrigation area as table 8 shows rainfall a1 per capita arable land area c10 and the irrigation water effective utilization coefficient c7 are the three most important factors affecting rwrsia in the 12 irrigation areas among these a1 is the most important factor and only in the three small well irrigation areas of yi an qixing and erdaohe is c7 c10 in all c10 c7 because the overall crop planting structure in heilongjiang province is relatively stable and the output of commercial grains has achieved good results hasty improvements may have many effects and rainfall is an uncontrollable natural factor therefore the three indicators that are relatively important for all irrigation areas target only adjusting the irrigation water effective utilization factor the average irrigation water effective utilization coefficient of the 12 irrigation areas in heilongjiang province in 2016 was 0 578 which is still well distant from that of advanced countries such as israel the investigation found that in many irrigation areas in heilongjiang province the actual irrigation quota far exceeded the designed irrigation quota the reasons mainly include unreasonable irrigation methods channel leakage nodal openings failure to consider water reuse for multiple uses etc for large and medium sized irrigation areas sprinkler irrigation or aqueducts can be used in the field advanced technologies such as microspray irrigation drip irrigation and film covered irrigation are unsuitable for large scale irrigation areas due to high costs but for small or well irrigation areas as mentioned above the three irrigation areas with higher weights can be selected and used according to the local economic level which is important for improving the effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water the purpose is to improve the resilience of the water resource system the importance of annual average humidity a3 annual average temperature a5 number of electromechanical wells per unit b3 anti seepage rate of backbone canal system b7 and proportion of water surface area d3 vary among individual irrigation areas the number of electromechanical wells per unit is an important factor that affects the irrigation areas of chahayang daxing wutonghe and 859 it is recommended that the above four irrigation areas reduce the use of electromechanical wells and bury some alternative mechanical wells surface water and groundwater replacement can be achieved through project water exchange further groundwater should be conserved to avoid the formation of a funnel zone the anti seepage rate of the backbone canal system is an important factor affecting the irrigation areas of yi an qixing erdaohe and jiangchuan it is suggested that the above four irrigation areas should consider installing composite anti seepage membranes to supplement traditional anti seepage measures this approach not only has anti seepage and reinforcement functions but also has a filtration effect in practical engineering applications it can effectively prevent the occurrence of sudden frost and is more suitable for irrigation areas in northern cold regions such as heilongjiang province it should be noted that most of the channels below the branch canal are still earth channels if a tightly compacted paint anti seepage layer can be laid on the surface of the irrigation canal bed the anti seepage effect will be greatly enhanced the proportion of water surface area is an important factor affecting the irrigation areas of fuyu tailai yi an xingkaihu and suibin but because the indicator remains at a relatively stable level year round in the five irrigation areas rash improvements are not appropriate the roles of a3 and a5 are not discussed since these are natural factors the plantation area at the end of the year d5 labor compensation of employees e1 total water conservancy investment e12 population growth rate e13 and per capita food occupancy c1 are less important factors affecting the rwrsia therefore we did not adjust for these factors 4 7 prediction of the control effect of water resource resilience in irrigation areas to analyze the adaptive path of each irrigation area according to 4 6 we predict the change in each index after regulation and analyze the 2020 and 2030 rwrsia on the basis of the 2016 rwrsia table 9 since the five indicators c1 d5 e1 e12 and e13 are relatively unimportant indicators in each irrigation area the results have little impact on the rwrsia therefore this section only predicts the remaining 8 indicators rainfall annual average humidity and annual average temperature are natural uncontrollable factors so the average value of each irrigation area during the ten years from 2007 to 2016 is drawn as the predicted value for 2020 and 2030 the values are 536 2 mm 70 8 and 3 5 since 2008 the area of arable land in the 12 sample irrigation areas has been relatively stable and the amount of population change is not obvious with the development of the social economy the number of farmers may slightly decrease year by year decrease by approximately 1 000 people annually from 2013 to 2016 it is now assumed that the area of arable land remains unchanged and the population of the irrigation area decreases by 1 000 people year by year the area of arable land in 2016 was 455 970 and the total population of the 12 irrigation districts was 217 607 that is the per capita arable land area in 2020 is 455970 217607 4000 2 13 similarly the per capita arable land area in 2030 is 2 24 according to the requirements of the national sustainable agriculture development plan 2015 2030 to determine the red line for water efficiency control the effective utilization coefficient of farmland irrigation water will reach 0 55 and 0 6 or more by 2020 and 2030 respectively considering that the average effective use coefficient of irrigation water in 2016 for 12 irrigation areas was 0 578 it is now proposed that the effective use coefficients of irrigation water in 2020 and 2030 are 0 58 and 0 6 respectively from 2009 to 2016 the proportion of water surface area has been stable at 0 088 0 09 with very small fluctuations so it is proposed to be 0 089 in 2020 and 2030 in terms of the number of electromechanical wells per unit pure well irrigation areas include daxing irrigation area and yi an irrigation area in 2020 the remaining 10 irrigation areas in impure well irrigation areas will be closed by 1 3 leaving a total of 15 806 eyes in 12 irrigation areas assuming that the area of cultivated land remains unchanged at 455 970 ha or 4559 7 square kilometers the number of electromechanical wells per unit is 3 46 set km2 by 2030 it is expected that all electromechanical wells in the remaining 10 irrigation areas will be closed leaving a total of 2348 holes in 12 irrigation areas or 0 52 set km2 surface water irrigation will be used to conserve groundwater resources in terms of the anti seepage rate of the backbone canal system with the improvement of canal system engineering the anti seepage rate of the backbone canal system showed a steady and rising trend during the 10 years from 2007 to 2016 among them 8 14 in 2007 and 14 58 in 2016 the average annual growth rate is 0 64 assuming a constant annual growth rate it will be 17 15 in 2020 and 20 98 in 2030 5 conclusion in this study we analyzed the connotation of water resource resilience constructed an rwrsia evaluation index system and selected evaluation indexes through the ccc rc cv model based on the igwo svm model we analyzed the spatial and temporal evolution of rwrsia in heilongjiang province from 2007 to 2016 the improvement of basic field support facilities and the rational use of water resources caused an overall upward trend from 2007 to 2012 due to the lack of the important natural factor of rainfall from 2013 to 2016 the single indicators reached only grade iv in 2015 and 2016 decreasing the overall level rainfall was roughly the same in 2008 and 2016 but resilience in 2016 increased by 9 32 compared to 2008 from a spatial scale the overall irrigation area in the west is not as good as that in the east primarily because the west is dominated by dry fields whose land surface does not store water well while the east is dominated by paddy fields and has abundant surface water and groundwater resources in the eastern irrigation areas the rwrsia along the river is significantly higher than that of the inland areas irrigation areas with a large proportion of water surface area have relatively stable resilience levels compared with the gwo svm gsa svm and svm models it is revealed that igwo svm has large advantages in all aspects of performance its mean square error mse is well below those of the gwo svm gsa svm and svm models 7 69 12 19 and 25 respectively its r2 increased by 0 33 1 11 and 2 73 respectively and its accuracy increased by 2 32 4 74 and 16 03 respectively in terms of running time igwo svm is on average 278 42 s and 498 63 s faster than gwo svm and gsa svm these results sufficiently indicate the accuracy and efficiency advantages of the igwo svm model research on rwrsia measurement is a timely and difficult issue however problems such as the inadequate selection of indicators due to the difficulty of obtaining data and insufficient time series may have some impact on the evaluation results of rwrsia in the future improving data monitoring of the water and soil environment in irrigation areas will benefit the effective resolution of scientific issues related to the water resource

4665,this study aims to address a series of problems with agricultural irrigation water shortages and the poor efficiency of irrigation water use in severely colder irrigation areas in china for this purpose a support vector machine model based on the improved gray wolf optimization algorithm igwo svm was proposed to improve the accuracy of the evaluation of the resilience of the water resource system in the irrigation areas the results showed that the overall resilience of the selected irrigation areas was u shaped from 2007 to 2016 from a spatial perspective the results revealed that the resilience level of the western songnen plain irrigation area was less robust than that of the eastern sanjiang plain irrigation area a comparison with the svm model and svm models optimized by the gray wolf optimization algorithm gwo svm and the gravity search algorithm gsa svm showed that the mean square error of the igwo svm model was reduced by 7 69 12 19 and 25 the r2 was 0 33 1 11 and 2 73 and the accuracy was 2 32 4 74 and 16 03 respectively the running time of igwo svm was 278 42 s 498 63 s faster than those of gwo svm and gsa svm on average respectively the improvement in the results suggested that the igwo svm model was stable and could be used to evaluate water resource system resilience keywords sustainable development irrigation area resilience svm china 1 introduction water resources are an important part of natural resources and water resources in irrigation areas are an important basic resource for supporting the sustainable development of agricultural regions miniotti et al 2016 mao et al 2017 constructing irrigation areas can improve the efficiency of farmland irrigation promote regional rural economic construction and improve poverty in rural economies nechifor and winning 2017 bekchanov and lamers 2016 kumar et al 2018 however the lack of agricultural irrigation water insufficient irrigation water management and poor efficiency of irrigation water use li et al 2019 2020b seriously constrain the sustainable development of irrigation water resources to solve this problem scholars from various countries have proposed different theories in 1973 holling et al 1973 first introduced the concept of resilience into the field of ecology to express the ability of ecosystems to recover after being subjected to external pressure introducing resilience theory into irrigation areas can strengthen the scientific rigor of the analysis of water resource systems in irrigation areas which can subsequently solve the problems of regional macroscopic perspectives imperfect methodologies and insufficient targeted control schemes in regional sustainable development assessment gong 2017 the term resilience originates from the latin resilo used in the sense of things jumping and rebounding alexander 2013 since then the concept of resilience has migrated into the fields of economics meteorology and environmental science giannakis and bruggeman 2019 thomas and waring 2015 gönnert and gerkensmeier 2015 scott et al 2014 proved that irrigation efficiency affects the resilience of regional watersheds by comparing three regions with similar climatic conditions in central chile the southwestern united states and central and southern spain liu et al 2019c used a coupled model of the weighted mahalanobis distance and the approximate ideal solution ranking method to evaluate the resilience of water and land resources of 15 farms in jiansanjiang administration of heilongjiang province and proposed measures and countermeasures such as the improved utilization of water and soil resources returning farmland to forest and improving the level and effectiveness of agricultural mechanization based on the research trends of irrigation area and water resource resilience although the current research has a wider focus on water resource resilience from the carrier there is less research on the irrigation area level moreover research on the resilience of irrigation areas mostly targets the resilience of surrounding watersheds from a research process perspective most research has concentrated on improving the models while research on the variability of the influencing factors and the adjustment mechanism is relatively weak from the research method perspective most research adopts a single method for evaluating system resilience therefore conducting resilience research is highly significant to the water resource system in irrigation areas resilience is a basic attribute that describes the operating status of regional agricultural systems expressing it quantitatively is the most important issue for solving the problem of resilience of water resources in irrigation areas to reduce the impact of natural disasters in the coastal areas of the philippines orencio and fujii 2013 used the analytic hierarchy process ahp to compare the elements that can be applied to improve disaster resilience the results showed that both the environment and natural management are important liu et al 2019b used wind driven algorithms to optimize the improved projection pursuit model to evaluate the flood disaster resilience of 12 farms in the hongxinglong administration of heilongjiang province and found that the key factors to improve the regional flood disaster resilience are to strengthen the forest coverage rate paddy field coverage rate and protective forest area ratio compared with the ahp which is too subjective in the weighting process and is easily affected by the preferences of experts zhao and tang 2019 projection pursuit cannot guarantee that the projection value can extract the maximum variation information of the original data qian et al 2019 the support vector machine svm model was first proposed by vapnik et al 1994 and has been widely used in clean energy biochemistry agricultural water management and other fields li et al 2020a wang et al 2020 mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 zhang et al 2019b solved the ecological environmental damage caused by urbanization and improved the city s disaster resistance the support vector machine model was used to evaluate the resilience of 57 streets in shenzhen china it is concluded that the comprehensive resilience of streets with much rain complex terrain and weak infrastructure is poor providing government assistance could strengthen the city s social services and infrastructure management however the classification and regression accuracy of the svm model depends largely on the choice of the penalty parameter c and the kernel function parameter σ and the prediction performance will vary greatly depending on the choices of these parameters the traditional svm model uses k fold cross validation in the libsvm toolbox in matlab to optimize the parameters but the data in the test set for each verification are too small thus it is difficult to obtain an accurate false alarm rate classical optimization algorithms such as particle swarm optimization pso are prone to become trapped in a local optimum to select the optimal parameters and improve the accuracy and speed of svm models the improved gray wolf optimization algorithm igwo is often used to optimize svm the gray wolf optimization algorithm gwo was first proposed by mirjalili et al 2014 in 2014 in the article gray wolf optimizer this algorithm simulates the hierarchical system and hunting mechanism of gray wolves in nature due to its simple and efficient advantages it has been widely used in various fields yu and lu 2018 used the combination of projection pursuit and gray wolf algorithm to analyze the water consumption of the songhua river basin and the results provided a certain reference value for the optimal allocation of water resources and other cross basin integrated management tikhamarine et al 2019 and others combined the gray wolf algorithm with ai to evaluate the 130 year monthly historical natural flow of the aswan high dam in the nile river basin the results verify the accuracy of the gwo model in terms of forecasting results and provide help for extreme conditions such as floods and droughts and long term water resource management however the original gwo is prone to problems such as local optimization low precision and poor robustness for high dimensional multipeak function and multiobjective optimization problems deng et al 2019 proposed the differential evolution gray wolf optimization algorithm de gwo theory of combining the differential evolution algorithm and the gray wolf optimization algorithm to solve gwo s comparative disadvantages after updating the position of the wolf pack this approach performs differential evolution operations and selects mutations crossovers and other operations to create better individuals for the next generation de gwo helps the gwo algorithm avoid falling into local extrema and improves its overall search capabilities in view of this in this paper the initial evaluation index is screened by constructing the complex correlation coefficient r clustering coefficient of variation ccc rc cv model and the final evaluation index system is obtained combining the igwo and svm to solve the problem of selecting the optimal parameters for the traditional svm model improves svm performance makes resilience of water resources system in irrigation area rwrsia measurement research more scientific and provides more accurate evaluation models for similar research and feasibility suggestions for regional sustainable development the research objectives are as follows 1 construct an evaluation index system based on the ccc rc cv model 2 construct a rwrsia quantitative model based on igwo svm and analyze its temporal and spatial evolution characteristics and causes 3 evaluate the performance of the igwo svm model and explore the adaptive cycle path of rwrsia 2 materials and methodology 2 1 research area heilongjiang province is located in northeastern china at geographic coordinates of 121 11 135 05 east longitude and 43 25 53 33 north latitude it covers an area of 473 000 km2 the main rivers flowing through the province are heilong songhua nen wusuli and suifen which together fully constitute the surface water and groundwater resources in heilongjiang province the annual average temperature in the province ranges mostly between 5 c and 5 c decreasing from south to north the annual precipitation is mostly between 400 mm and 650 mm agricultural production in heilongjiang province occupies a special position in china providing 9 million tons of commodity grain to the country every year with the sanjiang plain and the songnen plain providing 90 however due to the one sided pursuit of increased grain production unreasonable water use and fertilization models have caused a series of ecological and environmental problems such as groundwater overexploitation and water environment deterioration li and singh 2020 zhang et al 2019a 2020 faiz et al 2020 the country attaches great importance to the food security and sustainable development of these two great plains in 2013 it proposed the overall plan for the comprehensive reform of modern agriculture supporting reforms in the two great plains of heilongjiang province research on the resilience of water resource systems in irrigation areas can reasonably regulate the number of motor wells relieve the pressure of groundwater overdraft enhance the anti seepage ability of channels and improve the water use efficiency of irrigation areas it can provide effective help for the sustainable development of water resources in the two plains and solve food security problems based on the principle that the selected irrigation areas include four types of large medium and small wells and that the spatial distribution of the selected irrigation areas is as uniform as possible this article uses four irrigation areas on the songnen plain in heilongjiang province and eight irrigation areas on the sanjiang plain as sample irrigation areas to study the rwrsia in heilongjiang province the specific administrative divisions are as follows fig 1 2 2 data sources from the heilongjiang reclamation statistical yearbook 2007 2016 qiqihar administration comprehensive water conservancy annual report 2007 2016 jiansanjiang administration comprehensive water conservancy annual report 2007 2016 through collation calculation and analysis we obtained natural economic ecological and social development indicator data corresponding to the 12 irrigation areas from 2007 to 2016 3 methodology this chapter explains in detail the process of index screening in section 3 1 from the construction of the preliminary collection to the use of the ccc rc cv model to screen the indicators in section 3 2 the support vector machine model igwo svm based on the improved gray wolf algorithm will be explained and the model mechanism of svm gwo and igwo will be explained in detail to express this process intuitively part of the flowchart of the methodology is attached as shown in fig 2 3 1 index screening 3 1 1 build a preliminary set of indicators combined with the explanation of the resilience of water resources yu 2007 the resilience of the water resource system of the irrigation area is now defined as follows the water resource system at the level of the irrigation area is stimulated by the outside world the ability to gradually recover to structural stability resource supply and ecological regulation through the joint action of itself and the outside world it can be seen from the above definition that in addition to its own effects external stresses are also a crucial factor affecting the resilience of the irrigation area s water resources system external forces such as nature and ecology are integrated into the ecological environment system the impact of economic factors on the water resource system of the irrigation area is integrated into the socioeconomic system the factors closely related to the agricultural water and soil of the irrigation area are integrated into the agricultural system and the field supporting facilities that affect the water resource system of the irrigation area are integrated into the technical management system therefore the criterion level is divided into the water resource system socioeconomic system ecological environment system agricultural system and technical management system various research indicators such as flood disaster resilience liu et al 2019a sustainable agricultural development wang et al 2019 and irrigation area water resource evaluation gao et al 2006 liu et al 2020 were collected according to the classification principle for the above criterion layer the indexes affecting the water resource recovery of the irrigation area were allocated to each layer forming a preliminary selection set with a total of 43 indicators as shown in fig 3 and the ccc rc cv model is used for quantitative screening 3 1 2 complex correlation coefficient r clustering coefficient of variation ccc rc cv model relative to the other variables the partial correlation coefficient is fixed focusing solely on the correlation between the two variables pearson s correlation coefficient only focuses on the correlation between distance variables the multiple correlation coefficient focuses on the correlation between one variable and multiple variables it can effectively control the correlation between indicators in the same indicator system which is very suitable for the first step of the indicator screening system then r clustering is performed on the evaluation indicators of the same indicator layer and the rationality of the classification is verified through the kw test finally as the method of selecting the largest difference and the largest information content among similar data the coefficient of variation has the characteristics of convenient calculation relative to factor analysis and cumulative information contribution rate therefore the ccc rc cv model is chosen to screen the indicators step 1 standardize data before index screening to eliminate the influences of different index data and their dimensions on the index selection work and facilitate the comparison between the indexes we used the extreme value method to standardize the data li et al 2020c 1 y ij x ij min 1 j m x ij max 1 j m x ij min 1 j m x ij j j 1 max 1 j m x ij x ij max 1 j m x ij min 1 j m x ij j j 2 in the formula j1 represents a positive index that is the larger the index value the stronger the promoting effect on resilience j2 represents a negative index that is the larger the index value the stronger the inhibitory effect on resilience step 2 complex correlation coefficient first define the critical value e of the complex correlation coefficient if the complex correlation coefficient is 0 9 the correlation between the indicators is considered to be strong wang 2010 therefore the critical value is set to 0 9 then separately calculate the complex correlation coefficient between the indicators in the same criterion layer assuming that the maximum value of the complex correlation coefficient of all indicators in a certain criterion layer is ρ max a ρ max e indicates that the indicator corresponding to the maximum value overlaps with other indicators in the same criterion layer and therefore the indicator corresponding to ρ max should be eliminated next recalculate the complex correlation coefficient in the criterion layer for the remaining indicators when the maximum value of the complex correlation coefficient in the same criterion layer is less than the critical value e this loop is terminated and screening is complete step 3 r clustering by calculating the total sum of the square deviations of the indicators in each criterion layer and r clustering the evaluation indexes when the total sum of square deviations is the smallest the final number of indexes is determined suppose n evaluation indicators are each in one category si is the sum of squared deviations of ith evaluation indicators i 1 2 m ni is the number of ith evaluation indicators yi j is the standardized sample value vector of the jth evaluation index in the ith category j 1 2 m yi is the sample mean vector of the ith index calculated as follows sum of squared deviations for each category of indicators 2 s i j 1 n i y i j y i y i j y i sum of squared deviations of all categories 3 s i 1 k j 1 n i y i j y i y i j y i step 4 r clustering number rationality verification note that the number of r clusters is set artificially and has a certain level of subjectivity the nonparametric kw test method is used to test each criterion layer after clustering if the significant difference level of the index test results of each criterion layer is sig 0 05 guo 2005 then no obvious difference exists between the indicators after clustering the number of clusters must be both reasonable and effective step 5 coefficient of variation finally the clustered index data are introduced into formula 4 to calculate the coefficient of variation leaving the index with the largest coefficient of variation in each category as the final key index 4 v j 1 n i 1 n x ij x j 2 x j in the formula vj is the coefficient of variation of the jth indicator n is the number of objects evaluated x j is the average value of the data of each year of the jth evaluation indicator and xij is the value of the jth year of the ith indicator 3 2 support vector machine model based on the improved gray wolf algorithm 3 2 1 basic principles of the svm model the main goal of an svm is to build a classification hyperplane to distinguish different samples and maximize the classification interval specifically the kernel function maps feature vectors from low dimensional space to high dimensional space to establish a discriminant function the required hyperplane is expressed by the following formula 5 ω ψ x b 0 in the formula ω is a high dimensional vector composed of weights and b is an offset since the actual situation most of the data are linear and inseparable therefore the relaxation variable ζ i 0 is introduced for each sample so the linear support vector machine is transformed into the following convex quadratic programming problem which is expressed by the formula as 6 min 1 2 ω 2 c i 1 n ζ i 0 s t y i ω t ψ x i b 1 ζ i ζ i 0 in the formula c 0 is the penalty parameter ζ i is the relaxation variable introducing lagrange multipliers to transform equation 6 into a dual problem the final hyperplane can be expressed as 7 i 1 n α i y i k x x i b 0 in the formula α i represents the lagrange coefficient and k x x i is the kernel function the commonly used kernel functions mainly include linear kernel functions polynomial kernel functions radial basis kernel functions sigmoid kernel functions and fourier kernel functions the radial basis kernel function has better learning ability and is more commonly used this study uses the radial basis function as the kernel function karimi et al 2020 8 k x j x i exp x j x i 2 2 σ 2 the major influences on the results of the hyperplane solution are the penalty parameter c and the kernel function parameter σ c represents the penalty for exceeding the error range and is used to adjust the fit of the data and σ controls the radial action range of the kernel function when the value is too small overfitting may occur and when the value is too large the learning ability is adversely affected because the choices of the values of the parameters c and σ crucially influence the results the igwo is used to optimize these parameters to improve model accuracy 3 2 2 standard gray wolf optimization algorithm the gwo is a group optimization algorithm that iteratively finds the optimal value by simulating the hierarchy and predation strategy of the wolf pack the first level of the hierarchy is called α and is the leader of the population the second layer is called β this layer is mainly responsible for assisting with work in the population and acting as a bridge the third layer is called σ this layer is mainly responsible for investigation guard duty and other tasks the α and β wolves with poor adaptability will be reduced to σ wolves the bottom layer is called ω and is mainly responsible for maintaining a balance within the population the formula is as follows 9 d c x p t x t x t 1 x p t a d in the formula a and c are coefficient vectors t is the number of iterations and xp and x represent the position vectors of the prey and gray wolf respectively the expressions of coefficient vectors a and c are as follows 10 a 2 a r 1 a c 2 r 2 in the formula r1 and r2 are random vectors in the range 0 1 a is the convergence factor and decreases linearly from 2 to 0 as the number of iterations increases after starting the hunting process gray wolves identify prey locations and surround the prey when the gray wolf recognizes the position of the prey β and σ guide the wolf pack to surround the prey under the leadership of α in gwo it is assumed that the positions of the α β and σ wolves are most likely to be the position of prey that is the optimal solution for the wolf pack search during the search and optimization process α β and σ wolves are regarded as the three optimal search solutions while the remaining wolves are regarded as ω wolves the algorithm updates the positions of ω wolves according to the positions of the first three leadership level wolves and the distance formula is used to effectively adjust the position of the ω wolves the mathematical model is as follows 11 d α c 1 x α x d β c 2 x β x d σ c 3 x σ x in the formula x α x β and x σ represent the current position of α β and the σ wolf respectively d α d β and d σ represent the distance between the current wolf and other individuals c1 c2 and c3 are random vectors x is the current gray wolf s position xα 12 x 1 x α a 1 d α x 2 x β a 2 d β x 3 x σ a 3 d σ 13 x t 1 x 1 x 2 x 3 3 equation 12 defines the steps and directions of the ω individuals in the wolves towards α β and advance and equation 13 defines the final position of ω 3 2 3 improved gray wolf optimization algorithm evolving the wolves in a better direction is the basis for ensuring the competitiveness of the population the ideal vector mutation factor is the basis for ensuring that the gwo algorithm evolves toward the optimal solution thus the more competitive individuals are selected to be parents in the evolutionary population therefore the difference vectors of the two wolves β and σ are determined and a dynamic scaling factor is superimposed with the wolf α to construct a mutation factor for the gwo algorithm based on differential evolution its variation factor vector function expression is 14 v i t 1 x α t w x β t x σ t in the formula w is a dynamically changing scaling factor and its value is as follows 15 w f max f min t max t 1 t max f min in the formula fmin and fmax are the minimum and maximum scaling factors tmax is the maximum number of iterations and t is the current number of iterations dynamically changing the scaling factor w to target the defect that the basic gwo algorithm is prone to fall into local extrema in the early search stage the differential vector is dynamically adjusted by increasing the scaling factor to improve the global exploration ability of the gwo algorithm during the early search stage by reducing the scaling factor the gwo algorithm has a strong local development ability in the later search period which improves its search accuracy the target individual x i t in the wolf pack is crossed with the resulting mutation vector v i t 1 to generate an intermediate individual u i t 1 by randomly selecting at least one gene in u i t 1 provided by v i t 1 the mutation of x i t can be guaranteed its crossover operation is 16 u i t 1 x ij s r a n d j a n d j r a n d i v ij i 1 s r a n d j o r j r a n d i in the formula s represents the cross probability constant a proper selection of the crossover probability s not only improves the convergence speed and local search ability of the algorithm but also accelerates its global search speed and solution diversity then the intermediate individuals u i t 1 and x i t generated by the mutation and crossover operations are assessed and the individuals with good fitness are selected as the next generation of wolves as follows 17 x i t 1 x i t f x i t f v i t 1 v i t 1 f x i t f v i t 1 in the formula f is the fitness function constructed the distance between the individuals in the wolves is less than fclose and its value is 18 f close 1 2 k i 0 k f i max f i min 2 in the formula k is the number of objective functions f i max and f i min are the maximum and minimum values of the ith objective function and the good fitness value in x i t and v i t 1 is selected as the t 1th generation individual 4 results and discussion 4 1 index optimization through the ccc rc cv model we identified 13 indicators see table 1 and table 2 below after calculating the complex correlation coefficients the water resource system values were all below 0 9 so no additional screening was necessary except for b7 and b8 in the first round of the technical management system they were all above 0 9 the calculation continued after the maximum value of 0 998 b1 was screened out after five rounds of calculation the remaining index complex correlation coefficients were all 0 9 and the indicators b3 b5 b7 and b8 were obtained through a similar process the obtained agricultural system screening indicators were c1 c3 c6 c7 c8 c10 c11 and c12 the ecological environment system screening indicators were d2 d3 and d5 and the social economic system screening indicators were e1 e4 e6 e7 e9 e11 e12 and e13 then the category was determined column 3 of table 2 where a kw test sig 0 05 indicates that the number of clusters is reasonable column 4 of table 2 finally the coefficient of variation of each indicator in the same category was calculated and the largest value was chosen to represent the category the final screening indicators were a1 a3 a5 b3 b7 c1 c7 c10 d3 d5 e1 e12 and e13 note that 1 due to the larger number of indicators in the single indicator layer of the agricultural system and the social economic system if the unified calculation is prone to the situation that multiple indicator values are 1 it is not suitable to judge the screening items thus spss 22 0 was used to perform the following calculation by dividing them into two subindex layers c1 c6 becomes one category c7 c12 is another category e1 e6 becomes a category and e7 e13 becomes a category then the complex correlation coefficient is calculated 2 when the index of the clustering category alone represents an aspect of the evaluation system it is directly selected such as index a5 of the water resources system the same logic holds for b3 and d5 4 2 level simulation interval determination based on relevant scholarly research we set the evaluation standard of the resilience grade to 4 levels sun et al 2011 li 2010 for indicators without grading standards the average value of china was used as the passing threshold and the average value of developed countries was used as the optimal value the equal ratio method was used to allocate each node reasonably for example the coefficient of the effective use of irrigation water is 0 9 in israel and 0 55 in china ministry of water resources of the prc 2019 the characteristic nodes of each index are shown in table 3 bringing the threshold of each indicator into the igwo svm model use the original data set to randomly generate training samples and test samples according to table 3 and 4 standard intervals of water resource system resilience in the irrigation area are obtained and 400 sets of samples are generated in each interval a total of 1600 sets of samples were generated shuffle the order randomly select 1200 groups as the training set and 400 groups as the test set to train the model the resilience of the water resource system in the heilongjiang irrigation area is divided into 4 intervals see table 4 below for details 4 3 evaluation of the resilience of water resource systems in irrigation areas 4 3 1 analysis of time variation characteristics and driving factors we substituted the summation data of the indicators of the 12 irrigation areas from 2007 to 2016 into the igwo svm model to obtain an interannual change chart as shown in fig 4 the broken line is the calculation curve and the dotted line is the fitting curve the results showed that the overall resilience first showed an upward trend and then a downward trend in 2007 and 2008 the resilience reached the upper range of level iv in 2010 it was at the lower range of level ii and in 2009 and 2011 2014 it was at the upper range of level iii then from 2015 to 2016 it was at the lower range of level iii the weight of the indicator is determined by calculating the w absolute value of each index then the importance of each indicator to the evaluation result is analyzed and the key driving factors affecting the rwrsia in 12 irrigation areas are revealed the results are shown in fig 5 where it can be seen that rainfall is the most important factor affecting the rwrsia in addition the per capita cultivated land area the effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water the annual average humidity the annual average temperature the proportion of the water surface area and the anti seepage rate of the main canal system are important factors that affect the rwrsia comparing chen et al s 2014 research on the resilience of the water resource system in the hanjiang river basin and yu s 2007 research on the resilience of the water resource system in shanxi province it is found that the determination of rainfall as the most critical driving factor is the same as the above research results indicating that rainfall is the most critical factor for the resilience of water resources the conclusions of the driving factors are more reliable makropoulos et al 2018 also obtained key indicators such as temperature and rainfall when studying the resilience of urban water resource systems in the netherlands this is the same as the key driver analysis results of this article compared with the above research results this article also notes that the driving factors that are obviously characteristic of irrigation areas such as the effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water and the per capita arable land area in the agricultural system and the anti seepage rate of the backbone canal system in the technical management system are also important for the resilience of the irrigation area s water resources system and play a vital role therefore the key driving factors of water resource system resilience in irrigation areas obtained in this paper reflect reasonable results in 2007 and 2008 due to insufficient annual rainfall the humidity was insufficient the utilization efficiency of farmland irrigation water was not high and anti seepage work on the backbone canal system was not yet in place other comprehensive factors restricted the overall level of resilience in those two years which resulted in the level iv state after 2009 the resilience gradually stabilized fluctuating basically among the lower level ii and upper level iii states in addition to objective reasons such as abundant rainfall completed infrastructure improved the efficiency of irrigation water utilization and the enhancement of canal system impermeability was also crucial however in 2015 and 2016 due to the serious annual shortage of rainfall in the 12 irrigation areas the levels reached only 463 8 mm and 493 5 mm respectively the single index reached only level iv which is far below the average level although considerable progress has been made in water resource utilization in the irrigation area the annual average rainfall still has a greater impact on rwrsia thus the water resource resilience gradually returned to the lower range of level iii however due to the relatively flat rainfall in 2008 and 2016 table 5 shows that the resilience index in 2016 increased by 9 32 compared to 2008 therefore with less restriction of the important natural factors the improvement of the supporting facilities of rwrsia in heilongjiang province caused the overall resilience level of the region to follow an upward trend 4 3 2 analysis of the characteristics of spatiotemporal variation because 2008 and 2016 are the obvious time variable points of the calculation curve and 2012 is the lowest point of the fitting curve the three time nodes of 2008 2012 and 2016 were analyzed as typical years and the data of each irrigation area for 3 years were substituted into the igwo svm model to analyze the spatial differences of the 12 irrigation areas the overall average value of the two great plains in the current year was used to facilitate the comparative analysis of the 4 irrigation areas under the songnen plain in the west and the 8 irrigation areas under the sanjiang plain in the east as table 5 shows in 2008 among the study areas the resilience of the erdaohe and xingkaihu irrigation areas is grade ii the chahayang fuyu jiangchuan and suibin irrigation areas are grade iv and the remaining 6 irrigation areas have a resilience level of grade iii the resilience index of the fuyu irrigation area reached a minimum of 3 713 which was 1 705 lower than that of the erdaohe irrigation area which had the highest resilience index in 2012 compared with 2008 the resilience increased by 15 4 and 12 irrigation areas improved since 2008 among these the jiangchuan irrigation area increased by up to 53 9 except for the fuyu irrigation area which is still grade iv and the chahayang tailai and qixing irrigation areas which are grade iii the remaining seven irrigation areas all reached grade ii and the jiangchuan irrigation area even jumped to grade i however the jiangchuan irrigation area with the highest resilience index is 2 1069 higher than the lowest fuyu irrigation area which is an obvious gap in 2016 compared with 2008 this is an increase of 9 3 but compared with 2012 it is a decrease of 6 7 among the study areas the resilience index of 6 irrigation areas fell compared with 2012 the tailai and jiangchuan irrigation areas had the most obvious drops reaching 17 5 and 75 9 respectively mainly due to rainfall reduction the rainfall in the jiangchuan irrigation area reached 838 4 mm in 2012 compared with 454 4 mm and 569 8 mm in 2008 and 2016 respectively overall the 6 irrigation areas with an increased resilience index are not as good as the 6 irrigation areas with a decrease resulting in the overall decline in 2016 from the irrigation area perspective jiangchuan yi an erdaohe xingkaihu and daxing have a high overall resilience index among these the jiangchuan irrigation area had high rainfall in 2012 and its overall resilience level was high the resilience in the xingkaihu irrigation area is mainly due to its large water surface area and abundant surface water resources which makes its overall resilience level high while the other three irrigation areas in smaller irrigation districts use sprinkler irrigation methods and apply drip rather than flood irrigation which greatly increases the irrigation water utilization coefficient and results in a higher water resource resilience index to visually express the temporal and spatial evolution of the 12 irrigation areas and the two great plains as a whole we plotted the rwrsia level spatial change graph and rate graph of each time node according to the data in table 5 superimposed dem can reflect the topographic features of heilongjiang province it can also be shown that the irrigation area selected in this article is on the sanjiang plain and songnen plain at the same time it can be seen that the water vapor and climatic conditions of the sanjiang plain and the songnen plain are different and some comparative analysis can be done bing et al 2017 the resilience levels of different periods are superimposed on dem to obtain the spatial changes and rate of change of water resilience levels of 12 irrigation areas in heilongjiang province in 2008 2012 and 2016 as fig 6 shows the resilience of the songnen plain irrigation area in the west of heilongjiang province is generally lower than that in the sanjiang plain irrigation area in the east the main reason is that the western irrigation areas consist largely of dry fields the land surface does not store water and generally does not require seasonal irrigation most of the crops planted in this area are less water intensive during the growth cycle such as corn and wheat the irrigation areas in the east are dominated by rice paddy fields especially along the rivers where abundant surface water and groundwater resources exist almost every year there is seasonal water accumulation poor land storage capacity is the fundamental reason why the western irrigation area is not as resilient as the eastern irrigation area although the irrigation areas in the east are all paddy fields their degree of resilience also varies among them the jiangchuan and wutonghe irrigation areas are distributed on both banks of the songhua river and have approximately the same total amount of irrigation water the results show that the resilience level of water resources in these areas is roughly similar the qixing and daxing irrigation areas are near the administration bureau basically in the inland area however because daxing is a well irrigation area it has abundant groundwater resources and is superior to qixing in terms of its irrigation water effective utilization coefficient and backbone canal system seepage prevention rate therefore the overall resilience of the daxing irrigation area is higher than that of qixing the erdaohe irrigation area is close to the 859 irrigation area and close to the bielahong river surface water resources are abundant and rainfall has been abundant for many years therefore from the results the resilience of these two irrigation areas has been at relatively high levels the xingkaihu irrigation area is located in the southeastern region of heilongjiang province because of its proximity to xingkai lake the proportion of its water surface area is the largest among the 12 irrigation areas and its resilience has remained relatively stable in the lower range of level ii and the upper range of level iii for many years from the change rate chart the most obvious changes occur in the jiangchuan irrigation area which further highlights the large impact of rainfall on the resilience of the water resource system in that irrigation area closely followed by the suibin irrigation area because the growth rate is higher than the decline rate the overall recovery force index is on the rise the chahayang fuyu yi an qixing and daxing irrigation areas show an increasing trend in both stages the remaining 7 irrigation areas first increased and then declined but no irrigation area showed a downward trend in either stage among the study areas the growth rate of the fuyu and daxing irrigation areas in the 2012 2016 stage exceeded that in the 2008 2012 stage indicating that the resilience index of these two irrigation areas has steadily accelerated three of the five irrigated areas that have grown in both stages are located in the songnen plain indicating that although the overall resilience index of the songnen plain is not as good as that of the sanjiang plain it still shows a positive trend although the overall resilience level of the songnen plain irrigation area in the west is lower than that in the sanjiang plain irrigation area in the east it has been improving the irrigation water resilience level of the irrigation area along the river is significantly higher than that of the inland area the irrigation area has a larger proportion of water surface area and the level of resilience is relatively stable small well irrigated areas are generally superior to large and medium sized irrigated areas 4 4 igwo svm model performance test to test the performance of the igwo svm model we used the svm gsa svm and gwo svm models to evaluate the resilience of the water resource system in 12 sample irrigation areas from 2007 to 2016 among these models the traditional svm model uses the libsvm model created by professor lin chin jen of taiwan university for calculation chang and lin 2011 we set the number of iterations of gsa svm gwo svm igwo svm to 50 the model evaluation is divided into two parts accuracy and efficiency and the accuracy is divided into classification accuracy calculated by c svc and mean square error and determination coefficient r2 of regression analysis by ε svr the efficiency mainly addresses the running time of algorithm t seconds to avoid the effects of randomness the four models were executed 50 times each and their average values are listed in table 6 as table 6 shows igwo svm is better than gwo svm gsa svm and svm in all aspects compared with the gwo svm gsa svm and svm models igwo svm reduced the mean square error by 7 69 12 19 and 25 improved the r2 by 0 33 1 11 and 2 73 and improved the accuracy rate by 2 32 4 74 and 16 03 respectively moreover in terms of running time igwo svm is also faster than gwo svm and gsa svm by 278 42 s and 498 63 s on average respectively therefore the igwo svm model has both accuracy and efficiency advantages 4 5 reliability analysis of the igwo svm model to test the reliability of the igwo svm model we took 2016 as an example and evaluated the 12 irrigation areas with the svm gsa svm gwo svm and igwo svm models the results are shown in table 7 in table 7 compared with other traditional models the igwo svm model obtains 10 identical evaluation results its similarity rate is as high as 83 3 only the erdaohe and 859 irrigation areas have slightly different evaluation levels its results are identical to the evaluation results of the gwo svm model and differ from the gsa svm model evaluation result only in the 859 irrigation area and from the svm model evaluation result only in the erdaohe and 859 irrigation areas through further analysis of the resilience index obtained by each model combined with the key driving factors the three most weighted indicators of rainfall per capita arable land area and irrigation water effective utilization coefficient in the erdaohe irrigation area are slightly smaller than those in daxing irrigation area among the key driving factors only the key canal system has an anti seepage rate in the erdaohe irrigation area which is higher than that in the daxing irrigation area based on the above the resilience index of the erdaohe irrigation area should be slightly larger than that of the daxing irrigation area and the evaluation results of the svm model and igwo svm model are more consistent except for the indicator of the water surface area ratio the other indicators are relatively close in the 859 irrigation area and the jiangchuan irrigation area however the water surface area ratio of the 859 irrigation area is approximately 5 higher than that of the jiangchuan irrigation area the resilience index of the irrigation area should be slightly smaller than that of the jiangchuan irrigation area only the evaluation results of the gwo svm and igwo svm models are more consistent with the above situation in summary the igwo svm model is reliable from the grade evaluation results in combination with the analysis of key driving factors the igwo svm results in the evaluation of the resilience index are more in line with the actual situation therefore the igwo svm model is more reliable 4 6 research on the adaptive circulation paths of irrigation areas based on the typical year 2016 the overall resilience level of the 12 irrigation areas is at level iii which is still some distance away from level i therefore we calculated the w absolute value of the 13 indicators in 2016 to determine the weights of the indicators combined them with the key driving factors of various irrigation areas and proposed a path for differentiated resilience construction some reasonable suggestions for improving rwrsia in heilongjiang province are provided for reference the calculation results are shown in table 8 where the values in brackets are the weight rankings of the indicators in the irrigation area as table 8 shows rainfall a1 per capita arable land area c10 and the irrigation water effective utilization coefficient c7 are the three most important factors affecting rwrsia in the 12 irrigation areas among these a1 is the most important factor and only in the three small well irrigation areas of yi an qixing and erdaohe is c7 c10 in all c10 c7 because the overall crop planting structure in heilongjiang province is relatively stable and the output of commercial grains has achieved good results hasty improvements may have many effects and rainfall is an uncontrollable natural factor therefore the three indicators that are relatively important for all irrigation areas target only adjusting the irrigation water effective utilization factor the average irrigation water effective utilization coefficient of the 12 irrigation areas in heilongjiang province in 2016 was 0 578 which is still well distant from that of advanced countries such as israel the investigation found that in many irrigation areas in heilongjiang province the actual irrigation quota far exceeded the designed irrigation quota the reasons mainly include unreasonable irrigation methods channel leakage nodal openings failure to consider water reuse for multiple uses etc for large and medium sized irrigation areas sprinkler irrigation or aqueducts can be used in the field advanced technologies such as microspray irrigation drip irrigation and film covered irrigation are unsuitable for large scale irrigation areas due to high costs but for small or well irrigation areas as mentioned above the three irrigation areas with higher weights can be selected and used according to the local economic level which is important for improving the effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water the purpose is to improve the resilience of the water resource system the importance of annual average humidity a3 annual average temperature a5 number of electromechanical wells per unit b3 anti seepage rate of backbone canal system b7 and proportion of water surface area d3 vary among individual irrigation areas the number of electromechanical wells per unit is an important factor that affects the irrigation areas of chahayang daxing wutonghe and 859 it is recommended that the above four irrigation areas reduce the use of electromechanical wells and bury some alternative mechanical wells surface water and groundwater replacement can be achieved through project water exchange further groundwater should be conserved to avoid the formation of a funnel zone the anti seepage rate of the backbone canal system is an important factor affecting the irrigation areas of yi an qixing erdaohe and jiangchuan it is suggested that the above four irrigation areas should consider installing composite anti seepage membranes to supplement traditional anti seepage measures this approach not only has anti seepage and reinforcement functions but also has a filtration effect in practical engineering applications it can effectively prevent the occurrence of sudden frost and is more suitable for irrigation areas in northern cold regions such as heilongjiang province it should be noted that most of the channels below the branch canal are still earth channels if a tightly compacted paint anti seepage layer can be laid on the surface of the irrigation canal bed the anti seepage effect will be greatly enhanced the proportion of water surface area is an important factor affecting the irrigation areas of fuyu tailai yi an xingkaihu and suibin but because the indicator remains at a relatively stable level year round in the five irrigation areas rash improvements are not appropriate the roles of a3 and a5 are not discussed since these are natural factors the plantation area at the end of the year d5 labor compensation of employees e1 total water conservancy investment e12 population growth rate e13 and per capita food occupancy c1 are less important factors affecting the rwrsia therefore we did not adjust for these factors 4 7 prediction of the control effect of water resource resilience in irrigation areas to analyze the adaptive path of each irrigation area according to 4 6 we predict the change in each index after regulation and analyze the 2020 and 2030 rwrsia on the basis of the 2016 rwrsia table 9 since the five indicators c1 d5 e1 e12 and e13 are relatively unimportant indicators in each irrigation area the results have little impact on the rwrsia therefore this section only predicts the remaining 8 indicators rainfall annual average humidity and annual average temperature are natural uncontrollable factors so the average value of each irrigation area during the ten years from 2007 to 2016 is drawn as the predicted value for 2020 and 2030 the values are 536 2 mm 70 8 and 3 5 since 2008 the area of arable land in the 12 sample irrigation areas has been relatively stable and the amount of population change is not obvious with the development of the social economy the number of farmers may slightly decrease year by year decrease by approximately 1 000 people annually from 2013 to 2016 it is now assumed that the area of arable land remains unchanged and the population of the irrigation area decreases by 1 000 people year by year the area of arable land in 2016 was 455 970 and the total population of the 12 irrigation districts was 217 607 that is the per capita arable land area in 2020 is 455970 217607 4000 2 13 similarly the per capita arable land area in 2030 is 2 24 according to the requirements of the national sustainable agriculture development plan 2015 2030 to determine the red line for water efficiency control the effective utilization coefficient of farmland irrigation water will reach 0 55 and 0 6 or more by 2020 and 2030 respectively considering that the average effective use coefficient of irrigation water in 2016 for 12 irrigation areas was 0 578 it is now proposed that the effective use coefficients of irrigation water in 2020 and 2030 are 0 58 and 0 6 respectively from 2009 to 2016 the proportion of water surface area has been stable at 0 088 0 09 with very small fluctuations so it is proposed to be 0 089 in 2020 and 2030 in terms of the number of electromechanical wells per unit pure well irrigation areas include daxing irrigation area and yi an irrigation area in 2020 the remaining 10 irrigation areas in impure well irrigation areas will be closed by 1 3 leaving a total of 15 806 eyes in 12 irrigation areas assuming that the area of cultivated land remains unchanged at 455 970 ha or 4559 7 square kilometers the number of electromechanical wells per unit is 3 46 set km2 by 2030 it is expected that all electromechanical wells in the remaining 10 irrigation areas will be closed leaving a total of 2348 holes in 12 irrigation areas or 0 52 set km2 surface water irrigation will be used to conserve groundwater resources in terms of the anti seepage rate of the backbone canal system with the improvement of canal system engineering the anti seepage rate of the backbone canal system showed a steady and rising trend during the 10 years from 2007 to 2016 among them 8 14 in 2007 and 14 58 in 2016 the average annual growth rate is 0 64 assuming a constant annual growth rate it will be 17 15 in 2020 and 20 98 in 2030 5 conclusion in this study we analyzed the connotation of water resource resilience constructed an rwrsia evaluation index system and selected evaluation indexes through the ccc rc cv model based on the igwo svm model we analyzed the spatial and temporal evolution of rwrsia in heilongjiang province from 2007 to 2016 the improvement of basic field support facilities and the rational use of water resources caused an overall upward trend from 2007 to 2012 due to the lack of the important natural factor of rainfall from 2013 to 2016 the single indicators reached only grade iv in 2015 and 2016 decreasing the overall level rainfall was roughly the same in 2008 and 2016 but resilience in 2016 increased by 9 32 compared to 2008 from a spatial scale the overall irrigation area in the west is not as good as that in the east primarily because the west is dominated by dry fields whose land surface does not store water well while the east is dominated by paddy fields and has abundant surface water and groundwater resources in the eastern irrigation areas the rwrsia along the river is significantly higher than that of the inland areas irrigation areas with a large proportion of water surface area have relatively stable resilience levels compared with the gwo svm gsa svm and svm models it is revealed that igwo svm has large advantages in all aspects of performance its mean square error mse is well below those of the gwo svm gsa svm and svm models 7 69 12 19 and 25 respectively its r2 increased by 0 33 1 11 and 2 73 respectively and its accuracy increased by 2 32 4 74 and 16 03 respectively in terms of running time igwo svm is on average 278 42 s and 498 63 s faster than gwo svm and gsa svm these results sufficiently indicate the accuracy and efficiency advantages of the igwo svm model research on rwrsia measurement is a timely and difficult issue however problems such as the inadequate selection of indicators due to the difficulty of obtaining data and insufficient time series may have some impact on the evaluation results of rwrsia in the future improving data monitoring of the water and soil environment in irrigation areas will benefit the effective resolution of scientific issues related to the water resource

4666,excessive freshwater pumping in coastal areas result in an inland intrusion of the saltwater wedge underlying the freshwater aquifer leading to salinization of coastal aquifers while multiple approaches and techniques in the form of analytical solutions numerical simulations mass balance calculations and laboratory experiments have been used to study the flow dynamics of the density driven circulation of saltwater little is known regarding the groundwater ages in coastal aquifers and the process timescales the current study makes use of multiple age tracers such as 3h 85kr and 39ar allowing to calculate both modern and sub modern groundwater ages the ages derived based on the measured tracer values were compared to a numerical flow simulations the results indicate that seawater intrusion in the nitzanim coastal reserve prompted by excessive freshwater pumping upstream has a different effect on the ages of the shallow groundwaters in comparison with the deeper groundwater close to the shoreline 200 m at shallow depths 40 m below sea level the intruding saline groundwater is younger than the freshwater system leading to young ages of 50 years further away from the shoreline 700 m at greater depths 60 m below sea level the deep intruding saline groundwater is dated to 350 years which is significantly older than fresh groundwater ages in this part of the coastal aquifer the approach brought forward in the paper allows to better understand the timescales of density driven circulation mechanism and the effect of seawater intrusion on groundwater ages keywords coastal aquifer seawater intrusion groundwater dating 3h 3he 85kr 39ar 1 introduction coastal aquifers ca serve as a primary groundwater source worldwide increased rainfall in proximity to the shoreline shallow water table permeable deposits such as soils sands and alluvium make ca reservoirs a readily available renewable resource with more than 45 of the world s population residing within 100 km of the coastline large populations have grown to depend on ca as a vital source for water the increasing demand for water along with poor management has led to over exploitation decrease in groundwater levels and deterioration of water quality worldwide the decrease in groundwater levels result in an inland intrusion of the saltwater wedge underlying the freshwater aquifer leading to salinization of vast areas and disruption of the natural ca hydrological systems e g subsurface circulation paths and rates of intruding seawater water and element discharge in submarine springs seawater circulation is driven by several natural mechanisms and processes ranging from short term and spatially limited effects triggered by waves and tides through seasonal groundwater level variations up to long term large scale density driven dispersive mechanism the density driven saltwater circulation starts when seawater flows inland and intrude the aquifer due buoyancy forces and density differences on one hand the higher density of the seawater in comparison with freshwater leads to saline groundwater flow inland on the other hand fresh groundwater flow towards the sea hinders further intrusion of seawater meyer et al 2018 furthermore at a certain distance from the coast the density differences negate due to the rising water table head and the saltwater wedge formed in the aquifer pinches out this forms a dynamic equilibrium between the regional flow of fresh groundwater and the buoyancy forces between fresh and saline waters around the point of equilibrium the flow reverses and the returning saltwater current flows seaward while dispersing at the shallower freshwater saltwater interface fsi which forms the contact with the overriding freshwater the rate of seawater recirculation is suggested to reach a maximal value at a specific ratio of transverse dispersivity to sediment thickness smith 2004 the returning current carrying a mixture of fresh and saline groundwater normally brackish water is discharged via submarine springs the water flow rates along the fsi increase as additional fresh water joins the discharging stream despite the fact that submarine groundwater discharge sgd is patchy diffused and temporally variable it serves as an important pathway for transporting freshwater and elements required in geochemical cycles in the marine environment kim and kim 2014 wilson 2005 multiple approaches and techniques have been used to study examine and quantify the density driven circulation of saltwater the flow dynamics and transport of salts has been studied empirically in the laboratory and field as well as mathematically by analytical solutions numerical simulations and water balance calculations however as mentioned by burnett et al 2003 there is a serious lack of data to calibrate and verify such models depending on the case study seepage meters for instance could be suitable when the flow is sufficiently high usually when dominated by preferential flow paths e g fractured rock on the other hand when the flow is low due to a matrix flow regime as in the case study brought in this paper it is more challenging to detect flow rates using seepage meters which gives rise to the usage of geochemical tracers that integrate and smooth small scale variations over time and space dating tools based on radiogenic and stable isotopes have been widely used for measuring freshwater ages however they were seldom implemented for dating saltwater flow dynamics in ca calvache et al 2020 the difficulties in interpreting groundwater ages using 14c have led to the development of tools and methods which are less susceptible to water rock interactions and enable the coverage of a wide range of ages spanning from tens to hundreds of thousands of years as well as to identify multiple sources of water and mixing processes mayer et al 2014 mccallum et al 2017 solomon et al 2010 sültenfuß et al 2009 visser et al 2013 in this paper we combine the results of environmental tracers from the short lived 3h in conjunction with its daughter isotope 3he and 85kr to the relatively long lived 39ar which can date groundwater up to one thousand years old althaus et al 2009 visser et al 2013 while atmospheric concentrations of 3h and 85kr are affected by anthropogenic pollution and therefore significantly higher compared to the natural level 39ar concentrations in the atmosphere are constant and are not affected by human activity radioactive 3h was released into the atmosphere between 1955 and 1963 as a result of atmospheric thermonuclear testing which led in turn to a concentration increase of three orders of magnitude in rainwater sültenfuβ et al 2011 through time the 3h bearing rainwater which infiltrated the saturated zone decays into 3he half life t1 2 12 3 yr which accumulates in the groundwater without interacting with the host rock noble gas groundwater age is calculated by taking into account the decay in parent concentrations 3h and increase in daughter isotope 3he in conjunction with the decay constant tolstikhin 1969 radioactive 85kr is released as a byproduct of nuclear fuel reprocessing its concentration in the atmosphere has been steadily growing since the late 1950s since the late 2000s restrictions on nuclear energy production have led to a stabilization in 85kr atmospheric concentrations the 85kr based ages are derived by comparing the measured activity concentrations in the sampled groundwater to the decay corrected t1 2 10 74 yr historic atmospheric concentration bollhöfer et al 2019 the advantage of 39ar as a tracer is that it is produced in the atmosphere at a constant loosli and oeschger 1968 leading to globally constant activity concentration of 1 67 10 2 bq m3 air corresponding to 100 modern corcho alvarado et al 2007 upon isolation from the atmosphere when precipitation recharges the aquifer the 39ar decays with time t1 2 269 yr by knowing the 39ar concentrations in groundwater modern the radioactive decay equation is used to calculate the groundwater age the goal of this study is to quantitatively derive and model groundwater ages and flow rates for the ca hydrologic system specifically the aims of the current study are a introduce and exemplify the usage of radiogenic 39ar in dating sub modern density driven intruding saline water b deconvolute fresh and saline groundwater ages c use the derived ages to numerically constrain and simulate the ca dynamics while including the aquifers hydraulic parameters while taking into account the effect of over pumping on historic groundwater levels 2 methods 2 1 geological and hydrological background the israeli mediterranean coastal aquifer extends 120 km along the eastern part of the mediterranean sea fig 1 its thickness decreases eastwards from 180 m near the shoreline to less than a few meters near the eastern boundary ecker 1999 the aquifer belonging to the pleistocenic kurkar group consists of inter layered sandstone calcareous sandstone siltstone and red loam which alternate with continental and marine clays the aquifer overlays impervious marine clays of the saqiye group of pliocene age issar 1968 east of the shoreline up to a distance of 5 km clayey inter layers subdivide the aquifer into four sub aquifers some of the lower sub aquifers are confined while the upper ones are phreatic nativ and weisbrod 1994 the perennial precipitation of the southern coastal aquifer is 470 mm yr and the recharge coefficient is estimated to be 0 2 on average based on mass balance considerations gvirtzman 2002 hydrological service of israel 2018 thus the main direct recharge from rain to the southern coastal aquifer is 100 mm yr the study area is part of the nitzanim nature reserve 1 km south of the city of ashdod in the southern part of the coastal aquifer of israel fig 1 insert in this work we focused on the upper phreatic part of the aquifer the upper 100 m which is relatively homogenous composed of sand and calcareous sandstone kurkar and almost no clay lenses except for small lenses mostly in the unsaturated zone fig 2 the most saline groundwater samples in the coastal aquifer have a salinity and composition of the eastern mediterranean water 39 prior to the anthropogenic interference which started in 1930s groundwater levels in the coastal aquifer in their pristine condition were well above the sea level fig 3 a this over pumping reached a maximum in the 1960s fig 3b which created vast and deep hydrological cone of depressions leading to groundwater levels of up to 6 8 m below sea level hydrological cone of depressions below sea level have prevailed in the southern coastal aquifer until the early 1990s as a result the fsi has shifted inland by more than 1 km as a result of over pumping melloul and zeitoun 1999 since the 1990s mitigation programs and cautious management have led to a general trend of positive groundwater level restoration in the early 2000s the depressions started to fill and have been appearing more locally and sporadically but closer to the shoreline fig 3c the positive restoration trends continued and since 2015 positive water levels have been restored throughout the southern coastal aquifer of israel fig 3d the water authority of israel has defined minimal and maximal water levels lines which are constantly regulated in order to prevent seawater intrusion on one hand and major losses of freshwater to the sea on the other as a result the maximum water levels are not expected to return to the pristine water levels fig 3a 2 2 field work water samples and salinity profiles were collected from five boreholes logarithmically spaced along a cross section perpendicular to the shoreline at distance of up to 700 m from shore the boreholes drilled in the early 2000s were designed to penetrate the shallow phreatic aquifers as well as to reach below the fsi the boreholes were perforated through their entire length allowing the well to reach hydrostatic equilibrium with respect to ca hydrological units salinity profiles in the wells were generated using an electrical conductivity ec electrode along with a temperature sensor wtw 1970i connected to a 100 m cable water was pumped from various depths in a given well using a grundfos electrical submersible pump prior to sampling at least 3 well volumes were produced to assure that the samples were representative of the formation water as opposed to water stored in the well since the wells were perforated through their entire length pumping rates were maintained low 12 l min and constant in order minimize vertical mixing and contribution of water from shallower and or deeper layers the salinity of the produced sample was compared to the expected salinity based on the static ec profile for verification in most cases the expected salinity was produced and sampled fig 4 while in some cases a slight deviation towards higher salinities was observed indicating that water from greater depths were added into the sampled mixture water samples were collected while keeping an air tight system in order to avoid atmospheric contamination measurements of ph dissolved oxygen do water temperature and ec were carried out in the field with portable meters wtw 1970i 2 3 laboratory analyses laboratory measurements consisted of major ions noble gas radioisotopes 39ar and 85kr 3h he isotopes and ne major cation concentrations were analyzed by perkin elmer optima 3300 icp oes and major anions by the dionex series 40001 gradient ion chromatography with a maximum error of 3 chloride concentrations were also analyzed by titration with 0 1 n agno3 with a maximum analytical error of 2 for radioactive noble gases 39ar 85kr two to five cubic meters of groundwater were degassed in the field the field degassing device is based on a hydrophobic membrane contactor in the laboratory the ar and kr gases were separated from other gases 85kr and 39ar radionuclides were measured in low level gas proportional counters llc in the deep laboratory of the physics institute university of bern switzerland a detailed description of the analytic procedure can be found in riedmann and purtschert 2016 the analytical uncertainty associated with 39ar measurements is 5 modern for a sample larger than 2500 l air saturated water but increases with decreasing sample size the 85kr results are reported in the conventional units of dpm cckr which stands for the number of 85kr decays per minute per ml stp of kr gas with a minimal detection limit of 0 5 dpm cckr the analytical uncertainty associated with 85kr measurement is 1 dpm cckr for a water sample size 200 l samples for 3h analyses were collected in 1 5 l plastic bottles samples for he isotopes and ne analyses were collected by connecting the outlet of the pumping system to gas tight 40 ml copper tubes the copper tubes were flushed for several minutes before they were sealed with pinch off clamps analyses of 3h he isotopes and ne were conducted at the noble gas laboratory of the institute of environmental physics university of bremen germany a detailed description of the analytic procedure can be found in sültenfuß et al 2009 for groundwater samples the precision of the he and ne concentrations is better than 1 errors for 3h range from 0 05 to 0 1 tritium unit tu 3h 3he ages are derived from the remaining 3h in the aquifer and the decay produced 3he so called tritiogenic 3he all 3he components not produced by 3h decay are identified by means of 4he and ne measurements the apparent 3h 3he age is calculated using the method brought forward in sültenfuβ et al 2011 2 4 computer simulations the ca hydrological systems were simulated using feflow diersch 2013 a finite element simulator that solves the coupled variable density ground water flow and solute transport the simulator was setup along a w e cross section near the nitzanim nature reserve extending to the seafloor while taking into account the continental shelf slope fig 5 sade et al 2006 a mesh with 247 940 elements and 124 610 nodes was used with refinement near the fsi element size of 1 m2 in order to increase the stability of the numerical scheme and the accuracy of the model time steps for the transient simulations were automatically defined by the forward euler backward euler time integration method allowing for longer time steps when the solution of the previous time step converged well boundary conditions were set as follows 1 sps refid e1 no flow from the eastern boundary of the coastal aquifer as well as from the impermeable base of the aquifer saqiye formation 2 a hydraulic head gradient of 0 027 m per meter of seafloor depth z to account for the substitution of freshwater with seawater towards the sea assumed seawater density of 1 027 kg m 3 3 infiltration rate recharge influx set to a constant 100 mm year on the land surface salinity is prescribed on the sea floor 39 000 mg l and on the land surface 0 mg l the different hydraulic parameters hydraulic conductivity anisotropy porosity specific storage specific yield seawater and freshwater densities and salinities were based on information obtained from lutzky and shalev 2010 and amir et al 2013 a pumping well was assigned 3 km from the shoreline with a pumping rate of 4 m3 d m to simulate overexploitation the simulated width and location of the fsi transition zone was fitted to the salinity profiles by varying the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities following a given pumping period of 50 100 years fig 6 which is in accordance with the ca production history fig 3 the derived longitudinal and transverse dispersivity values table 1 were in the same order of magnitude as previously reported for the ca in israel abbo and gev 2008 amir et al 2013 bear et al 2001 levanon et al 2016 yakirevich et al 1998 groundwater age is defined as the elapsed time since a parcel of water entered the saturated zone ages were computed using goode s method incorporated into feflow diersch 2013 goode 1996 which is often referred as the direct age method post et al 2013 the method considers age as the concentration of a solute species which is set to zero at the start of the simulation and at the inflow boundaries this method allows to calculate the mean groundwater age that provides information on travel times and mixing processes it is important to note that while mixing old and young groundwater the mean groundwater age of the resulting mixture is arithmetically averaged a robust diagnosis can theoretically only be obtained given knowledge of the entire age distribution diersch 2013 the model was set to examine the density driven saltwater circulation dynamics rates and water ages for two main scenarios a base case steady state freshwater levels b perturbed case transient conditions used to simulate over exploitation by assigning a pumping well a comparison between the geochemical results and the computer simulation is discussed below 3 results 3 1 freshwater saltwater interface fsi present day groundwater levels at nitzanim increase monotonically with increasing distance from the shoreline as no significant hydraulic depressions exhibit inland in contrast to historic conditions based on the ec profiles fig 4 a cross section was plotted to show the fresh and saline water bodies and the fsi fig 2 with increasing distance from the shoreline the fsi is deeper and narrower close to the sea 20 40 m from the shoreline the transition from freshwater to saline water is gradual and spans over a thickness of more than 40 m this gradual transition near the shoreline has been previously attributed to advective mixing resulting from tidal oscillations and high waves associated with stormy seas groundwater level fluctuations in the nitzanim coastal reserve have been observed to vary as a result of tides and storms from a scale of few to 20 cm respectively along with short term hydraulic gradient inversions levanon et al 2013 shalev et al 2009 further away from the shoreline the effects of waves and tides diminishes leading to a sharper fsi levanon et al 2013 at a distance of 700 m the fsi is sharp and occurs over a section with a thickness of 10 m 50 60 m below ground level 3 2 chemical composition table 2 summarizes the well information and major ionic chemical composition of the 12 samples taken from 6 wells according to the following well name sampling date distance from the shoreline sampling depth ground level elevation water sample elevation temperature electrical conductivity and ionic composition of the water samples total dissolved solids tds and seawater fraction swf ionic concentrations na mg2 so4 2 and br vs cl of the collected samples all fall on a mixing line connecting the origin freshwater with the composition of mediterranean seawater the conservative behaviour of these major ionic constituents with respect to seawater indicates that the saline end member is seawater and not an alternative brine sivan et al 2005 the non conservative behaviour of ca2 k and sr2 results from cation exchange during salinization and freshening events russak and sivan 2010 therefore the swf is defined based on the concentration of cl the waters found in the ca are therefore defined as freshwater up to 400 mg cl l seawater 22 400 mg cl l and their range of mixtures table 2 3 3 age tracers table 3 depicts the radioactive and stable isotopes measured in the water samples collected in the study the table includes the well name sampling date distance from the shoreline water sample elevation swf the bulk concentrations measured for 85kr 39ar 3h tritiogenic 3he and δ3he recharge temperature for noble gas equilibration calculations was assumed to be 20 c 85kr activities vary from 2 1 to 10 4 dpm cckr 39ar values ranges between 50 and 100 of modern value 3h concentrations range between 0 3 and 1 43 tu all samples show tritium concentrations above the detection limit of 0 05 tu as the equilibrium concentration varies nearly linearly with salinity weiss 1971 the corresponding sea water fraction was applied tables 2 and 3 the ne he ratios of all samples except for nitzanim 112 3 show that he produced by alpha decay or from the mantle can be excluded hence the determination of tritiogenic 3he in all samples except for nitzanim 112 3 depends only on the 3he 4he ratio additionally fractionation of the 3he 4he ratio due to unknown salt concentrations and temperatures can be neglected benson and krause 1980 therefore ignoring the lack of knowledge of the equilibration conditions is justified all excess he above equilibrium concentrations has atmospheric 3he 4he ratio and therefore allows to use 4he to calculate the atmospheric 3he nitzanim 112 3 is the only sample with a significant concentration of radiogenic 4he of 7 6 10 6 ccstp kg indicating a small contribution of older water avrahamov et al 2018 apparent tracer ages assuming piston flow without taking into account dispersion effects are shown in table 4 and in fig 7 the average ages of all young tracers except for sample nitzanim 112 3 which was calculated using 39ar only are presented in fig 8 d and are compared to the results of the computer simulations presented below 3 4 computer simulations three feflow computer simulations are presented in order to investigate the flow dynamics of the ca hydrological systems according to the parameters presented in table 1 the results of the simulations are graphically summarized in fig 8 i steady state simulation row i ii transient conditions following 50 years of freshwater pumping row ii iii transient conditions following 100 years of freshwater pumping row iii the tracks in the fig 8 are organized according to the following a salinity profiles generated by the simulation compared to the salinity derived from the ec profiles in the well b simulation results showing the salinity color code age contours and flow lines arrows representing the flow direction and rate c simulation results showing the age color code and flow lines d age profiles generated by the simulations compared to the average ages derived from the tracers at steady state conditions the fsi is sharp and the only discharge of both fresh and saline groundwater is at the shoreline fig 8b track a in this simulation the total flux of fresh groundwater from the surface to the shoreline is 4 1 m3 d across a 1 m wide block and the total flux of the circulating saline groundwater is 0 33 m3 m d also the velocities of fresh groundwater 1 5 cm d are an order of magnitude higher than the saline groundwater velocities 0 1 cm d however the freshwater flow distance from its recharge at the surface to the shoreline 15 km is two orders of magnitude larger than the maximal extent of the saline groundwater flows 200 m the weighed effect of flow rate and transport distance leads to older fresh groundwater in comparison with the saline groundwater around the fsi at shallow depths fig 8c track i at greater depths however the saline groundwater is stagnant and very old in comparison with the younger freshwater system in the presence of pumping the flow rate of freshwater towards the fsi decreases leading to seawater intrusion and inland migration of the fsi fig 8a c tracks ii and iii while the intruding seawater plume increases the salinity of the ca the effect of the intruding seawater on the groundwater age is not trivial near the shoreline at shallow depths as a result of pumping young saline groundwater is pulled inland and intrude the reservoir while displacing the older freshwater further away from the shoreline inland the deeper and older saline groundwater intrude the aquifer and displace the younger freshwater fig 8b d tracks ii and iii 4 discussion 4 1 fresh and saline groundwater flow dynamics and mixing the comparison between the ec of the measured samples and the steady state salinity profiles generated by the feflow computer simulations implies that the current location of the fsi is significantly shallower and also located further inland than the expected location based on steady state assumptions fig 8a track i although the water levels in the area have been continuously increasing and the deep cone of depressions have been filled since 2013 fig 3 the fsi location at 2016 implies that it is located further inland in comparison with the pristine steady state modelled conditions fig 8b track i given the continuation of the restoration of positive groundwater levels the fsi is expected to continue withdrawing seaward 4 2 fresh and saline groundwater ages since the bimodal behaviour of the system is related to the type of water saline and fresh and the seawater fraction is determined by the chloride content budgets of tracer activity can be formulated in order to date both water components the results of the numerical simulations suggests that each water body fresh or saline intermixes prior to their mixing with one another at the fsi the mixing is attributed to non parallel advective flow shown in the flow lines in figs 8b and 7c and dispersion for instance a some of the deep and relatively old fresh groundwaters flow parallel to the fsi and intermix with shallower and younger freshwater upon their way towards the surface b some mixing also occurs along the circular travel path of the saline groundwater between older and younger saline groundwater intermixing of sub parcels of water with similar composition in either the freshwater or the saline groundwater systems results in a unimodal age distribution for each system separately post et al 2013 visser et al 2013 additionally dispersive processes of both the saline and freshwater components lead to an age distribution rather than a single age dispersive processes as these mixtures migrate upwards towards the sea older groundwaters both saline and fresh are transported from depths towards the surface mixing with younger water both saline and fresh these aforementioned flow dynamics lead to a complex age distribution that varies throughout the ca hydrological system which makes the interpretation of groundwater ages difficult post et al 2013 voss 1999 in order to interpret the groundwater ages in the complex ca system we applied the following approaches a tracer data analysis using a piston flow model pfm binary mixing bm including a lumped dispersion parameter model dm the bm and dm are supported by the multi tracer approach allowing to date the fresh and saline water separately b computer simulations ages derived by the feflow numerical simulations were compared to pfm ages derived by the tracer analysis 4 3 piston flow model in the pfm the system is strongly simplified and the whole water sample is considered to have a single age which represents an average of the fresh and saltwater components the above mentioned dispersive processes are neglected as well these pf ages table 3 are calculated individually per tracer using the techniques discussed in the methods section the ages derived are presented in table 4 and fig 7 the results indicate that all samples contain predominantly modern components post 1950s except for the nitzanim 112 3 sample 715 m from the shoreline which contains both modern tracers and a prominent sub modern component determined based on the 39ar concentrations and significant concentrations of 4he for all the samples except for nitzanim 112 3 a mean pf age was calculated by weighing the ages derived by 3h 3he and 85kr table 4 and fig 7 the samples mean pfm ages range between 25 and 46 years and do not show any dependence on depth fig 7 for the nitzanim 112 3 sample the pfm ages derived from 85kr 3h and 39ar are distinctively different table 4 and fig 7 a modern 3h 3he 85kr based age average of 40 3 years and b submodern 39ar based age of 270 years a binary mixing model to account for this apparent discrepancy is discussed below however at this point the significantly older submodern pfm age of sample 112 3 270 years is further discussed for comparison with the feflow computer simulation the computer simulation suggests that at shallow depths the fresh groundwater is older than the saline groundwater fig 8c track i at greater depths the saline groundwater is stagnant and therefore is significantly older than the younger freshwater system the effect of seawater intrusion driven by increased pumping depends on depth at shallow depths a young saline groundwater plume substitutes relatively old freshwater while at greater depths the trend reverses since older saline groundwater migrate inland while displacing younger freshwater fig 8c and d tracks ii and iii these age pattern shifts demonstrated by the model fig 8d solid lines are confirmed by the derived pfm tracer ages fig 8d solid circles under steady state conditions fig 8a track i the measured ages and the simulation conditions do not coincide however as with the salinity profiles fig 8a the derived tracer pfm ages agree well with the model prediction following a transient pumping period of 50 100 years which leads to an inland intrusion of seawater and the substitution of older freshwater at shallow depths with younger freshwater while simultaneously displacing younger freshwater with older seawater at greater depths and further inland fig 8d tracks ii and iii these fluid substitutions explain the young groundwater ages measured at shallow depths nearshore and the older groundwater ages measured more distally and deeper the match achieved between the empiric results and the computer simulations thereby increase the reliability of the trends captured in the model along with the assumed model parameters table 1 4 4 binary mixing of fresh and saline water the combination between the modern 3h 3he 85kr and submodern 39ar tracers allows to gain valuable information regarding the origin of each tracer and the ages of each fraction separately out of the samples retrieved under the scope of this study only the nitzanim 112 3 sample contained evidence for sub modern water based on 39ar and high concentration of radiogenic 4he in conjunction with the presence modern components as discussed above and indicated by the model simulations in order to examine the full gamut of water fraction and tracer concentration combinations and subsequently calculate the respective ages of each fraction an activity mass balance needs to be formulated the proportion of seawater swf in the nitzanim 112 3 sample and thus the freshwater fraction fwf is constrained by the salinity which equals to 81 and 19 respectively however since the solubilities of ar and kr in seawater is lower by 18 from that of freshwater weiss 1971 weiss and kyser 1978 the following correction is applied to correctly account for the relative contribution rc of ar and kr from each fraction yechieli et al 2019 1 r c sw 0 82 s w f fwf 0 82 s w f 2 r c fw fwf fwf 0 82 s w f the solubility correction presented in eqs 1 and 2 leads to a slight modification of the relative ar and kr contribution of the fwf and swf in the nitzanim 112 3 sample which equals to 78 and 22 respectively using the above calculated relative tracer contribution and the measured concentrations of 39ar and 81kr the following activity budgets are formulated for both tracers respectively 3 39armix rcsw a0 39ar exp λ39ar t sw rcfw a0 39ar exp λ 39ar t fw 4 85krmix rcsw a0 85kr exp λ 85kr t sw rcfw a0 85kr exp λ 85kr t fw where a0 39ar is taken as the present day atmospheric value 100 modern and a0 85kr is a time series input function which describes the 85kr concentration change as a function of recharge year for water samples collected in the year 2016 the time series function was based on the historic 85kr input bollhöfer et al 2019 kagabu et al 2017 which was allowed to decay to the year 2016 λ39ar and λ 85kr are the radioactive decay constants of 39ar and 85kr respectively t sw and t fw are the groundwater ages derived for the saline and fresh water fractions respectively using eqs 3 and 4 the ages are calculated based on the range of possible concentrations per tracer and water fraction distributing the measured tracer between fractions defines a line in scatter plot saline vs fresh water fraction ages where all possible ages combinations of each fraction are plotted fig 9 each tracer defines a separate age possibilities and the solutions that fulfil both tracer budges are represented by the intersection of both lines shaded area in fig 9 when distributing a measured tracer between fractions in the activity budgets above the lower the tracer concentration is from one fraction older age the higher the concentration is for the other younger age in the case of the nitzanim 112 3 sample only one intersection point occurs between both methods which indicates an age of the swf of 375 140 100 years with a 30 4 year old fwf 4 5 lumped dispersion parameter model while longitudinal dispersivity α is a property of the porous media additional factors lead to further apparent dispersion such effects include heterogeneity in the aquifer e g clay lenses variations in hydraulic conductivity spatial variations in rainfall and infiltration coefficients production history scale mixing via screened borehole length etc goode and konikow 1990 therefore hydrodynamic dispersion and its resultant effect on groundwater ages has also to be taken into account in particular for the interpretation of 85kr data for young component dating we used the lumped parameter dispersion model and the convolution integral described in suckow 2014 with the age distribution h t given by kreft and zuber 1979 5 h t τ d τ π d lumped t 3 2 exp t τ 2 d lumped t where t is time yr τ represents mean residence time yr and dlumped is the lumped dispersion parameter yr generally d is defined as 6 d 4 d v 2 4 α v where d is a dispersion coefficient m2 yr α is dispersivity m and υ is the flow velocity m yr estimating d based on eq 6 using the longitudinal dispersivity α 5 m and the flow velocity v 10 m yr as given by feflow a dispersion parameter d of 2 years is given in addition the apparent lumped dispersion parameter dlumped is scale dependent gelhar et al 1992 and should also account for mixing processes related to spatial extension of the recharge area and mixing across borehole perforated screen intervals since dispersion increases with scale it is estimated using gelhar et al 1992 dispersion scale relationship that for a longitudinal dimension size reservoir at a scale of 10 30 km an increase of 1 2 orders of magnitude in the dispersion parameter is expected following this approximation dlumped was estimated to exhibit a maximal value of 100 years note that dlumped can not be directly compared with the dispersivity that was used in the feflow model α 5 m which only represents the porous media effect on dispersion the width of the age bands fig 9 were adjusted according to both the assumed lumped dispersion parameter as well as the analytical uncertainties 1σ the resulting 85kr age band between the extreme cases d 0 yr pf and d 100 yr is shown in fig 9 the moderately small 85kr analytical uncertainty widens this age range only marginally in contrast to 85kr the width of the 39ar based age band is controlled by the relatively large analytical error associated with its measurement furthermore the dispersion effect is also negligible because of the small 39ar concentrations gradient during the time scale considered here the combination of the 85kr and 39ar data results in possible swf and fwf ages of 30 60 yr and 260 500 yr respectively with an age of 30 60 years for the fwf depending on whether a pfm or a dm is implemented the fwf basically contributed all of the 85kr present in the sample note that the 39ar age for the saline water converges towards a minimal age of 173 years to demonstrate an exterme case where all 39ar activity is attributed to the saline component eq 3 5 summary and conclusions seawater intrusion dynamics have been addressed experimentally by multiple age tracers 39ar 85kr and 3h and using a computer simulation for the nitzanim coastal reserve in israel the combination of tracers has allowed to individually date the fresh and saline groundwater fractions when applied alongside with the young tracers the usage of the submodern 39ar dating tool has enabled the derivation of saline groundwater ages in the order of hundreds of years through the results it is shown that the usage of a single tracer leads to unrealistic results and therefore it is advised to implement the multi tracer approach in ca systems to better determine the groundwater ages of the individual fractions the derived groundwater ages have allowed to validate the feflow numerical simulation thereby indicating that seawater has intruded inland due to enhanced pumping of freshwater upstream over the course of more than 50 years of pumping and reduction of the fresh groundwater flow rates downstream as a result groundwater close to the shoreline has been affected by young saline groundwater causing the groundwater ages to become younger in comparison with a non perturbed aquifer on the other hand the inland intrusion of seawater further away from the shoreline allowed deeper and older seawater to travel upstream resulting in older groundwater ages similar intrusion dynamics and subsequent effect on groundwater ages are expected during periods of sea level rise either through geological times or as a result of climate change while compositional changes are not subjected to change upon aquifer reclamation monitoring groundwater ages can provide insight whether the aquifer has stabilized on a new steady state or whether gradual changes are still occurring within the system and therefore the system is transient the validation of the model using the experimental data increases the reliability of the flow dynamics and ages derived by the numerical model also for non perturbed systems therefore natural processes over prolonged time scales such as density driven circulation can be modelled along with water rock interaction processes in order to determine sgd fluxes and the effect of this phenomenon on ocean chemistry credit authorship contribution statement i j reznik writing original draft

4666,excessive freshwater pumping in coastal areas result in an inland intrusion of the saltwater wedge underlying the freshwater aquifer leading to salinization of coastal aquifers while multiple approaches and techniques in the form of analytical solutions numerical simulations mass balance calculations and laboratory experiments have been used to study the flow dynamics of the density driven circulation of saltwater little is known regarding the groundwater ages in coastal aquifers and the process timescales the current study makes use of multiple age tracers such as 3h 85kr and 39ar allowing to calculate both modern and sub modern groundwater ages the ages derived based on the measured tracer values were compared to a numerical flow simulations the results indicate that seawater intrusion in the nitzanim coastal reserve prompted by excessive freshwater pumping upstream has a different effect on the ages of the shallow groundwaters in comparison with the deeper groundwater close to the shoreline 200 m at shallow depths 40 m below sea level the intruding saline groundwater is younger than the freshwater system leading to young ages of 50 years further away from the shoreline 700 m at greater depths 60 m below sea level the deep intruding saline groundwater is dated to 350 years which is significantly older than fresh groundwater ages in this part of the coastal aquifer the approach brought forward in the paper allows to better understand the timescales of density driven circulation mechanism and the effect of seawater intrusion on groundwater ages keywords coastal aquifer seawater intrusion groundwater dating 3h 3he 85kr 39ar 1 introduction coastal aquifers ca serve as a primary groundwater source worldwide increased rainfall in proximity to the shoreline shallow water table permeable deposits such as soils sands and alluvium make ca reservoirs a readily available renewable resource with more than 45 of the world s population residing within 100 km of the coastline large populations have grown to depend on ca as a vital source for water the increasing demand for water along with poor management has led to over exploitation decrease in groundwater levels and deterioration of water quality worldwide the decrease in groundwater levels result in an inland intrusion of the saltwater wedge underlying the freshwater aquifer leading to salinization of vast areas and disruption of the natural ca hydrological systems e g subsurface circulation paths and rates of intruding seawater water and element discharge in submarine springs seawater circulation is driven by several natural mechanisms and processes ranging from short term and spatially limited effects triggered by waves and tides through seasonal groundwater level variations up to long term large scale density driven dispersive mechanism the density driven saltwater circulation starts when seawater flows inland and intrude the aquifer due buoyancy forces and density differences on one hand the higher density of the seawater in comparison with freshwater leads to saline groundwater flow inland on the other hand fresh groundwater flow towards the sea hinders further intrusion of seawater meyer et al 2018 furthermore at a certain distance from the coast the density differences negate due to the rising water table head and the saltwater wedge formed in the aquifer pinches out this forms a dynamic equilibrium between the regional flow of fresh groundwater and the buoyancy forces between fresh and saline waters around the point of equilibrium the flow reverses and the returning saltwater current flows seaward while dispersing at the shallower freshwater saltwater interface fsi which forms the contact with the overriding freshwater the rate of seawater recirculation is suggested to reach a maximal value at a specific ratio of transverse dispersivity to sediment thickness smith 2004 the returning current carrying a mixture of fresh and saline groundwater normally brackish water is discharged via submarine springs the water flow rates along the fsi increase as additional fresh water joins the discharging stream despite the fact that submarine groundwater discharge sgd is patchy diffused and temporally variable it serves as an important pathway for transporting freshwater and elements required in geochemical cycles in the marine environment kim and kim 2014 wilson 2005 multiple approaches and techniques have been used to study examine and quantify the density driven circulation of saltwater the flow dynamics and transport of salts has been studied empirically in the laboratory and field as well as mathematically by analytical solutions numerical simulations and water balance calculations however as mentioned by burnett et al 2003 there is a serious lack of data to calibrate and verify such models depending on the case study seepage meters for instance could be suitable when the flow is sufficiently high usually when dominated by preferential flow paths e g fractured rock on the other hand when the flow is low due to a matrix flow regime as in the case study brought in this paper it is more challenging to detect flow rates using seepage meters which gives rise to the usage of geochemical tracers that integrate and smooth small scale variations over time and space dating tools based on radiogenic and stable isotopes have been widely used for measuring freshwater ages however they were seldom implemented for dating saltwater flow dynamics in ca calvache et al 2020 the difficulties in interpreting groundwater ages using 14c have led to the development of tools and methods which are less susceptible to water rock interactions and enable the coverage of a wide range of ages spanning from tens to hundreds of thousands of years as well as to identify multiple sources of water and mixing processes mayer et al 2014 mccallum et al 2017 solomon et al 2010 sültenfuß et al 2009 visser et al 2013 in this paper we combine the results of environmental tracers from the short lived 3h in conjunction with its daughter isotope 3he and 85kr to the relatively long lived 39ar which can date groundwater up to one thousand years old althaus et al 2009 visser et al 2013 while atmospheric concentrations of 3h and 85kr are affected by anthropogenic pollution and therefore significantly higher compared to the natural level 39ar concentrations in the atmosphere are constant and are not affected by human activity radioactive 3h was released into the atmosphere between 1955 and 1963 as a result of atmospheric thermonuclear testing which led in turn to a concentration increase of three orders of magnitude in rainwater sültenfuβ et al 2011 through time the 3h bearing rainwater which infiltrated the saturated zone decays into 3he half life t1 2 12 3 yr which accumulates in the groundwater without interacting with the host rock noble gas groundwater age is calculated by taking into account the decay in parent concentrations 3h and increase in daughter isotope 3he in conjunction with the decay constant tolstikhin 1969 radioactive 85kr is released as a byproduct of nuclear fuel reprocessing its concentration in the atmosphere has been steadily growing since the late 1950s since the late 2000s restrictions on nuclear energy production have led to a stabilization in 85kr atmospheric concentrations the 85kr based ages are derived by comparing the measured activity concentrations in the sampled groundwater to the decay corrected t1 2 10 74 yr historic atmospheric concentration bollhöfer et al 2019 the advantage of 39ar as a tracer is that it is produced in the atmosphere at a constant loosli and oeschger 1968 leading to globally constant activity concentration of 1 67 10 2 bq m3 air corresponding to 100 modern corcho alvarado et al 2007 upon isolation from the atmosphere when precipitation recharges the aquifer the 39ar decays with time t1 2 269 yr by knowing the 39ar concentrations in groundwater modern the radioactive decay equation is used to calculate the groundwater age the goal of this study is to quantitatively derive and model groundwater ages and flow rates for the ca hydrologic system specifically the aims of the current study are a introduce and exemplify the usage of radiogenic 39ar in dating sub modern density driven intruding saline water b deconvolute fresh and saline groundwater ages c use the derived ages to numerically constrain and simulate the ca dynamics while including the aquifers hydraulic parameters while taking into account the effect of over pumping on historic groundwater levels 2 methods 2 1 geological and hydrological background the israeli mediterranean coastal aquifer extends 120 km along the eastern part of the mediterranean sea fig 1 its thickness decreases eastwards from 180 m near the shoreline to less than a few meters near the eastern boundary ecker 1999 the aquifer belonging to the pleistocenic kurkar group consists of inter layered sandstone calcareous sandstone siltstone and red loam which alternate with continental and marine clays the aquifer overlays impervious marine clays of the saqiye group of pliocene age issar 1968 east of the shoreline up to a distance of 5 km clayey inter layers subdivide the aquifer into four sub aquifers some of the lower sub aquifers are confined while the upper ones are phreatic nativ and weisbrod 1994 the perennial precipitation of the southern coastal aquifer is 470 mm yr and the recharge coefficient is estimated to be 0 2 on average based on mass balance considerations gvirtzman 2002 hydrological service of israel 2018 thus the main direct recharge from rain to the southern coastal aquifer is 100 mm yr the study area is part of the nitzanim nature reserve 1 km south of the city of ashdod in the southern part of the coastal aquifer of israel fig 1 insert in this work we focused on the upper phreatic part of the aquifer the upper 100 m which is relatively homogenous composed of sand and calcareous sandstone kurkar and almost no clay lenses except for small lenses mostly in the unsaturated zone fig 2 the most saline groundwater samples in the coastal aquifer have a salinity and composition of the eastern mediterranean water 39 prior to the anthropogenic interference which started in 1930s groundwater levels in the coastal aquifer in their pristine condition were well above the sea level fig 3 a this over pumping reached a maximum in the 1960s fig 3b which created vast and deep hydrological cone of depressions leading to groundwater levels of up to 6 8 m below sea level hydrological cone of depressions below sea level have prevailed in the southern coastal aquifer until the early 1990s as a result the fsi has shifted inland by more than 1 km as a result of over pumping melloul and zeitoun 1999 since the 1990s mitigation programs and cautious management have led to a general trend of positive groundwater level restoration in the early 2000s the depressions started to fill and have been appearing more locally and sporadically but closer to the shoreline fig 3c the positive restoration trends continued and since 2015 positive water levels have been restored throughout the southern coastal aquifer of israel fig 3d the water authority of israel has defined minimal and maximal water levels lines which are constantly regulated in order to prevent seawater intrusion on one hand and major losses of freshwater to the sea on the other as a result the maximum water levels are not expected to return to the pristine water levels fig 3a 2 2 field work water samples and salinity profiles were collected from five boreholes logarithmically spaced along a cross section perpendicular to the shoreline at distance of up to 700 m from shore the boreholes drilled in the early 2000s were designed to penetrate the shallow phreatic aquifers as well as to reach below the fsi the boreholes were perforated through their entire length allowing the well to reach hydrostatic equilibrium with respect to ca hydrological units salinity profiles in the wells were generated using an electrical conductivity ec electrode along with a temperature sensor wtw 1970i connected to a 100 m cable water was pumped from various depths in a given well using a grundfos electrical submersible pump prior to sampling at least 3 well volumes were produced to assure that the samples were representative of the formation water as opposed to water stored in the well since the wells were perforated through their entire length pumping rates were maintained low 12 l min and constant in order minimize vertical mixing and contribution of water from shallower and or deeper layers the salinity of the produced sample was compared to the expected salinity based on the static ec profile for verification in most cases the expected salinity was produced and sampled fig 4 while in some cases a slight deviation towards higher salinities was observed indicating that water from greater depths were added into the sampled mixture water samples were collected while keeping an air tight system in order to avoid atmospheric contamination measurements of ph dissolved oxygen do water temperature and ec were carried out in the field with portable meters wtw 1970i 2 3 laboratory analyses laboratory measurements consisted of major ions noble gas radioisotopes 39ar and 85kr 3h he isotopes and ne major cation concentrations were analyzed by perkin elmer optima 3300 icp oes and major anions by the dionex series 40001 gradient ion chromatography with a maximum error of 3 chloride concentrations were also analyzed by titration with 0 1 n agno3 with a maximum analytical error of 2 for radioactive noble gases 39ar 85kr two to five cubic meters of groundwater were degassed in the field the field degassing device is based on a hydrophobic membrane contactor in the laboratory the ar and kr gases were separated from other gases 85kr and 39ar radionuclides were measured in low level gas proportional counters llc in the deep laboratory of the physics institute university of bern switzerland a detailed description of the analytic procedure can be found in riedmann and purtschert 2016 the analytical uncertainty associated with 39ar measurements is 5 modern for a sample larger than 2500 l air saturated water but increases with decreasing sample size the 85kr results are reported in the conventional units of dpm cckr which stands for the number of 85kr decays per minute per ml stp of kr gas with a minimal detection limit of 0 5 dpm cckr the analytical uncertainty associated with 85kr measurement is 1 dpm cckr for a water sample size 200 l samples for 3h analyses were collected in 1 5 l plastic bottles samples for he isotopes and ne analyses were collected by connecting the outlet of the pumping system to gas tight 40 ml copper tubes the copper tubes were flushed for several minutes before they were sealed with pinch off clamps analyses of 3h he isotopes and ne were conducted at the noble gas laboratory of the institute of environmental physics university of bremen germany a detailed description of the analytic procedure can be found in sültenfuß et al 2009 for groundwater samples the precision of the he and ne concentrations is better than 1 errors for 3h range from 0 05 to 0 1 tritium unit tu 3h 3he ages are derived from the remaining 3h in the aquifer and the decay produced 3he so called tritiogenic 3he all 3he components not produced by 3h decay are identified by means of 4he and ne measurements the apparent 3h 3he age is calculated using the method brought forward in sültenfuβ et al 2011 2 4 computer simulations the ca hydrological systems were simulated using feflow diersch 2013 a finite element simulator that solves the coupled variable density ground water flow and solute transport the simulator was setup along a w e cross section near the nitzanim nature reserve extending to the seafloor while taking into account the continental shelf slope fig 5 sade et al 2006 a mesh with 247 940 elements and 124 610 nodes was used with refinement near the fsi element size of 1 m2 in order to increase the stability of the numerical scheme and the accuracy of the model time steps for the transient simulations were automatically defined by the forward euler backward euler time integration method allowing for longer time steps when the solution of the previous time step converged well boundary conditions were set as follows 1 sps refid e1 no flow from the eastern boundary of the coastal aquifer as well as from the impermeable base of the aquifer saqiye formation 2 a hydraulic head gradient of 0 027 m per meter of seafloor depth z to account for the substitution of freshwater with seawater towards the sea assumed seawater density of 1 027 kg m 3 3 infiltration rate recharge influx set to a constant 100 mm year on the land surface salinity is prescribed on the sea floor 39 000 mg l and on the land surface 0 mg l the different hydraulic parameters hydraulic conductivity anisotropy porosity specific storage specific yield seawater and freshwater densities and salinities were based on information obtained from lutzky and shalev 2010 and amir et al 2013 a pumping well was assigned 3 km from the shoreline with a pumping rate of 4 m3 d m to simulate overexploitation the simulated width and location of the fsi transition zone was fitted to the salinity profiles by varying the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities following a given pumping period of 50 100 years fig 6 which is in accordance with the ca production history fig 3 the derived longitudinal and transverse dispersivity values table 1 were in the same order of magnitude as previously reported for the ca in israel abbo and gev 2008 amir et al 2013 bear et al 2001 levanon et al 2016 yakirevich et al 1998 groundwater age is defined as the elapsed time since a parcel of water entered the saturated zone ages were computed using goode s method incorporated into feflow diersch 2013 goode 1996 which is often referred as the direct age method post et al 2013 the method considers age as the concentration of a solute species which is set to zero at the start of the simulation and at the inflow boundaries this method allows to calculate the mean groundwater age that provides information on travel times and mixing processes it is important to note that while mixing old and young groundwater the mean groundwater age of the resulting mixture is arithmetically averaged a robust diagnosis can theoretically only be obtained given knowledge of the entire age distribution diersch 2013 the model was set to examine the density driven saltwater circulation dynamics rates and water ages for two main scenarios a base case steady state freshwater levels b perturbed case transient conditions used to simulate over exploitation by assigning a pumping well a comparison between the geochemical results and the computer simulation is discussed below 3 results 3 1 freshwater saltwater interface fsi present day groundwater levels at nitzanim increase monotonically with increasing distance from the shoreline as no significant hydraulic depressions exhibit inland in contrast to historic conditions based on the ec profiles fig 4 a cross section was plotted to show the fresh and saline water bodies and the fsi fig 2 with increasing distance from the shoreline the fsi is deeper and narrower close to the sea 20 40 m from the shoreline the transition from freshwater to saline water is gradual and spans over a thickness of more than 40 m this gradual transition near the shoreline has been previously attributed to advective mixing resulting from tidal oscillations and high waves associated with stormy seas groundwater level fluctuations in the nitzanim coastal reserve have been observed to vary as a result of tides and storms from a scale of few to 20 cm respectively along with short term hydraulic gradient inversions levanon et al 2013 shalev et al 2009 further away from the shoreline the effects of waves and tides diminishes leading to a sharper fsi levanon et al 2013 at a distance of 700 m the fsi is sharp and occurs over a section with a thickness of 10 m 50 60 m below ground level 3 2 chemical composition table 2 summarizes the well information and major ionic chemical composition of the 12 samples taken from 6 wells according to the following well name sampling date distance from the shoreline sampling depth ground level elevation water sample elevation temperature electrical conductivity and ionic composition of the water samples total dissolved solids tds and seawater fraction swf ionic concentrations na mg2 so4 2 and br vs cl of the collected samples all fall on a mixing line connecting the origin freshwater with the composition of mediterranean seawater the conservative behaviour of these major ionic constituents with respect to seawater indicates that the saline end member is seawater and not an alternative brine sivan et al 2005 the non conservative behaviour of ca2 k and sr2 results from cation exchange during salinization and freshening events russak and sivan 2010 therefore the swf is defined based on the concentration of cl the waters found in the ca are therefore defined as freshwater up to 400 mg cl l seawater 22 400 mg cl l and their range of mixtures table 2 3 3 age tracers table 3 depicts the radioactive and stable isotopes measured in the water samples collected in the study the table includes the well name sampling date distance from the shoreline water sample elevation swf the bulk concentrations measured for 85kr 39ar 3h tritiogenic 3he and δ3he recharge temperature for noble gas equilibration calculations was assumed to be 20 c 85kr activities vary from 2 1 to 10 4 dpm cckr 39ar values ranges between 50 and 100 of modern value 3h concentrations range between 0 3 and 1 43 tu all samples show tritium concentrations above the detection limit of 0 05 tu as the equilibrium concentration varies nearly linearly with salinity weiss 1971 the corresponding sea water fraction was applied tables 2 and 3 the ne he ratios of all samples except for nitzanim 112 3 show that he produced by alpha decay or from the mantle can be excluded hence the determination of tritiogenic 3he in all samples except for nitzanim 112 3 depends only on the 3he 4he ratio additionally fractionation of the 3he 4he ratio due to unknown salt concentrations and temperatures can be neglected benson and krause 1980 therefore ignoring the lack of knowledge of the equilibration conditions is justified all excess he above equilibrium concentrations has atmospheric 3he 4he ratio and therefore allows to use 4he to calculate the atmospheric 3he nitzanim 112 3 is the only sample with a significant concentration of radiogenic 4he of 7 6 10 6 ccstp kg indicating a small contribution of older water avrahamov et al 2018 apparent tracer ages assuming piston flow without taking into account dispersion effects are shown in table 4 and in fig 7 the average ages of all young tracers except for sample nitzanim 112 3 which was calculated using 39ar only are presented in fig 8 d and are compared to the results of the computer simulations presented below 3 4 computer simulations three feflow computer simulations are presented in order to investigate the flow dynamics of the ca hydrological systems according to the parameters presented in table 1 the results of the simulations are graphically summarized in fig 8 i steady state simulation row i ii transient conditions following 50 years of freshwater pumping row ii iii transient conditions following 100 years of freshwater pumping row iii the tracks in the fig 8 are organized according to the following a salinity profiles generated by the simulation compared to the salinity derived from the ec profiles in the well b simulation results showing the salinity color code age contours and flow lines arrows representing the flow direction and rate c simulation results showing the age color code and flow lines d age profiles generated by the simulations compared to the average ages derived from the tracers at steady state conditions the fsi is sharp and the only discharge of both fresh and saline groundwater is at the shoreline fig 8b track a in this simulation the total flux of fresh groundwater from the surface to the shoreline is 4 1 m3 d across a 1 m wide block and the total flux of the circulating saline groundwater is 0 33 m3 m d also the velocities of fresh groundwater 1 5 cm d are an order of magnitude higher than the saline groundwater velocities 0 1 cm d however the freshwater flow distance from its recharge at the surface to the shoreline 15 km is two orders of magnitude larger than the maximal extent of the saline groundwater flows 200 m the weighed effect of flow rate and transport distance leads to older fresh groundwater in comparison with the saline groundwater around the fsi at shallow depths fig 8c track i at greater depths however the saline groundwater is stagnant and very old in comparison with the younger freshwater system in the presence of pumping the flow rate of freshwater towards the fsi decreases leading to seawater intrusion and inland migration of the fsi fig 8a c tracks ii and iii while the intruding seawater plume increases the salinity of the ca the effect of the intruding seawater on the groundwater age is not trivial near the shoreline at shallow depths as a result of pumping young saline groundwater is pulled inland and intrude the reservoir while displacing the older freshwater further away from the shoreline inland the deeper and older saline groundwater intrude the aquifer and displace the younger freshwater fig 8b d tracks ii and iii 4 discussion 4 1 fresh and saline groundwater flow dynamics and mixing the comparison between the ec of the measured samples and the steady state salinity profiles generated by the feflow computer simulations implies that the current location of the fsi is significantly shallower and also located further inland than the expected location based on steady state assumptions fig 8a track i although the water levels in the area have been continuously increasing and the deep cone of depressions have been filled since 2013 fig 3 the fsi location at 2016 implies that it is located further inland in comparison with the pristine steady state modelled conditions fig 8b track i given the continuation of the restoration of positive groundwater levels the fsi is expected to continue withdrawing seaward 4 2 fresh and saline groundwater ages since the bimodal behaviour of the system is related to the type of water saline and fresh and the seawater fraction is determined by the chloride content budgets of tracer activity can be formulated in order to date both water components the results of the numerical simulations suggests that each water body fresh or saline intermixes prior to their mixing with one another at the fsi the mixing is attributed to non parallel advective flow shown in the flow lines in figs 8b and 7c and dispersion for instance a some of the deep and relatively old fresh groundwaters flow parallel to the fsi and intermix with shallower and younger freshwater upon their way towards the surface b some mixing also occurs along the circular travel path of the saline groundwater between older and younger saline groundwater intermixing of sub parcels of water with similar composition in either the freshwater or the saline groundwater systems results in a unimodal age distribution for each system separately post et al 2013 visser et al 2013 additionally dispersive processes of both the saline and freshwater components lead to an age distribution rather than a single age dispersive processes as these mixtures migrate upwards towards the sea older groundwaters both saline and fresh are transported from depths towards the surface mixing with younger water both saline and fresh these aforementioned flow dynamics lead to a complex age distribution that varies throughout the ca hydrological system which makes the interpretation of groundwater ages difficult post et al 2013 voss 1999 in order to interpret the groundwater ages in the complex ca system we applied the following approaches a tracer data analysis using a piston flow model pfm binary mixing bm including a lumped dispersion parameter model dm the bm and dm are supported by the multi tracer approach allowing to date the fresh and saline water separately b computer simulations ages derived by the feflow numerical simulations were compared to pfm ages derived by the tracer analysis 4 3 piston flow model in the pfm the system is strongly simplified and the whole water sample is considered to have a single age which represents an average of the fresh and saltwater components the above mentioned dispersive processes are neglected as well these pf ages table 3 are calculated individually per tracer using the techniques discussed in the methods section the ages derived are presented in table 4 and fig 7 the results indicate that all samples contain predominantly modern components post 1950s except for the nitzanim 112 3 sample 715 m from the shoreline which contains both modern tracers and a prominent sub modern component determined based on the 39ar concentrations and significant concentrations of 4he for all the samples except for nitzanim 112 3 a mean pf age was calculated by weighing the ages derived by 3h 3he and 85kr table 4 and fig 7 the samples mean pfm ages range between 25 and 46 years and do not show any dependence on depth fig 7 for the nitzanim 112 3 sample the pfm ages derived from 85kr 3h and 39ar are distinctively different table 4 and fig 7 a modern 3h 3he 85kr based age average of 40 3 years and b submodern 39ar based age of 270 years a binary mixing model to account for this apparent discrepancy is discussed below however at this point the significantly older submodern pfm age of sample 112 3 270 years is further discussed for comparison with the feflow computer simulation the computer simulation suggests that at shallow depths the fresh groundwater is older than the saline groundwater fig 8c track i at greater depths the saline groundwater is stagnant and therefore is significantly older than the younger freshwater system the effect of seawater intrusion driven by increased pumping depends on depth at shallow depths a young saline groundwater plume substitutes relatively old freshwater while at greater depths the trend reverses since older saline groundwater migrate inland while displacing younger freshwater fig 8c and d tracks ii and iii these age pattern shifts demonstrated by the model fig 8d solid lines are confirmed by the derived pfm tracer ages fig 8d solid circles under steady state conditions fig 8a track i the measured ages and the simulation conditions do not coincide however as with the salinity profiles fig 8a the derived tracer pfm ages agree well with the model prediction following a transient pumping period of 50 100 years which leads to an inland intrusion of seawater and the substitution of older freshwater at shallow depths with younger freshwater while simultaneously displacing younger freshwater with older seawater at greater depths and further inland fig 8d tracks ii and iii these fluid substitutions explain the young groundwater ages measured at shallow depths nearshore and the older groundwater ages measured more distally and deeper the match achieved between the empiric results and the computer simulations thereby increase the reliability of the trends captured in the model along with the assumed model parameters table 1 4 4 binary mixing of fresh and saline water the combination between the modern 3h 3he 85kr and submodern 39ar tracers allows to gain valuable information regarding the origin of each tracer and the ages of each fraction separately out of the samples retrieved under the scope of this study only the nitzanim 112 3 sample contained evidence for sub modern water based on 39ar and high concentration of radiogenic 4he in conjunction with the presence modern components as discussed above and indicated by the model simulations in order to examine the full gamut of water fraction and tracer concentration combinations and subsequently calculate the respective ages of each fraction an activity mass balance needs to be formulated the proportion of seawater swf in the nitzanim 112 3 sample and thus the freshwater fraction fwf is constrained by the salinity which equals to 81 and 19 respectively however since the solubilities of ar and kr in seawater is lower by 18 from that of freshwater weiss 1971 weiss and kyser 1978 the following correction is applied to correctly account for the relative contribution rc of ar and kr from each fraction yechieli et al 2019 1 r c sw 0 82 s w f fwf 0 82 s w f 2 r c fw fwf fwf 0 82 s w f the solubility correction presented in eqs 1 and 2 leads to a slight modification of the relative ar and kr contribution of the fwf and swf in the nitzanim 112 3 sample which equals to 78 and 22 respectively using the above calculated relative tracer contribution and the measured concentrations of 39ar and 81kr the following activity budgets are formulated for both tracers respectively 3 39armix rcsw a0 39ar exp λ39ar t sw rcfw a0 39ar exp λ 39ar t fw 4 85krmix rcsw a0 85kr exp λ 85kr t sw rcfw a0 85kr exp λ 85kr t fw where a0 39ar is taken as the present day atmospheric value 100 modern and a0 85kr is a time series input function which describes the 85kr concentration change as a function of recharge year for water samples collected in the year 2016 the time series function was based on the historic 85kr input bollhöfer et al 2019 kagabu et al 2017 which was allowed to decay to the year 2016 λ39ar and λ 85kr are the radioactive decay constants of 39ar and 85kr respectively t sw and t fw are the groundwater ages derived for the saline and fresh water fractions respectively using eqs 3 and 4 the ages are calculated based on the range of possible concentrations per tracer and water fraction distributing the measured tracer between fractions defines a line in scatter plot saline vs fresh water fraction ages where all possible ages combinations of each fraction are plotted fig 9 each tracer defines a separate age possibilities and the solutions that fulfil both tracer budges are represented by the intersection of both lines shaded area in fig 9 when distributing a measured tracer between fractions in the activity budgets above the lower the tracer concentration is from one fraction older age the higher the concentration is for the other younger age in the case of the nitzanim 112 3 sample only one intersection point occurs between both methods which indicates an age of the swf of 375 140 100 years with a 30 4 year old fwf 4 5 lumped dispersion parameter model while longitudinal dispersivity α is a property of the porous media additional factors lead to further apparent dispersion such effects include heterogeneity in the aquifer e g clay lenses variations in hydraulic conductivity spatial variations in rainfall and infiltration coefficients production history scale mixing via screened borehole length etc goode and konikow 1990 therefore hydrodynamic dispersion and its resultant effect on groundwater ages has also to be taken into account in particular for the interpretation of 85kr data for young component dating we used the lumped parameter dispersion model and the convolution integral described in suckow 2014 with the age distribution h t given by kreft and zuber 1979 5 h t τ d τ π d lumped t 3 2 exp t τ 2 d lumped t where t is time yr τ represents mean residence time yr and dlumped is the lumped dispersion parameter yr generally d is defined as 6 d 4 d v 2 4 α v where d is a dispersion coefficient m2 yr α is dispersivity m and υ is the flow velocity m yr estimating d based on eq 6 using the longitudinal dispersivity α 5 m and the flow velocity v 10 m yr as given by feflow a dispersion parameter d of 2 years is given in addition the apparent lumped dispersion parameter dlumped is scale dependent gelhar et al 1992 and should also account for mixing processes related to spatial extension of the recharge area and mixing across borehole perforated screen intervals since dispersion increases with scale it is estimated using gelhar et al 1992 dispersion scale relationship that for a longitudinal dimension size reservoir at a scale of 10 30 km an increase of 1 2 orders of magnitude in the dispersion parameter is expected following this approximation dlumped was estimated to exhibit a maximal value of 100 years note that dlumped can not be directly compared with the dispersivity that was used in the feflow model α 5 m which only represents the porous media effect on dispersion the width of the age bands fig 9 were adjusted according to both the assumed lumped dispersion parameter as well as the analytical uncertainties 1σ the resulting 85kr age band between the extreme cases d 0 yr pf and d 100 yr is shown in fig 9 the moderately small 85kr analytical uncertainty widens this age range only marginally in contrast to 85kr the width of the 39ar based age band is controlled by the relatively large analytical error associated with its measurement furthermore the dispersion effect is also negligible because of the small 39ar concentrations gradient during the time scale considered here the combination of the 85kr and 39ar data results in possible swf and fwf ages of 30 60 yr and 260 500 yr respectively with an age of 30 60 years for the fwf depending on whether a pfm or a dm is implemented the fwf basically contributed all of the 85kr present in the sample note that the 39ar age for the saline water converges towards a minimal age of 173 years to demonstrate an exterme case where all 39ar activity is attributed to the saline component eq 3 5 summary and conclusions seawater intrusion dynamics have been addressed experimentally by multiple age tracers 39ar 85kr and 3h and using a computer simulation for the nitzanim coastal reserve in israel the combination of tracers has allowed to individually date the fresh and saline groundwater fractions when applied alongside with the young tracers the usage of the submodern 39ar dating tool has enabled the derivation of saline groundwater ages in the order of hundreds of years through the results it is shown that the usage of a single tracer leads to unrealistic results and therefore it is advised to implement the multi tracer approach in ca systems to better determine the groundwater ages of the individual fractions the derived groundwater ages have allowed to validate the feflow numerical simulation thereby indicating that seawater has intruded inland due to enhanced pumping of freshwater upstream over the course of more than 50 years of pumping and reduction of the fresh groundwater flow rates downstream as a result groundwater close to the shoreline has been affected by young saline groundwater causing the groundwater ages to become younger in comparison with a non perturbed aquifer on the other hand the inland intrusion of seawater further away from the shoreline allowed deeper and older seawater to travel upstream resulting in older groundwater ages similar intrusion dynamics and subsequent effect on groundwater ages are expected during periods of sea level rise either through geological times or as a result of climate change while compositional changes are not subjected to change upon aquifer reclamation monitoring groundwater ages can provide insight whether the aquifer has stabilized on a new steady state or whether gradual changes are still occurring within the system and therefore the system is transient the validation of the model using the experimental data increases the reliability of the flow dynamics and ages derived by the numerical model also for non perturbed systems therefore natural processes over prolonged time scales such as density driven circulation can be modelled along with water rock interaction processes in order to determine sgd fluxes and the effect of this phenomenon on ocean chemistry credit authorship contribution statement i j reznik writing original draft

4667,detection of the type of trend in temperature data by distinguishing between deterministic and stochastic trends has important implications for understanding climate change the unit root tests urts have been widely used for detecting the type of trend but they do not consider the possibility of fractional integration and its influences in this study we detected the type of trends in observed surface air temperature during 1960 2019 at 558 stations across china by considering fractional integration the whole period was divided into three sub periods by two structural breakpoints denoted as sbp1 and sbp2 the fractional differencing parameter d was estimated by the local whittle lw function and then three urts namely pp kpss and za were used to detect the type of trends in the temperature data during different sub periods the results indicated that the de seasoned monthly temperature dmt series were fractionally integrated and thus exhibited long range dependence characteristics which significantly influenced the estimation of the slope of trend and detection of the type of trend compared with the lw function the ordinary least squares method yielded biased estimation of the slope of trend as it could not eliminate the influence of long range dependence of the dmt series the dmt series with weak long range dependence or anti persistent characteristics during 1960 sbp1 sbp1 sbp2 and sbp2 2019 were accurately detected as deterministic trends however the dmt series with strong long range dependence during sbp1 2019 and 1960 2019 were detected to have stochastic trends by the kpss test following the results of the fractional integration and urts together temperature over short periods in china were detected to have deterministic trends but those at long periods were detected to have a combination of long range dependence and deterministic trends keywords temperature variability deterministic trend stochastic trend unit root test fractional integration long range dependence 1 introduction climate change has recently been attracting much attention worldwide due to its significant impacts on natural systems human society and economic development duan et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 narita et al 2020 frame et al 2020 reddin et al 2020 as an important indicator of climate change global temperature exhibits an increasing trend but also with significant variability qian and qin 2006 ipcc 2014 many studies have attempted to evaluate the significance of trend in temperature and its attribution liu et al 2004 qian and lin 2004 li et al 2013 the variability in temperature can be attributed to the greenhouse gases ghgs aerosols and internal dynamics such as the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo wang et al 2013 chen and tung 2017 gong et al 2019 sang et al 2020a a linear trend quantified by its slope is a simple approach that is widely used to describe the temperature change at long timescales dai and wang 2010 barbosa 2011 courtillot et al 2013 sang et al 2014 dittus et al 2018 the estimation of the linear trend is usually achieved by the ordinary least squares ols method which assumes that the residual of a time series i e de trended series is a random independent variable drawn from gaussian distribution however such an assumption may not be satisfied by many temperature time series whose residuals have dependent rather than independent characteristics gil alana and sauci 2019 mudelsee 2019 thus causing a biased estimation of linear trends in temperature data the unit root process also called as difference stationarity is an important representation of dependent characteristics of a time series a time series with unit root process has a stochastic trend rather than a deterministic including linear trend and two time series with unit root processes may present a spurious regression relationship kaufmann and stern 2002 kaufmann et al 2010 thus it is important to distinguish between deterministic and stochastic trends by considering unit root process as a basis for obtaining an accurate estimation of trends in temperature data the unit root tests urts are widely used to detect unit root process and identify stochastic trends there exist many different urts including the dickey fuller df test augmented dickey fuller adf test phillips perron pp test and the kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shim kpss test the results from the different urts however may often be different and inconsistent and sometimes even contradictory and lead to inaccurate interpretations and conclusions about the type of trend for example regarding the global mean sea surface temperature sst the pp test suggested a deterministic trend while the kpss test suggested a stochastic trend barbosa 2011 some studies have reported that the contradictory results from the different urts could be due to the presence of structural breaks i e abrupt change points or shifts i e turning points in a time series as they weaken and even invalidate the statistical tests gay garcia et al 2009 coggin 2012 and cause biased kpss test results besides some other studies have suggested that noise in temperature data contaminates the signal of trend and further causes biased urt results to overcome the influence of these factors some studies have recently considered the cointegration relationship between the causative variables and the resulting variable to detect unit root process and the type of trend in the latter for example the cointegration relationship between temperature resulting variable and radiative forcing causative variable was analyzed by kaufmann and stern 2002 kaufmann et al 2006a kaufmann et al 2006b kaufmann et al 2010 kaufmann et al 2011 kaufmann et al 2013 in these studies since the radiative forcing was detected as a unit root process temperature was suggested to have a stochastic trend although its deterministic trend was directly detected by the pp test regardless of whether the trend in temperature is detected directly by urts or through the analysis of cointegration relationship the analysis ignores the possibility of fractional integration which is usually quantified by a fractional differencing parameter d and described as i d caporin and gupta 2017 yaya et al 2020 following the definition of fractional integration beenstock et al 2012 a time series with deterministic trend unit root process and fractional integration is denoted as i 0 i 1 and i d 0 d 1 respectively the pp and kpss tests only assume that d is an integer equal to 1 and 0 respectively rejecting the null hypothesis of the pp test means d 1 but it cannot support d 0 similarly rejection of the null hypothesis of the kpss test means d 0 but without supporting d 1 beenstock et al 2012 this implies that the pp and kpss tests cannot give a definitive conclusion on a deterministic or stochastic trend because they do not consider the situations where 0 d 1 generally the fractional differencing parameter d indicates the degree of long range dependence in a time series which means that the autocorrelation coefficient decays slowly following a power law and the next value in the time series requires knowledge of often many past values frich et al 2002 rybski et al 2006 2008 payne and gil alana 2018 monge and gil alana 2019 solarin et al 2020 while the long term correlations at large time lags are individually small their cumulative effects are non negligible and even may exhibit a visually significant trend within sub periods of a time series although there is no sizeable trend over the whole period considered fatichi et al 2009 there is increasing evidence showing that surface air temperature exhibits a long range dependent behavior beran 1994 rybski et al 2006 franzke 2012 therefore in view of the limitations of the urts and the possibility of inconsistent detection of trend in temperature and other hydroclimatic data fractional integration should be considered for more reliable results many studies have investigated the variability in temperature in china and its attribution sang et al 2012 to and yu 2016 paranunzio et al 2019 cui et al 2019 however the possible presence of a deterministic linear trend in temperature and its detection have not been properly addressed yet the spatiotemporal variability in temperature and its complex underlying physical mechanisms make this problem particularly challenging this provided the motivation for the present study the main objective of this study was to detect the type of trends in surface air temperature in china by examining the influence of fractional integration specifically the fractional differencing parameter d of the surface air temperature data at 558 stations across china during 1960 2019 were estimated using the local whittle lw function the results were also compared with the results from the urts to investigate the influence of long range dependence on the detection of the type of trend using the urts the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the data used in this study section 3 introduces the methods for estimating the fractional differencing parameter in temperature data and detecting the type of trends in temperature data including the pp test kpss test and zivot and andrews za test section 4 presents the results from the different methods followed by a discussion in section 5 finally conclusions are given in section 6 2 data the monthly surface air temperature data measured at 558 meteorological stations across china were used for this study the data from all the 558 stations had the same continuous period of 1960 2019 considering that the variability in temperature at long timescales was of interest in this study the de seasoned monthly temperature dmt data i e the average seasonal cycle was removed from the original data were analyzed to remove the influence of the seasonal cycle on the results to investigate the possible effects of structural breakpoints on the results of the urts see section 3 2 the whole period 1960 2019 was divided into three sub periods for comparison by identifying the two dominant breakpoints denoted as sbp1 and sbp2 in each dmt time series using the zivot and andrews za test zivot and andrews 1992 in each sub period the variability in temperature at long timescales tended to be a monotonic trend the periods of sbp1 2019 and 1960 2019 were also considered to understand the long term variability in temperature and the results for the periods of 1960 sbp1 sbp1 sbp2 sbp2 2019 sbp1 2019 and 1960 2019 were compared to examine the differences in the variability in temperature 3 methods in this study the fractional differencing parameter d of temperature data was assessed using the local whittle lw function gil alana and sauci 2019 the slope of the linear trend in the temperature data was also obtained from the lw function by considering long range dependence further the results were compared with those directly estimated by the ordinary least squares method for investigating the influence of long range dependence on the estimation of linear trends the urts fatichi et al 2009 as conventional methods to distinguish deterministic trends from stochastic trends were then used to detect the type of trends in temperature data and they were compared with the fractional differencing parameters to examine the influence of long range dependence on the detection of the type of trend using the urts 3 1 local whittle function the local whittle function was used to estimate the fractional differencing parameter d in fractional integration which can be generally described as 1 y t c β t x t 1 b d x t u t t 1 2 where y t is the time series to be analyzed c is an intercept coefficient β is the slope of a linear trend and b is the backshift operator i e b x t x t 1 and u t is a stationary noise component gil alana 2015 2016 solarin et al 2020 three cases were considered in the present analysis 1 with no terms c β 0 2 with an intercept β 0 and c 0 and 3 with an intercept and a linear time trend β 0 the most appropriate d was identified by the t values of the corresponding deterministic terms the fractional differencing parameter d at 95 confidence level was estimated by the lw function in the frequency domain dahlhaus 1989 along with a testing procedure from robinson 1994 which tests the null hypothesis h 0 2 h 0 d d 0 which includes stationary d 0 0 5 and non stationary d 0 0 5 characteristics generally d 0 means anti persistent characteristics while d 0 exhibits a long range dependence and higher d reflects stronger long range dependence monge and gil alana 2019 the lw function does not rely on data differencing or data tapering and the bias of its results is negligible with respect to the standard deviation of the data gil alana 2015 therefore the lw function was used in this study to estimate the fractional differencing parameter d 3 2 unit root test the dickey fuller df test augmented dickey fuller adf test pp test and kpss test were widely used to detect unit root process and identify deterministic or stochastic trends of hydrometeorological data unlike the dickey fuller test and the augmented dickey fuller test dickey and fuller 1979 said and dickey 1984 the pp and kpss tests do not require stationary noise to be white noise data thus allowing for serial correlation and heteroscedasticity which is handled directly in the test statistic barbosa 2011 moreover the null hypothesis of the pp test and the kpss test are complementary and their joint applications can yield more accurate results when compared to either test separately to further consider the influence of structural breakpoint sbp in a time series on the urts results the za test was also used to analyze the temperature data the three methods were explained as follows 1 pp test it has the null hypothesis of difference stationarity i e stochastic trend against the alternative of trend stationarity i e deterministic trend phillips 1987 for a given time series yt e g temperature time series the pp test considers 3 y t c β t α y t 1 u t the null hypothesis of difference stationarity is described by α 1 against the alternative of α 1 rejection of the null hypothesis indicates that the trend of yt is deterministic 2 kpss test it has the null hypothesis of trend stationarity against the alternative of difference stationarity the kpss test considers 4 y t c t β t u t where c t is a random walk that presents a stochastic trend as 5 c t c t 1 ε t ε t n 0 σ ε 2 if β 0 λ σ ε 0 then the model describes a trend stationary process and the variability in yt can be characterized with a deterministic linear trend when σ ε 2 0 the model presents a difference stationary process which indicates that the trend in the temperature time series is stochastic 3 za test it has the advantages of allowing unknown structural breakpoints in a time series zivot and andrews 1992 it is based on the null hypothesis of difference stationarity i e d 1 which implies that the trend in the temperature series is stochastic versus the alternative hypothesis of trend stationarity with a one time break occurring at an unknown point the za test considers three models 6 1 y t c β t α y t 1 γ d u t u t 6 2 y t c β t α y t 1 θ d t t u t 6 3 y t c β t α y t 1 γ d u t θ d t t u t where α 1 implies that the series y t contains a unit root process and α 1 implies that the series is a trend stationary process with a one time break occurring at an unknown point the term d u t d t t is a dummy variable for a mean shift trend shift occurring at each possible sbp with a parameter γ θ to adjust its magnitude they are described as follows 7 d u t 1 i f t s b p 0 o t h e r w i s e 8 d t t t s b p i f t s b p 0 o t h e r w i s e the model in eq 6 1 permits a one time change in the average level of yt that in eq 6 2 allows for a one time change in the slope of the trend function and that in eq 6 3 combines one time changes in the average level and the slope of the trend function of yt in this study the za test was used to identify the main sbps in each of the 558 temperature time series based on which the whole period of 1960 2019 was divided into different sub periods in each sub period the type of trend in temperature was detected by the pp kpss and za tests together fig 1 shows the flowchart for the detection of deterministic or stochastic trends in the de seasoned monthly temperature dmt series in china using the different approaches considered in this study 4 results 4 1 estimation of fractional differencing parameter d in dmt data the breakpoints of the 558 dmt series were identified using the za test fig 2 presented the results in the form of the frequency of break time occurrence for all the 558 dmt series the results indicated that the two main sbps varied with the dmt series analyzed the first structural breakpoint sbp1 mainly occurred during 1970 1985 and the other sbp2 occurred during 2000 2010 with these two main breakpoints each dmt series was divided into three parts then the fractional differencing parameter d of each dmt time series during 1960 sbp1 sbp1 sbp2 sbp2 2019 sbp1 2019 and 1960 2019 was estimated using the lw function the results were presented in fig 3 and table 1 the results indicated that the d value was smaller than 0 5 for all the dmt series during the five periods implying that the dmt series were fractionally integrated and their trends were not stochastic i e deterministic during 1960 sbp1 the 389 dmt series with d 0 exhibited anti persistent characteristic except the stations in the north of the songliao river basin and the upper reaches of the yellow and yangtze river basins where dmt data exhibited long range dependence the 316 dmt series in the yangtze river basin during sbp1 sbp2 and 305 dmt series in the yellow and yangtze river basins during sbp2 2019 had d 0 versus d value of 0 0 5 in the other regions implying that these dmt series exhibited long range dependence during sbp1 2019 and 1960 2019 as many as 444 dmt series except those in the lower reaches of the yangtze river basin and 539 dmt series respectively had much bigger d values than those in the former three sub periods indicating the stronger long range dependence of the dmt series over the longer periods the 95 confidence level of d values was further estimated table 1 the results indicated that 464 470 430 425 and 131 dmt series failed to reject d 0 at 95 confidence level in the five sub periods respectively the above results suggested that the dmt series were fractionally integrated and exhibited much stronger long range dependence during sbp1 2019 and 1960 2019 than that during 1960 sbp1 sbp1 sbp2 and sbp2 2019 this implied that the dmt series cannot be simply detected as a single deterministic trend or stochastic trend and therefore that the urts should be cautiously used for the detection of the type of trend in the dmt series by considering fractional integration 4 2 influence of long range dependence on the slope of trend of dmt the estimated slopes of linear trends in the dmt series using the lw function considering the influence of long range dependence were displayed in fig 4 and table 2 during the period 1960 sbp1 fig 4 a only 47 dmt series exhibited significant upward trends during sbp1 sbp2 fig 4 b however as many as 482 dmt series distributed almost all over china showed significant upward trends with a notable exception of the stations in southwest china ren et al 2005 drew a similar conclusion that the temperature warming in china had mainly occurred since the last two decades of the 20th century which was perhaps due to the high emission of ghgs during sbp2 2019 fig 4 c significant linear trends of 305 dmt series were mainly observed in the huai hai yellow and yangtze river basins this was in agreement with the observations reported by some recent studies that the global mean surface temperature has been exhibiting a smaller warming rate since 2000 trenberth and fasullo 2014 yan et al 2016 during sbp1 2019 fig 4 d and 1960 2019 fig 4 e nearly all the dmt series 512 and 531 respectively showed significant trends with higher significance level in north china to investigate the influence of long range dependence on the slopes of linear trends in the dmt series the trends were also estimated using the ols method and then compared with the above results using the lw function note that the significance of the linear trend was not considered here for the convenience of comparison the results in figs 5 and 6 showed that the slopes of trends in the dmt series estimated by the two methods were different during 1960 sbp1 the slopes of the downward trends estimated by the ols method were larger than that by the lw function for 403 dmt series indicating that the ols method would overestimate the slopes of trends because it does not consider the long range dependence of the dmt series to be specific the long range dependence of the dmt series during 1960 sbp1 indicated pseudo downward trends which were overlapped with the true downward trends and caused the overestimation of the ols method however for the dmt series in southwest china and the boundary of the yellow and yangtze river basins the slopes of trends were underestimated by the ols method due to the pseudo upward trends from the long range dependence of the dmt data over there similarly for the dmt series in the southern part of the yangtze river basin and some other regions during sbp1 sbp2 in east china during sbp2 2019 in the southern part of the yangtze river basin during sbp1 2019 and all over china during 1960 2019 their slopes of trends were overestimated by the ols method in such cases the long range dependence exhibited pseudo upward trends which overlapped with the actual upward trend and further caused the overestimation of the upward trend in the dmt series by the ols method these different results between the lw function and the ols method suggested the necessity of considering long range dependence to identify linear trends in the dmt series 4 3 influence of long range dependence on the type of trend using unit root tests the pp kpss and za tests were applied to distinguish deterministic trends from stochastic trends in the 558 dmt series and the results were presented in table 2 the results showed that the pp and za tests rejected the null hypothesis of difference stationarity stochastic trend at all the 558 stations while the kpss test rejected the null hypothesis of trend stationarity deterministic trend at 13 81 97 241 and 427 stations during 1960 sbp1 sbp1 sbp2 sbp2 2019 sbp1 2019 and 1960 2019 respectively to investigate the influence of long range dependence on the detection of the type of trend using the urts the fractional differencing parameter d value of the dmt series was further compared with the results of the urts for the five periods the dmt series with d 0 were found to reject the null hypothesis of difference stationarity stochastic trend by the pp and za tests results not shown here implying that their trends tended to be deterministic rather than stochastic the results of the kpss test were shown in table 3 and fig 7 where the dmt series exhibited stronger long range dependence characteristics during sbp1 2019 and 1960 2019 than that during 1961 sbp1 sbp1 sbp2 and sbp2 2019 the dmt series with d 0 at 95 confidence level 459 430 393 228 and 48 in the five sub periods were detected as deterministic trends by the kpss test and the dmt series with d 0 8 41 60 202 and 377 were detected as stochastic trends the results indicated that the dmt series with stronger long range dependence were more likely to be detected as stochastic trends by the kpss test during sbp1 2019 and 1960 2019 while the trends in the dmt series with d 0 during 1961 sbp1 sbp1 sbp2 and sbp2 2019 were generally detected as deterministic by the kpss test the above results suggested that the performances of the urts were significantly influenced by the long range dependence in the dmt data generally the temperature variability consists of linear deterministic component stationary noise and oscillatory components resulting from long range dependence the former two components can be detected as trend stationary or stationary by the urts and thus would not influence the detection of the type of trend by the urts however the oscillatory components from long range dependence would be wrongly detected as stochastic trend by the kpss test moreover stronger long range dependence would generate more significant oscillatory components in the dmt series during a longer period leading to false detection of the types of trends in the dmt series by the kpss test during 1960 sbp1 sbp1 sbp2 and sbp2 2019 the dmt series with anti persistent characteristic i e d 0 or weak long range dependence i e 0 d and d 0 cannot be rejected at 95 confidence level exhibited weak oscillatory components whose influence on the results from the kpss test could be ignored and thus they were rightly detected as deterministic trend by the kpss test for the dmt series during sbp1 2019 and 1960 2019 the oscillatory components from strong long range dependence became much more significant i e 0 d and d 0 can be rejected at 95 confidence level which had big influence on the detection of the type of trend using the kpss test and caused the wrong detection of stochastic trends in the dmt series furthermore the oscillatory components could not be described with a unit root process d 1 and thus the null hypothesis of stochastic trend in the pp and za tests was rejected for all the dmt series 4 4 determination of type of trend in dmt series it is important to recognize that one cannot expect to always obtain fractional differencing parameter d 0 for hydroclimate data even when there is no or weak long range dependence in the data thus the fractional differencing parameter d and the urts were used together here to determine the type of trends in the dmt series by considering significance level of trends together to be more specific if the fractional differencing parameter d 0 5 then the significant linear trend in the corresponding dmt series was regarded as stochastic if the fractional differencing parameter d 0 could not be rejected and the results of all pp kpss and za tests indicated trend stationarity difference stationarity then the significant linear trend in the corresponding dmt series was regarded as deterministic otherwise the variability of temperature was considered to be a combination of long range dependence and deterministic trend however the insignificant linear trends were not considered here for the detection using the urts table 2 and fig 8 presented the results of the type of trend in the dmt data the significant linear trends were detected as deterministic in 23 dmt series during 1960 sbp1 in 366 dmt series during sbp1 sbp2 except some regions in the yangtze and yellow river basins and in 228 dmt series during sbp2 2019 in some regions of the yangtze yellow and songliao river basins besides the variability of dozens of dmt series were detected as a combination of long range dependence and deterministic trend during the above three periods during sbp1 2019 significant deterministic trends of 218 dmt series were observed in the yangtze river basin whereas the variability of 294 dmt series was detected as a combination of long range dependence and deterministic trend during 1960 2019 as many as 485 dmt series were identified to be a combination of long range dependence and deterministic trend but the significant linear trends in 46 dmt series in the songliao and inland river basins were detected as deterministic 5 discussion the above results suggested that the long range dependence has great influence on the detection of the type of trend in the dmt data as previous studies have reported that the structural breakpoints in a time series would also cause biased and even false detection of the type of trend by urts their relationship was examined here the trends in the dmt series without breakpoints during 1961 sbp1 sbp1 sbp2 and sbp2 2019 were basically detected as deterministic comparatively the dmt series with two one structural breakpoints during 1960 2019 sbp1 2019 tended to be detected as stochastic trends by the kpss test the results obtained here seem to support the influence of structural breakpoints in a time series however it should be noticed that the long range dependence characteristics would generate natural oscillations which inevitably include structural breakpoints in a time series especially for long time series therefore it was more reasonable to take long range dependence as the essential cause that influences the performance of different urts and the detection of the type of trend in temperature data besides some studies e g werner et al 2015 have used segment trends i e step changes to describe the variability in temperature because the variability in temperature can be better described with segmented trends than a simple linear trend the different climate components have different intrinsic timescales and quasi oscillatory climate modes and thus climate systems at global and regional scales have been changing in complex ways keenlyside et al 2008 knight et al 2009 franzke 2010 sang et al 2018 this explains well the appearance of segmented trends over sub periods to describe the variability in temperature in fact the non monotonic variability in temperature consists of deterministic component resulting from external forcing and oscillatory components resulting from natural forcing xu et al 2015 sang et al 2020b which exhibit short range and long range dependence characteristics the deterministic component can generally be described with segmented trends and well interpreted by external forcing but the oscillatory components caused by natural forcing cannot be explained well with segmented trends in terms of physical mechanisms in particular there is increasing evidence showing that surface air temperature exhibits a long range dependent behavior beran 1994 franzke 2012 therefore it is not appropriate to simply use segmented trends while dealing with temperature data and describing its long term variability 6 conclusions detection of the variability in temperature is important to understand the changes in climate and its potential impacts in climate change related studies the linear trend is frequently used for describing the long term variability in temperature this practice assumes that the residual of the time series i e de trended series is a random independent variable drawn from gaussian distribution however residual of temperature data usually has dependent rather than independent characteristics which further influence the detection of the significance of linear trends and type of trend deterministic or stochastic in this study we considered the possibility of fractional integration that is used widely to describe the dependent characteristics of time series and investigated whether the trend in surface air temperature in china is deterministic or stochastic the fractional differencing parameter d of 558 de seasoned monthly temperature dmt series over china was estimated using the local whittle lw function considering the possible effects of structural breakpoints on the results of the unit root tests urts the whole period of available data i e 1960 2019 was divided into three sub periods with two breakpoints denoted as sbp1 and sbp2 the results suggested that the dmt series were fractionally integrated and that they exhibited much stronger long range dependence during sbp1 2019 and 1960 2019 than that during 1960 sbp1 sbp1 sbp2 and sbp2 2019 the trends estimated by the lw function were compared with that by the ols method the results indicated that the ols method gave biased results of the slopes of trends in temperature data because it could not handle the pseudo trends generated from the long range dependence of series furthermore the results from the pp kpss and za tests were compared with the fractional differencing parameter d and the influence of long range dependence on the detection of the type of trend by the urts was investigated the results showed that the dmt series with weak long range dependence or anti persistent characteristic were accurately detected to have deterministic trends during 1960 sbp1 sbp1 sbp2 and sbp2 2019 however the dmt series with strong long range dependence were detected to have stochastic trends by the kpss test during sbp1 2019 and 1960 2019 which resulted from the oscillation components from long range dependence the urts and the fractional differencing parameter d were considered together to better detect the type of trend of the dmt series and the results reflected that temperature in china over short periods have a deterministic trend but have a combination of long range dependence and deterministic trend during long periods these results suggested that it would not be appropriate to directly use ols and urts such as the pp and kpss tests to detect the type of trend in temperature and to evaluate their significance level as these methods do not consider the possibility of fractional integration of time series and its influence on the detection of the type of trend and the significance of the linear trend rather considering the fractional integration of time series and various urts together is a more proper approach to detect the type of trend in temperature data the results from this study are helpful for better understanding the reality of anthropogenic global warming which may also raise the intriguing possibility of detection of anthropogenic effects on temperature increasing at regional scales the results would also help to correct the bias in climate model simulations and hence more properly address the policy related global climate change issues however to further understand the variability of temperature in china the complex underlying physical mechanisms still need to be studied by considering the effects of internal climate dynamics and other external forcing factors finally the present study can be further extended in several directions this study only examined the influence of the presence of structural breaks in temperature data in a simple manner many studies had argued that not taking the structural breaks into account might produce spurious evidence of long memory behaviors mayoral 2012 in this sense more tests of structural breaks in the context of fractional integration can be implemented in the temperature data in addition nonlinear structures are also very much related with these models diebold and inoue 2001 therefore nonlinear deterministic structures such as those based on chebyshev polynomials in time or based on fourier functions gil alana and yaya 2020 can also be implemented in the context of i d models we will address these in our future research credit authorship

4667,detection of the type of trend in temperature data by distinguishing between deterministic and stochastic trends has important implications for understanding climate change the unit root tests urts have been widely used for detecting the type of trend but they do not consider the possibility of fractional integration and its influences in this study we detected the type of trends in observed surface air temperature during 1960 2019 at 558 stations across china by considering fractional integration the whole period was divided into three sub periods by two structural breakpoints denoted as sbp1 and sbp2 the fractional differencing parameter d was estimated by the local whittle lw function and then three urts namely pp kpss and za were used to detect the type of trends in the temperature data during different sub periods the results indicated that the de seasoned monthly temperature dmt series were fractionally integrated and thus exhibited long range dependence characteristics which significantly influenced the estimation of the slope of trend and detection of the type of trend compared with the lw function the ordinary least squares method yielded biased estimation of the slope of trend as it could not eliminate the influence of long range dependence of the dmt series the dmt series with weak long range dependence or anti persistent characteristics during 1960 sbp1 sbp1 sbp2 and sbp2 2019 were accurately detected as deterministic trends however the dmt series with strong long range dependence during sbp1 2019 and 1960 2019 were detected to have stochastic trends by the kpss test following the results of the fractional integration and urts together temperature over short periods in china were detected to have deterministic trends but those at long periods were detected to have a combination of long range dependence and deterministic trends keywords temperature variability deterministic trend stochastic trend unit root test fractional integration long range dependence 1 introduction climate change has recently been attracting much attention worldwide due to its significant impacts on natural systems human society and economic development duan et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 narita et al 2020 frame et al 2020 reddin et al 2020 as an important indicator of climate change global temperature exhibits an increasing trend but also with significant variability qian and qin 2006 ipcc 2014 many studies have attempted to evaluate the significance of trend in temperature and its attribution liu et al 2004 qian and lin 2004 li et al 2013 the variability in temperature can be attributed to the greenhouse gases ghgs aerosols and internal dynamics such as the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo wang et al 2013 chen and tung 2017 gong et al 2019 sang et al 2020a a linear trend quantified by its slope is a simple approach that is widely used to describe the temperature change at long timescales dai and wang 2010 barbosa 2011 courtillot et al 2013 sang et al 2014 dittus et al 2018 the estimation of the linear trend is usually achieved by the ordinary least squares ols method which assumes that the residual of a time series i e de trended series is a random independent variable drawn from gaussian distribution however such an assumption may not be satisfied by many temperature time series whose residuals have dependent rather than independent characteristics gil alana and sauci 2019 mudelsee 2019 thus causing a biased estimation of linear trends in temperature data the unit root process also called as difference stationarity is an important representation of dependent characteristics of a time series a time series with unit root process has a stochastic trend rather than a deterministic including linear trend and two time series with unit root processes may present a spurious regression relationship kaufmann and stern 2002 kaufmann et al 2010 thus it is important to distinguish between deterministic and stochastic trends by considering unit root process as a basis for obtaining an accurate estimation of trends in temperature data the unit root tests urts are widely used to detect unit root process and identify stochastic trends there exist many different urts including the dickey fuller df test augmented dickey fuller adf test phillips perron pp test and the kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shim kpss test the results from the different urts however may often be different and inconsistent and sometimes even contradictory and lead to inaccurate interpretations and conclusions about the type of trend for example regarding the global mean sea surface temperature sst the pp test suggested a deterministic trend while the kpss test suggested a stochastic trend barbosa 2011 some studies have reported that the contradictory results from the different urts could be due to the presence of structural breaks i e abrupt change points or shifts i e turning points in a time series as they weaken and even invalidate the statistical tests gay garcia et al 2009 coggin 2012 and cause biased kpss test results besides some other studies have suggested that noise in temperature data contaminates the signal of trend and further causes biased urt results to overcome the influence of these factors some studies have recently considered the cointegration relationship between the causative variables and the resulting variable to detect unit root process and the type of trend in the latter for example the cointegration relationship between temperature resulting variable and radiative forcing causative variable was analyzed by kaufmann and stern 2002 kaufmann et al 2006a kaufmann et al 2006b kaufmann et al 2010 kaufmann et al 2011 kaufmann et al 2013 in these studies since the radiative forcing was detected as a unit root process temperature was suggested to have a stochastic trend although its deterministic trend was directly detected by the pp test regardless of whether the trend in temperature is detected directly by urts or through the analysis of cointegration relationship the analysis ignores the possibility of fractional integration which is usually quantified by a fractional differencing parameter d and described as i d caporin and gupta 2017 yaya et al 2020 following the definition of fractional integration beenstock et al 2012 a time series with deterministic trend unit root process and fractional integration is denoted as i 0 i 1 and i d 0 d 1 respectively the pp and kpss tests only assume that d is an integer equal to 1 and 0 respectively rejecting the null hypothesis of the pp test means d 1 but it cannot support d 0 similarly rejection of the null hypothesis of the kpss test means d 0 but without supporting d 1 beenstock et al 2012 this implies that the pp and kpss tests cannot give a definitive conclusion on a deterministic or stochastic trend because they do not consider the situations where 0 d 1 generally the fractional differencing parameter d indicates the degree of long range dependence in a time series which means that the autocorrelation coefficient decays slowly following a power law and the next value in the time series requires knowledge of often many past values frich et al 2002 rybski et al 2006 2008 payne and gil alana 2018 monge and gil alana 2019 solarin et al 2020 while the long term correlations at large time lags are individually small their cumulative effects are non negligible and even may exhibit a visually significant trend within sub periods of a time series although there is no sizeable trend over the whole period considered fatichi et al 2009 there is increasing evidence showing that surface air temperature exhibits a long range dependent behavior beran 1994 rybski et al 2006 franzke 2012 therefore in view of the limitations of the urts and the possibility of inconsistent detection of trend in temperature and other hydroclimatic data fractional integration should be considered for more reliable results many studies have investigated the variability in temperature in china and its attribution sang et al 2012 to and yu 2016 paranunzio et al 2019 cui et al 2019 however the possible presence of a deterministic linear trend in temperature and its detection have not been properly addressed yet the spatiotemporal variability in temperature and its complex underlying physical mechanisms make this problem particularly challenging this provided the motivation for the present study the main objective of this study was to detect the type of trends in surface air temperature in china by examining the influence of fractional integration specifically the fractional differencing parameter d of the surface air temperature data at 558 stations across china during 1960 2019 were estimated using the local whittle lw function the results were also compared with the results from the urts to investigate the influence of long range dependence on the detection of the type of trend using the urts the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the data used in this study section 3 introduces the methods for estimating the fractional differencing parameter in temperature data and detecting the type of trends in temperature data including the pp test kpss test and zivot and andrews za test section 4 presents the results from the different methods followed by a discussion in section 5 finally conclusions are given in section 6 2 data the monthly surface air temperature data measured at 558 meteorological stations across china were used for this study the data from all the 558 stations had the same continuous period of 1960 2019 considering that the variability in temperature at long timescales was of interest in this study the de seasoned monthly temperature dmt data i e the average seasonal cycle was removed from the original data were analyzed to remove the influence of the seasonal cycle on the results to investigate the possible effects of structural breakpoints on the results of the urts see section 3 2 the whole period 1960 2019 was divided into three sub periods for comparison by identifying the two dominant breakpoints denoted as sbp1 and sbp2 in each dmt time series using the zivot and andrews za test zivot and andrews 1992 in each sub period the variability in temperature at long timescales tended to be a monotonic trend the periods of sbp1 2019 and 1960 2019 were also considered to understand the long term variability in temperature and the results for the periods of 1960 sbp1 sbp1 sbp2 sbp2 2019 sbp1 2019 and 1960 2019 were compared to examine the differences in the variability in temperature 3 methods in this study the fractional differencing parameter d of temperature data was assessed using the local whittle lw function gil alana and sauci 2019 the slope of the linear trend in the temperature data was also obtained from the lw function by considering long range dependence further the results were compared with those directly estimated by the ordinary least squares method for investigating the influence of long range dependence on the estimation of linear trends the urts fatichi et al 2009 as conventional methods to distinguish deterministic trends from stochastic trends were then used to detect the type of trends in temperature data and they were compared with the fractional differencing parameters to examine the influence of long range dependence on the detection of the type of trend using the urts 3 1 local whittle function the local whittle function was used to estimate the fractional differencing parameter d in fractional integration which can be generally described as 1 y t c β t x t 1 b d x t u t t 1 2 where y t is the time series to be analyzed c is an intercept coefficient β is the slope of a linear trend and b is the backshift operator i e b x t x t 1 and u t is a stationary noise component gil alana 2015 2016 solarin et al 2020 three cases were considered in the present analysis 1 with no terms c β 0 2 with an intercept β 0 and c 0 and 3 with an intercept and a linear time trend β 0 the most appropriate d was identified by the t values of the corresponding deterministic terms the fractional differencing parameter d at 95 confidence level was estimated by the lw function in the frequency domain dahlhaus 1989 along with a testing procedure from robinson 1994 which tests the null hypothesis h 0 2 h 0 d d 0 which includes stationary d 0 0 5 and non stationary d 0 0 5 characteristics generally d 0 means anti persistent characteristics while d 0 exhibits a long range dependence and higher d reflects stronger long range dependence monge and gil alana 2019 the lw function does not rely on data differencing or data tapering and the bias of its results is negligible with respect to the standard deviation of the data gil alana 2015 therefore the lw function was used in this study to estimate the fractional differencing parameter d 3 2 unit root test the dickey fuller df test augmented dickey fuller adf test pp test and kpss test were widely used to detect unit root process and identify deterministic or stochastic trends of hydrometeorological data unlike the dickey fuller test and the augmented dickey fuller test dickey and fuller 1979 said and dickey 1984 the pp and kpss tests do not require stationary noise to be white noise data thus allowing for serial correlation and heteroscedasticity which is handled directly in the test statistic barbosa 2011 moreover the null hypothesis of the pp test and the kpss test are complementary and their joint applications can yield more accurate results when compared to either test separately to further consider the influence of structural breakpoint sbp in a time series on the urts results the za test was also used to analyze the temperature data the three methods were explained as follows 1 pp test it has the null hypothesis of difference stationarity i e stochastic trend against the alternative of trend stationarity i e deterministic trend phillips 1987 for a given time series yt e g temperature time series the pp test considers 3 y t c β t α y t 1 u t the null hypothesis of difference stationarity is described by α 1 against the alternative of α 1 rejection of the null hypothesis indicates that the trend of yt is deterministic 2 kpss test it has the null hypothesis of trend stationarity against the alternative of difference stationarity the kpss test considers 4 y t c t β t u t where c t is a random walk that presents a stochastic trend as 5 c t c t 1 ε t ε t n 0 σ ε 2 if β 0 λ σ ε 0 then the model describes a trend stationary process and the variability in yt can be characterized with a deterministic linear trend when σ ε 2 0 the model presents a difference stationary process which indicates that the trend in the temperature time series is stochastic 3 za test it has the advantages of allowing unknown structural breakpoints in a time series zivot and andrews 1992 it is based on the null hypothesis of difference stationarity i e d 1 which implies that the trend in the temperature series is stochastic versus the alternative hypothesis of trend stationarity with a one time break occurring at an unknown point the za test considers three models 6 1 y t c β t α y t 1 γ d u t u t 6 2 y t c β t α y t 1 θ d t t u t 6 3 y t c β t α y t 1 γ d u t θ d t t u t where α 1 implies that the series y t contains a unit root process and α 1 implies that the series is a trend stationary process with a one time break occurring at an unknown point the term d u t d t t is a dummy variable for a mean shift trend shift occurring at each possible sbp with a parameter γ θ to adjust its magnitude they are described as follows 7 d u t 1 i f t s b p 0 o t h e r w i s e 8 d t t t s b p i f t s b p 0 o t h e r w i s e the model in eq 6 1 permits a one time change in the average level of yt that in eq 6 2 allows for a one time change in the slope of the trend function and that in eq 6 3 combines one time changes in the average level and the slope of the trend function of yt in this study the za test was used to identify the main sbps in each of the 558 temperature time series based on which the whole period of 1960 2019 was divided into different sub periods in each sub period the type of trend in temperature was detected by the pp kpss and za tests together fig 1 shows the flowchart for the detection of deterministic or stochastic trends in the de seasoned monthly temperature dmt series in china using the different approaches considered in this study 4 results 4 1 estimation of fractional differencing parameter d in dmt data the breakpoints of the 558 dmt series were identified using the za test fig 2 presented the results in the form of the frequency of break time occurrence for all the 558 dmt series the results indicated that the two main sbps varied with the dmt series analyzed the first structural breakpoint sbp1 mainly occurred during 1970 1985 and the other sbp2 occurred during 2000 2010 with these two main breakpoints each dmt series was divided into three parts then the fractional differencing parameter d of each dmt time series during 1960 sbp1 sbp1 sbp2 sbp2 2019 sbp1 2019 and 1960 2019 was estimated using the lw function the results were presented in fig 3 and table 1 the results indicated that the d value was smaller than 0 5 for all the dmt series during the five periods implying that the dmt series were fractionally integrated and their trends were not stochastic i e deterministic during 1960 sbp1 the 389 dmt series with d 0 exhibited anti persistent characteristic except the stations in the north of the songliao river basin and the upper reaches of the yellow and yangtze river basins where dmt data exhibited long range dependence the 316 dmt series in the yangtze river basin during sbp1 sbp2 and 305 dmt series in the yellow and yangtze river basins during sbp2 2019 had d 0 versus d value of 0 0 5 in the other regions implying that these dmt series exhibited long range dependence during sbp1 2019 and 1960 2019 as many as 444 dmt series except those in the lower reaches of the yangtze river basin and 539 dmt series respectively had much bigger d values than those in the former three sub periods indicating the stronger long range dependence of the dmt series over the longer periods the 95 confidence level of d values was further estimated table 1 the results indicated that 464 470 430 425 and 131 dmt series failed to reject d 0 at 95 confidence level in the five sub periods respectively the above results suggested that the dmt series were fractionally integrated and exhibited much stronger long range dependence during sbp1 2019 and 1960 2019 than that during 1960 sbp1 sbp1 sbp2 and sbp2 2019 this implied that the dmt series cannot be simply detected as a single deterministic trend or stochastic trend and therefore that the urts should be cautiously used for the detection of the type of trend in the dmt series by considering fractional integration 4 2 influence of long range dependence on the slope of trend of dmt the estimated slopes of linear trends in the dmt series using the lw function considering the influence of long range dependence were displayed in fig 4 and table 2 during the period 1960 sbp1 fig 4 a only 47 dmt series exhibited significant upward trends during sbp1 sbp2 fig 4 b however as many as 482 dmt series distributed almost all over china showed significant upward trends with a notable exception of the stations in southwest china ren et al 2005 drew a similar conclusion that the temperature warming in china had mainly occurred since the last two decades of the 20th century which was perhaps due to the high emission of ghgs during sbp2 2019 fig 4 c significant linear trends of 305 dmt series were mainly observed in the huai hai yellow and yangtze river basins this was in agreement with the observations reported by some recent studies that the global mean surface temperature has been exhibiting a smaller warming rate since 2000 trenberth and fasullo 2014 yan et al 2016 during sbp1 2019 fig 4 d and 1960 2019 fig 4 e nearly all the dmt series 512 and 531 respectively showed significant trends with higher significance level in north china to investigate the influence of long range dependence on the slopes of linear trends in the dmt series the trends were also estimated using the ols method and then compared with the above results using the lw function note that the significance of the linear trend was not considered here for the convenience of comparison the results in figs 5 and 6 showed that the slopes of trends in the dmt series estimated by the two methods were different during 1960 sbp1 the slopes of the downward trends estimated by the ols method were larger than that by the lw function for 403 dmt series indicating that the ols method would overestimate the slopes of trends because it does not consider the long range dependence of the dmt series to be specific the long range dependence of the dmt series during 1960 sbp1 indicated pseudo downward trends which were overlapped with the true downward trends and caused the overestimation of the ols method however for the dmt series in southwest china and the boundary of the yellow and yangtze river basins the slopes of trends were underestimated by the ols method due to the pseudo upward trends from the long range dependence of the dmt data over there similarly for the dmt series in the southern part of the yangtze river basin and some other regions during sbp1 sbp2 in east china during sbp2 2019 in the southern part of the yangtze river basin during sbp1 2019 and all over china during 1960 2019 their slopes of trends were overestimated by the ols method in such cases the long range dependence exhibited pseudo upward trends which overlapped with the actual upward trend and further caused the overestimation of the upward trend in the dmt series by the ols method these different results between the lw function and the ols method suggested the necessity of considering long range dependence to identify linear trends in the dmt series 4 3 influence of long range dependence on the type of trend using unit root tests the pp kpss and za tests were applied to distinguish deterministic trends from stochastic trends in the 558 dmt series and the results were presented in table 2 the results showed that the pp and za tests rejected the null hypothesis of difference stationarity stochastic trend at all the 558 stations while the kpss test rejected the null hypothesis of trend stationarity deterministic trend at 13 81 97 241 and 427 stations during 1960 sbp1 sbp1 sbp2 sbp2 2019 sbp1 2019 and 1960 2019 respectively to investigate the influence of long range dependence on the detection of the type of trend using the urts the fractional differencing parameter d value of the dmt series was further compared with the results of the urts for the five periods the dmt series with d 0 were found to reject the null hypothesis of difference stationarity stochastic trend by the pp and za tests results not shown here implying that their trends tended to be deterministic rather than stochastic the results of the kpss test were shown in table 3 and fig 7 where the dmt series exhibited stronger long range dependence characteristics during sbp1 2019 and 1960 2019 than that during 1961 sbp1 sbp1 sbp2 and sbp2 2019 the dmt series with d 0 at 95 confidence level 459 430 393 228 and 48 in the five sub periods were detected as deterministic trends by the kpss test and the dmt series with d 0 8 41 60 202 and 377 were detected as stochastic trends the results indicated that the dmt series with stronger long range dependence were more likely to be detected as stochastic trends by the kpss test during sbp1 2019 and 1960 2019 while the trends in the dmt series with d 0 during 1961 sbp1 sbp1 sbp2 and sbp2 2019 were generally detected as deterministic by the kpss test the above results suggested that the performances of the urts were significantly influenced by the long range dependence in the dmt data generally the temperature variability consists of linear deterministic component stationary noise and oscillatory components resulting from long range dependence the former two components can be detected as trend stationary or stationary by the urts and thus would not influence the detection of the type of trend by the urts however the oscillatory components from long range dependence would be wrongly detected as stochastic trend by the kpss test moreover stronger long range dependence would generate more significant oscillatory components in the dmt series during a longer period leading to false detection of the types of trends in the dmt series by the kpss test during 1960 sbp1 sbp1 sbp2 and sbp2 2019 the dmt series with anti persistent characteristic i e d 0 or weak long range dependence i e 0 d and d 0 cannot be rejected at 95 confidence level exhibited weak oscillatory components whose influence on the results from the kpss test could be ignored and thus they were rightly detected as deterministic trend by the kpss test for the dmt series during sbp1 2019 and 1960 2019 the oscillatory components from strong long range dependence became much more significant i e 0 d and d 0 can be rejected at 95 confidence level which had big influence on the detection of the type of trend using the kpss test and caused the wrong detection of stochastic trends in the dmt series furthermore the oscillatory components could not be described with a unit root process d 1 and thus the null hypothesis of stochastic trend in the pp and za tests was rejected for all the dmt series 4 4 determination of type of trend in dmt series it is important to recognize that one cannot expect to always obtain fractional differencing parameter d 0 for hydroclimate data even when there is no or weak long range dependence in the data thus the fractional differencing parameter d and the urts were used together here to determine the type of trends in the dmt series by considering significance level of trends together to be more specific if the fractional differencing parameter d 0 5 then the significant linear trend in the corresponding dmt series was regarded as stochastic if the fractional differencing parameter d 0 could not be rejected and the results of all pp kpss and za tests indicated trend stationarity difference stationarity then the significant linear trend in the corresponding dmt series was regarded as deterministic otherwise the variability of temperature was considered to be a combination of long range dependence and deterministic trend however the insignificant linear trends were not considered here for the detection using the urts table 2 and fig 8 presented the results of the type of trend in the dmt data the significant linear trends were detected as deterministic in 23 dmt series during 1960 sbp1 in 366 dmt series during sbp1 sbp2 except some regions in the yangtze and yellow river basins and in 228 dmt series during sbp2 2019 in some regions of the yangtze yellow and songliao river basins besides the variability of dozens of dmt series were detected as a combination of long range dependence and deterministic trend during the above three periods during sbp1 2019 significant deterministic trends of 218 dmt series were observed in the yangtze river basin whereas the variability of 294 dmt series was detected as a combination of long range dependence and deterministic trend during 1960 2019 as many as 485 dmt series were identified to be a combination of long range dependence and deterministic trend but the significant linear trends in 46 dmt series in the songliao and inland river basins were detected as deterministic 5 discussion the above results suggested that the long range dependence has great influence on the detection of the type of trend in the dmt data as previous studies have reported that the structural breakpoints in a time series would also cause biased and even false detection of the type of trend by urts their relationship was examined here the trends in the dmt series without breakpoints during 1961 sbp1 sbp1 sbp2 and sbp2 2019 were basically detected as deterministic comparatively the dmt series with two one structural breakpoints during 1960 2019 sbp1 2019 tended to be detected as stochastic trends by the kpss test the results obtained here seem to support the influence of structural breakpoints in a time series however it should be noticed that the long range dependence characteristics would generate natural oscillations which inevitably include structural breakpoints in a time series especially for long time series therefore it was more reasonable to take long range dependence as the essential cause that influences the performance of different urts and the detection of the type of trend in temperature data besides some studies e g werner et al 2015 have used segment trends i e step changes to describe the variability in temperature because the variability in temperature can be better described with segmented trends than a simple linear trend the different climate components have different intrinsic timescales and quasi oscillatory climate modes and thus climate systems at global and regional scales have been changing in complex ways keenlyside et al 2008 knight et al 2009 franzke 2010 sang et al 2018 this explains well the appearance of segmented trends over sub periods to describe the variability in temperature in fact the non monotonic variability in temperature consists of deterministic component resulting from external forcing and oscillatory components resulting from natural forcing xu et al 2015 sang et al 2020b which exhibit short range and long range dependence characteristics the deterministic component can generally be described with segmented trends and well interpreted by external forcing but the oscillatory components caused by natural forcing cannot be explained well with segmented trends in terms of physical mechanisms in particular there is increasing evidence showing that surface air temperature exhibits a long range dependent behavior beran 1994 franzke 2012 therefore it is not appropriate to simply use segmented trends while dealing with temperature data and describing its long term variability 6 conclusions detection of the variability in temperature is important to understand the changes in climate and its potential impacts in climate change related studies the linear trend is frequently used for describing the long term variability in temperature this practice assumes that the residual of the time series i e de trended series is a random independent variable drawn from gaussian distribution however residual of temperature data usually has dependent rather than independent characteristics which further influence the detection of the significance of linear trends and type of trend deterministic or stochastic in this study we considered the possibility of fractional integration that is used widely to describe the dependent characteristics of time series and investigated whether the trend in surface air temperature in china is deterministic or stochastic the fractional differencing parameter d of 558 de seasoned monthly temperature dmt series over china was estimated using the local whittle lw function considering the possible effects of structural breakpoints on the results of the unit root tests urts the whole period of available data i e 1960 2019 was divided into three sub periods with two breakpoints denoted as sbp1 and sbp2 the results suggested that the dmt series were fractionally integrated and that they exhibited much stronger long range dependence during sbp1 2019 and 1960 2019 than that during 1960 sbp1 sbp1 sbp2 and sbp2 2019 the trends estimated by the lw function were compared with that by the ols method the results indicated that the ols method gave biased results of the slopes of trends in temperature data because it could not handle the pseudo trends generated from the long range dependence of series furthermore the results from the pp kpss and za tests were compared with the fractional differencing parameter d and the influence of long range dependence on the detection of the type of trend by the urts was investigated the results showed that the dmt series with weak long range dependence or anti persistent characteristic were accurately detected to have deterministic trends during 1960 sbp1 sbp1 sbp2 and sbp2 2019 however the dmt series with strong long range dependence were detected to have stochastic trends by the kpss test during sbp1 2019 and 1960 2019 which resulted from the oscillation components from long range dependence the urts and the fractional differencing parameter d were considered together to better detect the type of trend of the dmt series and the results reflected that temperature in china over short periods have a deterministic trend but have a combination of long range dependence and deterministic trend during long periods these results suggested that it would not be appropriate to directly use ols and urts such as the pp and kpss tests to detect the type of trend in temperature and to evaluate their significance level as these methods do not consider the possibility of fractional integration of time series and its influence on the detection of the type of trend and the significance of the linear trend rather considering the fractional integration of time series and various urts together is a more proper approach to detect the type of trend in temperature data the results from this study are helpful for better understanding the reality of anthropogenic global warming which may also raise the intriguing possibility of detection of anthropogenic effects on temperature increasing at regional scales the results would also help to correct the bias in climate model simulations and hence more properly address the policy related global climate change issues however to further understand the variability of temperature in china the complex underlying physical mechanisms still need to be studied by considering the effects of internal climate dynamics and other external forcing factors finally the present study can be further extended in several directions this study only examined the influence of the presence of structural breaks in temperature data in a simple manner many studies had argued that not taking the structural breaks into account might produce spurious evidence of long memory behaviors mayoral 2012 in this sense more tests of structural breaks in the context of fractional integration can be implemented in the temperature data in addition nonlinear structures are also very much related with these models diebold and inoue 2001 therefore nonlinear deterministic structures such as those based on chebyshev polynomials in time or based on fourier functions gil alana and yaya 2020 can also be implemented in the context of i d models we will address these in our future research credit authorship

4668,numerical simulation of three dimensional water flow and solute transport in containerized variably saturated soilless substrates with complex hydraulic properties and boundary conditions necessitates high resolution discretization of the spatial and temporal domains which commonly leads to several million nodes requiring numerical evaluation even today s computing prowess of workstations is not adequate to tackle such problems within a reasonable timeframe especially when numerous realizations are required to optimize the geometry substrate properties and irrigation and fertigation management of soilless plant growth modules hence the parallelization of the numerical code and utilization of high performance computing hpc are essential here we adapted and applied the parswms parallelized code that is amenable to solving the 3d richards equation for water flow and the convection dispersion equation for solute transport subject to linear solute adsorption the code was modified to allow for nonlinear equilibrium solute adsorption with new boundary conditions and applied to simulate water flow and nitrogen and phosphorus transport in containerized soilless substrates multi solute transport simulations with the modified linux parswms code were first performed on a workstation and referenced to the windows based hydrus 2d 3d numerical code after confirming the agreement between the modified parswms code and hydrus 2d 3d various preconditioners and iterative solvers were evaluated to find the computationally most efficient combinations the performance of the modified parswms code and its stability were compared to hydrus 2d 3d simulations for three soilless substrates consisting of horticultural perlite volcanic tuff and a volcanic tuff coconut coir mixture considering the solute mass balance error as a stability measure parswms outperformed hydrus 2d 3d moreover simulations with the modified parswms code were about 22 faster than simulations with hydrus 2d 3d on the workstation tests of the modified parswms on two hpc clusters with 28 and 94 cores revealed a potential computational speedup of 94 relative to the hydrus 2d 3d simulations performed on the workstation keywords soilless culture water flow and solute transport numerical simulations high performance computing hydrus 2d 3d parswms 1 introduction because of the urgent need to secure and sustain the food and water supply for an ever growing human population especially in underdeveloped arid and semiarid regions of the world and an increasing demand for out of season fruits vegetables and ornamentals in the industrial world there is a momentous incentive to shift from soil based crop production to more resource efficient containerized soilless production systems raviv et al 2019 soilless substrates exhibit major advantages over soils besides the alleviated risk for spreading soilborne pathogens their physical and hydraulic properties i e plant water availability after irrigation and the aeration characteristics are superior to those of arable soils savvas 2003 savvas and gruda 2018 furthermore the nutrient availability to plant roots can be better controlled in soilless substrates which commonly leads to healthier plants and higher yields than in soil based production raviv et al 2019 it is even possible to tailor i e engineer substrates that exhibit specific physical and hydraulic properties beneficial for the growth of different crops though the same physical principles apply to both soilless substrates and soils their physical and hydraulic properties are vastly different in addition there are fundamental differences with regard to dynamic water air and nutrient distribution processes and root growth and development between spatially confined growth containers and unconfined field soils while an impermeable container bottom with drainage holes restricts water flow and nutrient transport in growth containers water drains and redistributes to much deeper layers in agricultural soils unless natural impediments exist this leads to vastly different infiltration and redistribution dynamics requiring more intensive management of soilless systems gohardoust et al 2020 taking into consideration that currently most of the soilless culture plant growth experiments are based on trial and error three dimensional 3d numerical flow and transport simulations can provide a scientifically sound basis for a priori elimination of substrates with unfavorable growth potential as well as guidance for growth module design and irrigation and fertigation management thereby preventing costly mistrials today numerical computer codes that solve the governing 3d water flow and solute transport equations are indispensable for advancing the understanding of complex porous media processes however intricate hydraulic properties and boundary conditions demand high resolution discretization of the spatial and temporal domains often leading to several million nodes requiring numerical evaluation šimůnek et al 2016 even the current computing prowess of workstations is not adequate to tackle such simulations within a reasonable timeframe especially when numerous realizations are desired to optimize the geometry soilless substrate properties and irrigation and fertigation management of plant growth modules hence parallelization of the numerical codes and utilization of high performance computing hpc clusters are vital hardelauf et al 2007 were among the first to develop a parallelized code for 3d simulation of water flow and solute transport that they termed parswms the code is based on the swms 3d model of šimůnek et al 1995 which numerically solves the richards equation for saturated unsaturated water flow and the convection dispersion equation cde for solute transport using a galerkin type linear finite element scheme the resulting nonlinear partial differential equation pde for water flow and the linear pde for the cde i e assuming linear adsorption isotherms are solved in swms 3d with preconditioned conjugate gradient and orthomin vinsome 1976 methods respectively in parswms hardelauf et al 2007 employed parmetis an open source mpi based library to distribute the simulation to multiple processing nodes and the portable extensive toolkit for scientific computation petsc library https www mcs anl gov petsc for preconditioning and solving the resulting system of linear equations driven by the need to execute a vast number of 3d flow and transport simulations to aid with the design and management of containerized plant growth modules we adopted parswms and modified the code to 1 permit the simultaneous application of time variable flux and free drainage boundary conditions bcs and allow for the time variable flux bc to be treated as an atmospheric bc and 2 enable multi solute transport simulations with nonlinear equilibrium adsorption these modifications are essential for the simulation of surface drip irrigation and to account for the nonlinear adsorption behavior of phosphorus and ammonium using hydrus 2d 3d version 3 02 0560 šimůnek et al 2018 as a reference we first meticulously verified the modified parswms code for a simple yet realistic soilless growth module setup thereafter we focused on computational efficiency and evaluated a vast number of preconditioner solver combinations for both water flow and solute transport based on a real growth module used in production scale greenhouse experiments subsequently we benchmarked the soilless substrate flow and transport simulation results against hydrus 2d 3d on a workstation with both windows and linux os installed as a final step we executed the modified parswms code on two hpc clusters to demonstrate the significant computational speedup relative to the hydrus 2d 3d simulations performed on the workstation please note that for brevity we refer to hydrus instead of hydrus 2d 3d in the following 2 modifications to parswms 2 1 boundary conditions in the parswms water flow simulation each node is assigned an integer code ranging from 6 to 6 while positive values are allocated to nodes with prescribed pressure heads zero and negative values represent nodes with prescribed volumetric water fluxes in the original parswms code hardelauf et al 2007 both time variable flux and free drainage boundary nodes are assigned 3 hence these bcs cannot be used simultaneously to resolve this issue the free drainage boundary condition code was set to 6 similar as in hydrus which was not allocated in the original parswms the discharge rate at a free drainage node n is determined as q n w i d t h n k h where w i d t h n is the surface area associated with node n and k h is the hydraulic conductivity as a function of the pressure head h to account for stage i i e potential evaporation rate controlled by atmospheric demand and stage ii i e falling evaporation rate limited by the ability of the substrate to transmit water to the surface evaporation it is necessary to treat the variable flux bc imposed for simulating surface drip irrigation as an atmospheric bc the atmospheric bc that is implemented in both hydrus and parswms is expressed as neuman et al 1974 1 k k i j a h x j k i z a n i e a n d h c r i t a h h c r i t s where k is the hydraulic conductivity k i j a are the components of the anisotropy tensor k a xi i 1 2 3 are the spatial coordinates ni are the components of the outward unit vector normal to the atmospheric boundary e is the maximum potential evaporation rate and hcrits and hcrita are two limiting values for the surface pressure head h the einstein summation convention is applied to eq 1 which implies summation over all possible values of the index in algebraic terms with repeated indices while the hcrits value specifies the maximum allowed pressure head at the soil surface usually 0 0 the hcrita value represents the minimum allowed surface pressure head defined based on equilibrium conditions between soil water and atmospheric vapor the modified parswms code now automatically switches between dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions for nodes with a variable flux bc if one of these limiting points is reached 2 2 multi solute transport with nonlinear equilibrium adsorption to allow realistic simulations of phosphorus and ammonium transport processes in containerized soilless substrates an option for nonlinear equilibrium solute adsorption was added to the modified parswms code the underlying cde in parswms is given as 2 θ c t ρ s t x i θ d ij c x j q i c x i μ w θ c μ s ρ s γ w θ γ s ρ s c where θ is the volumetric substrate water content l3 l 3 c is the solution concentration m l 3 s is the concentration adsorbed to the solid phase m m 1 ρ is the bulk density of the substrate m l 3 d ij is the dispersion coefficient tensor l2 t 1 q i is the i th component of the volumetric flux lt 1 μ w and μ s are first order rate constants for solutes in the liquid and solid phases t 1 respectively γ w and γ s are zero order rate constants for the liquid m l 3 t 1 and solid t 1 phases respectively s is the sink term in the water flow equation t 1 and c is the concentration of the sink term m l 3 with potential i and j values of 1 2 3 the equilibrium adsorption isotherm in its general form can be written as 3 s k s c β 1 η c β where k s l 3 β m β is the distribution coefficient and β and η l 3 β m β are coefficients of the nonlinear freundlich and langmuir adsorption isotherm models respectively for linear adsorption β 1 and η 0 with dimensions of l3 m 1 for nonlinear langmuir adsorption β 1 and for nonlinear freundlich adsorption η 0 substituting eq 3 into eq 2 yields a nonlinear differential equation that can be solved with nonlinear iterative schemes picard iteration was chosen for the nonlinear cde in the same fashion as for the richards equation note that numerical solvers and preconditioners specific for nonsymmetric matrices are required for the discretized cde see section 3 below to increase the computational efficiency simultaneous multi solute transport simulations i e phosphorus and ammonium were enabled in the modified parswms code again similar as in the current version of hydrus 3 hydraulic and chemical soilless substrate properties the selection of the three soilless substrates that were considered for the simulations was guided by production scale greenhouse tomato growth experiments at the volcani center in israel the substrates included perlite volcanic tuff and a 70 30 vol volcanic tuff coconut coir mixture horticultural perlite fig 1 a is a natural amorphous volcanic glass that is formed through the hydration of obsidian perlite is commonly heated to 1000 c which causes structural water to evaporate and the volume to expand to about 4 to 20 times of its original size when rehydrated bar tal et al 2019 the sieved perlite aggregates are light weight inert and pathogen free noland et al 1992 tuff fig 1b is a pyroclastic volcanic material with high porosity and surface area the mineral composition and weathering stage in conjunction with physical alterations i e grinding and sieving determine its physicochemical properties silber et al 1994 tuff possesses a high buffering capacity and may adsorb and release nutrients throughout the growing season especially phosphorus silber et al 1999 silber and raviv 1996 it exhibits bulk densities between 0 8 and 1 5 g cm 3 and a total porosity ranging from 60 to 80 coconut coir consists of short and medium length fibers of the mesocarp of cocos nucifera l that are left from various industrial applications it exhibits remarkable physical and chemical characteristics such as high water holding capacity good drainage and aeration properties and high cation exchange capacity evans et al 1996 abad et al 2005 it is commonly used as a surrogate for peat moss and mixed with mineral substrates such as tuff fig 1c the substrate water characteristics swc were measured with tempe cells soilmoisture equipment corp santa barbara ca connected to a pressure manifold with a high resolution pressure vacuum regulator and gauge initially saturated samples were sequentially desaturated via application of increasing pressures after each equilibration phase the saturated hydraulic conductivities k sat were measured with an automated constant head permeameter details about the swc and k sat measurements are provided in gohardoust et al 2020 after thoroughly testing several swc models comprising the van genuchten 1980 model a modified version of the van genuchten model vogel and cislerova 1988 vogel et al 2000 and the brooks and corey 1966 model we found that the latter was best suited for mitigation of numerical instability issues caused by the extreme nonlinearity of the hydraulic conductivity function near saturation for all considered soilless substrates fig 1 the brooks and corey bc swc model is given as 4 θ h θ r θ s θ r h b h λ h h b θ h θ s h h b 5 k h k sat h h b 2 3 λ where h is the pressure head h b is the air entry pressure i e pressure threshold related to the onset of drainage of the largest pore in the system a transition from fully to partially saturated conditions θ is the water content expressed as a function of h θ s is the saturated water content θ r is the residual water content λ is an empirical shape parameter and k is the hydraulic conductivity expressed as a function of h the parameters of the bc model were determined via least square fitting to the measured θ h data pairs fig 2 with swc parameters and k sat listed in table 1 the phosphorus and ammonium adsorption isotherms were measured with a combination of calorimetric spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry details are provided in gohardoust et al 2020 the derived isotherm parameters are listed in table 2 4 verification of the modified parswms code using hyrus version 3 02 0560 šimůnek et al 2018 as a reference we meticulously verified the modified parswms code using a simple domain representative of a containerized growth module fig 3 we note that hydrus has been extensively tested for specific flow or transport problems based on analytical solutions and measured data e g cook et al 2006 kandelous and šimůnek 2010 karlsson et al 2015 lassabatere et al 2014 luo and sophocleous 2010 neumann et al 2011 vanderborght et al 2005 and code to code validation is a scientifically accepted approach e g greenwald 2010 hardelauf et al 2007 kačur and minár 2013 orgogozo et al 2014 to mimic irrigation and fertigation with drip emitters water phosphorus ammonium and nitrate were applied to the surface within two circles with variable flux bcs when no water or solutes were applied the variable flux bc was treated as an atmospheric bc to conform with the remaining evaporating substrate surface the 70 30 vol tuff coconut coir mixture see table 1 for hydraulic parameters which was dry i e 5000 cm pressure head at the start of the simulation was used for validation while nonlinear langmuir adsorption was considered for ammonium nh 4 and phosphorus h 2 p o 4 see adsorption isotherm parameters in table 2 nitrate no 3 did not interact i e adsorb with the solid phase the applied concentrations for h 2 p o 4 nh 4 and no 3 were 20 mg l 1 20 mg l 1 and 80 mg l 1 respectively water was applied every 8 h at a rate of 1 0 l h 1 for 4 min with one fourth allowed to evaporate the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities were assumed to be 2 0 and 0 2 cm respectively the diffusion coefficients for h 2 p o 4 nh 4 and no 3 in water were assumed as 0 032 0 063 and 0 068 cm2 h 1 respectively similar values have been reported in buffle et al 2007 and hashitani and tanaka 1983 the water content tolerance was set to 2 10 5 cm3 cm 3 and the absolute and relative concentration tolerances were set to 10 6 mmol cm 3 and 10 3 respectively the flow and transport domains were discretized with finite elements of 1 4 cm in the horizontal direction and 0 7 cm in the vertical direction mesh refinements for the top 1 cm layer i e using half of the finite element size led to a total of 25 264 spatial nodes the temporal discretization was dynamically calculated throughout the simulation based on the specified initial time step of 2 4e 7 hr the total simulation time was ten days input files for the modified parswms code were generated with the export to parswms function in hydrus to extract and analyze parswms simulation results dedicated matlab version r2019b mathworks natick ma usa scripts were created the simulations were performed on a workstation with two 2 40 ghz intel xeon e5 2630 v3 processors the hard drive was partitioned with windows 10 pro version 1909 os build 18363 1016 as well as ubuntu 18 04 5 lts installed to run the hydrus and modified parswms codes respectively the modified parswms and hydrus water flow and solute transport simulation results were compared at the end of the simulations based on the normalized root mean squared error nrmse given as 6 nrmse 1 n i 1 n c p a r swms i c hydrus i c hydrus max c hydrus min where c is the specific output quantity to be compared and n is the number of spatial nodes the comparison of the modified parswms and hydrus volumetric water content θ and h 2 p o 4 nh 4 and no 3 concentration simulation results after 10 days are depicted in fig 4 the coefficients of determination for θ and h 2 p o 4 nh 4 and no 3 concentrations exceeded 0 999 with associated nrmses of less than 1 which indicates excellent agreement between hydrus and the modified parswms code this is further solidified by the very low mass balance errors of less than 0 3 for water and less than 2 5 for the solutes table 3 notably the mass balance errors of the modified parswms code are smaller than the errors of hydrus 5 evaluation of preconditioners and solvers to simulate water flow and solute transport separate sets of linear equations need to be solved to assure computational efficiency it is imperative to apply the optimal preconditioner solver combinations which differ for flow and transport the discretization of the associated partial differential equations via finite element or finite difference methods yields linear systems of the form 7 ax b with a r n n is the coefficient matrix b r n is the right hand side vector and x is the vector of unknowns depending on the extent of the problem direct or iterative solvers may be employed to solve eq 7 to enhance the numerical robustness and stability of ill posed problems with very high condition numbers sparse direct solvers are preferred despite their high memory usage and extended computation times especially for large three dimensional problems kwack et al 2016 duff and scott 2004 benzi 2002 on the other hand sparse iterative solvers such as preconditioned krylov subspace solvers can most efficiently handle massive linear equation systems dongarra and sullivan 2000 to resolve eq 7 iteratively the solution is approximated via constructing a sequence of x n starting with an initial guess x 0 by moving in an affine subspace x 0 k r n in order to create suitable subspaces k methods containing efficient operations such as matrix vector products e g krylov subspaces are of great value del corso et al 2015 assuming the residual of the n th iteration r n b a x n krylov subspace projection methods can be separated into three main categories golub and van der vorst 1997 1 ritz galerkin methods in which x n is constructed such that the residual is orthogonal to the current subspace examples are conjugate gradients cg the full orthogonalization method fom saad 1981 and generalized conjugate gradients gencg eisenstat et al 1983 2 minimum residual methods in which x n minimizes the second norm of the residual over k n the generalized minimal residual gmres saad and schultz 1986 the minimum residual minres orthomin vinsome 1976 and orthodir young and jea 1980 methods fall within this category and 3 petrov galerkin methods in which x n is determined so that the residual is orthogonal to some other n dimensional subspace the biconjugate gradient bi cg fletcher 1975 and quasi minimal residual qmr methods freund and nachtigal 1991 are part of this category in addition there are hybrids of the above categories such as the conjugate gradient squared cgs sonneveld 1989 biconjugate gradient stabilized bi cgstab van der vorst 1992 transpose free quasi minimal residual tfqmr freund 1993 and flexible generalized minimal residual fgmres saad 1993 methods in brief preconditioning is applied to convert a given problem into a form that is more amenable for numerical solution herbst et al 2008 this means that eq 7 is transformed to the form 8 m 1 1 a m 2 1 y m 1 1 b y m 2 x where m 1 and m 2 are nonsingular matrices with inverses that can be rapidly and accurately solved this leads to faster convergence and requires much less memory simoncini and szyld 2007 to find optimal preconditioner solver combinations with regard to both robustness and computational efficiency we consider a realistic flow and transport simulation applicable for soilless culture growth modules note that the optimal preconditioner solver combinations differ for water flow and solute transport simulations as they exhibit symmetric and asymmetric coefficient matrices respectively hence they are evaluated separately 5 1 preconditioners and solvers for water flow computational efficiency is essential when simulating flow and transport processes in complex porous systems where intricate hydraulic properties and boundary conditions demand high resolution discretization of the spatial and temporal domains often leading to several million nodes requiring numerical evaluation this holds true for soilless plant growth modules especially when numerous realizations are desired to optimize container geometry soilless substrate properties and irrigation and fertigation management to evaluate potential preconditioner solver combinations for water flow we considered a typical growth module for greenhouse tomato production at the agricultural research organization aro volcani center in israel fig 5 a where water and nutrients are applied via surface drip emitters and the solution drains through circular openings in the bottom of the concrete containers fig 5b the 70 30 vol tuff coconut coir mixture with its hydraulic properties listed in table 1 was used as the substrate for the test case the applied water flow and solute transport bcs are consistent with the flow domain depicted in fig 3 for water flow this means an atmospheric bc at the top with ten circular inclusions with variable flux bcs to mimic surface drip irrigation i e two angle arrow drippers per tomato plant and seven openings at the bottom to allow for free drainage for root water uptake a simple root distribution model vrugt et al 2001a 2001b was considered for each of the five tomato plants šimůnek et al 2018 while uptake conforms with the feddes et al 1978 water stress response function the potential uptake rate was constrained at 13 of the evapotranspiration rate nutrients were applied together with irrigation water see section 4 for concentrations drip irrigation occurred every two hours for 2 75 min at a rate of 1 0 l per hour per angle arrow dripper i e a total of 5 5 l were applied per day to consider heterogeneity independent scaling factors for the pressure head and hydraulic conductivity function were introduced the scaling factors were generated via sequential gaussian simulation with the visim program hansen and mosegaard 2008 in the open source mgstat matlab toolbox hansen 2020 with a variance of 0 05 a mean value of 1 0 and correlation lengths of 4 and 2 cm in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively the spatial distribution of the hydraulic conductivity scaling factors within the flow domain is depicted in fig 6 the flow domain was discretized with finite elements of 1 0 cm in the horizontal direction and 0 5 cm in the vertical direction mesh refinements for the top 1 cm layer and in areas with variable flux and free drainage bcs led to a total of 408 848 nodes and 2 315 763 3d mesh elements to solve eq 7 with its symmetric sparse coefficient matrix for water flow a total of 15 preconditioners and 13 solvers were considered table 4 all preconditioners and solvers but two were extracted from the portable extensible toolkit for scientific computation petsc library https www mcs anl gov petsc two preconditioners were incorporated from the high performance preconditioners hypre library http www llnl gov casc hypre via the petsc interface the sparsity pattern of the coefficient matrix associated with the water flow simulation is depicted in fig 7 because of the large number of considered preconditioner solver combinations the total time for each simulation was limited to 10 h the simulations were performed on the university of arizona puma hpc cluster with system specifications provided in table s1 the number of cores nc utilized were 12 24 48 and 94 respectively to compare the computational efficiency of various preconditioner solver combinations the wall clock time which includes preconditioner setup and application time as well as the time for solver application was used as a metric fig 8 depicts the ten fastest preconditioner solver combinations together with the ideal speedup line that is defined as the ratio of utilized cores and the number of cores used for the base case i e 12 9 t p p base p t base where t p is the simulation time when p processors are utilized and p base and t base are the number of processors used for the base case and the associated simulation time respectively the inset in fig 8 shows all successful combinations as apparent the choice of the preconditioner solver combination significantly impacts computational efficiency as the determined wall clock times vary by more than one order of magnitude note that some of the simulations with the gamg preconditioner did not converge when 94 cores were utilized the reported wall clock times represent the median of 5 separate simulation runs the simulation speedup follows the ideal speedup line up to 48 cores beyond which the performance starts to degrade this is attributable to the increase of the communication to computation ratio hammond et al 2014 for the executed simulations the average number of nodes for each core was about 8500 and 4400 when utilizing 48 and 94 cores respectively this suggests that for optimal scalability the minimum number of nodes per processor should fall within this range because the order of the most efficient combinations is dependent on the number of cores nc the wall clock times were normalized by the smallest value for each nc group i e 12 24 48 and 94 and then averaged the five fastest combinations and their associated normalized times are listed in table 5 although the dgmres solver applied in conjunction with the bjacobi preconditioner performed better than other widely used solvers such as cg the differences are minor between the five computationally most efficient combinations table 5 this leads to the conclusion that bjacobi which performs the incomplete lower upper factorization in each block with zero level fill is the preconditioner of choice for our water flow simulations this finding in general concurs with herbst et al 2008 who investigated the performance of five preconditioners in combination with the cg solver for simulation of one and three dimensional water flow i e richards equation in porous media in contrast to their results the algebraic multigrid preconditioner boomeramg did not work well for our simulations which is most likely because of the more complex water distributions within our flow domain due to the implementation of surface drip irrigation root water uptake and free drainage from the bottom boundary 5 2 preconditioners and solvers for solute transport the test case for solute transport is identical to the test case in section 5 1 with regard to water flow in addition h 2 p o 4 nh 4 and no 3 were applied with the irrigation water at concentrations of 20 mg l 1 20 mg l 1 and 80 mg l 1 respectively while nonlinear langmuir adsorption was considered for ammonium nh 4 and phosphorus h 2 p o 4 nitrate no 3 did not interact with the solid phase fifteen preconditioners and 12 solvers were evaluated table 6 the ten computationally most efficient preconditioner solver combinations for solute transport are depicted in fig 9 together with the ideal speedup line the inset shows all successful combinations which vary over two orders of magnitude as for water flow the simulation speedup follows the ideal speedup line up to 48 cores and then the performance starts degrading combinations with the gamg preconditioner were the least efficient although the boomeramg preconditioner performed better for solute transport it is not among the top ranked these results differ from sbai and larabi 2021 who simulated field scale chemical transport in groundwater the deviations can be attributed to the consideration of adsorbing solutes in our simulations as well as the generally better performance of the algebraic multigrid preconditioner for large transport domains sbai and larabi 2020 the most efficient combinations consisted of preconditioners of the successive over relaxation category i e sor and eisenstat and variations of the gmres solver it should be noted that the parallel sor and eisenstat preconditioners are equivalent to bjacobi with sor on each block and are therefore not true parallel preconditioners as evident from fig 9 and table 7 the sor fgmres combination is best suited for our application 6 computational efficiency and stability of hydrus and the modified parswms as already indicated in section 5 computational efficiency and stability are essential when simulating flow and transport processes in soilless plant growth modules especially when a vast number of realizations is required hence it is of interest to compare the windows os based hydrus with the linux os based modified parswms because workstations and hpc clusters are not intercomparable such comparison is only viable on a workstation with both windows i e windows 10 pro version 1909 os build 18363 1016 and linux i e ubuntu 18 04 5 lts installed on a partitioned hard drive a workstation with two 2 40 ghz intel xeon e5 2630 v3 dual 8 core processors and 32 gb ram was used for the comparison hydrus benefits from a powerful gui with numerous advanced features such as the ability to create or import complex domain geometries or to specify various spatially variable properties such as materials initial conditions boundary conditions and domain properties either directly on the finite element mesh or on geometric objects independent of the mesh šimůnek et al 2016 to utilize parallel computing and the computing prowess of the latest multicore workstations hydrus relies on the hydrus parallelized hypar module and the microsoft parallel patterns library to numerically solve eq 7 for water flow and solute transport with the cg and orthomin solvers respectively equation 7 is preconditioned with the incomplete lower upper factorization method both the solvers and the preconditioner are from the orthofem library mendoza et al 1991 the test case for the stability and efficiency comparison conforms with the descriptions in sections 5 1 and 5 2 except that the swc and hydraulic conductivity functions were not scaled for the considered tuff tuff coconut coir and perlite substrates see hydraulic properties in table 1 the simulation duration was 14 days 336 hrs the flow domain was discretized with finite elements of 1 90 cm in the horizontal direction and 0 95 cm in the vertical direction mesh refinements for the top 1 cm layer and in areas with variable flux and free drainage bcs led to a total of 132 570 nodes and 726 264 3d mesh elements note that the hydraulic characteristics are calculated directly from the hydraulic functions by setting the lower and upper limits of the internal interpolation tables to zero in both hydrus and the modified parswms code the bjacobi dgmres and sor fgmres preconditioner solver combinations were used for parswms water flow and solute transport simulations respectively fig 10 shows the temporal evolution of mass balance errors for water flow and h 2 p o 4 nh 4 and no 3 transport the water mass balance errors are below 0 15 for all substrates for both the hydrus and parswms simulations which we consider quite accurate the mass balance errors for solute transport are higher for both hydrus and the modified parswms an extreme error of about 80 for no 3 is evident for the hydrus simulation for tuff which can be attributed to simulation instability issues starting at around 48 hrs this is likely due to very localized increases in no 3 concentrations at the atmospheric bc because of evaporation fig 11 bottom right in comparison the maximum mass balance error for no 3 and tuff simulated with the modified parswms is 0 54 note that the instability issues experienced with hydrus can be potentially resolved by increasing the density of the 3d mesh close to the surface at the cost of computational efficiency notably the parswms solute mass balance errors are significantly lower than the hydrus errors fig 12 shows a comparison of computational efficiencies of the hydrus and modified parswms codes besides the simulations performed on the workstation we ran parswms on the ocelote hpc 28 cores and the recently installed puma hpc 94 cores clusters for specifications see table s1 to demonstrate the massive increase in scalability when hpc environments are utilized the simulation speedup expressed in terms of normalized wall clock times see values on top of the bars in fig 12 of the modified parswms code is about 22 faster than that of hydrus on the workstation and about 94 faster on the puma hpc cluster with 94 cores note that while an increase in the number of processing cores generally speeds up the simulations beyond a certain core threshold the computational efficiency starts to decline due to an increase of the communication to computation ratio 7 conclusions with the goal of performing a vast number of flow and transport simulations on hpc clusters to aid the design and management of soilless culture growth modules we modified the open source 3d parswms code to not only enable nonlinear equilibrium solute adsorption and multi solute transport simulations but also the application of boundary conditions to realistically represent typical soilless culture systems the modified parswms code was thoroughly tested using hydrus as a reference to optimize the computational efficiency of the modified parswms numerous preconditioner numerical solver combinations were tested for both the water flow and solute transport equations while the bjacobi dgmres preconditioner solver combination was the most efficient for water flow sor fgmres worked best for solute transport in general gmres type and cg solvers applied in conjunction with the bjacobi preconditioner were very efficient for water flow simulations the most efficient combinations for solute transport consisted of preconditioners of the successive over relaxation category i e sor and eisenstat and variations of the gmres solver to compare the stability and computational efficiency of modified parswms with hydrus a real growth module from a production scale greenhouse experiment at the aro volcani center in israel was simulated considering three soilless substrates and h 2 p o 4 nh 4 and no 3 transport the simulations were performed on a workstation and two hpc clusters the results revealed that the modified parswms was about 22 more efficient than hydruswhen the simulations on the workstation were compared simulations on the hpc clusters were up to 94 more efficient when 94 cores were utilized if the full computational power of the hpc clusters i e no competing projects and up to 23 616 available cores was to be utilized simulation times would again be drastically reduced to a very small fraction of the hydrus wall clock time while we experienced some stability issues for tuff and no 3 with hydrus leading to an unrealistically high mass balance error all modified parswms simulations were stable on both the workstation and hpc clusters in general all water and solute mass balance errors generated with the modified parswms where bellow the mass balance errors of hydrus the availability of the modified and tested parswms code opens new avenues for streamlining 3d water flow and solute transport simulations for complex porous media via the utilization of hpc environments simulations that took days to complete can now be resolved within a matter of a few hours allowing for a vast number of realizations within a short period of time 8 availability of software all computer codes and matlab scripts created for this project are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request

4668,numerical simulation of three dimensional water flow and solute transport in containerized variably saturated soilless substrates with complex hydraulic properties and boundary conditions necessitates high resolution discretization of the spatial and temporal domains which commonly leads to several million nodes requiring numerical evaluation even today s computing prowess of workstations is not adequate to tackle such problems within a reasonable timeframe especially when numerous realizations are required to optimize the geometry substrate properties and irrigation and fertigation management of soilless plant growth modules hence the parallelization of the numerical code and utilization of high performance computing hpc are essential here we adapted and applied the parswms parallelized code that is amenable to solving the 3d richards equation for water flow and the convection dispersion equation for solute transport subject to linear solute adsorption the code was modified to allow for nonlinear equilibrium solute adsorption with new boundary conditions and applied to simulate water flow and nitrogen and phosphorus transport in containerized soilless substrates multi solute transport simulations with the modified linux parswms code were first performed on a workstation and referenced to the windows based hydrus 2d 3d numerical code after confirming the agreement between the modified parswms code and hydrus 2d 3d various preconditioners and iterative solvers were evaluated to find the computationally most efficient combinations the performance of the modified parswms code and its stability were compared to hydrus 2d 3d simulations for three soilless substrates consisting of horticultural perlite volcanic tuff and a volcanic tuff coconut coir mixture considering the solute mass balance error as a stability measure parswms outperformed hydrus 2d 3d moreover simulations with the modified parswms code were about 22 faster than simulations with hydrus 2d 3d on the workstation tests of the modified parswms on two hpc clusters with 28 and 94 cores revealed a potential computational speedup of 94 relative to the hydrus 2d 3d simulations performed on the workstation keywords soilless culture water flow and solute transport numerical simulations high performance computing hydrus 2d 3d parswms 1 introduction because of the urgent need to secure and sustain the food and water supply for an ever growing human population especially in underdeveloped arid and semiarid regions of the world and an increasing demand for out of season fruits vegetables and ornamentals in the industrial world there is a momentous incentive to shift from soil based crop production to more resource efficient containerized soilless production systems raviv et al 2019 soilless substrates exhibit major advantages over soils besides the alleviated risk for spreading soilborne pathogens their physical and hydraulic properties i e plant water availability after irrigation and the aeration characteristics are superior to those of arable soils savvas 2003 savvas and gruda 2018 furthermore the nutrient availability to plant roots can be better controlled in soilless substrates which commonly leads to healthier plants and higher yields than in soil based production raviv et al 2019 it is even possible to tailor i e engineer substrates that exhibit specific physical and hydraulic properties beneficial for the growth of different crops though the same physical principles apply to both soilless substrates and soils their physical and hydraulic properties are vastly different in addition there are fundamental differences with regard to dynamic water air and nutrient distribution processes and root growth and development between spatially confined growth containers and unconfined field soils while an impermeable container bottom with drainage holes restricts water flow and nutrient transport in growth containers water drains and redistributes to much deeper layers in agricultural soils unless natural impediments exist this leads to vastly different infiltration and redistribution dynamics requiring more intensive management of soilless systems gohardoust et al 2020 taking into consideration that currently most of the soilless culture plant growth experiments are based on trial and error three dimensional 3d numerical flow and transport simulations can provide a scientifically sound basis for a priori elimination of substrates with unfavorable growth potential as well as guidance for growth module design and irrigation and fertigation management thereby preventing costly mistrials today numerical computer codes that solve the governing 3d water flow and solute transport equations are indispensable for advancing the understanding of complex porous media processes however intricate hydraulic properties and boundary conditions demand high resolution discretization of the spatial and temporal domains often leading to several million nodes requiring numerical evaluation šimůnek et al 2016 even the current computing prowess of workstations is not adequate to tackle such simulations within a reasonable timeframe especially when numerous realizations are desired to optimize the geometry soilless substrate properties and irrigation and fertigation management of plant growth modules hence parallelization of the numerical codes and utilization of high performance computing hpc clusters are vital hardelauf et al 2007 were among the first to develop a parallelized code for 3d simulation of water flow and solute transport that they termed parswms the code is based on the swms 3d model of šimůnek et al 1995 which numerically solves the richards equation for saturated unsaturated water flow and the convection dispersion equation cde for solute transport using a galerkin type linear finite element scheme the resulting nonlinear partial differential equation pde for water flow and the linear pde for the cde i e assuming linear adsorption isotherms are solved in swms 3d with preconditioned conjugate gradient and orthomin vinsome 1976 methods respectively in parswms hardelauf et al 2007 employed parmetis an open source mpi based library to distribute the simulation to multiple processing nodes and the portable extensive toolkit for scientific computation petsc library https www mcs anl gov petsc for preconditioning and solving the resulting system of linear equations driven by the need to execute a vast number of 3d flow and transport simulations to aid with the design and management of containerized plant growth modules we adopted parswms and modified the code to 1 permit the simultaneous application of time variable flux and free drainage boundary conditions bcs and allow for the time variable flux bc to be treated as an atmospheric bc and 2 enable multi solute transport simulations with nonlinear equilibrium adsorption these modifications are essential for the simulation of surface drip irrigation and to account for the nonlinear adsorption behavior of phosphorus and ammonium using hydrus 2d 3d version 3 02 0560 šimůnek et al 2018 as a reference we first meticulously verified the modified parswms code for a simple yet realistic soilless growth module setup thereafter we focused on computational efficiency and evaluated a vast number of preconditioner solver combinations for both water flow and solute transport based on a real growth module used in production scale greenhouse experiments subsequently we benchmarked the soilless substrate flow and transport simulation results against hydrus 2d 3d on a workstation with both windows and linux os installed as a final step we executed the modified parswms code on two hpc clusters to demonstrate the significant computational speedup relative to the hydrus 2d 3d simulations performed on the workstation please note that for brevity we refer to hydrus instead of hydrus 2d 3d in the following 2 modifications to parswms 2 1 boundary conditions in the parswms water flow simulation each node is assigned an integer code ranging from 6 to 6 while positive values are allocated to nodes with prescribed pressure heads zero and negative values represent nodes with prescribed volumetric water fluxes in the original parswms code hardelauf et al 2007 both time variable flux and free drainage boundary nodes are assigned 3 hence these bcs cannot be used simultaneously to resolve this issue the free drainage boundary condition code was set to 6 similar as in hydrus which was not allocated in the original parswms the discharge rate at a free drainage node n is determined as q n w i d t h n k h where w i d t h n is the surface area associated with node n and k h is the hydraulic conductivity as a function of the pressure head h to account for stage i i e potential evaporation rate controlled by atmospheric demand and stage ii i e falling evaporation rate limited by the ability of the substrate to transmit water to the surface evaporation it is necessary to treat the variable flux bc imposed for simulating surface drip irrigation as an atmospheric bc the atmospheric bc that is implemented in both hydrus and parswms is expressed as neuman et al 1974 1 k k i j a h x j k i z a n i e a n d h c r i t a h h c r i t s where k is the hydraulic conductivity k i j a are the components of the anisotropy tensor k a xi i 1 2 3 are the spatial coordinates ni are the components of the outward unit vector normal to the atmospheric boundary e is the maximum potential evaporation rate and hcrits and hcrita are two limiting values for the surface pressure head h the einstein summation convention is applied to eq 1 which implies summation over all possible values of the index in algebraic terms with repeated indices while the hcrits value specifies the maximum allowed pressure head at the soil surface usually 0 0 the hcrita value represents the minimum allowed surface pressure head defined based on equilibrium conditions between soil water and atmospheric vapor the modified parswms code now automatically switches between dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions for nodes with a variable flux bc if one of these limiting points is reached 2 2 multi solute transport with nonlinear equilibrium adsorption to allow realistic simulations of phosphorus and ammonium transport processes in containerized soilless substrates an option for nonlinear equilibrium solute adsorption was added to the modified parswms code the underlying cde in parswms is given as 2 θ c t ρ s t x i θ d ij c x j q i c x i μ w θ c μ s ρ s γ w θ γ s ρ s c where θ is the volumetric substrate water content l3 l 3 c is the solution concentration m l 3 s is the concentration adsorbed to the solid phase m m 1 ρ is the bulk density of the substrate m l 3 d ij is the dispersion coefficient tensor l2 t 1 q i is the i th component of the volumetric flux lt 1 μ w and μ s are first order rate constants for solutes in the liquid and solid phases t 1 respectively γ w and γ s are zero order rate constants for the liquid m l 3 t 1 and solid t 1 phases respectively s is the sink term in the water flow equation t 1 and c is the concentration of the sink term m l 3 with potential i and j values of 1 2 3 the equilibrium adsorption isotherm in its general form can be written as 3 s k s c β 1 η c β where k s l 3 β m β is the distribution coefficient and β and η l 3 β m β are coefficients of the nonlinear freundlich and langmuir adsorption isotherm models respectively for linear adsorption β 1 and η 0 with dimensions of l3 m 1 for nonlinear langmuir adsorption β 1 and for nonlinear freundlich adsorption η 0 substituting eq 3 into eq 2 yields a nonlinear differential equation that can be solved with nonlinear iterative schemes picard iteration was chosen for the nonlinear cde in the same fashion as for the richards equation note that numerical solvers and preconditioners specific for nonsymmetric matrices are required for the discretized cde see section 3 below to increase the computational efficiency simultaneous multi solute transport simulations i e phosphorus and ammonium were enabled in the modified parswms code again similar as in the current version of hydrus 3 hydraulic and chemical soilless substrate properties the selection of the three soilless substrates that were considered for the simulations was guided by production scale greenhouse tomato growth experiments at the volcani center in israel the substrates included perlite volcanic tuff and a 70 30 vol volcanic tuff coconut coir mixture horticultural perlite fig 1 a is a natural amorphous volcanic glass that is formed through the hydration of obsidian perlite is commonly heated to 1000 c which causes structural water to evaporate and the volume to expand to about 4 to 20 times of its original size when rehydrated bar tal et al 2019 the sieved perlite aggregates are light weight inert and pathogen free noland et al 1992 tuff fig 1b is a pyroclastic volcanic material with high porosity and surface area the mineral composition and weathering stage in conjunction with physical alterations i e grinding and sieving determine its physicochemical properties silber et al 1994 tuff possesses a high buffering capacity and may adsorb and release nutrients throughout the growing season especially phosphorus silber et al 1999 silber and raviv 1996 it exhibits bulk densities between 0 8 and 1 5 g cm 3 and a total porosity ranging from 60 to 80 coconut coir consists of short and medium length fibers of the mesocarp of cocos nucifera l that are left from various industrial applications it exhibits remarkable physical and chemical characteristics such as high water holding capacity good drainage and aeration properties and high cation exchange capacity evans et al 1996 abad et al 2005 it is commonly used as a surrogate for peat moss and mixed with mineral substrates such as tuff fig 1c the substrate water characteristics swc were measured with tempe cells soilmoisture equipment corp santa barbara ca connected to a pressure manifold with a high resolution pressure vacuum regulator and gauge initially saturated samples were sequentially desaturated via application of increasing pressures after each equilibration phase the saturated hydraulic conductivities k sat were measured with an automated constant head permeameter details about the swc and k sat measurements are provided in gohardoust et al 2020 after thoroughly testing several swc models comprising the van genuchten 1980 model a modified version of the van genuchten model vogel and cislerova 1988 vogel et al 2000 and the brooks and corey 1966 model we found that the latter was best suited for mitigation of numerical instability issues caused by the extreme nonlinearity of the hydraulic conductivity function near saturation for all considered soilless substrates fig 1 the brooks and corey bc swc model is given as 4 θ h θ r θ s θ r h b h λ h h b θ h θ s h h b 5 k h k sat h h b 2 3 λ where h is the pressure head h b is the air entry pressure i e pressure threshold related to the onset of drainage of the largest pore in the system a transition from fully to partially saturated conditions θ is the water content expressed as a function of h θ s is the saturated water content θ r is the residual water content λ is an empirical shape parameter and k is the hydraulic conductivity expressed as a function of h the parameters of the bc model were determined via least square fitting to the measured θ h data pairs fig 2 with swc parameters and k sat listed in table 1 the phosphorus and ammonium adsorption isotherms were measured with a combination of calorimetric spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry details are provided in gohardoust et al 2020 the derived isotherm parameters are listed in table 2 4 verification of the modified parswms code using hyrus version 3 02 0560 šimůnek et al 2018 as a reference we meticulously verified the modified parswms code using a simple domain representative of a containerized growth module fig 3 we note that hydrus has been extensively tested for specific flow or transport problems based on analytical solutions and measured data e g cook et al 2006 kandelous and šimůnek 2010 karlsson et al 2015 lassabatere et al 2014 luo and sophocleous 2010 neumann et al 2011 vanderborght et al 2005 and code to code validation is a scientifically accepted approach e g greenwald 2010 hardelauf et al 2007 kačur and minár 2013 orgogozo et al 2014 to mimic irrigation and fertigation with drip emitters water phosphorus ammonium and nitrate were applied to the surface within two circles with variable flux bcs when no water or solutes were applied the variable flux bc was treated as an atmospheric bc to conform with the remaining evaporating substrate surface the 70 30 vol tuff coconut coir mixture see table 1 for hydraulic parameters which was dry i e 5000 cm pressure head at the start of the simulation was used for validation while nonlinear langmuir adsorption was considered for ammonium nh 4 and phosphorus h 2 p o 4 see adsorption isotherm parameters in table 2 nitrate no 3 did not interact i e adsorb with the solid phase the applied concentrations for h 2 p o 4 nh 4 and no 3 were 20 mg l 1 20 mg l 1 and 80 mg l 1 respectively water was applied every 8 h at a rate of 1 0 l h 1 for 4 min with one fourth allowed to evaporate the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities were assumed to be 2 0 and 0 2 cm respectively the diffusion coefficients for h 2 p o 4 nh 4 and no 3 in water were assumed as 0 032 0 063 and 0 068 cm2 h 1 respectively similar values have been reported in buffle et al 2007 and hashitani and tanaka 1983 the water content tolerance was set to 2 10 5 cm3 cm 3 and the absolute and relative concentration tolerances were set to 10 6 mmol cm 3 and 10 3 respectively the flow and transport domains were discretized with finite elements of 1 4 cm in the horizontal direction and 0 7 cm in the vertical direction mesh refinements for the top 1 cm layer i e using half of the finite element size led to a total of 25 264 spatial nodes the temporal discretization was dynamically calculated throughout the simulation based on the specified initial time step of 2 4e 7 hr the total simulation time was ten days input files for the modified parswms code were generated with the export to parswms function in hydrus to extract and analyze parswms simulation results dedicated matlab version r2019b mathworks natick ma usa scripts were created the simulations were performed on a workstation with two 2 40 ghz intel xeon e5 2630 v3 processors the hard drive was partitioned with windows 10 pro version 1909 os build 18363 1016 as well as ubuntu 18 04 5 lts installed to run the hydrus and modified parswms codes respectively the modified parswms and hydrus water flow and solute transport simulation results were compared at the end of the simulations based on the normalized root mean squared error nrmse given as 6 nrmse 1 n i 1 n c p a r swms i c hydrus i c hydrus max c hydrus min where c is the specific output quantity to be compared and n is the number of spatial nodes the comparison of the modified parswms and hydrus volumetric water content θ and h 2 p o 4 nh 4 and no 3 concentration simulation results after 10 days are depicted in fig 4 the coefficients of determination for θ and h 2 p o 4 nh 4 and no 3 concentrations exceeded 0 999 with associated nrmses of less than 1 which indicates excellent agreement between hydrus and the modified parswms code this is further solidified by the very low mass balance errors of less than 0 3 for water and less than 2 5 for the solutes table 3 notably the mass balance errors of the modified parswms code are smaller than the errors of hydrus 5 evaluation of preconditioners and solvers to simulate water flow and solute transport separate sets of linear equations need to be solved to assure computational efficiency it is imperative to apply the optimal preconditioner solver combinations which differ for flow and transport the discretization of the associated partial differential equations via finite element or finite difference methods yields linear systems of the form 7 ax b with a r n n is the coefficient matrix b r n is the right hand side vector and x is the vector of unknowns depending on the extent of the problem direct or iterative solvers may be employed to solve eq 7 to enhance the numerical robustness and stability of ill posed problems with very high condition numbers sparse direct solvers are preferred despite their high memory usage and extended computation times especially for large three dimensional problems kwack et al 2016 duff and scott 2004 benzi 2002 on the other hand sparse iterative solvers such as preconditioned krylov subspace solvers can most efficiently handle massive linear equation systems dongarra and sullivan 2000 to resolve eq 7 iteratively the solution is approximated via constructing a sequence of x n starting with an initial guess x 0 by moving in an affine subspace x 0 k r n in order to create suitable subspaces k methods containing efficient operations such as matrix vector products e g krylov subspaces are of great value del corso et al 2015 assuming the residual of the n th iteration r n b a x n krylov subspace projection methods can be separated into three main categories golub and van der vorst 1997 1 ritz galerkin methods in which x n is constructed such that the residual is orthogonal to the current subspace examples are conjugate gradients cg the full orthogonalization method fom saad 1981 and generalized conjugate gradients gencg eisenstat et al 1983 2 minimum residual methods in which x n minimizes the second norm of the residual over k n the generalized minimal residual gmres saad and schultz 1986 the minimum residual minres orthomin vinsome 1976 and orthodir young and jea 1980 methods fall within this category and 3 petrov galerkin methods in which x n is determined so that the residual is orthogonal to some other n dimensional subspace the biconjugate gradient bi cg fletcher 1975 and quasi minimal residual qmr methods freund and nachtigal 1991 are part of this category in addition there are hybrids of the above categories such as the conjugate gradient squared cgs sonneveld 1989 biconjugate gradient stabilized bi cgstab van der vorst 1992 transpose free quasi minimal residual tfqmr freund 1993 and flexible generalized minimal residual fgmres saad 1993 methods in brief preconditioning is applied to convert a given problem into a form that is more amenable for numerical solution herbst et al 2008 this means that eq 7 is transformed to the form 8 m 1 1 a m 2 1 y m 1 1 b y m 2 x where m 1 and m 2 are nonsingular matrices with inverses that can be rapidly and accurately solved this leads to faster convergence and requires much less memory simoncini and szyld 2007 to find optimal preconditioner solver combinations with regard to both robustness and computational efficiency we consider a realistic flow and transport simulation applicable for soilless culture growth modules note that the optimal preconditioner solver combinations differ for water flow and solute transport simulations as they exhibit symmetric and asymmetric coefficient matrices respectively hence they are evaluated separately 5 1 preconditioners and solvers for water flow computational efficiency is essential when simulating flow and transport processes in complex porous systems where intricate hydraulic properties and boundary conditions demand high resolution discretization of the spatial and temporal domains often leading to several million nodes requiring numerical evaluation this holds true for soilless plant growth modules especially when numerous realizations are desired to optimize container geometry soilless substrate properties and irrigation and fertigation management to evaluate potential preconditioner solver combinations for water flow we considered a typical growth module for greenhouse tomato production at the agricultural research organization aro volcani center in israel fig 5 a where water and nutrients are applied via surface drip emitters and the solution drains through circular openings in the bottom of the concrete containers fig 5b the 70 30 vol tuff coconut coir mixture with its hydraulic properties listed in table 1 was used as the substrate for the test case the applied water flow and solute transport bcs are consistent with the flow domain depicted in fig 3 for water flow this means an atmospheric bc at the top with ten circular inclusions with variable flux bcs to mimic surface drip irrigation i e two angle arrow drippers per tomato plant and seven openings at the bottom to allow for free drainage for root water uptake a simple root distribution model vrugt et al 2001a 2001b was considered for each of the five tomato plants šimůnek et al 2018 while uptake conforms with the feddes et al 1978 water stress response function the potential uptake rate was constrained at 13 of the evapotranspiration rate nutrients were applied together with irrigation water see section 4 for concentrations drip irrigation occurred every two hours for 2 75 min at a rate of 1 0 l per hour per angle arrow dripper i e a total of 5 5 l were applied per day to consider heterogeneity independent scaling factors for the pressure head and hydraulic conductivity function were introduced the scaling factors were generated via sequential gaussian simulation with the visim program hansen and mosegaard 2008 in the open source mgstat matlab toolbox hansen 2020 with a variance of 0 05 a mean value of 1 0 and correlation lengths of 4 and 2 cm in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively the spatial distribution of the hydraulic conductivity scaling factors within the flow domain is depicted in fig 6 the flow domain was discretized with finite elements of 1 0 cm in the horizontal direction and 0 5 cm in the vertical direction mesh refinements for the top 1 cm layer and in areas with variable flux and free drainage bcs led to a total of 408 848 nodes and 2 315 763 3d mesh elements to solve eq 7 with its symmetric sparse coefficient matrix for water flow a total of 15 preconditioners and 13 solvers were considered table 4 all preconditioners and solvers but two were extracted from the portable extensible toolkit for scientific computation petsc library https www mcs anl gov petsc two preconditioners were incorporated from the high performance preconditioners hypre library http www llnl gov casc hypre via the petsc interface the sparsity pattern of the coefficient matrix associated with the water flow simulation is depicted in fig 7 because of the large number of considered preconditioner solver combinations the total time for each simulation was limited to 10 h the simulations were performed on the university of arizona puma hpc cluster with system specifications provided in table s1 the number of cores nc utilized were 12 24 48 and 94 respectively to compare the computational efficiency of various preconditioner solver combinations the wall clock time which includes preconditioner setup and application time as well as the time for solver application was used as a metric fig 8 depicts the ten fastest preconditioner solver combinations together with the ideal speedup line that is defined as the ratio of utilized cores and the number of cores used for the base case i e 12 9 t p p base p t base where t p is the simulation time when p processors are utilized and p base and t base are the number of processors used for the base case and the associated simulation time respectively the inset in fig 8 shows all successful combinations as apparent the choice of the preconditioner solver combination significantly impacts computational efficiency as the determined wall clock times vary by more than one order of magnitude note that some of the simulations with the gamg preconditioner did not converge when 94 cores were utilized the reported wall clock times represent the median of 5 separate simulation runs the simulation speedup follows the ideal speedup line up to 48 cores beyond which the performance starts to degrade this is attributable to the increase of the communication to computation ratio hammond et al 2014 for the executed simulations the average number of nodes for each core was about 8500 and 4400 when utilizing 48 and 94 cores respectively this suggests that for optimal scalability the minimum number of nodes per processor should fall within this range because the order of the most efficient combinations is dependent on the number of cores nc the wall clock times were normalized by the smallest value for each nc group i e 12 24 48 and 94 and then averaged the five fastest combinations and their associated normalized times are listed in table 5 although the dgmres solver applied in conjunction with the bjacobi preconditioner performed better than other widely used solvers such as cg the differences are minor between the five computationally most efficient combinations table 5 this leads to the conclusion that bjacobi which performs the incomplete lower upper factorization in each block with zero level fill is the preconditioner of choice for our water flow simulations this finding in general concurs with herbst et al 2008 who investigated the performance of five preconditioners in combination with the cg solver for simulation of one and three dimensional water flow i e richards equation in porous media in contrast to their results the algebraic multigrid preconditioner boomeramg did not work well for our simulations which is most likely because of the more complex water distributions within our flow domain due to the implementation of surface drip irrigation root water uptake and free drainage from the bottom boundary 5 2 preconditioners and solvers for solute transport the test case for solute transport is identical to the test case in section 5 1 with regard to water flow in addition h 2 p o 4 nh 4 and no 3 were applied with the irrigation water at concentrations of 20 mg l 1 20 mg l 1 and 80 mg l 1 respectively while nonlinear langmuir adsorption was considered for ammonium nh 4 and phosphorus h 2 p o 4 nitrate no 3 did not interact with the solid phase fifteen preconditioners and 12 solvers were evaluated table 6 the ten computationally most efficient preconditioner solver combinations for solute transport are depicted in fig 9 together with the ideal speedup line the inset shows all successful combinations which vary over two orders of magnitude as for water flow the simulation speedup follows the ideal speedup line up to 48 cores and then the performance starts degrading combinations with the gamg preconditioner were the least efficient although the boomeramg preconditioner performed better for solute transport it is not among the top ranked these results differ from sbai and larabi 2021 who simulated field scale chemical transport in groundwater the deviations can be attributed to the consideration of adsorbing solutes in our simulations as well as the generally better performance of the algebraic multigrid preconditioner for large transport domains sbai and larabi 2020 the most efficient combinations consisted of preconditioners of the successive over relaxation category i e sor and eisenstat and variations of the gmres solver it should be noted that the parallel sor and eisenstat preconditioners are equivalent to bjacobi with sor on each block and are therefore not true parallel preconditioners as evident from fig 9 and table 7 the sor fgmres combination is best suited for our application 6 computational efficiency and stability of hydrus and the modified parswms as already indicated in section 5 computational efficiency and stability are essential when simulating flow and transport processes in soilless plant growth modules especially when a vast number of realizations is required hence it is of interest to compare the windows os based hydrus with the linux os based modified parswms because workstations and hpc clusters are not intercomparable such comparison is only viable on a workstation with both windows i e windows 10 pro version 1909 os build 18363 1016 and linux i e ubuntu 18 04 5 lts installed on a partitioned hard drive a workstation with two 2 40 ghz intel xeon e5 2630 v3 dual 8 core processors and 32 gb ram was used for the comparison hydrus benefits from a powerful gui with numerous advanced features such as the ability to create or import complex domain geometries or to specify various spatially variable properties such as materials initial conditions boundary conditions and domain properties either directly on the finite element mesh or on geometric objects independent of the mesh šimůnek et al 2016 to utilize parallel computing and the computing prowess of the latest multicore workstations hydrus relies on the hydrus parallelized hypar module and the microsoft parallel patterns library to numerically solve eq 7 for water flow and solute transport with the cg and orthomin solvers respectively equation 7 is preconditioned with the incomplete lower upper factorization method both the solvers and the preconditioner are from the orthofem library mendoza et al 1991 the test case for the stability and efficiency comparison conforms with the descriptions in sections 5 1 and 5 2 except that the swc and hydraulic conductivity functions were not scaled for the considered tuff tuff coconut coir and perlite substrates see hydraulic properties in table 1 the simulation duration was 14 days 336 hrs the flow domain was discretized with finite elements of 1 90 cm in the horizontal direction and 0 95 cm in the vertical direction mesh refinements for the top 1 cm layer and in areas with variable flux and free drainage bcs led to a total of 132 570 nodes and 726 264 3d mesh elements note that the hydraulic characteristics are calculated directly from the hydraulic functions by setting the lower and upper limits of the internal interpolation tables to zero in both hydrus and the modified parswms code the bjacobi dgmres and sor fgmres preconditioner solver combinations were used for parswms water flow and solute transport simulations respectively fig 10 shows the temporal evolution of mass balance errors for water flow and h 2 p o 4 nh 4 and no 3 transport the water mass balance errors are below 0 15 for all substrates for both the hydrus and parswms simulations which we consider quite accurate the mass balance errors for solute transport are higher for both hydrus and the modified parswms an extreme error of about 80 for no 3 is evident for the hydrus simulation for tuff which can be attributed to simulation instability issues starting at around 48 hrs this is likely due to very localized increases in no 3 concentrations at the atmospheric bc because of evaporation fig 11 bottom right in comparison the maximum mass balance error for no 3 and tuff simulated with the modified parswms is 0 54 note that the instability issues experienced with hydrus can be potentially resolved by increasing the density of the 3d mesh close to the surface at the cost of computational efficiency notably the parswms solute mass balance errors are significantly lower than the hydrus errors fig 12 shows a comparison of computational efficiencies of the hydrus and modified parswms codes besides the simulations performed on the workstation we ran parswms on the ocelote hpc 28 cores and the recently installed puma hpc 94 cores clusters for specifications see table s1 to demonstrate the massive increase in scalability when hpc environments are utilized the simulation speedup expressed in terms of normalized wall clock times see values on top of the bars in fig 12 of the modified parswms code is about 22 faster than that of hydrus on the workstation and about 94 faster on the puma hpc cluster with 94 cores note that while an increase in the number of processing cores generally speeds up the simulations beyond a certain core threshold the computational efficiency starts to decline due to an increase of the communication to computation ratio 7 conclusions with the goal of performing a vast number of flow and transport simulations on hpc clusters to aid the design and management of soilless culture growth modules we modified the open source 3d parswms code to not only enable nonlinear equilibrium solute adsorption and multi solute transport simulations but also the application of boundary conditions to realistically represent typical soilless culture systems the modified parswms code was thoroughly tested using hydrus as a reference to optimize the computational efficiency of the modified parswms numerous preconditioner numerical solver combinations were tested for both the water flow and solute transport equations while the bjacobi dgmres preconditioner solver combination was the most efficient for water flow sor fgmres worked best for solute transport in general gmres type and cg solvers applied in conjunction with the bjacobi preconditioner were very efficient for water flow simulations the most efficient combinations for solute transport consisted of preconditioners of the successive over relaxation category i e sor and eisenstat and variations of the gmres solver to compare the stability and computational efficiency of modified parswms with hydrus a real growth module from a production scale greenhouse experiment at the aro volcani center in israel was simulated considering three soilless substrates and h 2 p o 4 nh 4 and no 3 transport the simulations were performed on a workstation and two hpc clusters the results revealed that the modified parswms was about 22 more efficient than hydruswhen the simulations on the workstation were compared simulations on the hpc clusters were up to 94 more efficient when 94 cores were utilized if the full computational power of the hpc clusters i e no competing projects and up to 23 616 available cores was to be utilized simulation times would again be drastically reduced to a very small fraction of the hydrus wall clock time while we experienced some stability issues for tuff and no 3 with hydrus leading to an unrealistically high mass balance error all modified parswms simulations were stable on both the workstation and hpc clusters in general all water and solute mass balance errors generated with the modified parswms where bellow the mass balance errors of hydrus the availability of the modified and tested parswms code opens new avenues for streamlining 3d water flow and solute transport simulations for complex porous media via the utilization of hpc environments simulations that took days to complete can now be resolved within a matter of a few hours allowing for a vast number of realizations within a short period of time 8 availability of software all computer codes and matlab scripts created for this project are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request

4669,estimating precipitation at high spatial temporal resolution is vital in manifold hydrological meteorological and water management applications especially over areas with un gauged networks and regions where water resources are on the wane this study aims to evaluate five downscaling methods to determine the accuracy and efficiency of which on generating high resolution precipitation data at annual and monthly scales to establish precipitation land surface characteristics relationship environmental factors including normalized difference vegetation index ndvi land surface temperature lst and digital elevation model dem were considered as proxies in the spatial downscaling procedure the downscaling algorithms namely support vector machine svm random forest rf geographically weighted regression gwr multiple linear regression mlr and exponential regression er were implemented to downscale the version 7 of trmm tropical rainfall measuring mission precipitation 3b43 v7 product over lake urmia basin lub from 0 25 to 1 km spatial resolution the downscaled precipitation data was validated against observations from meteorological stations monthly fractions derived from trmm 3b43 were used to disaggregate 1 km annual precipitation to 1 km monthly precipitation furthermore the best method was selected for calibration based on geographical difference analysis gda to assess the effectiveness of the calibration as a viable option the results indicate that svm not only outperforms the other methods but also has good agreements with in situ measurements compared to the original trmm the results confirm that inclusion of lst and geographic information along with ndvi can improve the downscaling performance downscaling and gda calibration significantly improve the accuracy of trmm 3b43 product at both spatial and temporal resolution and should be considered as an essential step in calibration of trmm precipitation calibration at monthly scale yields slightly better results than calibration at annual scale and then disaggregating into monthly maps in terms of accuracy assessment keywords trmm downscaling calibration machine learning lake urmia basin 1 introduction as an integral component of the water cycle and energy balance precipitation is considered as an important parameter in ecological climatological and hydrological research kidd et al 2012 ghajarnia et al 2015 acquiring high temporal and spatial resolution precipitation at high temporal and spatial resolution can be crucial for understanding land atmosphere interactions and global climate change however obtaining such data at higher accuracy in remote and un gauged areas still remains a great challenge salio et al 2015 henn et al 2018 spatially limited and sparsely distributed rain gauges and point based measurements fail to reflect the spatial variation of precipitation properly villarini et al 2008 javanmard et al 2010 in recent years remote sensing has offered a promising solution with reliable estimates of precipitation over large areas the pixel size of satellite precipitation datasets e g 0 25 are too coarse to be applied in hydrological and meteorological studies at basin scales which should be resolved first immerzeel et al 2009 michaelides et al 2009 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 several satellite rainfall datasets such as the global precipitation climatology project huffman et al 1997 adler et al 2003 and precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks hsu et al 1997 have been developed one of the satellite products is precipitation from the tropical rainfall measuring mission kummerow et al 1998 2000 which is widely used in many hydrological modellings and climatological studies yang et al 2017 yoshimoto and amarnath 2017 zhao et al 2018 therefore prior to using precipitation products downscaling and calibration is required to improve the accuracy of such satellite based datasets and make it more applicable even in small and local scales calibration and validation of the satellite retrieved precipitation products e g trmm for this study is mainly based on the comparison between trmm pixels and rain gauges e g heidinger et al 2012 which causes scale mismatch issue each trmm pixel represents the areal average precipitation within it while rain gauge measurements are point based therefore this scale difference between point based measurements of rain gauges and pixel based values of the trmm can create errors for validation and calibration purposes park et al 2017 there are two ways for solving this issue to some extent one of the approaches is to select pixels with multiple rain gauges within them and use the average value of those gauges as ground truth yong et al 2010 el kenawy et al 2015 since this method is not applicable in regions with sparsely gauged network downscaling precipitation from coarse to fine resolution can provide high resolution gridded data the downscaled data can be compared with individual rain gauges effectively and thus properly used in hydrological and meteorological studies at basin and regional scales this study focuses on downscaling trmm 3b43 v7 from 0 25 to 1 km to generate high resolution precipitation data many studies have used hydrometeorological variables derived from remote sensing data that are physically related to the precipitation as predictors to develop downscaling model immerzeel et al 2009 onema and taigbenu 2009 jia et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 immerzeel et al 2009 used an exponential relationship between normalized difference vegetation index ndvi as a proxy of vegetation and precipitation to improve the resolution of the trmm from 0 25 to 1 km on an annual basis jia et al 2011 incorporated ndvi and digital elevation model dem into multiple linear regression mlr model to downscale the pixel size of trmm from 0 25 to 1 km over the qaidam basin duan and bastiaanssen 2013 in addition to disaggregating annual precipitation into monthly precipitation using monthly fractions proposed geographical differential analysis gda and geographical differential analysis gra calibration cheema and bastiaanssen 2012 to improve the downscaling procedure since linkages between precipitation and land surface characteristics vary spatially this feature cannot be properly explained by exponential regression er or mlr and may add uncertainty and error in the downscaled precipitation datasets foody 2003 xu et al 2015 thus geographically weighted regression gwr was developed to reduce biases chen et al 2015 2018 2019 xu et al 2015 earlier studies have considered machine learning algorithms as an effective way to capture the non linearity between precipitation and explanatory variables effectively and thus increasing the accuracy of the downscaled precipitation shi et al 2015 jing et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 although several algorithms are proposed for downscaling trmm precipitation yet the primary question remains unanswered that which algorithm is able to surpass the others this study evaluates ability of the two machine learning algorithms support vector machine svm and random forest rf geographically weighted regression gwr exponential regression and multiple linear regression mlr to downscale the version 7 of trmm satellite precipitation trmm 3b43 v7 over lake urmia basin lub three land surface related variables including ndvi lst and dem are used to construct the downscaling model many studies have reported that vegetation response to precipitation has a 3 months lag and ndvi cannot be used on monthly scales because of the defoliation of vegetation during autumn and winter immerzeel et al 2009 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 xu et al 2015 therefore this study focuses on downscaling on an annual basis and disaggregating annual precipitation into monthly maps as proposed by duan and bastiaanssen 2013 moreover since there might be no explicit relation between environmental variables and precipitation xu et al 2015 jing et al 2016 different methods are explored to capture such complex relationships in the downscaling procedure after evaluation of all the downscaling methods the gda procedure is applied to the method which demonstrates higher validation results against ground observations in order to determine the extent of improvements that it can bring about also we apply the gda calibration at annual and monthly scales to compare the effectiveness of gda procedure at both scales this could be of great value in data scarce regions another notable point is that there is some debate as to whether residual correction is essential for downscaling or not duan and bastiaanssen 2013 xu et al 2015 jing et al 2016 exploring the necessity of residual correction goes beyond the purpose of this article and deserves further investigation and it is ignored in this study however it can be inferred that residual correction exacerbates the performance of downscaling model when the model can predict the precipitation effectively shi et al 2015 xu et al 2015 jing et al 2016 the specific objectives of this study include evaluation and comparison of five downscaling methods based on ndvi lst and dem as suggested by immerzeel et al 2009 jia et al 2011 xu et al 2015 jing et al 2016 integrate downscaling and gda calibration to investigate whether a calibration procedure can increase the overall accuracy of the downscaled precipitation at annual and monthly scales comparing the effectiveness of monthly based calibration after disaggregation and annual based calibration evaluating the importance of geographic coordinates for capturing the spatial variation relationships between precipitation and the environmental variables investigate whether importance of lst can be significant compared to the other environmental variables 2 study domain lake urmia basin lub is one of the six river basins located in the northwestern of iran between 35 6 n 38 5 n latitude and 44 1 e 47 8 e longitude fig 1 the basin covers a surface area of 52000 km including the lake urmia area 34 000 km2 of mountainous areas and 13 000 km2 of flat lands the water level of lake urmia that was once the largest lake in the middle east has dramatically dropped over eight meters within the last three decades mainly due to the extension of cultivation and high water consumption in agricultural sector bakhshianlamouki et al 2019 taheri et al 2019 with the elevation ranges from 1250 to 3650 m above mean sea level lub exhibits a variety of climate conditions mean annual precipitation in the basin varies from 200 mm in the northwestern regions to around 800 mm in the western and the southern areas and the mean annual temperature varies from 3 c to 12 c the high spatial variability of precipitation in the lub with the complex topography makes it a proper place for the evaluation of satellite based precipitation estimates 3 datasets and processing 3 1 ground observation this study uses 21 rain gauge stations rgs with continuous monthly data between 2009 and 2013 which are obtained from the islamic republic of iran meteorological organization during this period the average annual precipitation was 346 mm over lub with the maximum 410 mm and minimum 310 mm in years 2011 and 2010 respectively for calibration and validation purposes we followed the procedure described by duan and bastiaanssen 2013 for the sake of calibration average annual precipitation of all five year period from 21 rgs calculated and sorted in lowest highest sequence 1 21 finally eleven rgs with odd numbers were selected for calibration and the rest for validation 3 2 tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm is a joint project between nasa and japanese space agency jaxa which is launched in november 1997 with three rainfall measuring sensors huffman et al 2007 the trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa combines most of available precipitation products with satellite sensors and rain gauges to provide precipitation at spatial resolution of 0 25 huffman et al 2007 2010 trmm 3b43 is one of tmpa products which are available at monthly temporal resolution this study uses trmm 3b43 version 7 which released in may 2012 https disc2 gesdisc eosdis nasa gov monthly trmm precipitation is added to provide annual precipitation for this study 3 3 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis is an imaging instrument onboard the nasa s terra and aqua platforms which was launched in 1999 and 2002 respectively for land surface monitoring in support of global change research and environmental applications justice et al 2002 modis has provided a wide variety of measurements and products in global dynamics oceans and land processes wan 2014 kilpatrick et al 2015 giglio et al 2016 this study uses modis 16 day normalized difference vegetation index product mod13q1 and modis 8 day land surface temperature product mod10a2 at the resolution of 250 m and 1 km in the sinusoidal projection respectively data are publicly available at https e4ftl01 cr usgs gov modis ndvi is up scaled to 1 km for downscaling annual trmm precipitation moreover the average annual ndvi and lst are computed for each typical year to be used in downscaling process 3 4 digital elevation model dem data the shuttle radar topography mission srtm operated by the national geospatial intelligence agency nga and the national aeronautics and space administration nasa provides digital elevation model dem maps at high spatial resolution farr et al 2007 schneider et al 2012 dem data with spatial resolution of 90 m was downloaded from http srtm csi cgiar org and then resampled to 1 km by averaging the values of pixels within each 1 km pixel 4 methodology 4 1 downscaling of trmm 3b43 precipitation the main concepts of this study is constructed based on the previous studies immerzeel et al 2009 jia et al 2011 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 immerzeel et al 2009 proposed a precipitation ndvi relationship to establish an exponential regression for downscaling trmm jia et al 2011 reported that dem can be an effective proxy for precipitation as well precipitation as a predictand can generally be affected by topography and geographic locations especially in mountainous areas and thus can be considered effective predictors for downscaling procedure guan et al 2009 jia et al 2011 shi et al 2015 wang et al 2018 also recent studies have demonstrated correlations between precipitation and lst trenberth and shea 2005 de kauwe et al 2013 which make it a potential predictor for precipitation in addition assessing the usability of lst when there are no clear relationships between precipitation and ndvi can be worthwhile therefore lst is introduced in this study to enhance the accuracy of downscaling procedure as recommended by xu et al 2015 jing et al 2016 this study evaluates and compares five methods used in downscaling of trmm 3b43 v7 precipitation including two machine learning models svm and rf two regression models er and mlr and gwr each method has unique characteristics and can exhibit the importance and complexity level of linkage between predictors and predictand the specific steps taken for downscaling are described as follows 1 all the monthly datasets namely trmm 3b43 v7 lst and ndvi were aggregated to annual maps for each year 2 after up scaling dem and ndvi to 1 km it is necessary to exclude the negative ndvi values from the datasets which mainly belongs to snow and water bodies such as lake urmia by applying the threshold ndvi 0 those pixels were eliminated from the datasets this limitation can preclude estimating precipitation over water bodies and snow areas the limitation was ultimately obviated by interpolating the downscaled annual precipitation with idw interpolator where ndvi values were negative 3 ndvi lst and dem values were aggregated from 1 km to 0 25 by pixel averaging the pixel averaging method can reflect the overall situation within each 0 25 as well as reducing the impact of outliers in the 1 km pixels 4 the relationship between independent variables at 0 25 and trmm 3b43 v7 was established for each algorithm the svm and rf algorithms were conducted using scikit learn package developed in python pedregosa et al 2011 and for gwr we used gwr 4 0 software https gwrtools github io gwr4 downloads html with adaptive bi square as kernel function and aicc corrected akaike information criterion as the selection criteria 5 annual precipitation at 1 km for each typical year was estimated using the established models in step 4 individually residual correction is not implemented in this study residual correction is a process in which a residual map between data and regressed data is added to the model it should be noted that our initial analysis showed that applying residual correction on svm rf and gwr exacerbates the accuracy of the models and it appears to be non essential step for downscaling at least in our study however further investigations are required 4 2 gda calibration of downscaled precipitation geographical differential analysis gda method is a residual based analysis developed by cheema and bastiaanssen 2012 gda used for calibration of the trmm is based on minimizing the difference between downscaled precipitation and rain gauge measurements in this study gda calibration has only been applied to the method with the best validation results to assess the efficiency of the calibration the difference between point based measurements p obs and corresponding downscaled trmm pixels was calculated as p error point 1 δ p p o int p obs p trmm 1 k m δ p p o int is interpolated to grid of 1 km p error 1 k m using inverse distance weighting idw to provide difference map idw is known as the suitable interpolator for interpolating randomly distributed errors duan and bastiaanssen 2013 thus the difference map is added to the downscaled trmm to produce the calibrated trmm p gda 1 k m 2 p gda 1 k m p error 1 k m p trmm 1 k m 4 3 disaggregation of annual precipitation since vegetation defoliates during cold seasons and vegetation response to precipitation has a lag time up to several months quiroz et al 2011 downscaling of precipitation on a monthly basis is likely to produce large errors we therefore use monthly fractions fraci derived from trmm 3b43 v7 monthly data to disaggregate the downscaled annual precipitation into monthly maps as 3 frac i p trmmi i 1 12 p trmmi where i is month index this regularly spaced fractions at 0 25 spatial resolution are interpolated into 1 km resolution using spline interpolation similar to the calibration procedure described in section 4 2 we implemented the same calibration procedure for each month to compare monthly based and annual based calibration 4 4 brief description of downscaling algorithms to assess the performance of downscaling methods five algorithms svm rf gwr mlr and er are used to downscale trmm 3b43 v7 precipitation data for this purpose support vector machine svm is a robust machine learning algorithm developed by vapnik 2013 which can be used for classification and regression problems the svm algorithm is based on an optimization theory that establishes set of hyperplanes in a high dimensional space with maximal margin the maximal margin is obtained by solving the following quadratic problem 4 maximize w a i 1 n a i 1 2 i 1 n j 1 n a i a j y i y j k x i x j subject to i 1 n a i y i 0 and 0 a i c for all i where x is the training vectors and k x i y i is the kernel function svm has been successfully availed in many fields such as hydrology deka 2014 chiogna et al 2018 remote sensing mountrakis et al 2011 geiß et al 2019 and drought monitoring rahmati et al 2020 random forest rf is an ensemble learning algorithm based on the classification and regression trees cart algorithm breiman 2001 in rf regression random samples with replacement are extracted from the original training sample set and for each subset a regression tree is constructed independently finally the predictions are obtained by averaging the predictions from all the individual regression trees as 5 f 1 n i 1 n f i x where n is the number of trees x is the training sample set and fi x is the prediction from each regression tree the svm and rf models are highly capable of coping with non linear problems and thus they manage to capture the relationships between independent features and trmm precipitation especially where this relationship becomes more complex in addition to two machine learning algorithms exponential regression multiple linear regression and geographically weighted regression were evaluated in this study immerzeel et al 2009 proposed a ndvi based exponential regression to downscale trmm precipitation ndvi and trmm datasets were up scaled to different scales 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 and 1 25 in order to determine the exponential regression with the best fit for downscaling trmm to 1 km finally the difference map between the regressed values and original trmm was added to the 1 km precipitation 6 p a e b n d v i where p is trmm precipitation and a and b are the fitting coefficients jia et al 2011 employed a mlr model in which precipitation was regressed on ndvi and dem to downscale trmm 3b43 data and improved the downscaling further in this study we incorporated lst as third variable to investigate applicability of lst 7 p a n d v i b l s t c d e m d where a b and c are the coefficients and d is the intercept term er and mlr assume that the relationship between dependent variable and independent variables are constant in the space to obviate this issue geographically weighted regression gwr was used in this study to investigate the non stationary characteristics of such relationships contrary to er and mlr gwr is regional regression method that attempts to capture the spatial variation between predicand and predictors by integrating the geographical location information into the regression model foody 2003 fotheringham et al 2003 8 y i j β j u i v i x i j ε i where x i j is the jth predictor at ith point βj ui vi are the coefficients at ith point ε i is the error term and ui vi is the coordinate of the ith point unlike traditional regression models the coefficients in eq 8 are weighted based on the distance of the observations around the ith point closer points receive more weights and vice versa hence gwr is able to attain higher performance than traditional global regression models such as er and mlr it should be noted that 20 of the data was used for test and the rest for training in order to find the optimal parameters through a range of parameter combinations for svm and rf cross validated grid search algorithm was implemented using four fold cross validation on training set parameter combinations for rf and svm are shown in table 1 4 5 validation the ground observations rain gauges that are not included in the calibration are used to evaluate five downscaling methods the coefficient of determination known as r squared r2 the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and bias are computed for evaluation of the results as 9 rmse i 1 n p i p obs 2 n 10 mae i 1 n p i p obs n 11 bias i 1 n p i i 1 n p obs 1 where n is the number of observations pobs is the observation from rain gauges and p is the satellite based precipitation at the corresponding rain gauge 5 results and discussion 5 1 annual results based on the studies conducted by immerzeel et al 2009 jia et al 2011 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 xu et al 2015 jing et al 2016 annual trmm 3b43 v7 precipitation data was downscaled using svm rf gwr er and mlr on an annual basis since svm algorithm produced more reliable results with better accuracy the downscaled precipitation maps derived from svm was selected for gda calibration procedure termed as svm gda the annual trmm precipitation and the downscaled precipitation derived from er mlr gwr rf svm svm gda methods over lake urmia basin are shown in fig 2 fig 2 shows that generally all the downscaled precipitation maps have almost the same spatial distribution and pattern also the resolution of the downscaled precipitation is considerably improved fig 3 shows the scatterplot between measured annual precipitation from the validation rain gauge stations and trmm er mlr rf svm and svm gda from 2009 to 2013 it can be seen that the original trmm er mlr and gwr have overestimated the precipitation while rf and svm have improved the precipitation by lowering the deviation from 1 1 line it is clear that the svm gda has drawn the points nearer to 1 1 line and thus has improved the overall accuracy the main reason that the downscaling algorithms overestimate the precipitation is because the original trmm has overestimated the precipitation which the regression was based on another important point is that as the ability of the downscaling algorithm for capturing the relation between predictand and predicators increases overestimation reduces hence er and svm algorithm shows the highest and lowest level of overestimation moreover gda calibration corrects for this further and close the points to 1 1 line the statistical measures for each method and for each year are listed in table 2 based on the 10 independent validation stations it is obvious that svm based and rf based downscaling exhibits higher accuracy with reduced rmse mae and bias values compared to er mlr gwr and trmm the only drawback for rf based downscaling is for 2013 which has slightly worse rmse and mae than the original trmm instead rf has improved bias er and mlr has failed to show satisfactory results at 1 km which implies that residual correction should be considered as a necessary step for globally regression models since lst and dem are considered in mlr method it shows more satisfactory results than er algorithm gwr has better validation results compared to er and mlr as gwr takes the spatial variation between predictand and predictors into account for the first three years 2009 2010 and 2011 gwr has better rmse mae and bias values than trmm neglecting slight difference of mae for 2011 while gwr shows worse statistical measures compared to the original trmm for 2012 and 2013 this issue could be attributed to the increased complexity level between precipitation and the environmental variables in those years for instance the failure of er algorithm to capture the precipitation ndvi relationship may be because of the aridity level of lub which creates complex ndvi precipitation pattern fig 4 vegetation growth can be affected by several factors such as intensity and distribution of precipitation soil type irrigation and hydrological conditions and will consequently result in a complicated precipitation ndvi relationship jia et al 2011 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 the same conditions could apply to lst and dem which vindicate the unsatisfactory results derived from er mlr and gwr given all the results svm model achieved the best results and outperformed the rest even the original trmm in terms of rmse mae and bias generally we can deduce that downscaling is a necessary step in accuracy assessment of satellite retrieved precipitation estimations applying gda calibration on svm reduces rmse mae and bias and improves the accuracy further it is clear that the svm based downscaling procedure greatly increases the accuracy of trmm and gda calibration improves the statistical indicators especially mae and bias even more duan and bastiaanssen 2013 suggested that for evaluation analysis of different downscaling methods mae and bias are more important and r2 is not a good measurement for comparison of downscaling methods therefore for annual results only mae rmse and bias are considered and we compared the scatterplots to 1 1 line by comparing mae and bias it can be concluded that svm gda presents the best 1 km results at annual scale and gda calibration is simply an effective procedure to enhance the accuracy of downscaling procedure further based on the table 3 the statistical indicators confirm the same conclusion svm based downscaling produces the best output with lower rmse mae and bias followed by the gda calibration rmse and more importantly mae and bias was decreased notably the results illustrate the promising potential of gda in improving the accuracy of satellite derived precipitation estimates comparison of the predictive performance of all the five downscaling methods with the trmm annual precipitation at 0 25 for each typical year are shown in table 4 it is worthwhile to mention that mlr has better accuracy than er which can be attributed to the inclusion of lst and dem in the regression likewise gwr method ameliorates r2 and rmse values even further by introducing the geographical information locations into the regression model which reveals the paramount importance of the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation in the downscaling procedure more importantly r2 reaches its zenith when svm and rf is employed this is because machine learning algorithms are highly capable of capturing the complex and non linear relationships between land surface characteristics and precipitation taking each typical year into account it can be discerned that svm based downscaling outperformed the other methods incisively the variable importance derived from rf algorithm proves the conclusions drawn above fig 5 fig 5 quantifies the usability of inclusion of the feature importance of auxiliary factors in rf method for every individual year it is shown that ndvi and longitude is of great importance in terms of contribution to the regression model also lst and dem has significant feature importance as shown in fig 5 in the first three years importance of lst is considerable as feature importance of coordinates longitude rises importance of lst begins to fall fig 5b it can be inferred that integrating both lst and geographical locations information into the regression model can make notable improvements to the downscaling model fig 5a highlights the average variable importance for each variable during 2009 2013 on average longitude and ndvi possess the highest feature importance respectively followed by lst dem and latitude 5 2 monthly results based on the annual downscaling results obtained from the previous section monthly precipitation maps were generated using the monthly fractions derived from trmm 3b43 in addition to evaluation of different downscaling methods at monthly scale monthly based gda calibration of svm termed as svm mgda was considered for accuracy assessment of monthly and annual based calibration for all five typical years comparisons between the 10 validation rain gauges values and all the monthly achieved results including monthly original trmm disaggregated er erdis disaggregated mlr mlrdis disaggregated gwr gwrdis disaggregated rf rfdis disaggregated svm svmdis disaggregated annual based calibrated svm svm gdadis as well as svm mgda for all five years are shown in fig 6 erdis and mlrdis has shown the lowest r2 rmse mae and bias among the other methods gwrdis shows acceptable results with r 2 of 0 51 rmse of 27 9 mm mae of 18 37 mm and bias of 0 31 which is almost identical to the trmm results like the annual results svmdis and rfdis improves the accuracy of trmm precipitation notably and exhibits the strength of machine learning algorithms in downscaling of the trmm 3b43 v7 product at both annual and monthly scales also svm mgda has nearly the same results to svm gdadis but with slightly better improvements for further analysis statistical measures for each year are listed in table 5 as expected svmdis and rfdis outperformed the other methods in 2013 trmm shows slightly better r2 than svm gdadis and svm mgda which might be caused by the non uniformity of improvements for the individual gauge correlation according to duan and bastiaanssen 2013 also in 2012 and 2013 trmm has better conditions in terms of r2 than svmdis since such contradictions in r2 of downscaled precipitation are reported in other studies stathopoulou and cartalis 2009 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 we gave more weight to other validation indicators specifically mae rather than r2 by comparing rmse and mae it can be seen that svm and rf methods have enhanced the overall accuracy of the original trmm 3b43 v7 eventually svmdis possesses the first rank with the best mae values among the other methods the comparison between svm mgda and svm gdadis reveals that monthly based calibration increases the overall accuracy of the svm based downscaling procedure than the annual based calibration however applying the gda calibration at monthly scale might not be necessary since the results of calibration at monthly scale was slightly better than calibration at annual scale and thus annual records of rain gauges can be enough for the sake of calibration in other words this integrated downscaling calibration procedure can be implemented successfully even in data scarce regions it is worth mentioning that inclusion of more stations if possible can inherently enhance the usability of the gda calibration fig 7 presents the time series of monthly precipitation spatially averaged over the locations of 10 validation rain gauge stations for trmm svm gdadis and svm mgda based on the fig 7 svm mgda shows better agreements with the rain gauge stations compared to svm gdadis in most cases but this agreement is not that considerable to make a big difference between annual and monthly based calibrations in addition trmm has overestimated precipitation nonetheless it follows the same pattern as the rain gauges fig 8 shows the mae values of svm mgda and svm gdadis since mae has the same pattern as rmse but with lower values only mae was considered for this purpose fig 8 confirms the same deduction drawn from fig 7 the difference of the mae values between svm mgda and svm gdadis are almost identical svm mgda shows slightly better mae values for most months though in fact svm gdadis is rather overestimated 6 conclusions the objective of this study was to evaluate and compare different downscaling methods from 0 25 to 1 km at both annual and monthly temporal resolution for the version 7 of trmm 3b43 product over lake urmia basin during 2009 2013 the high resolution precipitation is valuable in ungauged basins and data scarce regions for hydrological and ecological studies at local and global scales being an effective solution to scale mismatch downscaling can also be an essential step in calibrating trmm precipitation data for the purpose of evaluation five algorithms were implemented to downscale annual trmm 3b43 data validation results using 10 independent rain gauge stations indicated that svm and rf based models resulted in considerably higher accuracy than gwr mlr and er models however svm method surpassed all the methods and was ranked as the best downscaling method furthermore analyzing the results derived from gwr mlr and er revealed the indispensable contribution of lst and spatial variation in downscaling procedure to be specific the mlr model with lst and dem along with ndvi as proxies outperformed er similarly gwr outperformed mlr and er because gwr algorithm is able capture the spatial variation between the precipitation and the environmental factors according to the feature importance of rf algorithm ndvi and geographic coordinates were the most important variables followed by lst and dem furthermore the relations between precipitation and environmental variables as well as their importance in the downscaling procedure can be site specific and several factors can alter and complicate this relationship since all downscaling procedures are based on the original trmm 3b43 data the accuracy of downscaled precipitation can be affected by the accuracy of the original trmm the downscaled precipitation using machine learning models especially svm model reduced the overestimation of the trmm data so that the downscaled precipitation had notably higher accuracy than the original trmm 3b43 v7 downscaling followed by the gda calibration gave the best annual results and improved the statistical measures and visual evaluation even more and thus considered suitable method for improving the downscaling procedure the simple disaggregation procedure based on the monthly fractions disaggregated annual precipitation to 1 km monthly precipitation effectively like the annual downscaled precipitation machine learning algorithms namely svm and rf produced the highest accuracy data in terms of statistical indicators respectively followed by gwr mlr and er the accuracy of svm based precipitation data was even better than the original trmm 3b43 when compared to ground rainfall measurements the comparison of monthly based and annual based calibration showed that there is no statistically significant difference between them however the monthly based calibration improved the overall accuracy of the precipitation just slightly compared to the annual based calibration other land surface variables such as soil moisture could be considered to establish enhanced relationships between satellite derived precipitation data and other land characteristics to improve downscaling procedure additional efforts need to be taken to develop universal downscaling techniques to be implemented at different temporal scales weekly daily and sub daily declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

4669,estimating precipitation at high spatial temporal resolution is vital in manifold hydrological meteorological and water management applications especially over areas with un gauged networks and regions where water resources are on the wane this study aims to evaluate five downscaling methods to determine the accuracy and efficiency of which on generating high resolution precipitation data at annual and monthly scales to establish precipitation land surface characteristics relationship environmental factors including normalized difference vegetation index ndvi land surface temperature lst and digital elevation model dem were considered as proxies in the spatial downscaling procedure the downscaling algorithms namely support vector machine svm random forest rf geographically weighted regression gwr multiple linear regression mlr and exponential regression er were implemented to downscale the version 7 of trmm tropical rainfall measuring mission precipitation 3b43 v7 product over lake urmia basin lub from 0 25 to 1 km spatial resolution the downscaled precipitation data was validated against observations from meteorological stations monthly fractions derived from trmm 3b43 were used to disaggregate 1 km annual precipitation to 1 km monthly precipitation furthermore the best method was selected for calibration based on geographical difference analysis gda to assess the effectiveness of the calibration as a viable option the results indicate that svm not only outperforms the other methods but also has good agreements with in situ measurements compared to the original trmm the results confirm that inclusion of lst and geographic information along with ndvi can improve the downscaling performance downscaling and gda calibration significantly improve the accuracy of trmm 3b43 product at both spatial and temporal resolution and should be considered as an essential step in calibration of trmm precipitation calibration at monthly scale yields slightly better results than calibration at annual scale and then disaggregating into monthly maps in terms of accuracy assessment keywords trmm downscaling calibration machine learning lake urmia basin 1 introduction as an integral component of the water cycle and energy balance precipitation is considered as an important parameter in ecological climatological and hydrological research kidd et al 2012 ghajarnia et al 2015 acquiring high temporal and spatial resolution precipitation at high temporal and spatial resolution can be crucial for understanding land atmosphere interactions and global climate change however obtaining such data at higher accuracy in remote and un gauged areas still remains a great challenge salio et al 2015 henn et al 2018 spatially limited and sparsely distributed rain gauges and point based measurements fail to reflect the spatial variation of precipitation properly villarini et al 2008 javanmard et al 2010 in recent years remote sensing has offered a promising solution with reliable estimates of precipitation over large areas the pixel size of satellite precipitation datasets e g 0 25 are too coarse to be applied in hydrological and meteorological studies at basin scales which should be resolved first immerzeel et al 2009 michaelides et al 2009 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 several satellite rainfall datasets such as the global precipitation climatology project huffman et al 1997 adler et al 2003 and precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks hsu et al 1997 have been developed one of the satellite products is precipitation from the tropical rainfall measuring mission kummerow et al 1998 2000 which is widely used in many hydrological modellings and climatological studies yang et al 2017 yoshimoto and amarnath 2017 zhao et al 2018 therefore prior to using precipitation products downscaling and calibration is required to improve the accuracy of such satellite based datasets and make it more applicable even in small and local scales calibration and validation of the satellite retrieved precipitation products e g trmm for this study is mainly based on the comparison between trmm pixels and rain gauges e g heidinger et al 2012 which causes scale mismatch issue each trmm pixel represents the areal average precipitation within it while rain gauge measurements are point based therefore this scale difference between point based measurements of rain gauges and pixel based values of the trmm can create errors for validation and calibration purposes park et al 2017 there are two ways for solving this issue to some extent one of the approaches is to select pixels with multiple rain gauges within them and use the average value of those gauges as ground truth yong et al 2010 el kenawy et al 2015 since this method is not applicable in regions with sparsely gauged network downscaling precipitation from coarse to fine resolution can provide high resolution gridded data the downscaled data can be compared with individual rain gauges effectively and thus properly used in hydrological and meteorological studies at basin and regional scales this study focuses on downscaling trmm 3b43 v7 from 0 25 to 1 km to generate high resolution precipitation data many studies have used hydrometeorological variables derived from remote sensing data that are physically related to the precipitation as predictors to develop downscaling model immerzeel et al 2009 onema and taigbenu 2009 jia et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 immerzeel et al 2009 used an exponential relationship between normalized difference vegetation index ndvi as a proxy of vegetation and precipitation to improve the resolution of the trmm from 0 25 to 1 km on an annual basis jia et al 2011 incorporated ndvi and digital elevation model dem into multiple linear regression mlr model to downscale the pixel size of trmm from 0 25 to 1 km over the qaidam basin duan and bastiaanssen 2013 in addition to disaggregating annual precipitation into monthly precipitation using monthly fractions proposed geographical differential analysis gda and geographical differential analysis gra calibration cheema and bastiaanssen 2012 to improve the downscaling procedure since linkages between precipitation and land surface characteristics vary spatially this feature cannot be properly explained by exponential regression er or mlr and may add uncertainty and error in the downscaled precipitation datasets foody 2003 xu et al 2015 thus geographically weighted regression gwr was developed to reduce biases chen et al 2015 2018 2019 xu et al 2015 earlier studies have considered machine learning algorithms as an effective way to capture the non linearity between precipitation and explanatory variables effectively and thus increasing the accuracy of the downscaled precipitation shi et al 2015 jing et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 although several algorithms are proposed for downscaling trmm precipitation yet the primary question remains unanswered that which algorithm is able to surpass the others this study evaluates ability of the two machine learning algorithms support vector machine svm and random forest rf geographically weighted regression gwr exponential regression and multiple linear regression mlr to downscale the version 7 of trmm satellite precipitation trmm 3b43 v7 over lake urmia basin lub three land surface related variables including ndvi lst and dem are used to construct the downscaling model many studies have reported that vegetation response to precipitation has a 3 months lag and ndvi cannot be used on monthly scales because of the defoliation of vegetation during autumn and winter immerzeel et al 2009 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 xu et al 2015 therefore this study focuses on downscaling on an annual basis and disaggregating annual precipitation into monthly maps as proposed by duan and bastiaanssen 2013 moreover since there might be no explicit relation between environmental variables and precipitation xu et al 2015 jing et al 2016 different methods are explored to capture such complex relationships in the downscaling procedure after evaluation of all the downscaling methods the gda procedure is applied to the method which demonstrates higher validation results against ground observations in order to determine the extent of improvements that it can bring about also we apply the gda calibration at annual and monthly scales to compare the effectiveness of gda procedure at both scales this could be of great value in data scarce regions another notable point is that there is some debate as to whether residual correction is essential for downscaling or not duan and bastiaanssen 2013 xu et al 2015 jing et al 2016 exploring the necessity of residual correction goes beyond the purpose of this article and deserves further investigation and it is ignored in this study however it can be inferred that residual correction exacerbates the performance of downscaling model when the model can predict the precipitation effectively shi et al 2015 xu et al 2015 jing et al 2016 the specific objectives of this study include evaluation and comparison of five downscaling methods based on ndvi lst and dem as suggested by immerzeel et al 2009 jia et al 2011 xu et al 2015 jing et al 2016 integrate downscaling and gda calibration to investigate whether a calibration procedure can increase the overall accuracy of the downscaled precipitation at annual and monthly scales comparing the effectiveness of monthly based calibration after disaggregation and annual based calibration evaluating the importance of geographic coordinates for capturing the spatial variation relationships between precipitation and the environmental variables investigate whether importance of lst can be significant compared to the other environmental variables 2 study domain lake urmia basin lub is one of the six river basins located in the northwestern of iran between 35 6 n 38 5 n latitude and 44 1 e 47 8 e longitude fig 1 the basin covers a surface area of 52000 km including the lake urmia area 34 000 km2 of mountainous areas and 13 000 km2 of flat lands the water level of lake urmia that was once the largest lake in the middle east has dramatically dropped over eight meters within the last three decades mainly due to the extension of cultivation and high water consumption in agricultural sector bakhshianlamouki et al 2019 taheri et al 2019 with the elevation ranges from 1250 to 3650 m above mean sea level lub exhibits a variety of climate conditions mean annual precipitation in the basin varies from 200 mm in the northwestern regions to around 800 mm in the western and the southern areas and the mean annual temperature varies from 3 c to 12 c the high spatial variability of precipitation in the lub with the complex topography makes it a proper place for the evaluation of satellite based precipitation estimates 3 datasets and processing 3 1 ground observation this study uses 21 rain gauge stations rgs with continuous monthly data between 2009 and 2013 which are obtained from the islamic republic of iran meteorological organization during this period the average annual precipitation was 346 mm over lub with the maximum 410 mm and minimum 310 mm in years 2011 and 2010 respectively for calibration and validation purposes we followed the procedure described by duan and bastiaanssen 2013 for the sake of calibration average annual precipitation of all five year period from 21 rgs calculated and sorted in lowest highest sequence 1 21 finally eleven rgs with odd numbers were selected for calibration and the rest for validation 3 2 tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm is a joint project between nasa and japanese space agency jaxa which is launched in november 1997 with three rainfall measuring sensors huffman et al 2007 the trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa combines most of available precipitation products with satellite sensors and rain gauges to provide precipitation at spatial resolution of 0 25 huffman et al 2007 2010 trmm 3b43 is one of tmpa products which are available at monthly temporal resolution this study uses trmm 3b43 version 7 which released in may 2012 https disc2 gesdisc eosdis nasa gov monthly trmm precipitation is added to provide annual precipitation for this study 3 3 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis is an imaging instrument onboard the nasa s terra and aqua platforms which was launched in 1999 and 2002 respectively for land surface monitoring in support of global change research and environmental applications justice et al 2002 modis has provided a wide variety of measurements and products in global dynamics oceans and land processes wan 2014 kilpatrick et al 2015 giglio et al 2016 this study uses modis 16 day normalized difference vegetation index product mod13q1 and modis 8 day land surface temperature product mod10a2 at the resolution of 250 m and 1 km in the sinusoidal projection respectively data are publicly available at https e4ftl01 cr usgs gov modis ndvi is up scaled to 1 km for downscaling annual trmm precipitation moreover the average annual ndvi and lst are computed for each typical year to be used in downscaling process 3 4 digital elevation model dem data the shuttle radar topography mission srtm operated by the national geospatial intelligence agency nga and the national aeronautics and space administration nasa provides digital elevation model dem maps at high spatial resolution farr et al 2007 schneider et al 2012 dem data with spatial resolution of 90 m was downloaded from http srtm csi cgiar org and then resampled to 1 km by averaging the values of pixels within each 1 km pixel 4 methodology 4 1 downscaling of trmm 3b43 precipitation the main concepts of this study is constructed based on the previous studies immerzeel et al 2009 jia et al 2011 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 immerzeel et al 2009 proposed a precipitation ndvi relationship to establish an exponential regression for downscaling trmm jia et al 2011 reported that dem can be an effective proxy for precipitation as well precipitation as a predictand can generally be affected by topography and geographic locations especially in mountainous areas and thus can be considered effective predictors for downscaling procedure guan et al 2009 jia et al 2011 shi et al 2015 wang et al 2018 also recent studies have demonstrated correlations between precipitation and lst trenberth and shea 2005 de kauwe et al 2013 which make it a potential predictor for precipitation in addition assessing the usability of lst when there are no clear relationships between precipitation and ndvi can be worthwhile therefore lst is introduced in this study to enhance the accuracy of downscaling procedure as recommended by xu et al 2015 jing et al 2016 this study evaluates and compares five methods used in downscaling of trmm 3b43 v7 precipitation including two machine learning models svm and rf two regression models er and mlr and gwr each method has unique characteristics and can exhibit the importance and complexity level of linkage between predictors and predictand the specific steps taken for downscaling are described as follows 1 all the monthly datasets namely trmm 3b43 v7 lst and ndvi were aggregated to annual maps for each year 2 after up scaling dem and ndvi to 1 km it is necessary to exclude the negative ndvi values from the datasets which mainly belongs to snow and water bodies such as lake urmia by applying the threshold ndvi 0 those pixels were eliminated from the datasets this limitation can preclude estimating precipitation over water bodies and snow areas the limitation was ultimately obviated by interpolating the downscaled annual precipitation with idw interpolator where ndvi values were negative 3 ndvi lst and dem values were aggregated from 1 km to 0 25 by pixel averaging the pixel averaging method can reflect the overall situation within each 0 25 as well as reducing the impact of outliers in the 1 km pixels 4 the relationship between independent variables at 0 25 and trmm 3b43 v7 was established for each algorithm the svm and rf algorithms were conducted using scikit learn package developed in python pedregosa et al 2011 and for gwr we used gwr 4 0 software https gwrtools github io gwr4 downloads html with adaptive bi square as kernel function and aicc corrected akaike information criterion as the selection criteria 5 annual precipitation at 1 km for each typical year was estimated using the established models in step 4 individually residual correction is not implemented in this study residual correction is a process in which a residual map between data and regressed data is added to the model it should be noted that our initial analysis showed that applying residual correction on svm rf and gwr exacerbates the accuracy of the models and it appears to be non essential step for downscaling at least in our study however further investigations are required 4 2 gda calibration of downscaled precipitation geographical differential analysis gda method is a residual based analysis developed by cheema and bastiaanssen 2012 gda used for calibration of the trmm is based on minimizing the difference between downscaled precipitation and rain gauge measurements in this study gda calibration has only been applied to the method with the best validation results to assess the efficiency of the calibration the difference between point based measurements p obs and corresponding downscaled trmm pixels was calculated as p error point 1 δ p p o int p obs p trmm 1 k m δ p p o int is interpolated to grid of 1 km p error 1 k m using inverse distance weighting idw to provide difference map idw is known as the suitable interpolator for interpolating randomly distributed errors duan and bastiaanssen 2013 thus the difference map is added to the downscaled trmm to produce the calibrated trmm p gda 1 k m 2 p gda 1 k m p error 1 k m p trmm 1 k m 4 3 disaggregation of annual precipitation since vegetation defoliates during cold seasons and vegetation response to precipitation has a lag time up to several months quiroz et al 2011 downscaling of precipitation on a monthly basis is likely to produce large errors we therefore use monthly fractions fraci derived from trmm 3b43 v7 monthly data to disaggregate the downscaled annual precipitation into monthly maps as 3 frac i p trmmi i 1 12 p trmmi where i is month index this regularly spaced fractions at 0 25 spatial resolution are interpolated into 1 km resolution using spline interpolation similar to the calibration procedure described in section 4 2 we implemented the same calibration procedure for each month to compare monthly based and annual based calibration 4 4 brief description of downscaling algorithms to assess the performance of downscaling methods five algorithms svm rf gwr mlr and er are used to downscale trmm 3b43 v7 precipitation data for this purpose support vector machine svm is a robust machine learning algorithm developed by vapnik 2013 which can be used for classification and regression problems the svm algorithm is based on an optimization theory that establishes set of hyperplanes in a high dimensional space with maximal margin the maximal margin is obtained by solving the following quadratic problem 4 maximize w a i 1 n a i 1 2 i 1 n j 1 n a i a j y i y j k x i x j subject to i 1 n a i y i 0 and 0 a i c for all i where x is the training vectors and k x i y i is the kernel function svm has been successfully availed in many fields such as hydrology deka 2014 chiogna et al 2018 remote sensing mountrakis et al 2011 geiß et al 2019 and drought monitoring rahmati et al 2020 random forest rf is an ensemble learning algorithm based on the classification and regression trees cart algorithm breiman 2001 in rf regression random samples with replacement are extracted from the original training sample set and for each subset a regression tree is constructed independently finally the predictions are obtained by averaging the predictions from all the individual regression trees as 5 f 1 n i 1 n f i x where n is the number of trees x is the training sample set and fi x is the prediction from each regression tree the svm and rf models are highly capable of coping with non linear problems and thus they manage to capture the relationships between independent features and trmm precipitation especially where this relationship becomes more complex in addition to two machine learning algorithms exponential regression multiple linear regression and geographically weighted regression were evaluated in this study immerzeel et al 2009 proposed a ndvi based exponential regression to downscale trmm precipitation ndvi and trmm datasets were up scaled to different scales 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 and 1 25 in order to determine the exponential regression with the best fit for downscaling trmm to 1 km finally the difference map between the regressed values and original trmm was added to the 1 km precipitation 6 p a e b n d v i where p is trmm precipitation and a and b are the fitting coefficients jia et al 2011 employed a mlr model in which precipitation was regressed on ndvi and dem to downscale trmm 3b43 data and improved the downscaling further in this study we incorporated lst as third variable to investigate applicability of lst 7 p a n d v i b l s t c d e m d where a b and c are the coefficients and d is the intercept term er and mlr assume that the relationship between dependent variable and independent variables are constant in the space to obviate this issue geographically weighted regression gwr was used in this study to investigate the non stationary characteristics of such relationships contrary to er and mlr gwr is regional regression method that attempts to capture the spatial variation between predicand and predictors by integrating the geographical location information into the regression model foody 2003 fotheringham et al 2003 8 y i j β j u i v i x i j ε i where x i j is the jth predictor at ith point βj ui vi are the coefficients at ith point ε i is the error term and ui vi is the coordinate of the ith point unlike traditional regression models the coefficients in eq 8 are weighted based on the distance of the observations around the ith point closer points receive more weights and vice versa hence gwr is able to attain higher performance than traditional global regression models such as er and mlr it should be noted that 20 of the data was used for test and the rest for training in order to find the optimal parameters through a range of parameter combinations for svm and rf cross validated grid search algorithm was implemented using four fold cross validation on training set parameter combinations for rf and svm are shown in table 1 4 5 validation the ground observations rain gauges that are not included in the calibration are used to evaluate five downscaling methods the coefficient of determination known as r squared r2 the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and bias are computed for evaluation of the results as 9 rmse i 1 n p i p obs 2 n 10 mae i 1 n p i p obs n 11 bias i 1 n p i i 1 n p obs 1 where n is the number of observations pobs is the observation from rain gauges and p is the satellite based precipitation at the corresponding rain gauge 5 results and discussion 5 1 annual results based on the studies conducted by immerzeel et al 2009 jia et al 2011 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 xu et al 2015 jing et al 2016 annual trmm 3b43 v7 precipitation data was downscaled using svm rf gwr er and mlr on an annual basis since svm algorithm produced more reliable results with better accuracy the downscaled precipitation maps derived from svm was selected for gda calibration procedure termed as svm gda the annual trmm precipitation and the downscaled precipitation derived from er mlr gwr rf svm svm gda methods over lake urmia basin are shown in fig 2 fig 2 shows that generally all the downscaled precipitation maps have almost the same spatial distribution and pattern also the resolution of the downscaled precipitation is considerably improved fig 3 shows the scatterplot between measured annual precipitation from the validation rain gauge stations and trmm er mlr rf svm and svm gda from 2009 to 2013 it can be seen that the original trmm er mlr and gwr have overestimated the precipitation while rf and svm have improved the precipitation by lowering the deviation from 1 1 line it is clear that the svm gda has drawn the points nearer to 1 1 line and thus has improved the overall accuracy the main reason that the downscaling algorithms overestimate the precipitation is because the original trmm has overestimated the precipitation which the regression was based on another important point is that as the ability of the downscaling algorithm for capturing the relation between predictand and predicators increases overestimation reduces hence er and svm algorithm shows the highest and lowest level of overestimation moreover gda calibration corrects for this further and close the points to 1 1 line the statistical measures for each method and for each year are listed in table 2 based on the 10 independent validation stations it is obvious that svm based and rf based downscaling exhibits higher accuracy with reduced rmse mae and bias values compared to er mlr gwr and trmm the only drawback for rf based downscaling is for 2013 which has slightly worse rmse and mae than the original trmm instead rf has improved bias er and mlr has failed to show satisfactory results at 1 km which implies that residual correction should be considered as a necessary step for globally regression models since lst and dem are considered in mlr method it shows more satisfactory results than er algorithm gwr has better validation results compared to er and mlr as gwr takes the spatial variation between predictand and predictors into account for the first three years 2009 2010 and 2011 gwr has better rmse mae and bias values than trmm neglecting slight difference of mae for 2011 while gwr shows worse statistical measures compared to the original trmm for 2012 and 2013 this issue could be attributed to the increased complexity level between precipitation and the environmental variables in those years for instance the failure of er algorithm to capture the precipitation ndvi relationship may be because of the aridity level of lub which creates complex ndvi precipitation pattern fig 4 vegetation growth can be affected by several factors such as intensity and distribution of precipitation soil type irrigation and hydrological conditions and will consequently result in a complicated precipitation ndvi relationship jia et al 2011 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 the same conditions could apply to lst and dem which vindicate the unsatisfactory results derived from er mlr and gwr given all the results svm model achieved the best results and outperformed the rest even the original trmm in terms of rmse mae and bias generally we can deduce that downscaling is a necessary step in accuracy assessment of satellite retrieved precipitation estimations applying gda calibration on svm reduces rmse mae and bias and improves the accuracy further it is clear that the svm based downscaling procedure greatly increases the accuracy of trmm and gda calibration improves the statistical indicators especially mae and bias even more duan and bastiaanssen 2013 suggested that for evaluation analysis of different downscaling methods mae and bias are more important and r2 is not a good measurement for comparison of downscaling methods therefore for annual results only mae rmse and bias are considered and we compared the scatterplots to 1 1 line by comparing mae and bias it can be concluded that svm gda presents the best 1 km results at annual scale and gda calibration is simply an effective procedure to enhance the accuracy of downscaling procedure further based on the table 3 the statistical indicators confirm the same conclusion svm based downscaling produces the best output with lower rmse mae and bias followed by the gda calibration rmse and more importantly mae and bias was decreased notably the results illustrate the promising potential of gda in improving the accuracy of satellite derived precipitation estimates comparison of the predictive performance of all the five downscaling methods with the trmm annual precipitation at 0 25 for each typical year are shown in table 4 it is worthwhile to mention that mlr has better accuracy than er which can be attributed to the inclusion of lst and dem in the regression likewise gwr method ameliorates r2 and rmse values even further by introducing the geographical information locations into the regression model which reveals the paramount importance of the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation in the downscaling procedure more importantly r2 reaches its zenith when svm and rf is employed this is because machine learning algorithms are highly capable of capturing the complex and non linear relationships between land surface characteristics and precipitation taking each typical year into account it can be discerned that svm based downscaling outperformed the other methods incisively the variable importance derived from rf algorithm proves the conclusions drawn above fig 5 fig 5 quantifies the usability of inclusion of the feature importance of auxiliary factors in rf method for every individual year it is shown that ndvi and longitude is of great importance in terms of contribution to the regression model also lst and dem has significant feature importance as shown in fig 5 in the first three years importance of lst is considerable as feature importance of coordinates longitude rises importance of lst begins to fall fig 5b it can be inferred that integrating both lst and geographical locations information into the regression model can make notable improvements to the downscaling model fig 5a highlights the average variable importance for each variable during 2009 2013 on average longitude and ndvi possess the highest feature importance respectively followed by lst dem and latitude 5 2 monthly results based on the annual downscaling results obtained from the previous section monthly precipitation maps were generated using the monthly fractions derived from trmm 3b43 in addition to evaluation of different downscaling methods at monthly scale monthly based gda calibration of svm termed as svm mgda was considered for accuracy assessment of monthly and annual based calibration for all five typical years comparisons between the 10 validation rain gauges values and all the monthly achieved results including monthly original trmm disaggregated er erdis disaggregated mlr mlrdis disaggregated gwr gwrdis disaggregated rf rfdis disaggregated svm svmdis disaggregated annual based calibrated svm svm gdadis as well as svm mgda for all five years are shown in fig 6 erdis and mlrdis has shown the lowest r2 rmse mae and bias among the other methods gwrdis shows acceptable results with r 2 of 0 51 rmse of 27 9 mm mae of 18 37 mm and bias of 0 31 which is almost identical to the trmm results like the annual results svmdis and rfdis improves the accuracy of trmm precipitation notably and exhibits the strength of machine learning algorithms in downscaling of the trmm 3b43 v7 product at both annual and monthly scales also svm mgda has nearly the same results to svm gdadis but with slightly better improvements for further analysis statistical measures for each year are listed in table 5 as expected svmdis and rfdis outperformed the other methods in 2013 trmm shows slightly better r2 than svm gdadis and svm mgda which might be caused by the non uniformity of improvements for the individual gauge correlation according to duan and bastiaanssen 2013 also in 2012 and 2013 trmm has better conditions in terms of r2 than svmdis since such contradictions in r2 of downscaled precipitation are reported in other studies stathopoulou and cartalis 2009 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 we gave more weight to other validation indicators specifically mae rather than r2 by comparing rmse and mae it can be seen that svm and rf methods have enhanced the overall accuracy of the original trmm 3b43 v7 eventually svmdis possesses the first rank with the best mae values among the other methods the comparison between svm mgda and svm gdadis reveals that monthly based calibration increases the overall accuracy of the svm based downscaling procedure than the annual based calibration however applying the gda calibration at monthly scale might not be necessary since the results of calibration at monthly scale was slightly better than calibration at annual scale and thus annual records of rain gauges can be enough for the sake of calibration in other words this integrated downscaling calibration procedure can be implemented successfully even in data scarce regions it is worth mentioning that inclusion of more stations if possible can inherently enhance the usability of the gda calibration fig 7 presents the time series of monthly precipitation spatially averaged over the locations of 10 validation rain gauge stations for trmm svm gdadis and svm mgda based on the fig 7 svm mgda shows better agreements with the rain gauge stations compared to svm gdadis in most cases but this agreement is not that considerable to make a big difference between annual and monthly based calibrations in addition trmm has overestimated precipitation nonetheless it follows the same pattern as the rain gauges fig 8 shows the mae values of svm mgda and svm gdadis since mae has the same pattern as rmse but with lower values only mae was considered for this purpose fig 8 confirms the same deduction drawn from fig 7 the difference of the mae values between svm mgda and svm gdadis are almost identical svm mgda shows slightly better mae values for most months though in fact svm gdadis is rather overestimated 6 conclusions the objective of this study was to evaluate and compare different downscaling methods from 0 25 to 1 km at both annual and monthly temporal resolution for the version 7 of trmm 3b43 product over lake urmia basin during 2009 2013 the high resolution precipitation is valuable in ungauged basins and data scarce regions for hydrological and ecological studies at local and global scales being an effective solution to scale mismatch downscaling can also be an essential step in calibrating trmm precipitation data for the purpose of evaluation five algorithms were implemented to downscale annual trmm 3b43 data validation results using 10 independent rain gauge stations indicated that svm and rf based models resulted in considerably higher accuracy than gwr mlr and er models however svm method surpassed all the methods and was ranked as the best downscaling method furthermore analyzing the results derived from gwr mlr and er revealed the indispensable contribution of lst and spatial variation in downscaling procedure to be specific the mlr model with lst and dem along with ndvi as proxies outperformed er similarly gwr outperformed mlr and er because gwr algorithm is able capture the spatial variation between the precipitation and the environmental factors according to the feature importance of rf algorithm ndvi and geographic coordinates were the most important variables followed by lst and dem furthermore the relations between precipitation and environmental variables as well as their importance in the downscaling procedure can be site specific and several factors can alter and complicate this relationship since all downscaling procedures are based on the original trmm 3b43 data the accuracy of downscaled precipitation can be affected by the accuracy of the original trmm the downscaled precipitation using machine learning models especially svm model reduced the overestimation of the trmm data so that the downscaled precipitation had notably higher accuracy than the original trmm 3b43 v7 downscaling followed by the gda calibration gave the best annual results and improved the statistical measures and visual evaluation even more and thus considered suitable method for improving the downscaling procedure the simple disaggregation procedure based on the monthly fractions disaggregated annual precipitation to 1 km monthly precipitation effectively like the annual downscaled precipitation machine learning algorithms namely svm and rf produced the highest accuracy data in terms of statistical indicators respectively followed by gwr mlr and er the accuracy of svm based precipitation data was even better than the original trmm 3b43 when compared to ground rainfall measurements the comparison of monthly based and annual based calibration showed that there is no statistically significant difference between them however the monthly based calibration improved the overall accuracy of the precipitation just slightly compared to the annual based calibration other land surface variables such as soil moisture could be considered to establish enhanced relationships between satellite derived precipitation data and other land characteristics to improve downscaling procedure additional efforts need to be taken to develop universal downscaling techniques to be implemented at different temporal scales weekly daily and sub daily declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
