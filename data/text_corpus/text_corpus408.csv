2040,when an excavation is close to an existing underground structure which exactly penetrates aquifers the structure would exert water blocking wb and soil blocking sb effects by changing the groundwater seepage and restricting the strata movement these two barrier effects would make the dewatering induced behaviours of groundwater and strata be different from the case with no nearby structure in this study a typical metro station was selected as an underground barrier and its barrier effect on the responses of groundwater and strata to dewatering of adjacent large scale excavations were numerically investigated results indicate that regardless of the excavation scale the overall water yield of the excavation would be reduced by considering the wb effect while in the meantime the induced groundwater drawdown would be enlarged meaning the number of the designed pumping wells could be reduced to achieve the same dewatering effect the strata behaviour under barrier effect is more complicated depending on the coupled action of the wb and sb effects both the excavation width b and the distance of station to the excavation d could largely affect the intensity of the wb and sb effects further determining the ground settlement amount either larger or smaller than that without barrier effect designers should consider the barrier effect based on practical d and b to realize the optimal or economic design and meanwhile to prevent the appearance of unexpected large responses of groundwater and strata during dewatering construction keywords dewatering groundwater drawdown water yield ground settlement barrier effect data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years the urban population surges with the fast urbanization and many cities are facing heavy traffic bringing about a large scale construction of metro lines or underground transport system pujades et al 2016 attard et al 2017 wang et al 2018 zeng et al 2019c wu et al 2020a wu et al 2020b li et al 2021 shen et al 2021 zeng et al 2021c zheng et al 2016 in the construction of underground infrastructures pumping of groundwater i e dewatering is usually employed to lower the water level inside an excavation facilitating the construction in a dry and stable environment ma et al 2014 wu et al 2016 pujades et al 2017 zhang et al 2017a zhang et al 2017b zeng et al 2018 feng and zhan 2019 wang et al 2019 li et al 2020 zeng et al 2021a cao et al 2022 however the excavation dewatering could usually lead to water level decline surrounding the excavation due to the leakage of waterproof curtains which are used to enclose the excavation further incurring surrounding strata or ground soil subsidence and settlements of existing building facilities roy and robinson 2009 xu et al 2012 pujades et al 2016 chang et al 2017 figueroa miranda et al 2018 gu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 zeng et al 2019a zheng et al 2019a zheng et al 2019b de caro et al 2020 pan and fu 2020 zeng et al 2021b zeng et al 2021d typically for the condition that an excavation is constructed around a pre existing underground structure the structure as an underground barrier may block the groundwater flow and hinder the ground movement surrounding the structure these phenomena are referred to as water blocking wb and soil blocking sb effects as a result the behaviours of groundwater and strata in excavation dewatering would be affected xu et al 2014 font capo et al 2015 liao et al 2016 de caro et al 2020 as to the wb effect xue et al 2023 xu et al 2012 pujades et al 2012 and attard et al 2016 stated that the underground structure would partially or totally block the groundwater seepage in aquifers leading to a smaller water crossing section therein a rotation of seepage direction and thus a longer seepage path which result in greater groundwater drawdown and ground subsidence on the downstream side i e between the excavation and the underground structure as to the sb effect liao et al 2016 and tan et al 2015 stated that the underground structure would limit the ground movement around it due to the ground structure interaction and thus smaller ground subsidence would appear during adjacent excavation construction the above analyses indicate that the two types of barrier effect wb and sb effects could incur opposite ground behaviour one intensifying the ground subsidence while the other reducing the ground subsidence zeng et al 2022a numerically investigated the coupled actions of the wb and sb effects during excavation dewatering and found both the effects would work at the same time and the stronger one would determine the ground behaviour i e whether the ground subsidence would be intensified or reduced depends on which type of the barrier effect is stronger however when the sb or wb effects would be stronger is a complicated issue which depends on lots of factors such as the layout of the underground barrier the permeability of the aquifer and the dewatering intensity inside the excavation in zeng s study they only focused on the barrier effect during dewatering inside a small and narrow excavation and didn t investigate the barrier effect performance during dewatering in large scale excavations with greater width in which the groundwater volume pumped from the excavation is rather greater and the induced barrier effect intensity is expected to be even larger compared to that during the dewatering in a small and narrow excavation considering that most excavations in urban cities have large scale it is of great importance to investigate the barrier effect performance or the interaction between sb and wb effects during dewatering in large scale excavations and meanwhile clarify how the groundwater and strata behave accordingly in this study a series of numerical simulations were conducted to solve the above issues specifically a common scenario in which the excavation dewatering is constructed with a nearby metro station was developed for numerical modelling field monitoring results e g groundwater drawdown and ground subsidence of a practical pumping test were adopted to validate the numerical model then extensive numerical computations were performed to investigate the barrier effect performance and the corresponding behaviours of groundwater and ground soils during dewatering in large scale excavations with different width b to enrich the understanding two other variables the pumping depth h d and the distance from metro station to excavation d were also considered in the numerical calculation the obtained results would be of value for engineers to form a better understanding of the barrier effects and their impacts on the ground behaviour which would be beneficial to the optimal dewatering design 2 pumping test 2 1 overview of background fig 1 plots the plan view of an excavation for a metro station in tianjin china the dimensions of excavation were approximately 155 m 40 m 19 m length width depth the reinforced concrete diaphragm wall 0 8 m thick and approximately 32 5 m deep was used as retaining structure a total of 25 pumping wells were installed inside the excavation to lower the groundwater level during excavation plenty of observation wells and ground settlement points only parts of them are shown in fig 1 were set around the excavation to monitor the water level change and land subsidence outside the excavation the following analyses and comparison between observed and calculated results would mainly be based on the presented observation points for the strata and aquifer distributions as shown in fig 2 one phreatic aquifer aq0 four confined aquifers aqi aqiv and four aquitards adi adiv exist within 50 m below the ground level bgl silts and silty sands are the main soil types for the aquifers while the aquitards generally consist of silty clays the initial water level head of the aquifers were found at approximately 2 0 2 7 3 0 3 2 and 3 7 m bgl from upper to lower aquifer the aquitards serve as a barrier to block the hydraulic connection among aquifers however according to the site investigation the aquifers aqi aqii and aqiii are hydraulically connected as the aquitards adii and adiii were detected to be full of high permeable sand lens the main strata properties are presented in fig 2 which were obtained from site investigation and laboratory soil property test fig 3 presents the vertical views of the pumping and observation wells together with the relative positions among wells strata and the excavation the pumping wells 23 m deep in the standard segment and 25 m deep in the end shaft were inserted into aqii considering the aqii was not totally blocked by diaphragm wall of the excavation the dewatering inside the excavation was expected to incur water level decline and land subsidence outside the excavation two types of observation well 18 m deep and 31 m deep were used for monitoring water level changes in aq0 aqi and aqii respectively to assess the impact of dewatering on the surrounding environment in advance of the formal construction pumping tests were conducted inside the excavation before bulk excavation 2 2 test procedure after installations of the diaphragm wall and first level of reinforced concrete strut a series of pumping tests were conducted inside the excavation a typical one that 22 pumping wells were operated to extract groundwater for approximately 3 2 days is introduced here and used as the background for the following numerical modelling during the test the engineers kept 3 pumping wells unoperated i e j1 j3 and adopted them as observation wells to monitor the variations of water level inside the excavation it was observed that an average groundwater drawdown of 15 m appeared inside the excavation incurring different extents of water level decline in different aquifers outside the excavation meanwhile the diaphragm wall was observed to move towards the excavation inside and the strata behind the wall presented subsidence the detailed results are shown in the following section 3 3 which compares the computed and calculated results 3 numerical modelling 3 1 modelling scheme two types of finite element fe models were established in this study by use of the abaqus package the first kind was to simulate the aforementioned pumping test with the aim to validate the fe model based on the measured results in the test the second kind was developed by adding a hypothetical metro station into the first kind of model to investigate the barrier effect problem because the main concern of this study is the barrier effect performance and the corresponding behaviours of groundwater and ground soils during dewatering in large scale excavations the excavation width b was selected as a key variable in the second kind of fe model to enrich the understanding of the barrier effect two other variables the pumping depth h d and the distance from metro station to excavation d were also considered in the numerical calculation table 1 presents the values of the above variables adopted in this study the following section would only introduce the setup of a typical fe model with adjacent metro station in detail because all the fe models in this study have basically the same modelling procedure and share the same excavation layout strata distribution and soil properties one should note that all the numerical calculations in this study could reflect the hydro mechanical h m coupling on the basis of a series of classical theories such as biot consolidation theory and darcy s law the detailed introduction of the h m coupling method could be found in li et al 2020 3 2 model setup 3 2 1 model dimension and input parameters fig 4 shows the general view of a typical fe model established in this study the model dimension and the relative position among model excavation adjacent metro station and model strata are also shown in fig 4 the excavation and the pumping wells were modelled according to the practical layout described in section 2 while the adjacent metro station was modelled based on a typical layout of a two story metro station in tianjin china zeng et al 2018 given the symmetry only half of the excavation and metro station was established in the fe model the thickness of overall model soil was set to 50 m containing 12 layers according to the engineering strata distribution introduced in section 2 considering the decline of water level occurring during the pumping test the horizontal soil boundaries should be set exceeding the influence radius of pumping r assuming that an extreme decline of water level s w and a typical horizontal soil permeability of aqii k h are equal to 35 5 m and 3 m d respectively the calculated value for r in aqii would be 615 m according to sichardt s formula i e r 10 s w k h bear 1979 therefore the horizontal soil boundaries were set 800 m from the excavation as for the modelling of the soil behaviour during excavation dewatering the mohr coulomb mc and elastic models are commonly adopted by researchers especially for the prediction of soil response to groundwater drawdown in coastal area of china shen and xu 2011 xu et al 2012 wang et al 2019 li et al 2020 zeng et al 2021b 2022b the main reason is that the groundwater level in coastal cities of china e g tianjin shanghai hangzhou has experienced repeated decline and recovery due to the over exploitation of groundwater in the past years and the restriction of groundwater withdrawal in recent years as a result the soils especially those with abundant sand particles typically present an elastic deformation subject to general groundwater drawdown during practical dewatering construction zheng et al 2019a zheng et al 2019b ha et al 2020 based on the above analyses the mc model was employed in this study to simulate the soil behavior during excavation dewatering table 2 lists the input parameters of the model soil most of which were acquired from fig 2 while the young s modulus e hydraulic conductivity k h and k v and specific storage coefficient s s were obtained by an inversion computation based on the pumping test introduced in section 2 i e repetitive trial simulations and calculations of the pumping test were conducted by adjusting e k h and k v until the computed groundwater level change ground surface settlement and diaphragm wall deflection were able to well fit the corresponding measured results in the pumping test note the fitting results are shown in the following section 3 3 based on the obtained e and the following equation 1 suggested by zeng et al 2022a s s was further computed where γ w means the unit weight of water 1 s s γ w e the diaphragm wall first level of strut and pumping well of the excavation and the metro station were simulated by solid element beam element shell element and solid element respectively the stress strain behaviour of all the structures were analyzed based on the linear elastic theory with young s modulus of 210 gpa for the pumping well and 30 gpa for the other structures according to the structure design code in china china academy of building research 2010 the structure soil friction conformed to the coulomb s law with the friction coefficient set at 0 3 according to zeng et al 2018 3 2 2 initial boundary conditions and simulation of dewatering at the asymmetric lateral boundaries and the bottom of the model the ground deformations were limited to zero in all the directions however at the symmetric lateral boundary only the horizontal displacement perpendicular to the boundary was limited the bottom of the model and the symmetric lateral boundary were set impermeably but a constant head boundary was set on the asymmetric lateral planes with the fixed head at the ground surface for the simulation of dewatering since the groundwater table inside the excavation was observed to decline quickly and finally stabilized at approximately 15 m below the original groundwater table during the pumping test in section 2 a hydraulic boundary with zero pore water pressure was directly applied on the soil nodes contacting the model pumping well in the depth range of 0 15 m bgl while another hydraulic boundary with the function of building a hydrostatic pressure was set on the interface between soil and pumping well from 15 m bgl to the bottom of the pumping well i e 24 5 m the simulation of pumping with different dewatered depth was similar to the above description but only the depth ranges of the hydraulic boundary with zero pore water pressure were different 3 3 model validation 3 3 1 groundwater drawdown a parameter r gwl was defined as the ratio of the computed groundwater drawdown to the measured drawdown r gwl 1 means the computed result is perfectly in agreement with the measured result fig 5 shows the variation of r gwl with pumping time for some typical observation wells r gwl approaches to 1 after the pumping time is larger than 10 h indicating that the computed results are able to well reflect the practical steady groundwater response at the beginning of the pumping the error between measured and computed results is relatively large which may be due to the simplification of the pumping simulation inducing a significant groundwater drawdown initially 3 3 2 ground surface settlement and diaphragm wall deflection likewise parameters r gss and r mwd were also defined as the ratio of the computed data to the measured data r gss means the ground surface settlement ratio and r mwd represents the diaphragm wall deflection ratio fig 6 shows the variation of r gss with pumping time for a typical settlement monitoring section fig 7 shows the distribution of steady r mwd along the length direction of the excavation as for the settlement r gss shows a similar variation trend to that of r gwl both initially demonstrating a relatively great deviation between computed and measured results but finally presenting a good agreement between them indicating a good performance of the fe model in reproducing the steady ground behaviour during excavation dewatering the statistics of the computed and measured settlements summarized in fig 6 shows that all the data points are around the 100 agreement line and the errors between the measured and computed results are basically within 30 as for the diaphragm wall deflection a relatively large deviation between measured and computed results occurs at the corner of the excavation as r mwd greatly deviates from 1 while in the central part of the excavation there is a reasonable agreement between the measured and computed results in fact the existence of deviation or error between the computed and measured results is normal and expectable because the simplified fe model employed in this study could not accurately reflect the variations of the strata thickness and the soil properties in the actual field conditions to assure the accuracy and reasonability of this study the following analyses would be based on the results at the central part of the excavation unless otherwise specified additionally all the data analyses in section 4 are on the basis of the results in steady state 4 barrier effect of adjacent metro station 4 1 effect on groundwater behaviour water blocking effect 4 1 1 distribution of groundwater drawdown taking the cases with h d 22 m and d 40 m for examples fig 8 shows the steady groundwater drawdown in different aquifers outside the excavation during the dewatering inside the excavation two main points can be obtained from these figures 1 for the cases without metro station blue lines the groundwater drawdown curves are continuous however for the cases with station black lines the drawdown curves blocked by the station structure present a segmented pattern i e groundwater drawdown appears to be greater in front of the metro station while relatively smaller behind the metro station this reason is the water blocking effect incurred by the adjacent metro station changes the direction of the groundwater seepage from horizontal to both vertical and horizontal around the station prolonging the seepage path of groundwater 2 as the excavation width b increases groundwater drawdowns in all the aquifers outside the excavation become greater this is because a larger volume of groundwater is pumped out during the dewatering inside the wider excavation incurring a greater requirement for the groundwater recharge from outside of the excavation which eventually leads to more apparent groundwater drawdown for the wider excavation the above explanation could be proven by fig 9 which shows the relationship between the water yield of the excavation q and the excavation width b taking the cases with h d 22 m for examples it can be seen that q grows nonlinearly with the increase of b as a result the groundwater drawdowns outside the wider excavation would be enlarged as indicated in fig 8 additionally fig 9 also demonstrates that q in the scenarios with metro station outside is always smaller than that without metro station and with the decrease of d q becomes even smaller this indicates that the water blocking effect of the pre existing metro station could reduce the overall water yield of an excavation but in the meantime incur greater groundwater drawdown in practical excavation construction in crowed urban area engineers could reasonably reduce the number of the designed pumping wells to achieve the required dewatering effect by considering the water blocking effect of adjacent underground structure 4 1 2 maximum drawdown for assessing the water blocking wb effect under different conditions a parameter η expressed as h 2 h 1 was adopted to evaluate the intensity of the wb effect where h 2 means the maximum drawdown outside the excavation for the case with adjacent metro station h 1 means that without metro station η 1 denotes no wb effect while η 1 demonstrates the wb effect works and a stronger wb effect corresponds to a larger η fig 10 presents the relationship between η and b in each aquifer for all the calculation cases with metro station according to fig 10 the following main points can be obtained 1 η is always larger when d 10 m solid points compared to the cases of d 40 m hollow points indicating that the wb effect appears to be stronger for the cases with smaller d 2 regardless of d η gets smaller following a nonlinear pattern with the increase of b in all the aquifers indicating that the wb effect tends to become weaker with the increase of b this is understandable because the wider excavation would draw a larger volume of groundwater from outside of the excavation to assure the required drawdown inside the excavation as indicated in fig 9 while the volume of groundwater blocked by the metro station modelled in this study would not apparently increase because the scale of the metro station in this study is set constant in all the calculation cases thus the wb effect of the metro station would appear to be weakened as the nearby excavation size gradually grows 3 regardless of d η in aqii is always smaller than that in both aq0 and aqi that is because the wb effect in aqii would be mitigated by the leakage of groundwater from the underlying unblocked aquifer aqiii 4 1 3 differential drawdown the significant difference in drawdowns on both sides of the metro station i e differential drawdown labelled as δ h as indicated in fig 8 would result in large asymmetric water pressure laterally acting on the station structure possibly inducing a rotation of the metro station towards the excavation for better illustrating the variation of differential drawdown under different conditions δ h was standardized as δ h h d the relationships between δ h h d and b in each aquifer for all the calculation cases with metro station are plotted in fig 11 two main points can be obtained from these figures 1 in the same aquifer δ h h d is always larger when d 10 m solid points due to the stronger wb effect on this condition indicating more attention should be paid to the motion status of the metro station for the cases with smaller d 2 regardless of d δ h h d in all the aquifer grows with the increase of b while seemingly converges to a relatively large stable value as b reaches approximately 60 m this is because the groundwater drawdown in front of the metro station as shown in fig 8 grows fast as b increases greatly aggravating the differential drawdown on both sides of the station structure likewise engineers should be highly concerned about the deformation monitoring of the metro station during dewatering in a wider excavation 3 regardless of d δ h h d in aqii is always greater than that in both aq0 and aqi that is because the excavation inside is hydraulically connected with outside through aqii and thus the groundwater response in aqii is more apparent in contrast the aqi and aq0 are hydraulically blocked by aquitards adii and adi respectively the groundwater response in aqi and aq0 therefore are sharply reduced which can be also found in fig 8 the large asymmetric water pressure on the metro station especially existing in the aquifer with a direct connection with excavation inside i e aqii in this study is an unfavorable factor incurring lateral deformation of the metro station and meanwhile worsening the stress state of the station structure e g causing additional shear force in the column of the station structure engineers should better evaluate the possible barrier effect on the surrounding protected underground structures to assure the safety of them 4 2 effect on ground soil behaviour coupled action of wb and sb effects 4 2 1 distribution of ground surface settlement taking the cases with h d 22 m for examples fig 12 shows the steady diaphragm wall deflection and ground surface settlement outside the excavation during the dewatering inside the excavation four main points can be obtained from these figures 1 in general for the cases without metro station red lines the surface settlement curves are continuous showing only one settlement trough however for the cases with metro station black lines the settlement curves show a complex segmented distribution with two obvious settlement troughs one in front of the station and the other behind the station 2 for the settlement trough ahead of the station a smaller d e g d 10 m as shown in fig 12 a produces a smaller surface settlement compared to the cases without station outside while a larger d e g d 40 m as shown in fig 12 b produces a greater surface settlement this reflects the combined action of the water blocking wb and soil blocking sb effects on the ground response specifically the sb effect induced by the station structure plays a dominant role i e the sb effect is stronger than the wb effect when d is small which leads to the restriction of the settlement development however when d is large enough say d 40 m the wb effect plays a leading role as sb effect weakens more rapidly compared to the wb effect with the increase of d thereby causing a greater settlement than that without station additionally regardless of d the settlement trough behind the station formed mainly due to the deflective movement of the station toward the excavation is always smaller than that without station outside for the same excavation in accord with the groundwater response behind the station described in section 4 1 1 3 regardless of d ground surface settlement and diaphragm wall deflection keep increasing with the increase of b which is a typical result of the deformation size effect revealed by zeng et al 2019b besides the variation of b would not change the nature of the barrier effect i e whether the sb effect or the wb effect would take dominant role is irrelevant to b 4 regardless of d the diaphragm wall deflections induced by excavation dewatering with station outside are always smaller than those without station outside i e the barrier effect of the metro station whether wb or sb plays a dominant role could reduce diaphragm wall deflections the main reasons include the following two aspects on the one hand under the barrier effect of the metro station a more significant decline of groundwater level or head outside the excavation would reduce the water pressure behind the diaphragm wall on the other hand the barrier effect diminishes the earth pressure behind the diaphragm wall according to liao et al 2016 in practice engineers should take into account the barrier effect of pre existing underground structure during the design of the excavation so as to yield a more reasonable retaining scheme and meanwhile to prevent the appearance of unexpected large ground response during construction 4 2 2 maximum surface settlement in front of the metro station from above analyses one could understand that the ground response during excavation dewatering with underground barrier outside is complex and ever changing depending on which type of the barrier effect could play a leading role to further clarify the dewatering induced ground response under barrier effect an index settlement ratio δ vm2 δ vm1 was defined as the ratio of the maximum surface settlement for the cases with and without metro station outside fig 13 presents the variation of δ vm2 δ vm1 with b for all the calculation cases δ vm2 δ vm1 1 represents the wb effect plays a dominant role while δ vm2 δ vm1 1 denotes the sb effect plays a dominant role moreover a larger deviation of δ vm2 δ vm1 from the value 1 represents a stronger barrier effect two main points can be obtained from fig 13 1 regardless of h d δ vm2 δ vm1 is always less than 1 when d 10 m meaning the sb effect is stronger than the wb effect when d is small and thus ground settlements are restricted however when d 40 m δ vm2 δ vm1 is always greater than 1 indicating that the sb effect has decayed a lot as d increases and been weaker than wb effect although the wb effect also get weaken with the increase of d this also implies that the decay rate of sb effect is faster than that of the wb effect as d gets larger the practical excavation design should consider the interaction between the wb and sb effects and their possible influence on the ground response based on the practical distance of the pre existing underground structure to the excavation to realize the optimal design 2 regardless of h d and d δ vm2 δ vm1 generally decreases nonlinearly with the increase of b however when d is small e g d 10 m δ vm2 δ vm1 gradually deviates from the line δ vm2 δ vm1 1 as b increases indicating that the barrier effect or specifically the sb effect becomes stronger as b gets larger this is because the soil movement outside a wider excavation would be more apparent due to size effect explained by zeng et al 2019b and as a result the interaction between the soil and station structure would be more obvious i e the sb effect is more apparent in a word when d is small enough to make sb effect play a dominant role an increase in b would strengthen the barrier effect and thus the difference in maximum ground settlement for considering and without considering the barrier effect would be more apparent however when d is large enough e g d 40 m the δ vm2 δ vm1 gradually approaches to the line δ vm2 δ vm1 1 as b increases demonstrating that the barrier effect gets weaker as b becomes larger this is because the wb effect plays a leading role on this occasion and as indicated in section 4 1 2 the wb effect becomes weaker with the increase of b in summary when d is large enough to make wb effect play a dominant role an increase in b would weaken the barrier effect and thus the difference in maximum ground settlement for considering and without considering the barrier effect would be less apparent 4 2 3 maximum surface settlement behind the metro station as explained in section 4 2 1 there is another apparent settlement trough behind the metro station to further clarify the ground response behind the station another index of settlement ratio δ vm3 δ vm2 was defined as the ratio of the maximum surface settlement behind and in front of the station fig 14 presents the variation of δ vm3 δ vm2 with b for all the calculation cases regardless of h d and d δ vm3 δ vm2 is always smaller than 1 indicating that the surface settlement behind the station is always smaller than that in front of the station however δ vm3 δ vm2 grows nonlinearly with the increase of b grows slightly as h d increases and grows substantially as d gets smaller indicating that in a wider excavation or in the case with demand for deeper dewatering depth or in the case with smaller distance between the excavation and underground barrier the dewatering process would intensify the ground response behind the metro station on this occasion the monitoring area of the ground settlement should be enlarged to cover the location behind the underground barrier 4 2 4 maximum diaphragm wall deflection fig 15 plots the variations of δ hm2 δ hm1 with b for all the calculation cases where δ hm2 denotes the maximum diaphragm wall deflection induced by excavation dewatering with an adjacent metro station and δ hm1 denotes that without the station two main points can be obtained from fig 15 1 δ hm2 δ hm1 is always less than 1 indicating that the barrier effect of the existing metro station could limit the lateral movement of the diaphragm wall induced by excavation dewatering 2 the variations of δ hm2 δ hm1 with b for the cases with small and large d are diametrically opposed when d is small e g d 10 m δ hm2 δ hm1 gradually decreases as b increases however when d is large e g d 40 m δ hm2 δ hm1 generally increases as b increases the reason for this opposite response is as follows as explained in section 4 2 2 when d is small the sb effect would play a dominant role on this occasion an increase in b would strengthen the sb effect causing δ hm2 δ hm1 to gradually deviate from the line δ hm2 δ hm1 1 however when d is large the wb effect would play a dominant role on this occasion an increase in b would weaken the wb effect making δ hm2 δ hm1 gradually approaching to 1 4 2 5 relation between maximum surface settlement and maximum wall deflection fig 16 plots the relationship between the maximum surface settlement δ vm and the maximum diaphragm wall deflection δ hm for conveniently comparing with other studies δ vm and δ hm were standardized as δ vm h d and δ hm h d respectively two main points can be obtained from fig 16 1 δ vm mostly lies between δ vm 1 2δ hm and δ vm 2 8δ hm during excavation dewatering with δ vm varied from 0 044 h d to 0 113 h d and δ hm ranged from 0 023 h d to 0 066 h d the variation range of δ vm obtained in this study is basically within that monitored by zhang et al 2018 i e from δ vm δ hm to δ vm 10δ hm who also summarized the relation between δ vm and δ hm in an excavation case with a close hydraulic connection between the inside and outside of the excavation 2 for the cases with different d the variation range of δ vm is different when d is relatively large i e d 40 m δ vm is greater lies between δ vm 1 6δ hm and δ vm 2 8δ hm due to the wb effect aggravating the ground settlement on this occasion however when d is relatively small i e d 10 m δ vm is smaller lies between δ vm 1 2δ hm and δ vm 2δ hm due to the sb effect restricting the ground settlement at this point the variation range of δ vm and δ hm and their relation summarized in this study could provide reference for engineer to preliminary evaluate the dewatering induced δ vm and δ hm under similar strata distribution and similar barrier effect of adjacent underground structure 5 conclusions taking a metro station as a typical underground barrier this study conducted fe modellings to investigate its barrier effect performance and the corresponding behaviours of groundwater and soil during dewatering in adjacent large scale excavations several key influence factors like the excavation width b pumped depth h d and distance from metro station to excavation d were selected as changing parameters in the fe model to enrich the understanding of the groundwater and soil responses under barrier effect i e wb and sb effects with different intensity based on this study the following conclusions can be obtained 1 during dewatering in a wider excavation the induced wb effect would be less apparent and thus the overall water yield of the excavation q would be larger which leads to greater groundwater drawdown and differential drawdown on both sides of the metro station causing greater asymmetric water pressure laterally acting on the station structure possibly further incurring a rotation of the metro station towards the excavation in practice engineers should be highly concerned about the deformation monitoring of the metro station during dewatering in a wider excavation especially the excavation with a smaller distance to the metro station 2 whatever the b is q would be reduced by considering the barrier effect while in the meantime the groundwater drawdown would be enlarged indicating that the number of the designed pumping wells could be reduced to achieve the same dewatering effect which would be a useful and economic way in optimizing the excavation design in crowed urban area with extensive pre existing underground structures 3 whatever the b is two obvious ground settlement troughs one in front of the metro station and the other behind the station would appear outside the excavation during the dewatering inside the excavation the settlement behind the station is always smaller than that in front of the station with maximum varied from 0 044 h d to 0 113 h d but would be largely enlarged as b and h d increase and d decreases on this occasion the monitoring area of the ground settlement should be enlarged to cover the location behind the underground barrier 4 the parameter d greatly affect the ground behaviour ahead of the metro station when d is small say d 10 m sb effect is stronger than the wb effect and thus ground settlements are restricted however when d is large enough say d 40 m the sb effect would be weaker than wb effect thus inducing a greater settlement than that without station 5 unlike the effect of d the parameter b would not change the nature of the barrier effect but affect its intensity when d is small say d 10 m an increase in b would strengthen the barrier effect mainly the sb effect and thus the difference in maximum ground settlement with and without the barrier effect would be more apparent however when d is large say d 40 m an increase in b would weaken the barrier effect mainly the wb effect and thus the settlement difference would be less apparent designers should consider the barrier effect based on the practical d and b to realize the optimal design and meanwhile to prevent the appearance of unexpected large ground response during construction 6 whatever the b and d are the diaphragm wall deflections induced by excavation dewatering with station outside with maximum ranged from 0 023 h d to 0 066 h d in this study are always smaller than those without station outside which is beneficial to the excavation stability the consideration of the barrier effect during excavation design would yield a more reasonable retaining scheme credit

2040,when an excavation is close to an existing underground structure which exactly penetrates aquifers the structure would exert water blocking wb and soil blocking sb effects by changing the groundwater seepage and restricting the strata movement these two barrier effects would make the dewatering induced behaviours of groundwater and strata be different from the case with no nearby structure in this study a typical metro station was selected as an underground barrier and its barrier effect on the responses of groundwater and strata to dewatering of adjacent large scale excavations were numerically investigated results indicate that regardless of the excavation scale the overall water yield of the excavation would be reduced by considering the wb effect while in the meantime the induced groundwater drawdown would be enlarged meaning the number of the designed pumping wells could be reduced to achieve the same dewatering effect the strata behaviour under barrier effect is more complicated depending on the coupled action of the wb and sb effects both the excavation width b and the distance of station to the excavation d could largely affect the intensity of the wb and sb effects further determining the ground settlement amount either larger or smaller than that without barrier effect designers should consider the barrier effect based on practical d and b to realize the optimal or economic design and meanwhile to prevent the appearance of unexpected large responses of groundwater and strata during dewatering construction keywords dewatering groundwater drawdown water yield ground settlement barrier effect data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years the urban population surges with the fast urbanization and many cities are facing heavy traffic bringing about a large scale construction of metro lines or underground transport system pujades et al 2016 attard et al 2017 wang et al 2018 zeng et al 2019c wu et al 2020a wu et al 2020b li et al 2021 shen et al 2021 zeng et al 2021c zheng et al 2016 in the construction of underground infrastructures pumping of groundwater i e dewatering is usually employed to lower the water level inside an excavation facilitating the construction in a dry and stable environment ma et al 2014 wu et al 2016 pujades et al 2017 zhang et al 2017a zhang et al 2017b zeng et al 2018 feng and zhan 2019 wang et al 2019 li et al 2020 zeng et al 2021a cao et al 2022 however the excavation dewatering could usually lead to water level decline surrounding the excavation due to the leakage of waterproof curtains which are used to enclose the excavation further incurring surrounding strata or ground soil subsidence and settlements of existing building facilities roy and robinson 2009 xu et al 2012 pujades et al 2016 chang et al 2017 figueroa miranda et al 2018 gu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 zeng et al 2019a zheng et al 2019a zheng et al 2019b de caro et al 2020 pan and fu 2020 zeng et al 2021b zeng et al 2021d typically for the condition that an excavation is constructed around a pre existing underground structure the structure as an underground barrier may block the groundwater flow and hinder the ground movement surrounding the structure these phenomena are referred to as water blocking wb and soil blocking sb effects as a result the behaviours of groundwater and strata in excavation dewatering would be affected xu et al 2014 font capo et al 2015 liao et al 2016 de caro et al 2020 as to the wb effect xue et al 2023 xu et al 2012 pujades et al 2012 and attard et al 2016 stated that the underground structure would partially or totally block the groundwater seepage in aquifers leading to a smaller water crossing section therein a rotation of seepage direction and thus a longer seepage path which result in greater groundwater drawdown and ground subsidence on the downstream side i e between the excavation and the underground structure as to the sb effect liao et al 2016 and tan et al 2015 stated that the underground structure would limit the ground movement around it due to the ground structure interaction and thus smaller ground subsidence would appear during adjacent excavation construction the above analyses indicate that the two types of barrier effect wb and sb effects could incur opposite ground behaviour one intensifying the ground subsidence while the other reducing the ground subsidence zeng et al 2022a numerically investigated the coupled actions of the wb and sb effects during excavation dewatering and found both the effects would work at the same time and the stronger one would determine the ground behaviour i e whether the ground subsidence would be intensified or reduced depends on which type of the barrier effect is stronger however when the sb or wb effects would be stronger is a complicated issue which depends on lots of factors such as the layout of the underground barrier the permeability of the aquifer and the dewatering intensity inside the excavation in zeng s study they only focused on the barrier effect during dewatering inside a small and narrow excavation and didn t investigate the barrier effect performance during dewatering in large scale excavations with greater width in which the groundwater volume pumped from the excavation is rather greater and the induced barrier effect intensity is expected to be even larger compared to that during the dewatering in a small and narrow excavation considering that most excavations in urban cities have large scale it is of great importance to investigate the barrier effect performance or the interaction between sb and wb effects during dewatering in large scale excavations and meanwhile clarify how the groundwater and strata behave accordingly in this study a series of numerical simulations were conducted to solve the above issues specifically a common scenario in which the excavation dewatering is constructed with a nearby metro station was developed for numerical modelling field monitoring results e g groundwater drawdown and ground subsidence of a practical pumping test were adopted to validate the numerical model then extensive numerical computations were performed to investigate the barrier effect performance and the corresponding behaviours of groundwater and ground soils during dewatering in large scale excavations with different width b to enrich the understanding two other variables the pumping depth h d and the distance from metro station to excavation d were also considered in the numerical calculation the obtained results would be of value for engineers to form a better understanding of the barrier effects and their impacts on the ground behaviour which would be beneficial to the optimal dewatering design 2 pumping test 2 1 overview of background fig 1 plots the plan view of an excavation for a metro station in tianjin china the dimensions of excavation were approximately 155 m 40 m 19 m length width depth the reinforced concrete diaphragm wall 0 8 m thick and approximately 32 5 m deep was used as retaining structure a total of 25 pumping wells were installed inside the excavation to lower the groundwater level during excavation plenty of observation wells and ground settlement points only parts of them are shown in fig 1 were set around the excavation to monitor the water level change and land subsidence outside the excavation the following analyses and comparison between observed and calculated results would mainly be based on the presented observation points for the strata and aquifer distributions as shown in fig 2 one phreatic aquifer aq0 four confined aquifers aqi aqiv and four aquitards adi adiv exist within 50 m below the ground level bgl silts and silty sands are the main soil types for the aquifers while the aquitards generally consist of silty clays the initial water level head of the aquifers were found at approximately 2 0 2 7 3 0 3 2 and 3 7 m bgl from upper to lower aquifer the aquitards serve as a barrier to block the hydraulic connection among aquifers however according to the site investigation the aquifers aqi aqii and aqiii are hydraulically connected as the aquitards adii and adiii were detected to be full of high permeable sand lens the main strata properties are presented in fig 2 which were obtained from site investigation and laboratory soil property test fig 3 presents the vertical views of the pumping and observation wells together with the relative positions among wells strata and the excavation the pumping wells 23 m deep in the standard segment and 25 m deep in the end shaft were inserted into aqii considering the aqii was not totally blocked by diaphragm wall of the excavation the dewatering inside the excavation was expected to incur water level decline and land subsidence outside the excavation two types of observation well 18 m deep and 31 m deep were used for monitoring water level changes in aq0 aqi and aqii respectively to assess the impact of dewatering on the surrounding environment in advance of the formal construction pumping tests were conducted inside the excavation before bulk excavation 2 2 test procedure after installations of the diaphragm wall and first level of reinforced concrete strut a series of pumping tests were conducted inside the excavation a typical one that 22 pumping wells were operated to extract groundwater for approximately 3 2 days is introduced here and used as the background for the following numerical modelling during the test the engineers kept 3 pumping wells unoperated i e j1 j3 and adopted them as observation wells to monitor the variations of water level inside the excavation it was observed that an average groundwater drawdown of 15 m appeared inside the excavation incurring different extents of water level decline in different aquifers outside the excavation meanwhile the diaphragm wall was observed to move towards the excavation inside and the strata behind the wall presented subsidence the detailed results are shown in the following section 3 3 which compares the computed and calculated results 3 numerical modelling 3 1 modelling scheme two types of finite element fe models were established in this study by use of the abaqus package the first kind was to simulate the aforementioned pumping test with the aim to validate the fe model based on the measured results in the test the second kind was developed by adding a hypothetical metro station into the first kind of model to investigate the barrier effect problem because the main concern of this study is the barrier effect performance and the corresponding behaviours of groundwater and ground soils during dewatering in large scale excavations the excavation width b was selected as a key variable in the second kind of fe model to enrich the understanding of the barrier effect two other variables the pumping depth h d and the distance from metro station to excavation d were also considered in the numerical calculation table 1 presents the values of the above variables adopted in this study the following section would only introduce the setup of a typical fe model with adjacent metro station in detail because all the fe models in this study have basically the same modelling procedure and share the same excavation layout strata distribution and soil properties one should note that all the numerical calculations in this study could reflect the hydro mechanical h m coupling on the basis of a series of classical theories such as biot consolidation theory and darcy s law the detailed introduction of the h m coupling method could be found in li et al 2020 3 2 model setup 3 2 1 model dimension and input parameters fig 4 shows the general view of a typical fe model established in this study the model dimension and the relative position among model excavation adjacent metro station and model strata are also shown in fig 4 the excavation and the pumping wells were modelled according to the practical layout described in section 2 while the adjacent metro station was modelled based on a typical layout of a two story metro station in tianjin china zeng et al 2018 given the symmetry only half of the excavation and metro station was established in the fe model the thickness of overall model soil was set to 50 m containing 12 layers according to the engineering strata distribution introduced in section 2 considering the decline of water level occurring during the pumping test the horizontal soil boundaries should be set exceeding the influence radius of pumping r assuming that an extreme decline of water level s w and a typical horizontal soil permeability of aqii k h are equal to 35 5 m and 3 m d respectively the calculated value for r in aqii would be 615 m according to sichardt s formula i e r 10 s w k h bear 1979 therefore the horizontal soil boundaries were set 800 m from the excavation as for the modelling of the soil behaviour during excavation dewatering the mohr coulomb mc and elastic models are commonly adopted by researchers especially for the prediction of soil response to groundwater drawdown in coastal area of china shen and xu 2011 xu et al 2012 wang et al 2019 li et al 2020 zeng et al 2021b 2022b the main reason is that the groundwater level in coastal cities of china e g tianjin shanghai hangzhou has experienced repeated decline and recovery due to the over exploitation of groundwater in the past years and the restriction of groundwater withdrawal in recent years as a result the soils especially those with abundant sand particles typically present an elastic deformation subject to general groundwater drawdown during practical dewatering construction zheng et al 2019a zheng et al 2019b ha et al 2020 based on the above analyses the mc model was employed in this study to simulate the soil behavior during excavation dewatering table 2 lists the input parameters of the model soil most of which were acquired from fig 2 while the young s modulus e hydraulic conductivity k h and k v and specific storage coefficient s s were obtained by an inversion computation based on the pumping test introduced in section 2 i e repetitive trial simulations and calculations of the pumping test were conducted by adjusting e k h and k v until the computed groundwater level change ground surface settlement and diaphragm wall deflection were able to well fit the corresponding measured results in the pumping test note the fitting results are shown in the following section 3 3 based on the obtained e and the following equation 1 suggested by zeng et al 2022a s s was further computed where γ w means the unit weight of water 1 s s γ w e the diaphragm wall first level of strut and pumping well of the excavation and the metro station were simulated by solid element beam element shell element and solid element respectively the stress strain behaviour of all the structures were analyzed based on the linear elastic theory with young s modulus of 210 gpa for the pumping well and 30 gpa for the other structures according to the structure design code in china china academy of building research 2010 the structure soil friction conformed to the coulomb s law with the friction coefficient set at 0 3 according to zeng et al 2018 3 2 2 initial boundary conditions and simulation of dewatering at the asymmetric lateral boundaries and the bottom of the model the ground deformations were limited to zero in all the directions however at the symmetric lateral boundary only the horizontal displacement perpendicular to the boundary was limited the bottom of the model and the symmetric lateral boundary were set impermeably but a constant head boundary was set on the asymmetric lateral planes with the fixed head at the ground surface for the simulation of dewatering since the groundwater table inside the excavation was observed to decline quickly and finally stabilized at approximately 15 m below the original groundwater table during the pumping test in section 2 a hydraulic boundary with zero pore water pressure was directly applied on the soil nodes contacting the model pumping well in the depth range of 0 15 m bgl while another hydraulic boundary with the function of building a hydrostatic pressure was set on the interface between soil and pumping well from 15 m bgl to the bottom of the pumping well i e 24 5 m the simulation of pumping with different dewatered depth was similar to the above description but only the depth ranges of the hydraulic boundary with zero pore water pressure were different 3 3 model validation 3 3 1 groundwater drawdown a parameter r gwl was defined as the ratio of the computed groundwater drawdown to the measured drawdown r gwl 1 means the computed result is perfectly in agreement with the measured result fig 5 shows the variation of r gwl with pumping time for some typical observation wells r gwl approaches to 1 after the pumping time is larger than 10 h indicating that the computed results are able to well reflect the practical steady groundwater response at the beginning of the pumping the error between measured and computed results is relatively large which may be due to the simplification of the pumping simulation inducing a significant groundwater drawdown initially 3 3 2 ground surface settlement and diaphragm wall deflection likewise parameters r gss and r mwd were also defined as the ratio of the computed data to the measured data r gss means the ground surface settlement ratio and r mwd represents the diaphragm wall deflection ratio fig 6 shows the variation of r gss with pumping time for a typical settlement monitoring section fig 7 shows the distribution of steady r mwd along the length direction of the excavation as for the settlement r gss shows a similar variation trend to that of r gwl both initially demonstrating a relatively great deviation between computed and measured results but finally presenting a good agreement between them indicating a good performance of the fe model in reproducing the steady ground behaviour during excavation dewatering the statistics of the computed and measured settlements summarized in fig 6 shows that all the data points are around the 100 agreement line and the errors between the measured and computed results are basically within 30 as for the diaphragm wall deflection a relatively large deviation between measured and computed results occurs at the corner of the excavation as r mwd greatly deviates from 1 while in the central part of the excavation there is a reasonable agreement between the measured and computed results in fact the existence of deviation or error between the computed and measured results is normal and expectable because the simplified fe model employed in this study could not accurately reflect the variations of the strata thickness and the soil properties in the actual field conditions to assure the accuracy and reasonability of this study the following analyses would be based on the results at the central part of the excavation unless otherwise specified additionally all the data analyses in section 4 are on the basis of the results in steady state 4 barrier effect of adjacent metro station 4 1 effect on groundwater behaviour water blocking effect 4 1 1 distribution of groundwater drawdown taking the cases with h d 22 m and d 40 m for examples fig 8 shows the steady groundwater drawdown in different aquifers outside the excavation during the dewatering inside the excavation two main points can be obtained from these figures 1 for the cases without metro station blue lines the groundwater drawdown curves are continuous however for the cases with station black lines the drawdown curves blocked by the station structure present a segmented pattern i e groundwater drawdown appears to be greater in front of the metro station while relatively smaller behind the metro station this reason is the water blocking effect incurred by the adjacent metro station changes the direction of the groundwater seepage from horizontal to both vertical and horizontal around the station prolonging the seepage path of groundwater 2 as the excavation width b increases groundwater drawdowns in all the aquifers outside the excavation become greater this is because a larger volume of groundwater is pumped out during the dewatering inside the wider excavation incurring a greater requirement for the groundwater recharge from outside of the excavation which eventually leads to more apparent groundwater drawdown for the wider excavation the above explanation could be proven by fig 9 which shows the relationship between the water yield of the excavation q and the excavation width b taking the cases with h d 22 m for examples it can be seen that q grows nonlinearly with the increase of b as a result the groundwater drawdowns outside the wider excavation would be enlarged as indicated in fig 8 additionally fig 9 also demonstrates that q in the scenarios with metro station outside is always smaller than that without metro station and with the decrease of d q becomes even smaller this indicates that the water blocking effect of the pre existing metro station could reduce the overall water yield of an excavation but in the meantime incur greater groundwater drawdown in practical excavation construction in crowed urban area engineers could reasonably reduce the number of the designed pumping wells to achieve the required dewatering effect by considering the water blocking effect of adjacent underground structure 4 1 2 maximum drawdown for assessing the water blocking wb effect under different conditions a parameter η expressed as h 2 h 1 was adopted to evaluate the intensity of the wb effect where h 2 means the maximum drawdown outside the excavation for the case with adjacent metro station h 1 means that without metro station η 1 denotes no wb effect while η 1 demonstrates the wb effect works and a stronger wb effect corresponds to a larger η fig 10 presents the relationship between η and b in each aquifer for all the calculation cases with metro station according to fig 10 the following main points can be obtained 1 η is always larger when d 10 m solid points compared to the cases of d 40 m hollow points indicating that the wb effect appears to be stronger for the cases with smaller d 2 regardless of d η gets smaller following a nonlinear pattern with the increase of b in all the aquifers indicating that the wb effect tends to become weaker with the increase of b this is understandable because the wider excavation would draw a larger volume of groundwater from outside of the excavation to assure the required drawdown inside the excavation as indicated in fig 9 while the volume of groundwater blocked by the metro station modelled in this study would not apparently increase because the scale of the metro station in this study is set constant in all the calculation cases thus the wb effect of the metro station would appear to be weakened as the nearby excavation size gradually grows 3 regardless of d η in aqii is always smaller than that in both aq0 and aqi that is because the wb effect in aqii would be mitigated by the leakage of groundwater from the underlying unblocked aquifer aqiii 4 1 3 differential drawdown the significant difference in drawdowns on both sides of the metro station i e differential drawdown labelled as δ h as indicated in fig 8 would result in large asymmetric water pressure laterally acting on the station structure possibly inducing a rotation of the metro station towards the excavation for better illustrating the variation of differential drawdown under different conditions δ h was standardized as δ h h d the relationships between δ h h d and b in each aquifer for all the calculation cases with metro station are plotted in fig 11 two main points can be obtained from these figures 1 in the same aquifer δ h h d is always larger when d 10 m solid points due to the stronger wb effect on this condition indicating more attention should be paid to the motion status of the metro station for the cases with smaller d 2 regardless of d δ h h d in all the aquifer grows with the increase of b while seemingly converges to a relatively large stable value as b reaches approximately 60 m this is because the groundwater drawdown in front of the metro station as shown in fig 8 grows fast as b increases greatly aggravating the differential drawdown on both sides of the station structure likewise engineers should be highly concerned about the deformation monitoring of the metro station during dewatering in a wider excavation 3 regardless of d δ h h d in aqii is always greater than that in both aq0 and aqi that is because the excavation inside is hydraulically connected with outside through aqii and thus the groundwater response in aqii is more apparent in contrast the aqi and aq0 are hydraulically blocked by aquitards adii and adi respectively the groundwater response in aqi and aq0 therefore are sharply reduced which can be also found in fig 8 the large asymmetric water pressure on the metro station especially existing in the aquifer with a direct connection with excavation inside i e aqii in this study is an unfavorable factor incurring lateral deformation of the metro station and meanwhile worsening the stress state of the station structure e g causing additional shear force in the column of the station structure engineers should better evaluate the possible barrier effect on the surrounding protected underground structures to assure the safety of them 4 2 effect on ground soil behaviour coupled action of wb and sb effects 4 2 1 distribution of ground surface settlement taking the cases with h d 22 m for examples fig 12 shows the steady diaphragm wall deflection and ground surface settlement outside the excavation during the dewatering inside the excavation four main points can be obtained from these figures 1 in general for the cases without metro station red lines the surface settlement curves are continuous showing only one settlement trough however for the cases with metro station black lines the settlement curves show a complex segmented distribution with two obvious settlement troughs one in front of the station and the other behind the station 2 for the settlement trough ahead of the station a smaller d e g d 10 m as shown in fig 12 a produces a smaller surface settlement compared to the cases without station outside while a larger d e g d 40 m as shown in fig 12 b produces a greater surface settlement this reflects the combined action of the water blocking wb and soil blocking sb effects on the ground response specifically the sb effect induced by the station structure plays a dominant role i e the sb effect is stronger than the wb effect when d is small which leads to the restriction of the settlement development however when d is large enough say d 40 m the wb effect plays a leading role as sb effect weakens more rapidly compared to the wb effect with the increase of d thereby causing a greater settlement than that without station additionally regardless of d the settlement trough behind the station formed mainly due to the deflective movement of the station toward the excavation is always smaller than that without station outside for the same excavation in accord with the groundwater response behind the station described in section 4 1 1 3 regardless of d ground surface settlement and diaphragm wall deflection keep increasing with the increase of b which is a typical result of the deformation size effect revealed by zeng et al 2019b besides the variation of b would not change the nature of the barrier effect i e whether the sb effect or the wb effect would take dominant role is irrelevant to b 4 regardless of d the diaphragm wall deflections induced by excavation dewatering with station outside are always smaller than those without station outside i e the barrier effect of the metro station whether wb or sb plays a dominant role could reduce diaphragm wall deflections the main reasons include the following two aspects on the one hand under the barrier effect of the metro station a more significant decline of groundwater level or head outside the excavation would reduce the water pressure behind the diaphragm wall on the other hand the barrier effect diminishes the earth pressure behind the diaphragm wall according to liao et al 2016 in practice engineers should take into account the barrier effect of pre existing underground structure during the design of the excavation so as to yield a more reasonable retaining scheme and meanwhile to prevent the appearance of unexpected large ground response during construction 4 2 2 maximum surface settlement in front of the metro station from above analyses one could understand that the ground response during excavation dewatering with underground barrier outside is complex and ever changing depending on which type of the barrier effect could play a leading role to further clarify the dewatering induced ground response under barrier effect an index settlement ratio δ vm2 δ vm1 was defined as the ratio of the maximum surface settlement for the cases with and without metro station outside fig 13 presents the variation of δ vm2 δ vm1 with b for all the calculation cases δ vm2 δ vm1 1 represents the wb effect plays a dominant role while δ vm2 δ vm1 1 denotes the sb effect plays a dominant role moreover a larger deviation of δ vm2 δ vm1 from the value 1 represents a stronger barrier effect two main points can be obtained from fig 13 1 regardless of h d δ vm2 δ vm1 is always less than 1 when d 10 m meaning the sb effect is stronger than the wb effect when d is small and thus ground settlements are restricted however when d 40 m δ vm2 δ vm1 is always greater than 1 indicating that the sb effect has decayed a lot as d increases and been weaker than wb effect although the wb effect also get weaken with the increase of d this also implies that the decay rate of sb effect is faster than that of the wb effect as d gets larger the practical excavation design should consider the interaction between the wb and sb effects and their possible influence on the ground response based on the practical distance of the pre existing underground structure to the excavation to realize the optimal design 2 regardless of h d and d δ vm2 δ vm1 generally decreases nonlinearly with the increase of b however when d is small e g d 10 m δ vm2 δ vm1 gradually deviates from the line δ vm2 δ vm1 1 as b increases indicating that the barrier effect or specifically the sb effect becomes stronger as b gets larger this is because the soil movement outside a wider excavation would be more apparent due to size effect explained by zeng et al 2019b and as a result the interaction between the soil and station structure would be more obvious i e the sb effect is more apparent in a word when d is small enough to make sb effect play a dominant role an increase in b would strengthen the barrier effect and thus the difference in maximum ground settlement for considering and without considering the barrier effect would be more apparent however when d is large enough e g d 40 m the δ vm2 δ vm1 gradually approaches to the line δ vm2 δ vm1 1 as b increases demonstrating that the barrier effect gets weaker as b becomes larger this is because the wb effect plays a leading role on this occasion and as indicated in section 4 1 2 the wb effect becomes weaker with the increase of b in summary when d is large enough to make wb effect play a dominant role an increase in b would weaken the barrier effect and thus the difference in maximum ground settlement for considering and without considering the barrier effect would be less apparent 4 2 3 maximum surface settlement behind the metro station as explained in section 4 2 1 there is another apparent settlement trough behind the metro station to further clarify the ground response behind the station another index of settlement ratio δ vm3 δ vm2 was defined as the ratio of the maximum surface settlement behind and in front of the station fig 14 presents the variation of δ vm3 δ vm2 with b for all the calculation cases regardless of h d and d δ vm3 δ vm2 is always smaller than 1 indicating that the surface settlement behind the station is always smaller than that in front of the station however δ vm3 δ vm2 grows nonlinearly with the increase of b grows slightly as h d increases and grows substantially as d gets smaller indicating that in a wider excavation or in the case with demand for deeper dewatering depth or in the case with smaller distance between the excavation and underground barrier the dewatering process would intensify the ground response behind the metro station on this occasion the monitoring area of the ground settlement should be enlarged to cover the location behind the underground barrier 4 2 4 maximum diaphragm wall deflection fig 15 plots the variations of δ hm2 δ hm1 with b for all the calculation cases where δ hm2 denotes the maximum diaphragm wall deflection induced by excavation dewatering with an adjacent metro station and δ hm1 denotes that without the station two main points can be obtained from fig 15 1 δ hm2 δ hm1 is always less than 1 indicating that the barrier effect of the existing metro station could limit the lateral movement of the diaphragm wall induced by excavation dewatering 2 the variations of δ hm2 δ hm1 with b for the cases with small and large d are diametrically opposed when d is small e g d 10 m δ hm2 δ hm1 gradually decreases as b increases however when d is large e g d 40 m δ hm2 δ hm1 generally increases as b increases the reason for this opposite response is as follows as explained in section 4 2 2 when d is small the sb effect would play a dominant role on this occasion an increase in b would strengthen the sb effect causing δ hm2 δ hm1 to gradually deviate from the line δ hm2 δ hm1 1 however when d is large the wb effect would play a dominant role on this occasion an increase in b would weaken the wb effect making δ hm2 δ hm1 gradually approaching to 1 4 2 5 relation between maximum surface settlement and maximum wall deflection fig 16 plots the relationship between the maximum surface settlement δ vm and the maximum diaphragm wall deflection δ hm for conveniently comparing with other studies δ vm and δ hm were standardized as δ vm h d and δ hm h d respectively two main points can be obtained from fig 16 1 δ vm mostly lies between δ vm 1 2δ hm and δ vm 2 8δ hm during excavation dewatering with δ vm varied from 0 044 h d to 0 113 h d and δ hm ranged from 0 023 h d to 0 066 h d the variation range of δ vm obtained in this study is basically within that monitored by zhang et al 2018 i e from δ vm δ hm to δ vm 10δ hm who also summarized the relation between δ vm and δ hm in an excavation case with a close hydraulic connection between the inside and outside of the excavation 2 for the cases with different d the variation range of δ vm is different when d is relatively large i e d 40 m δ vm is greater lies between δ vm 1 6δ hm and δ vm 2 8δ hm due to the wb effect aggravating the ground settlement on this occasion however when d is relatively small i e d 10 m δ vm is smaller lies between δ vm 1 2δ hm and δ vm 2δ hm due to the sb effect restricting the ground settlement at this point the variation range of δ vm and δ hm and their relation summarized in this study could provide reference for engineer to preliminary evaluate the dewatering induced δ vm and δ hm under similar strata distribution and similar barrier effect of adjacent underground structure 5 conclusions taking a metro station as a typical underground barrier this study conducted fe modellings to investigate its barrier effect performance and the corresponding behaviours of groundwater and soil during dewatering in adjacent large scale excavations several key influence factors like the excavation width b pumped depth h d and distance from metro station to excavation d were selected as changing parameters in the fe model to enrich the understanding of the groundwater and soil responses under barrier effect i e wb and sb effects with different intensity based on this study the following conclusions can be obtained 1 during dewatering in a wider excavation the induced wb effect would be less apparent and thus the overall water yield of the excavation q would be larger which leads to greater groundwater drawdown and differential drawdown on both sides of the metro station causing greater asymmetric water pressure laterally acting on the station structure possibly further incurring a rotation of the metro station towards the excavation in practice engineers should be highly concerned about the deformation monitoring of the metro station during dewatering in a wider excavation especially the excavation with a smaller distance to the metro station 2 whatever the b is q would be reduced by considering the barrier effect while in the meantime the groundwater drawdown would be enlarged indicating that the number of the designed pumping wells could be reduced to achieve the same dewatering effect which would be a useful and economic way in optimizing the excavation design in crowed urban area with extensive pre existing underground structures 3 whatever the b is two obvious ground settlement troughs one in front of the metro station and the other behind the station would appear outside the excavation during the dewatering inside the excavation the settlement behind the station is always smaller than that in front of the station with maximum varied from 0 044 h d to 0 113 h d but would be largely enlarged as b and h d increase and d decreases on this occasion the monitoring area of the ground settlement should be enlarged to cover the location behind the underground barrier 4 the parameter d greatly affect the ground behaviour ahead of the metro station when d is small say d 10 m sb effect is stronger than the wb effect and thus ground settlements are restricted however when d is large enough say d 40 m the sb effect would be weaker than wb effect thus inducing a greater settlement than that without station 5 unlike the effect of d the parameter b would not change the nature of the barrier effect but affect its intensity when d is small say d 10 m an increase in b would strengthen the barrier effect mainly the sb effect and thus the difference in maximum ground settlement with and without the barrier effect would be more apparent however when d is large say d 40 m an increase in b would weaken the barrier effect mainly the wb effect and thus the settlement difference would be less apparent designers should consider the barrier effect based on the practical d and b to realize the optimal design and meanwhile to prevent the appearance of unexpected large ground response during construction 6

2041,accurate estimates of reference evapotranspiration et0 are of great significance to water resources planning and management but the actual solar radiation rs as the primary parameter for et0 estimation is difficult to obtain directly in most areas thus studying the impacts of locally calibrated empirical solar radiation rs models to improve the accuracy of penman monteith pm is significant meanwhile swarm intelligence algorithms have proved their potential in the domains of agriculture and hydrology but few studies applied them in optimizing rs models to improve et0 estimation this study used the particle swarm optimization pso the gravitational search algorithm gsa and the mind evolutionary algorithm mea respectively to optimize the nine most common empirical rs models comprising three sunshine based models angstrom ögelman bahel three temperature based models hargreaves bristow campbell hunt and three combined based models fan chen el sebaii and then integrated them into the pm for et0 estimation at four climatic zones of china the results showed that the fan model obtained the most accurate rs estimates in china while the sunshine based and temperature based exerted significantly different applicability at different climatic zones regarding optimization algorithm this study found that gsa performed better for the ögelman model fan model and chen model when integrating into the pm equation for et0 estimation whereas mea performed better for the angstrom model hunt model and el sebaii model after optimization pmgsa fan obtained the most accurate estimates of et0 at four climatic zones with a regional spatial gradient in estimates accuracy of rs from north to south of china in terms of sunshine based models the pmmea angstrom performed better in tmz tcz and mpz whereas the pmgsa ögelman performed better in smz respectively in terms of temperature based models the pmmea hunt performed better in tmz and smz whereas the pmlsm hargreaves performed better in tcz and mpz respectively overall this study identifies the optimal rs estimation model and optimization algorithm for et0 estimation at four climatic zones which provide

function 1 introduction reference evapotranspiration et0 is an essential component in hydrological ecological processes and agricultural water management which is defined as the rate of evapotranspiration et from a hypothetical reference crop with an assumed crop height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 allen et al 1998 in the agro ecosystems et0 is most frequently utilized for calculating et through food and agriculture organization fao crop coefficient method kool et al 2014 thus accurate estimation of et0 is vital in improving irrigation efficiency water reuse and drainage control shiri et al 2014 however direct et0 measurement by experimental techniques methods is less practicability high commission and time consuming torres and calera 2010 xing et al 2022a it is necessary to develop an alternative mathematical method for accurately estimating et0 with reasonable precision and high stability in recent decades numerous models have been developed for computing et0 at various climates among which the fao 56 pm model is recommended as the sole standard model for et0 estimation by the fao of the united nations allen et al 1998 the pm model was developed based on the energy balance and aerodynamic principles and its reliability has been demonstrated in different climates because it considers all factors that affect the evapotranspiration process feng et al 2016 tabari et al 2013 the main disadvantage of the pm model is that it requires many climatic variables i e maximum air temperature tmax minimum air temperature tmin wind speed u relative humidity rh and solar radiation rs that might be missing or unavailable in some regions thereby limiting its application throughout mainland china however 752 national meteorological stations measure tmax tmin wind speed sunshine duration and rh but only 122 stations produce daily rs data directly thus many studies have explored alternative models for concisely estimating rs with reasonable precision and high stability using readily accessible meteorological variables at present the existing empirical rs models can be categorized as sunshine based temperature based cloudiness based models and combined based models fan et al 2018b although the angstrom prescott model based on sunshine duration data prescott 1940 is the priority recommended by fao 56 allen et al 1998 it still should be noted that the accuracy of different rs models can vary significantly and the performance of the most commonly used rs models in the complex climatic zones of china deserves more attention liu et al 2012 furthermore previous studies have demonstrated that the empirical parameters of rs models are site specific and they should be calibrated specifically liu et al 2009b gocic et al 2016 analyzed the effect of rs on daily et0 in serbia and the result showed that significant differences exist in the different empirical rs models yin et al 2008 stated that the rs is an important and site specific component to determine et0 and they concluded that the et0 would be overestimated by about 27 if no local calibration is performed yang et al 2021 further found that the estimation accuracy of et0 was significant influenced by the empirical parameters a b in the angstrom prescott method against the background of numerous climate types in china feng et al 2020 utilized daily rs measurements to locally calibrate the parameters of the nineteen empirical rs model and they found that calibration of empirical parameters improved the prediction accuracy of rs which can provide crucial information for the et0 estimation liu et al 2012 assessed seven locally calibrated angstrom prescott models at 80 meteorological stations in china and found that the error of the best performing model was related to the empirical parameters with altitude with 2 mj m 2 d 1 at 89 of the stations in addition studies have investigated the effects of optimized rs models on accurate et0 estimation tabari et al 2015 investigated the applicability of 12 different rs models and their effects on daily et0 calculation using the pm model under cool arid and semi arid climates of iran and they found that the locally calibrated rs models provided more accurate et0 estimation thus enormous studies that have been conducted highlighted the importance of using locally calibrated rs models for et0 estimation although the optimized mathematical models obtain superior accuracy compared with the original versions the accuracy of various parameter optimization methods differs significantly garg 2009 panda and padhy 2008 wang et al 2009 the recent boom in swarm intelligence algorithms has advanced studies in the domains of agriculture and hydrology alizadeh et al 2021 bai and gao 2021 chen et al 2020b and the existing swarm intelligence optimization algorithms can be categorized as biology based physics based and sociology based bohaienko et al 2021 used particle swarm optimization pso to identify the parameters in the water transport model and they found that using the optimized parameters could significantly increase the accuracy of simulations bohaienko et al 2021 used particle swarm optimization pso to identify the parameters in the water transport model and they found that using the optimized parameters could significantly increase the accuracy of simulations naserbegi et al 2018 proposed the gravitational search algorithm gsa for the exergy optimization of the bushehr nuclear power plant bnpp and the exergy destruction in the bnpp with the application of the gsa is minimized and the optimum operating parameters in desired streams dong et al 2022 proposed a mind evolutionary algorithm mea to calibrate seven empirical et0 models at 100 meteorological stations in china and they found the calibrated were significantly better than the original models the concern is justified regarding the performance of swarm intelligence optimization algorithms to calibrated rs models for et0 estimation since the great successful application achieved by the above research but little was reported in such field moreover it is generally considered that using estimates rather than data measurements to compute rs might lead to specific errors in et0 estimation liu et al 2009b liu et al 2012 nwokolo et al 2022 yang et al 2021 but it is still necessary to investigate how the performance of the pm model might be affected by using various rs models at different climate zones in china in addition recalibrated rs models may be closer to the measured rs but they are still affected by the performance of the optimization algorithms employed fan et al 2020 garg 2009 wu et al 2022b however few studies have applied the optimal empirical parameters in rs models using intelligent optimization algorithms although they have been applied successfully in many cases thus comparative studies are urgently required to assess the performance of various rs models optimized by intelligent optimization algorithms for estimating et0 integrated with pm at different climatic zones of china therefore the objectives of the present study were 1 to determine the spatiotemporal variations in the annual average meteorological variables i e air temperature ta wind speed at 2 m above ground level u2 rh precipitation pre rs and et0 2 to conduct national scale assessments of nine typical rs models comprising three sunshine based models three temperature based models and three combined based models for estimating rs across four climatic zones in china and 3 to evaluate the effectiveness of optimization using the pso gsa and mea algorithms on the et0 estimates obtained by the hybrid pm equations which integrated with optimized rs models at four climatic zones in china finally the most recommended hybrid pm equations which were integrated with optimized rs models will be given at four climatic zones of china in this study 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the four main climatic zones in china fan et al 2016 are the temperate monsoon zone tmz temperate continental zone tcz mountain plateau zone mpz and subtropical monsoon zone smz respectively fig 1 tmz tcz mpz and smz can be generally grouped as semi humid arid semi arid and humid areas with mean annual precipitation amounts of 560 mm 194 mm 433 mm and 1320 mm respectively and annual pan evaporation amounts of 1475 mm 2148 mm 1883 mm and 1545 mm more average annual meteorological characteristic value see table s1 2 2 data collection measurements of rs were started in 1957 by the china meteorology administration cma initially 122 national meteorological stations collected rs measurements however the cma introduced a new type of radiometer for acquiring rs measurements and 95 stations have collected these data since 1994 tang et al 2018 yang et al 2015 according to yang et al 2015 the replacement of the rs instruments resulted in a shift in the rs data 1 4 0 5 mj m 2 d 1 thus considering the availability and continuity of data only the daily meteorological data collected during 1994 2016 were used in this study see table s1 for information about the national meteorological stations comprising tmin tmax and average air temperature ta sunshine duration n rh wind speed at 10 m height u10 and actual rs these variables were measured following the guidelines of the world meteorological organization and the cma conducted preliminary quality control of the data before providing the data to users liu et al 2009b further quality control of the data was also conducted according to the schemes described by liu et al 2009b and the average omission rate of the meteorological dataset in this study was 3 2 2 3 penman monteith equation according to fao

models and three combined based models were selected for estimating rs due to their broad applicability detailed introduction of these rs models are described as follows 2 4 1 sunshine based model angstrom model angstrom prescott model proposed by angstrom 1924 is the most commonly utilized sunshine based model which related the ratio of rs and clear sky radiation rs0 to the relative sunshine duration n n due to the unavailability of rs0 in many regions throughout the world prescott 1940 developed the angstrom prescott model which is the most commonly utilized sunshine based model abbreviated as m1 3 r s a b n n r a where rs is the global solar radiation mj m 2 d 1 n is the sunshine duration h n is the maximum possible sunshine duration h a and b are empirical parameters ögelman model ögelman et al 1984 correlated rs with n by utilizing a maximum likelihood quadratic fit and then established the following equation abbreviated as m2 4 r s a b n n c n n 2 r a where a b and c are empirical parameters bahel model bahel et al 1987 proposed and developed the bahel model abbreviated as m3 5 r s a b n n c n n 2 d n n 3 r a where a b c and d are empirical parameters 2 4 2 temperature based model sunshine based models are considered the better accurate empirical models but sunshine duration observation data are not readily available in many regions throughout the world thus it is preferable to determine the empirical correlations between rs and other reliably measured meteorological variables in particular the average air temperature ta is one of the most widely measured meteorological variables in most areas and thus many efforts hitherto have been made to estimate rs using temperature based models hargreaves model the most commonly utilized temperature based model is the hargreaves model abbreviated as m4 which was proposed by hargreaves and samani 1982 and considered rs as a function of ra and δt 6 r s a δ t b r a where δt is the diurnal temperature range δt tmax tmin c a and b are empirical parameters bristow campbell model bristow and campbell 1984 implemented an exponential function to correlate rs and the diurnal temperature range and established the following model abbreviated as m5 7 r s a 1 exp b δ t c r a where a b and c are empirical parameters hunt model hunt et al 1998 calibrated the hargreaves model and presented the model in an additive equation abbreviated as m6 8 r s a δ t r a b where a and b are empirical parameters 2 4 3 combined based model combined based models generally compute rs by combining the sunshine duration or air temperature with other common meteorological variables the following three typical combined based models were selected in this study fan model fan et al 2018b jointly combined the effects of pre and ta on rs and then established the fan model abbreviated as m7 9 r s a b n n c d ln δ t e l n pre 1 f t a r a where pre is the average precipitation mm d 1 a b c d e and f are empirical parameters chen model chen et al 2004 considered that rs has a powerful correlation with the relative sunshine n n and a logarithmic correlation with δt and established the following complex model abbreviated as m8 10 r s a b n n c d ln δ t r a where a b c and d are empirical parameters el sebaii model el sebaii et al 2009 proposed the following simple new method abbreviated as m9 for estimating rs based on ta rh and ra 11 r s a b t a c r h r a where a b and c are empirical parameters 2 5 swarm intelligent optimization algorithms in order to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of swarm intelligent optimization algorithms on the et0 estimates obtained by the hybrid pm equations which are integrated with rs models this study applied biology based pso physics based gsa and sociology based mea algorithms to calibrate the empirical parameters of rs models before building hybrid pm equations and compared them the least squares method lsm as with original version in et0 estimation flowcharts illustrating the optimization algorithms comprising pso gsa and mea are shown in fig 2 2 5 1 pso algorithm the pso algorithm was developed by kennedy and eberhart 1995 based on population foraging the pso is essentially an improved genetic algorithm that can achieve global optimization more rapidly wu et al 2021b by randomly initializing an initial population comprising n particles in the feasible solution region with dimension d and random initial velocity each particle is a potential solution to the problem i e the fitness value determined by the fitness function the directions of motion and distances of each of the particles in the multi dimensional search space are determined by their velocity and the velocity is affected by inertia in each iteration the algorithm iteratively updates the position and velocity of each particle based on the personal extremum pbest and global extremum gbest li et al 2022 the mathematical process conducted by the pso algorithm is described as follows 12 v i t 1 v i t c 1 r 1 p b e s t i x i c 2 r 2 g b e s t i x i 13 x i t 1 x i t v i t 1 where i 1 2 n t is the current iterative algebra c1 and c2 are acceleration parameters indicating the degree of particle social learning and self learning respectively and r1 and r2 are random numbers from 0 1 additional instructions pbest records the optimal historical information for each particle during flight and gbest is the optimal solution information for the whole population in the search process during the continuous iteration process individual particles update their own velocity value vi according to their own historical optimization and global optimization of the population and then change xi the fitness value f xi of the objective function is then calculated when the fitness value is better than the fitness value of the historical optimal solution the historical optimal solution pbesti is updated when the fitness value is better than the fitness value of the global optimal solution the values of pbesti and gbesti are updated for further details please refer to the study by wu et al 2021a 2 5 2 gsa algorithm the gsa algorithm was proposed by rashedi et al 2009 based on the law of universal gravitation newton s second law and the phenomenon that allows particles to attract each other by force in the gsa the solution to the optimization problem is regarded as a group of particles in space and these search particles gather together due to the force received by each other the motions of the particles follow the dynamic law where particles with large inertial mass move slower than particles with small inertial mass therefore matter moves toward the particles with large inertial mass and the particles with the largest inertial mass occupy the optimal position in order to obtain the optimal solution of the problem suppose that there are n particles in the independent system the position of the ith particle i 1 2 n is defined as x i x i 1 x i 2 x i d x i n and x i d is the position of the ith particle in the d dimensional space position updating and acceleration are expressed as 14 v i d t 1 r a

the sum of the forces on it from other particles a i d t is the acceleration of the ith particle at time t in the d dimensional space and m i d t is the inertial mass of the ith particle for further details please refer to the study by aghaie and mahmoudi 2016 2 5 3 mea algorithm the mea algorithm imitates the evolutionary process of human thinking through a convergence and divergence process which overcomes the shortcomings of the genetic algorithm but also integrates the advantages of the genetic algorithm and evolutionary strategy wang et al 2018 the mea optimization process can be summarized as three basic links individual learning group cooperation and competitive innovation where individual learning represents the behavior of individuals learning from each other in the optimization process group cooperation represents the individuals with better information exchange and promotion of the whole group and competitive innovation represents population renewal and the development of new individuals the mathematical description of the unified mea framework is as follows 17 mea p o p s t c o c r α β γ t where pop is the population st represents individual learning α

population at time t and α t represents the information required to determine a specific learning strategy at time t the group cooperation link can be mathematically described as co p o p t β t where pop t represents a new set of individuals generated after individual learning at time t and β t represents the information required to determine the cooperation strategy of a specific group at t time based on the individual learning and group cooperation links new individuals can be generated from old individuals therefore 18 p op t c o s t p op α t β t where p op t represents the set of new individuals at time t i e the population generated by the intermediate operation process the process based on reusing competitive innovation to produce the next generation of the population can be mathematically described as follows 19 p op t 1 c r p o p t φ t where φ t represents the information required to determine a specific competitive innovation strategy at t time population renewal for each generation under the unified mea framework can be mathematically described as follows 20 p op t 1 c r c o s t p op α t 1 β t 1 φ t 1 2 6 spatiotemporal variation analysis method 2 6 1 mann

first part of the data 1994 2010 was used to locally determine the empirical parameters for each selected rs model and the second part of the data 2011 2016 was utilized to assess the performance of calibrated rs models and hybrid pm equations according to martí et al 2015 and chen et al 2022 calculated et0 is acceptable with the lack of experimental measurement on this assertion we treated et0 values calculated by the pm equations and measured rs as the standard values benchmark when evaluating the empirical rs models and their corresponding hybrid pm equations statistical accuracy

temperature based models at tmz and smz with the corresponding median value of r2 nse and rmse being better than that of the hargreaves model by 2 0 3 2 22 5 446 7 and 4 1 4 8 and of bristow campbell model by 16 9 34 2 196 1 358 0 and 16 0 18 5 respectively in terms of tcz and mpz the result showed the hargreaves was the most recommended temperature based rs model and the median values of r2 nse and rmse were improved by 1 6 8 7 6 4 31 6 and 7 2 10 9 at tcz and 24 3 34 1 42 4 45 6 and 20 9 23 0 at smz respectively under a similar reason as the previous section fig 5 listed the violin plots of r2 nse and rmse of the hybrid pm model integrated with recommended temperature based rs models which were calibrated by lsm pso gsa and mea for estimating et0 at four climatic zones however there was no significant difference found in the statistical accuracy indicators obtained by different algorithms in optimizing hargreaves for et0 estimation integrated with the pm equation table 2 hence this study accepted its original version lsm hargreaves as the recommended temperature based rs model to replace measured rs when the temperature data was left only at tcz and mpz and the median values of r2 nse and rmse obtained by pm lsm hargreaves was 0 88 0 86 and 0 68 mm d 1 at tcz and 0 78 0 74 and 0 61 mm d 1 at mpz respectively regarding the tmz and smz mea was more applicable to optimizing hunt for et0 estimation and the improvement values of r2 nse and rmse obtained by pmmea hunt ranged from 9 2 to 26 5 11 3 25 4 and 10 0 23 9 at tmz and 5 0 25 9 9 7 39 0 and 4 8 24 5 at smz respectively in summary pm mea hunt was the best hybrid pm model which integrated with the optimized temperature based rs model at tmz and smz respectively however there was no necessity in optimizing pmhargreaves for et0 estimation which was recommended at tcz and mpz 3 4 accuracy performance of combined based models as shown in table 1 the accuracy of three combined based models using different combinations of meteorological variables existed a significant difference in estimating rs and the accuracy can be ranked based on gpi from best to worst as fan model el sebaii model and chen model compared to el sebaii model the improvement values r2 nse and rmse obtained by the fan model were 4 1 8 6 5 3 10 3 and 6 9 30 1 at four climatic zones respectively in terms of comparison between the fan model and the chen model the improvement values r2 nse and rmse obtained by the fan model were 3 3 24 2 2 8 32 7 and 20 9 47 8 at four climatic zones respectively since the combined based models were not mutually replaceable because of the different requirements for meteorological data the accuracy performance of pmfan pmchen and pmel sebaii had high application significance in different scenarios of data acquisition fig 6 depicts the box plots of r2 nse and rmse of the hybrid pm model integrated with the combined based rs models which were calibrated by lsm pso gsa and mea for estimating et0 at four climatic zones of china as shown in fig 6 pmgsa fan was the best hybrid pm equation integrated with the optimized combined based model for et0 estimation with the corresponding median value of r2 nse and rmse were 0 94 0 92 and 0 48 mm d 1 at tmz 0 93 0 91 and 0 56 mm d 1 at tcz 0 89 0 86 and 0 51 mm d 1 at mpz and 0 86 0 82 and 0 67 mm d 1 at smz respectively moreover the most recommended optimization algorithms for the chen model and el sebaii model were gsa and mea at four climatic zones of china respectively compared to pmgsa chen the corresponding median value of rmse obtained by pmgsa fan was improved by 1 9 6 3 8 7 and 10 4 at tmz tcz mpz and smz respectively while the values of r2 and nse didn t show significant differences between them compared to pmmea el sebaii the corresponding median value of r2 nse and rmse obtained by pmgsa fan were improved by 2 1 3 2 and 35 3 at tmz 2 8 3 6 and 51 3 at tcz 7 9 10 1 and 38 3 at mpz and 5 9 12 8 and 48 2 at smz respectively in summary pmgsa fan was the best hybrid pm model integrated with the optimized combined based rs model at four climatic zones and the most recommended optimization algorithms for the chen model and el sebaii model were gsa and mea at four climatic zones of china respectively moreover the accuracy of the hybrid pm models integrated with the optimized combined based models can be ranked based on gpi from best to worst as pmgsa fan pmmea el sebaii and pmgsa chen 3 5 cross comparison among three types of models despite both advantages and disadvantages being obvious in different types of empirical rs models for et0 estimation when integrated with the pm equation the accuracy improvement effect of optimization algorithms was also significant thus it is necessary to make a cross comparison among three types of empirical rs models for et0 estimation as shown in table 2 before being optimized by the intelligent optimization algorithm the pmlsm el sebaii achieved the best performance table 2 with the median values of r2 nse and rmse ranging from 0 91 to 0 96 0 86 0 95 and 0 38 0 52 mm d 1 at four climatic zones respectively but beyond that a significant phenomenon existed that not more complex rs models present a better performance in et0 estimation when integrated with the pm equation for example pmlsm chen which was established based on the n n and δt exerted a poorer performance than the pmlsm angstrom and pmlsm hunt at tmz and tcz and the corresponding gpi values were improved by 53 0 60 6 and 29 3 103 3 respectively after optimization despite all hybrid pm models being improved significantly three combined based exert better performance than sunshine based and temperature based table 2 compared to pmlsm angstrom which is recommended by fao the median r2 nse and rmse of pmmea angstrom improved by 22 9 25 4 24 7 27 6 and 22 1 28 2 respectively furthermore the median r2 of pmgsa fan pmgsa chen and pmmea el sebaii increased by 32 3 46 6 31 9 44 6 and 32 1 44 8 compared to pmlsm angstrom respectively a similar result can be gained from nse that the corresponding improvement values were 35 9 54 4 35 4 52 0 and 35 6 52 3 respectively regarding rmse the improvement values of the pmgsa fan pmgsa chen and pmmea el sebaii were 66 0 70 1 63 8 67 2 and 64 7 68 8 respectively moreover although hybrid pm integrated with temperature based rs models achieved the poorest performance for et0 estimation after optimization the differences between temperature based and sunshine based were also narrowed and the corresponding values of r2 nse and rmse were improved by 14 0 16 5 14 8 16 2 and 14 8 17 2 respectively compared to pmlsm angstrom fig 7 illustrated the spatial distribution of accuracy statistical indicators obtained by hybrid pm equations integrated with the optimized rs models for estimating et0 at four climatic zones of china as shown in fig 7a 7c the hybrid pm integrated with the optimized sunshine based rs model manifested a relatively good performance throughout china r2 0 65 nse 0 50 and rmse 0 34 mm d 1 respectively and the worst accuracy appeared at the southwestern tmz northwestern tcz and southeastern mpz respectively in terms of hybrid pm integrated with the optimized temperature based rs model the accuracy of which exhibited a significant spatial gradient in china from north to south of china as shown in fig 7d 7f where the r2 nse and rmse values for the models ranged among 0 24 0 95 2 12 0 95 and 0 46 1 15 mm d 1 respectively as expected the hybrid pm integrated with the optimized combined based rs model obtained excellent performance throughout china and the pmgsa fan achieved the best national performance in et0 estimation r2 0 92 nse 0 88 and rmse 0 15 mm d 1 respectively however the regional spatial gradient was also significant that the r2 nse and rmse values decreased from north to south of china and the major worst performance existed at the smz on the whole the combined based hybrid pm models were superior to others regionally and nationally moreover sunshine based hybrid pm models were more suitable for tcz and smz while temperature based ones were more recommended in the north of china in summary the estimation accuracy of hybrid pm equations was not only related to the complexity of the model but also significantly affected by the optimization algorithms after optimization the accuracy of the hybrid pm equation integrated with the optimized rs models can be ranked based on gpi from best to worst as combined based sunshine based and temperature based hybrid pm equations respectively 4 discussion 4 1 accuracy discrepancies among different empirical rs models rs is strongly affected by atmospheric extinction and atmospheric extinction is related to air density and atmospheric thickness vignola et al 2012 oyewola et al 2022 calculated rs in the fiji islands from 1984 to 1998 using an empirical formula and found that the accuracy of sunshine based models was higher than that of temperature based models feng et al 2020 explained that sunshine based models obtained better results because the relative sunshine duration n n is used to express the cloudiness of the atmosphere nwokolo et al 2022 calculated rs in nigeria from 1985 to 2016 and they also concluded that the accuracy of the angstrom prescott model sunshine based model was higher than those of other models similarly this study also found sunshine based empirical models performed better than temperature based models at four climatic zones of china with corresponding gpi index values increased by 121 7 304 0 108 7 633 3 75 9 304 0 and 42 1 274 2 respectively table 1 in addition it should be noted that the sunshine based rs models performance is more sensitive to model structure presumably because correct mapping path is more important than mapping complexity feng et al 2020 the result found by this study confirmed this assertion that simpler sunshine based rs model angstrom model linear function of n n achieved better performance table 2 with the corresponding gpi value increased by 1 3 33 3 3 0 77 8 and 15 1 37 8 compared to ögelman model quadratic function of n n and bahel model cubic function of n n although sunshine based rs models provide more accurate results compared with other models temperature based models can be recommended as widely used alternative methods because air temperature data are more available than sunshine data fan et al 2018a used 20 temperature based empirical models to estimate rs in humid regions of china and concluded that temperature based models can be applied for daily global rs estimation with higher accuracy in the humid subtropical and tropical regions of china liu et al 2009a assessed 16 rs models including modified versions of the bristow campbell and hargreaves models across a wide range of agro ecological conditions in china and indicated that the rs estimates based on the daily air temperature were stable and robust bellido jiménez et al 2021 calculated rs at nine sites in southern spain and north carolina using the hargreaves samani and bristow campbell and the accuracy of the models improved after parameter calibration in this study the local calibrated temperature based models can provide reasonable results with the r2 nse and rmse values of the most suitable temperature based ranging from 0 65 to 0 75 0 42 0 67 and 3 65 4 52 mj m 2 d 1 respectively at four climatic zones of china considering structure similarity and accuracy discrepancy between hargreaves model tmz and smz and hunt model tcz and mpz we can speculatively conclude that temperature based models performance may be sensitive to climatic environments in the present study we further found that combined based models which considered precipitation or rh data generally obtained better estimates than the single sunshine based and temperature based models with the r2 nse and rmse values improved up to 81 3 277 3 and 28 9 respectively table 1 it is presumably because the models that included these meteorological variables better represented the effect of atmospheric extinction on rs chen et al 2004 nwokolo et al 2022 saud et al 2020 similar results also were obtained by fan et al 2018b that the combined based models could be better applied for daily global rs estimation with high accuracy after the comparison between sunshine based models and combined empirical models for estimating the daily horizontal global rs in humid regions of china similarly feng et al 2020 developed seven sunshine based models nine temperature based models and three combined based models for predicting rs in china and they found that the combined based models generally obtained the most accurate predictions thus we can conclude that the estimation accuracy of rs models is also inclined to meteorological independent variables however not always more complex empirical rs models obtained more accurate results than the simple ones based on the same meteorological variables when using the same meteorological data thereby indicating that the performance of the models was also sensitive to the model structure a more sophisticated model structure might explain more of the processes involved but increasing the number of parameters that need to be calibrated could also make them more susceptible to overfitting chen et al 2020a li et al 2015 wu et al 2022b similarly makade and jamil 2018 applied 10 different statistical error tests to compare 300 existing sunshine based models in india and found significant differences in the accuracy of the models due to their structures fan et al 2018a applied 20 temperature based empirical models for estimating rs in humid regions of china and they recommended their proposed novel model for estimating rs with acceptable accuracy when only air temperatures are available to summarize the accuracy of rs models for estimating solar radiation is sensitive to factors such as model structure climatic environment and meteorological independent variables therefore these factors should be taken into account when selecting the most appropriate model for estimating solar radiation at the four climatic zones in china 4 2 accuracy discrepancies among different optimization algorithms a modeling approach simplifies or approximates processes for estimating rs so empirical models will differ significantly from the actual problem presumably because of numerous assumptions and approximations sarker and newton 2007 these differences may lead to sophisticated models that include many mechanistic processes and empirical parameters using many empirical parameters generally leads to greater adaptability and the model may be closer to the real system but the problem of parameter acquisition could be exacerbated moreover problems such as correlations between parameters non uniqueness ill posedness and parameter equivalence will lead to the production of non unique empirical parameter estimates using traditional methods birdi et al 2021 bugajny and furmańczyk 2022 kovács and fekete 2019 mbonimpa et al 2015 tang et al 2018 and it is impossible to prove whether an empirical rs model gets the local optimal value intelligent optimization algorithms can effectively obtain unique globally optimal parameter estimates for mathematical models garcia and lôndero 2021 jiang et al 2021 mohanty et al 2017 saud et al 2020 used the k fold cross validation approach to optimize 25 empirical rs models for india from 1986 to 2000 and they found that the accuracy of the model was greatly improved wu et al 2022a used the whale optimization algorithm woa to optimize twelve empirical et0 models to improve estimates accuracy and the prediction accuracy of optimized temperature radiation and hybrid model was improved by 12 05 11 06 and 10 46 respectively however most previous studies hitherto applied the intelligent optimization algorithms to improve empirical et0 or rs models directly few research considered the effect of optimized empirical rs models on the accuracy improvement of et0 estimates in the present study we found that the et0 estimates improved significantly using the pm equation integrated with the empirical rs model which optimized by the most recommended intelligent optimization algorithms table 2 and the corresponding r2 nse and rmse values improved by 3 13 69 0 3 16 75 0 and 22 0 72 0 respectively compared to their original version furthermore the results showed that the mea was more suitable for optimizing the empirical parameters in the angstrom model hunt model and el sebaii model table 2 because these equations belong to low dimensional problems and the mea algorithm overcomes the shortcomings of ga and evolutionary strategies by transforming single layer population evolution into multi layer population evolution through its unique convergence and divergence processes to improve the global search efficiency of the algorithm dong et al 2022 however in the face of high dimensional problems the optimization strategy of the mea algorithm limits the optimization effect of ögelman fan and chen the search space of gsa grew exponentially with the size of the problem owing to the algorithm using gravity as a tool for information transmission which can efficiently realize optimal information sharing among individuals therefore this algorithm achieved better optimization effect when dealing with high dimensional problems rashedi et al 2009 wang et al 2021 moreover the information interaction process in gsa optimal algorithm not only spreads information within the group but also all individuals within the group can process information and change their search behavior according to the information they get so that the entire group can emerge some abilities and characteristics that individual individuals do not have ezzat et al 2021 mahmoudi and aghaie 2019 that is although individual behavior is simple in the group individuals can solve the overall goal through the interaction of the information they get and the spread of information in the whole group enables the problem to be solved more effectively than that solved by a single individual garg 2019 su et al 2021 the result of this study further confirmed these conclusions that the r2 nse and rmse values of pmgsa ögelman pmgsa fan and pmgsa chen were improved by 4 21 12 8 4 26 26 0 and 15 0 58 0 compared to pmmea ögelman pmmea fan and pmmea chen respectively table 2 to summarize despite the intelligent optimization algorithms having a higher capacity for parameter optimization in the et0 estimates using the pm equation which is integrated with the rs model compared with the traditional methods it is still necessary to select an optimal algorithm for each specific rs model by considering the model structure and algorithm characteristics 4 3 accuracy discrepancies among hybrid pm integrated with different rs models many studies have investigated alternative models for concisely estimating rs with reasonable precision and high stability using readily available meteorological variables fan et al 2018b feng et al 2020 rehman 1998 song et al 2020 sun et al 2015 trnka et al 2005 zhang et al 2021 however few studies have investigated the effects of optimizing rs models using swarm intelligent optimization algorithms on the accuracy of et0 estimates when integrated with the pm equation even though tabari et al 2015 have proved that the average accuracy of the et0 estimates increased by using 12 calibrated rs models and analyzed their effects on daily et0 calculation with the pm model in cool arid and semi arid climate areas of iran in the present study evaluations were conducted to determine the effects of the optimized empirical rs models when using the hybrid pm model for estimating et0 at four climatic zones of china and differences in accuracy were found between the optimized rs models for estimating et0 in particular the hybrid pm model integrated with combined rs models generally obtained better estimates than the single sunshine based models and temperature based models thereby indicating that introducing other variables into the models could improve their performance when estimating et0 at four climatic zones in china the results obtained in this study also showed that the hybrid pm models integrated with the optimized fan model chen model and el sebaii model were suitable for estimating et0 throughout china thereby demonstrating the broad applicability of combined rs models across various climatic zones in china the reason is that the rs is the main driving force of evapotranspiration and rs is strongly affected by atmospheric extinction which is related to the air density and atmospheric thickness bai and zong 2021 carra et al 2018 ma et al 2018 also concluded that the ta rh and rs are the main reasons for the variations in et0 which implied the importance of these meteorological data to the et0 estimation wang and zheng 2022 further proved that rs rh and pre exerted an overall stronger influence on et0 r2 0 50 than other factors therefore the accuracy of the et0 estimates improved after introducing rh and pre data into the pm model in this study thus more accurate et0 estimates could be obtained by considering additional atmospheric data such as the cloudiness value aerosols and vapor pressure deficit but except that the sunshine based models and temperature based models exert higher potential to replace combined models when integrating them into the pm for et0 estimation because of their less metrological data requirement and acceptable estimation accuracy as shown in table 2 the median values of r2 nse and rmse obtained by the hybrid pm which were integrated with the optimized sunshine based models ranged from 0 83 to 0 92 0 80 0 90 and 0 54 059 mm d 1 respectively moreover the median values of r2 nse and rmse obtained by the hybrid pm which were integrated with the optimized temperature based model which merely used temperature data as input ranged from 0 77 to 0 88 0 66 0 86 and 0 61 0 78 mm d 1 respectively as recommended by allen et al 1998 the sunshine based rs model was the most mainstream alternative method currently which has been successfully applicated in many research fan et al 2018b nwokolo et al 2022 yin et al 2008 this study further found the sunshine based rs model can be improved significantly by the intelligent optimization algorithm which was used to build the hybrid pm equation and the accuracy difference between the two types of hybrid pm models was not very obvious r2 10 at tmz tcz and smz and nearly 15 at mpz compared to combined based models moreover although temperature based rs models achieved the poorest performance for et0 estimation when integrated with pm the characteristic of minimum data requirement gives it a stronger application in china s vast climate changing regions qiu et al 2022 comprehensively reviewed 82 temperature based models for estimating daily rs using only temperature data and the results showed that these models can be successfully applied to predict daily rs in china with forecast temperature data for a lead time of 1 8 days ihaddadene et al 2019 used seven temperature based empirical models to estimate the daily average global solar radiation on the horizontal surface and the result suggested that the daily global solar radiation can be estimated successfully using only extreme air temperatures in south algeria furthermore significant spatial discrepancies exist in the accuracy performance of et0 estimation obtained by the hybrid pm equations across china deep seated reasons can be drawn from similar research about rs estimation using limited meteorological features specifically except for a relatively good estimation performance this study found the worst accuracy obtained by the hybrid pm equations integrated with sunshine based rs models appeared at the southwestern tmz northwestern tcz and southeastern mpz respectively fig 7a 7c which is presumably because that clearness index significantly affects the et0 estimation through rs estimation fan et al 2019 insisted that the sunshine based rs models performed similarly to the clearness index correlated ones on a daily basis while the clearness index exerted the same variety rule as our research on the other hand this study found that the estimation accuracy of temperature based hybrid pm exhibited a significant spatial gradient in china from north to south of china fig 7d 7f which was similar to the conclusion drawn by liu et al 2009a found that the accuracy of the temperature based rs models was affected mainly by the daily range of air temperature compared to the rs estimated models using limited input the combined based rs model contains more useful meteorological information which can be flexibly adjusted to cope with complex environmental features through appropriate parameter optimization to show national stability and high estimation accuracy across china fig 7g 7o and this conclusion is well supported by similar research results drawn by feng et al 2020 who concluded that more meteorological input improved the prediction accuracy of rs by providing more crucial information thus regardless of the availability of data at four climatic zones of china the most recommended radiation models which were integrated into the pm equation for estimating et0 ranked combined based sunshine based and temperature based rs models respectively but both the different types of rs models had their obvious advantages and disadvantages for et0 estimation and the estimated model was suggested to be selected by comprehensively considering the accuracy of the empirical model and the availability of meteorological data 5 conclusion in the present study particle swarm optimization pso gravitational search algorithm gsa and mind evolutionary algorithm mea were used to optimize sunshine based models temperature based models and combined based rs models respectively before integrating them into pm equations for estimating et0 at four climatic zones of china the main conclusions based on the results obtained in this study can be summarized as follows fan model manifested the best accurate estimates among the nine empirical rs models across the four climatic zones of china among the sunshine based models the angstrom model performed better in tmz tcz and mpz whereas ögelman performed better in smz respectively among the temperature based models the hunt model performed better in tmz and smz whereas the hargreaves model performed better in tcz and mpz respectively gsa performed better for the hybrid pm equations which were integrated with the ögelman model fan model and chen model whereas mea performed better for the hybrid pm equations which were integrated with the angstrom model hunt model and el sebaii model respectively moreover there was no difference in their optimum performance for the hybrid pm equation which was integrated with the hargreaves model after optimization pmgsa fan achieved the most accurate estimates of et0 at four climatic zones and the accuracy of the hybrid pm equations integrated with the optimized rs models can be ranked from best to worst as combined based sunshine based and temperature based hybrid pm equations respectively credit authorship contribution statement liwen xing conceptualization methodology software writing

2041,accurate estimates of reference evapotranspiration et0 are of great significance to water resources planning and management but the actual solar radiation rs as the primary parameter for et0 estimation is difficult to obtain directly in most areas thus studying the impacts of locally calibrated empirical solar radiation rs models to improve the accuracy of penman monteith pm is significant meanwhile swarm intelligence algorithms have proved their potential in the domains of agriculture and hydrology but few studies applied them in optimizing rs models to improve et0 estimation this study used the particle swarm optimization pso the gravitational search algorithm gsa and the mind evolutionary algorithm mea respectively to optimize the nine most common empirical rs models comprising three sunshine based models angstrom ögelman bahel three temperature based models hargreaves bristow campbell hunt and three combined based models fan chen el sebaii and then integrated them into the pm for et0 estimation at four climatic zones of china the results showed that the fan model obtained the most accurate rs estimates in china while the sunshine based and temperature based exerted significantly different applicability at different climatic zones regarding optimization algorithm this study found that gsa performed better for the ögelman model fan model and chen model when integrating into the pm equation for et0 estimation whereas mea performed better for the angstrom model hunt model and el sebaii model after optimization pmgsa fan obtained the most accurate estimates of et0 at four climatic zones with a regional spatial gradient in estimates accuracy of rs from north to south of china in terms of sunshine based models the pmmea angstrom performed better in tmz tcz and mpz whereas the pmgsa ögelman performed better in smz respectively in terms of temperature based models the pmmea hunt performed better in tmz and smz whereas the pmlsm hargreaves performed better in tcz and mpz respectively overall this study identifies the optimal rs estimation model and optimization algorithm for et0 estimation at four climatic zones which provide regionally and nationally accurate water consumption information without actual measured rs in china keywords intelligence optimization algorithm combined based model sunshine based model temperature

function 1 introduction reference evapotranspiration et0 is an essential component in hydrological ecological processes and agricultural water management which is defined as the rate of evapotranspiration et from a hypothetical reference crop with an assumed crop height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 allen et al 1998 in the agro ecosystems et0 is most frequently utilized for calculating et through food and agriculture organization fao crop coefficient method kool et al 2014 thus accurate estimation of et0 is vital in improving irrigation efficiency water reuse and drainage control shiri et al 2014 however direct et0 measurement by experimental techniques methods is less practicability high commission and time consuming torres and calera 2010 xing et al 2022a it is necessary to develop an alternative mathematical method for accurately estimating et0 with reasonable precision and high stability in recent decades numerous models have been developed for computing et0 at various climates among which the fao 56 pm model is recommended as the sole standard model for et0 estimation by the fao of the united nations allen et al 1998 the pm model was developed based on the energy balance and aerodynamic principles and its reliability has been demonstrated in different climates because it considers all factors that affect the evapotranspiration process feng et al 2016 tabari et al 2013 the main disadvantage of the pm model is that it requires many climatic variables i e maximum air temperature tmax minimum air temperature tmin wind speed u relative humidity rh and solar radiation rs that might be missing or unavailable in some regions thereby limiting its application throughout mainland china however 752 national meteorological stations measure tmax tmin wind speed sunshine duration and rh but only 122 stations produce daily rs data directly thus many studies have explored alternative models for concisely estimating rs with reasonable precision and high stability using readily accessible meteorological variables at present the existing empirical rs models can be categorized as sunshine based temperature based cloudiness based models and combined based models fan et al 2018b although the angstrom prescott model based on sunshine duration data prescott 1940 is the priority recommended by fao 56 allen et al 1998 it still should be noted that the accuracy of different rs models can vary significantly and the performance of the most commonly used rs models in the complex climatic zones of china deserves more attention liu et al 2012 furthermore previous studies have demonstrated that the empirical parameters of rs models are site specific and they should be calibrated specifically liu et al 2009b gocic et al 2016 analyzed the effect of rs on daily et0 in serbia and the result showed that significant differences exist in the different empirical rs models yin et al 2008 stated that the rs is an important and site specific component to determine et0 and they concluded that the et0 would be overestimated by about 27 if no local calibration is performed yang et al 2021 further found that the estimation accuracy of et0 was significant influenced by the empirical parameters a b in the angstrom prescott method against the background of numerous climate types in china feng et al 2020 utilized daily rs measurements to locally calibrate the parameters of the nineteen empirical rs model and they found that calibration of empirical parameters improved the prediction accuracy of rs which can provide crucial information for the et0 estimation liu et al 2012 assessed seven locally calibrated angstrom prescott models at 80 meteorological stations in china and found that the error of the best performing model was related to the empirical parameters with altitude with 2 mj m 2 d 1 at 89 of the stations in addition studies have investigated the effects of optimized rs models on accurate et0 estimation tabari et al 2015 investigated the applicability of 12 different rs models and their effects on daily et0 calculation using the pm model under cool arid and semi arid climates of iran and they found that the locally calibrated rs models provided more accurate et0 estimation thus enormous studies that have been conducted highlighted the importance of using locally calibrated rs models for et0 estimation although the optimized mathematical models obtain superior accuracy compared with the original versions the accuracy of various parameter optimization methods differs significantly garg 2009 panda and padhy 2008 wang et al 2009 the recent boom in swarm intelligence algorithms has advanced studies in the domains of agriculture and hydrology alizadeh et al 2021 bai and gao 2021 chen et al 2020b and the existing swarm intelligence optimization algorithms can be categorized as biology based physics based and sociology based bohaienko et al 2021 used particle swarm optimization pso to identify the parameters in the water transport model and they found that using the optimized parameters could significantly increase the accuracy of simulations bohaienko et al 2021 used particle swarm optimization pso to identify the parameters in the water transport model and they found that using the optimized parameters could significantly increase the accuracy of simulations naserbegi et al 2018 proposed the gravitational search algorithm gsa for the exergy optimization of the bushehr nuclear power plant bnpp and the exergy destruction in the bnpp with the application of the gsa is minimized and the optimum operating parameters in desired streams dong et al 2022 proposed a mind evolutionary algorithm mea to calibrate seven empirical et0 models at 100 meteorological stations in china and they found the calibrated were significantly better than the original models the concern is justified regarding the performance of swarm intelligence optimization algorithms to calibrated rs models for et0 estimation since the great successful application achieved by the above research but little was reported in such field moreover it is generally considered that using estimates rather than data measurements to compute rs might lead to specific errors in et0 estimation liu et al 2009b liu et al 2012 nwokolo et al 2022 yang et al 2021 but it is still necessary to investigate how the performance of the pm model might be affected by using various rs models at different climate zones in china in addition recalibrated rs models may be closer to the measured rs but they are still affected by the performance of the optimization algorithms employed fan et al 2020 garg 2009 wu et al 2022b however few studies have applied the optimal empirical parameters in rs models using intelligent optimization algorithms although they have been applied successfully in many cases thus comparative studies are urgently required to assess the performance of various rs models optimized by intelligent optimization algorithms for estimating et0 integrated with pm at different climatic zones of china therefore the objectives of the present study were 1 to determine the spatiotemporal variations in the annual average meteorological variables i e air temperature ta wind speed at 2 m above ground level u2 rh precipitation pre rs and et0 2 to conduct national scale assessments of nine typical rs models comprising three sunshine based models three temperature based models and three combined based models for estimating rs across four climatic zones in china and 3 to evaluate the effectiveness of optimization using the pso gsa and mea algorithms on the et0 estimates obtained by the hybrid pm equations which integrated with optimized rs models at four climatic zones in china finally the most recommended hybrid pm equations which were integrated with optimized rs models will be given at four climatic zones of china in this study 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the four main climatic zones in china fan et al 2016 are the temperate monsoon zone tmz temperate continental zone tcz mountain plateau zone mpz and subtropical monsoon zone smz respectively fig 1 tmz tcz mpz and smz can be generally grouped as semi humid arid semi arid and humid areas with mean annual precipitation amounts of 560 mm 194 mm 433 mm and 1320 mm respectively and annual pan evaporation amounts of 1475 mm 2148 mm 1883 mm and 1545 mm more average annual meteorological characteristic value see table s1 2 2 data collection measurements of rs were started in 1957 by the china meteorology administration cma initially 122 national meteorological stations collected rs measurements however the cma introduced a new type of radiometer for acquiring rs measurements and 95 stations have collected these data since 1994 tang et al 2018 yang et al 2015 according to yang et al 2015 the replacement of the rs instruments resulted in a shift in the rs data 1 4 0 5 mj m 2 d 1 thus considering the availability and continuity of data only the daily meteorological data collected during 1994 2016 were used in this study see table s1 for information about the national meteorological stations comprising tmin tmax and average air temperature ta sunshine duration n rh wind speed at 10 m height u10 and actual rs these variables were measured following the guidelines of the world meteorological organization and the cma conducted preliminary quality control of the data before providing the data to users liu et al 2009b further quality control of the data was also conducted according to the schemes described by liu et al 2009b and the average omission rate of the meteorological dataset in this study was 3 2 2 3 penman monteith equation according to fao

models and three combined based models were selected for estimating rs due to their broad applicability detailed introduction of these rs models are described as follows 2 4 1 sunshine based model angstrom model angstrom prescott model proposed by angstrom 1924 is the most commonly utilized sunshine based model which related the ratio of rs and clear sky radiation rs0 to the relative sunshine duration n n due to the unavailability of rs0 in many regions throughout the world prescott 1940 developed the angstrom prescott model which is the most commonly utilized sunshine based model abbreviated as m1 3 r s a b n n r a where rs is the global solar radiation mj m 2 d 1 n is the sunshine duration h n is the maximum possible sunshine duration h a and b are empirical parameters ögelman model ögelman et al 1984 correlated rs with n by utilizing a maximum likelihood quadratic fit and then established the following equation abbreviated as m2 4 r s a b n n c n n 2 r a where a b and c are empirical parameters bahel model bahel et al 1987 proposed and developed the bahel model abbreviated as m3 5 r s a b n n c n n 2 d n n 3 r a where a b c and d are empirical parameters 2 4 2 temperature based model sunshine based models are considered the better accurate empirical models but sunshine duration observation data are not readily available in many regions throughout the world thus it is preferable to determine the empirical correlations between rs and other reliably measured meteorological variables in particular the average air temperature ta is one of the most widely measured meteorological variables in most areas and thus many efforts hitherto have been made to estimate rs using temperature based models hargreaves model the most commonly utilized temperature based model is the hargreaves model abbreviated as m4 which was proposed by hargreaves and samani 1982 and considered rs as a function of ra and δt 6 r s a δ t b r a where δt is the diurnal temperature range δt tmax tmin c a and b are empirical parameters bristow campbell model bristow and campbell 1984 implemented an exponential function to correlate rs and the diurnal temperature range and established the following model abbreviated as m5 7 r s a 1 exp b δ t c r a where a b and c are empirical parameters hunt model hunt et al 1998 calibrated the hargreaves model and presented the model in an additive equation abbreviated as m6 8 r s a δ t r a b where a and b are empirical parameters 2 4 3 combined based model combined based models generally compute rs by combining the sunshine duration or air temperature with other common meteorological variables the following three typical combined based models were selected in this study fan model fan et al 2018b jointly combined the effects of pre and ta on rs and then established the fan model abbreviated as m7 9 r s a b n n c d ln δ t e l n pre 1 f t a r a where pre is the average precipitation mm d 1 a b c d e and f are empirical parameters chen model chen et al 2004 considered that rs has a powerful correlation with the relative sunshine n n and a logarithmic correlation with δt and established the following complex model abbreviated as m8 10 r s a b n n c d ln δ t r a where a b c and d are empirical parameters el sebaii model el sebaii et al 2009 proposed the following simple new method abbreviated as m9 for estimating rs based on ta rh and ra 11 r s a b t a c r h r a where a b and c are empirical parameters 2 5 swarm intelligent optimization algorithms in order to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of swarm intelligent optimization algorithms on the et0 estimates obtained by the hybrid pm equations which are integrated with rs models this study applied biology based pso physics based gsa and sociology based mea algorithms to calibrate the empirical parameters of rs models before building hybrid pm equations and compared them the least squares method lsm as with original version in et0 estimation flowcharts illustrating the optimization algorithms comprising pso gsa and mea are shown in fig 2 2 5 1 pso algorithm the pso algorithm was developed by kennedy and eberhart 1995 based on population foraging the pso is essentially an improved genetic algorithm that can achieve global optimization more rapidly wu et al 2021b by randomly initializing an initial population comprising n particles in the feasible solution region with dimension d and random initial velocity each particle is a potential solution to the problem i e the fitness value determined by the fitness function the directions of motion and distances of each of the particles in the multi dimensional search space are determined by their velocity and the velocity is affected by inertia in each iteration the algorithm iteratively updates the position and velocity of each particle based on the personal extremum pbest and global extremum gbest li et al 2022 the mathematical process conducted by the pso algorithm is described as follows 12 v i t 1 v i t c 1 r 1 p b e s t i x i c 2 r 2 g b e s t i x i 13 x i t 1 x i t v i t 1 where i 1 2 n t is the current iterative algebra c1 and c2 are acceleration parameters indicating the degree of particle social learning and self learning respectively and r1 and r2 are random numbers from 0 1 additional instructions pbest records the optimal historical information for each particle during flight and gbest is the optimal solution information for the whole population in the search process during the continuous iteration process individual particles update their own velocity value vi according to their own historical optimization and global optimization of the population and then change xi the fitness value f xi of the objective function is then calculated when the fitness value is better than the fitness value of the historical optimal solution the historical optimal solution pbesti is updated when the fitness value is better than the fitness value of the global optimal solution the values of pbesti and gbesti are updated for further details please refer to the study by wu et al 2021a 2 5 2 gsa algorithm the gsa algorithm was proposed by rashedi et al 2009 based on the law of universal gravitation newton s second law and the phenomenon that allows particles to attract each other by force in the gsa the solution to the optimization problem is regarded as a group of particles in space and these search particles gather together due to the force received by each other the motions of the particles follow the dynamic law where particles with large inertial mass move slower than particles with small inertial mass therefore matter moves toward the particles with large inertial mass and the particles with the largest inertial mass occupy the optimal position in order to obtain the optimal solution of the problem suppose that there are n particles in the independent system the position of the ith particle i 1 2 n is defined as x i x i 1 x i 2 x i d x i n and x i d is the position of the ith particle in the d dimensional space position updating and acceleration are expressed as 14 v i d t 1 r a

the sum of the forces on it from other particles a i d t is the acceleration of the ith particle at time t in the d dimensional space and m i d t is the inertial mass of the ith particle for further details please refer to the study by aghaie and mahmoudi 2016 2 5 3 mea algorithm the mea algorithm imitates the evolutionary process of human thinking through a convergence and divergence process which overcomes the shortcomings of the genetic algorithm but also integrates the advantages of the genetic algorithm and evolutionary strategy wang et al 2018 the mea optimization process can be summarized as three basic links individual learning group cooperation and competitive innovation where individual learning represents the behavior of individuals learning from each other in the

population at time t and α t represents the information required to determine a specific learning strategy at time t the group cooperation link can be mathematically described as co p o p t β t where pop t represents a new set of individuals generated after individual learning at time t and β t represents the information required to determine the cooperation strategy of a specific group at t time based on the individual learning and group cooperation links new individuals can be generated from old individuals therefore 18 p op t c o s t p op α t β t where p op t represents the set of new individuals at time t i e the population generated by the intermediate operation process the process based on reusing competitive innovation to produce the next generation of the population can be mathematically described as follows 19 p op t 1 c r p o p t φ t where φ t represents the information required to determine a specific competitive innovation strategy at t time population renewal for each generation under the unified mea framework can be mathematically described as follows 20 p op t 1 c r c o s t p op α t 1 β t 1 φ t 1 2 6 spatiotemporal variation analysis method 2 6 1 mann kendall trend analysis method tests for the detection of significant trends in climatologic time series can be classified as parametric and non parametric methods gocic and trajkovic 2013 in the non parametric test the original hypothesis believed that the increase or decrease trend of the time series was not obvious but the alternative hypothesis holds that the changing trend of the time series is significant non parametric mann kendall test has been widely used for trend analysis dong et al 2022 douglas et al 2000 partal and kahya 2006 and the definition of mann kendall s test statistics is

first part of the data 1994 2010 was used to locally determine the empirical parameters for each selected rs model and the second part of the data 2011 2016 was utilized to assess the performance of calibrated rs models and hybrid pm equations according to martí et al 2015 and chen et al 2022 calculated et0 is acceptable with the lack of experimental measurement on this assertion we treated et0 values calculated by the pm equations and measured rs as the standard values benchmark when evaluating the empirical rs models and their corresponding hybrid pm equations statistical accuracy

meteorological features fig 3 shows the spatial distributions and temporal trends in the annual average ta rh u2 pre rs and et0 in china during 1994 2016 the temporally averaged annual ta tended to increase significantly fig 3a whereas rh tended to decrease significantly during 1994 2016 fig 3b in addition the spatially averaged annual ta and rh values decreased from east to west and from south to north with ranges of 0 28 to 27 15 c and 31 86 respectively fig 3c shows the annual sunshine duration n varied from 950 to 3524 h in china with increasing trends at 27 stations significant increasing trends at 10 stations decreasing trends at 33 stations and significant decreasing trends at 25 stations regionally 4 3 8 3 27 3 and 10 8 stations had significantly increasing trends in tmz tcz mpz and smz whereas 34 8 20 8 45 5 and 18 9 stations significant decreasing trends respectively fig 3d shows the annual precipitation pre varied from 16 to 1943 mm y 1 in china where 65 stations had increasing trends and 30 stations had decreasing trends the variations were not significant among most stations in china but five stations had significant increasing trends and one station had a significant increasing trend fig 3e shows the annual variation in measured rs followed a significant spatial gradient in china where it decreased from northeast to northwest with a range of 3224 47 8334 76 mj m 2 d 1 in addition 40 stations had increasing trends 16 stations had significant increasing trends 30 stations had decreasing trends and nine stations had significant decreasing trends regionally 8 7 20 8 9 1 and 21 6 of the stations had significant increasing trends in tmz tcz mpz and smz whereas 12 5 18 2 and 10 8 of the stations had significant decreasing trends in tcz mpz and smz respectively the et0 values calculated using the pm model exhibited an increasing trend in china as shown in fig 3f where 28 stations had significant increasing trends and 40 stations had increasing trends in addition six stations had significant decreasing trends and 21 stations had decreasing trends regionally 26 1 33 3 18 2 and 32 4 of stations had significantly increasing trends in tmz tcz mpz and smz respectively whereas 33 3 8 3 and 18 2 of the stations had significant decreasing trends in tmz tcz and mpz it was notable that the average annual et0 exhibited a similar spatial distribution to that of rs ranging from 651 to 1532 mm y 1 thereby indicating a significant correlation between rs and et0 3 2 accuracy performance of sunshine based models table 1 shows the median values of r2 nse and rmse obtained by empirical rs models across four climatic zones of china according to table 1 the angstrom model performed best among the sunshine based rs models at tmz tcz and mpz with the corresponding median value of r2 nse and rmse being better than that of the ögelman model by 3 9 9 6 6 1 9 6 and 16 3 24 0 and of bahel model by 10 3 34 3 18 6 76 1 and 30 1 37 8 respectively in terms of the smz zone the ögelman achieved the best performance with the improvement values of r2 nse and rmse being 3 7 3 4 and 17 8 compared to angstrom respectively to explore the performance of different rs models optimized by algorithms in estimating et0 when integrated with the pm this study proposed pso gsa and mea to optimize recommended rs models before integrating them into the hybrid pm models fig 4 listed the violin plots of r2 nse and rmse of the hybrid pm model integrated with recommended sunshine based rs models which were calibrated by lsm pso gsa and mea for estimating et0 at four climatic zones regarding pmangstrom mea was the best algorithm for optimizing the empirical parameters of the rs model which integrated into the hybrid pm models with the corresponding median value of gpi obtained by pmmea angstrom being 0 91 0 88 and 0 77 at tmz tcz and mpz respectively moreover the corresponding median value of r2 nse and rmse were improved by 22 9 25 4 24 7 27 6 and 22 1 28 2 compared to pmlsm angstrom 14 6 15 3 1 2 16 0 and 12 7 13 6 compared to pmpso angstrom and 14 6 15 3 1 2 16 0 and 12 7 13 6 compared to pmgsa angstrom respectively regarding pmögelman in smz gsa was significantly superior to other algorithms with the improvement values of r2 nse and rmse obtained by pmgsa ögelman ranged from 7 3 to 38 3 12 9 50 8 and 15 1 59 9 respectively the corresponding median value of r2 nse and rmse were listed in table 2 in summary pmmea angstrom was the best hybrid pm model which integrated with the optimized sunshine based rs model at tmz tcz and mpz while pmgsa ögelman was more applicable to smz for et0 estimation 3 3 accuracy performance of temperature based models as shown in table 1 the hunt model performed better among the temperature based models at tmz and smz with the corresponding median value of r2 nse and rmse being better than that of the hargreaves model by 2 0 3 2 22 5 446 7 and 4 1 4 8 and of bristow campbell model by 16 9 34 2 196 1 358 0 and 16 0 18 5 respectively in terms of tcz and mpz the result showed the hargreaves was the most recommended temperature based rs model and the median values of r2 nse and rmse were improved by 1 6 8 7 6 4 31 6 and 7 2 10 9 at tcz and 24 3 34 1 42 4 45 6 and 20 9 23 0 at smz respectively under a similar reason as the previous section fig 5 listed the violin plots of r2 nse and rmse of the hybrid pm model integrated with recommended temperature based rs models which were calibrated by lsm pso gsa and mea for estimating et0 at four climatic zones however there was no significant difference found in the statistical accuracy indicators obtained by different algorithms in optimizing hargreaves for et0 estimation integrated with the pm equation table 2 hence this study accepted its original version lsm hargreaves as the recommended temperature based rs model to replace measured rs when the temperature data was left only at tcz and mpz and the median values of r2 nse and rmse obtained by pm lsm hargreaves was 0 88 0 86 and 0 68 mm d 1 at tcz and 0 78 0 74 and 0 61 mm d 1 at mpz respectively regarding the tmz and smz mea was more applicable to optimizing hunt for et0 estimation and the improvement values of r2 nse and rmse obtained by pmmea hunt ranged from 9 2 to 26 5 11 3 25 4 and 10 0 23 9 at tmz and 5 0 25 9 9 7 39 0 and 4 8 24 5 at smz respectively in summary pm mea hunt was the best hybrid pm model which integrated with the optimized temperature based rs model at tmz and smz respectively however there was no necessity in optimizing pmhargreaves for et0 estimation which was recommended at tcz and mpz 3 4 accuracy performance of combined based models as shown in table 1 the accuracy of three combined based models using different combinations of meteorological variables existed a significant difference in estimating rs and the accuracy can be ranked based on gpi from best to worst as fan model el sebaii model and chen model compared to el sebaii model the improvement values r2 nse and rmse obtained by the fan model were 4 1 8 6 5 3 10 3 and 6 9 30 1 at four climatic zones respectively in terms of comparison between the fan model and the chen model the improvement values r2 nse and rmse obtained by the fan model were 3 3 24 2 2 8 32 7 and 20 9 47 8 at four climatic zones respectively since the combined based models were not mutually replaceable because of the different requirements for meteorological data the accuracy performance of pmfan pmchen and pmel sebaii had high application significance in different scenarios of data acquisition fig 6 depicts the box plots of r2 nse and rmse of the hybrid pm model integrated with the combined based rs models which were calibrated by lsm pso gsa and mea for estimating et0 at four climatic zones of china as shown in fig 6 pmgsa fan was the best hybrid pm equation integrated with the optimized combined based model for et0 estimation with the corresponding median value of r2 nse and rmse were 0 94 0 92 and 0 48 mm d 1 at tmz 0 93 0 91 and 0 56 mm d 1 at tcz 0 89 0 86 and 0 51 mm d 1 at mpz and 0 86 0 82 and 0 67 mm d 1 at smz respectively moreover the most recommended optimization algorithms for the chen model and el sebaii model were gsa and mea at four climatic zones of china respectively compared to pmgsa chen the corresponding median value of rmse obtained by pmgsa fan was improved by 1 9 6 3 8 7 and 10 4 at tmz tcz mpz and smz respectively while the values of r2 and nse didn t show significant differences between them compared to pmmea el sebaii the corresponding median value of r2 nse and rmse obtained by pmgsa fan were improved by 2 1 3 2 and 35 3 at tmz 2 8 3 6 and 51 3 at tcz 7 9 10 1 and 38 3 at mpz and 5 9 12 8 and 48 2 at smz respectively in summary pmgsa fan was the best hybrid pm model integrated with the optimized combined based rs model at four climatic zones and the most recommended optimization algorithms for the chen model and el sebaii model were gsa and mea at four climatic zones of china respectively moreover the accuracy of the hybrid pm models integrated with the optimized combined based models can be ranked based on gpi from best to worst as pmgsa fan pmmea el sebaii and pmgsa chen 3 5 cross comparison among three types of models despite both advantages and disadvantages being obvious in different types of empirical rs models for et0 estimation when integrated with the pm equation the accuracy improvement effect of optimization algorithms was also significant thus it is necessary to make a cross comparison among three types of empirical rs models for et0 estimation as shown in table 2 before being optimized by the intelligent optimization algorithm the pmlsm el sebaii achieved the best performance table 2 with the median values of r2 nse and rmse ranging from 0 91 to 0 96 0 86 0 95 and 0 38 0 52 mm d 1 at four climatic zones respectively but beyond that a significant phenomenon existed that not more complex rs models present a better performance in et0 estimation when integrated with the pm equation for example pmlsm chen which was established based on the n n and δt exerted a poorer performance than the pmlsm angstrom and pmlsm hunt at tmz and tcz and the corresponding gpi values were improved by 53 0 60 6 and 29 3 103 3 respectively after optimization despite all hybrid pm models being improved significantly three combined based exert better performance than sunshine based and temperature based table 2 compared to pmlsm angstrom which is recommended by fao the median r2 nse and rmse of pmmea angstrom improved by 22 9 25 4 24 7 27 6 and 22 1 28 2 respectively furthermore the median r2 of pmgsa fan pmgsa chen and pmmea el sebaii increased by 32 3 46 6 31 9 44 6 and 32 1 44 8 compared to pmlsm angstrom respectively a similar result can be gained from nse that the corresponding improvement values were 35 9 54 4 35 4 52 0 and 35 6 52 3 respectively regarding rmse the improvement values of the pmgsa fan pmgsa chen and pmmea el sebaii were 66 0 70 1 63 8 67 2 and 64 7 68 8 respectively moreover although hybrid pm integrated with temperature based rs models achieved the poorest performance for et0 estimation after optimization the differences between temperature based and sunshine based were also narrowed and the corresponding values of r2 nse and rmse were improved by 14 0 16 5 14 8 16 2 and 14 8 17 2 respectively compared to pmlsm angstrom fig 7 illustrated the spatial distribution of accuracy statistical indicators obtained by hybrid pm equations integrated with the optimized rs models for estimating et0 at four climatic zones of china as shown in fig 7a 7c the hybrid pm integrated with the optimized sunshine based rs model manifested a relatively good performance throughout china r2 0 65 nse 0 50 and rmse 0 34 mm d 1 respectively and the worst accuracy appeared at the southwestern tmz northwestern tcz and southeastern mpz respectively in terms of hybrid pm integrated with the optimized temperature based rs model the accuracy of which exhibited a significant spatial gradient in china from north to south of china as shown in fig 7d 7f where the r2 nse and rmse values for the models ranged among 0 24 0 95 2 12 0 95 and 0 46 1 15 mm d 1 respectively as expected the hybrid pm integrated with the optimized combined based rs model obtained excellent performance throughout china and the pmgsa fan achieved the best national performance in et0 estimation r2 0 92 nse 0 88 and rmse 0 15 mm d 1 respectively however the regional spatial gradient was also significant that the r2 nse and rmse values decreased from north to south of china and the major worst performance existed at the smz on the whole the combined based hybrid pm models were superior to others regionally and nationally moreover sunshine based hybrid pm models were more suitable for tcz and smz while temperature based ones were more recommended in the north of china in summary the estimation accuracy of hybrid pm equations was not only related to the complexity of the model but also significantly affected by the optimization algorithms after optimization the accuracy of the hybrid pm equation integrated with the optimized rs models can be ranked based on gpi from best to worst as combined based sunshine based and temperature based hybrid pm equations respectively 4 discussion 4 1 accuracy discrepancies among different empirical rs models rs is strongly affected by atmospheric extinction and atmospheric extinction is related to air density and atmospheric thickness vignola et al 2012 oyewola et al 2022 calculated rs in the fiji islands from 1984 to 1998 using an empirical formula and found that the accuracy of sunshine based models was higher than that of temperature based models feng et al 2020 explained that sunshine based models obtained better results because the relative sunshine duration n n is used to express the cloudiness of the atmosphere nwokolo et al 2022 calculated rs in nigeria from 1985 to 2016 and they also concluded that the accuracy of the angstrom prescott model sunshine based model was higher than those of other models similarly this study also found sunshine based empirical models performed better than temperature based models at four climatic zones of china with corresponding gpi index values increased by 121 7 304 0 108 7 633 3 75 9 304 0 and 42 1 274 2 respectively table 1 in addition it should be noted that the sunshine based rs models performance is more sensitive to model structure presumably because correct mapping path is more important than mapping complexity feng et al 2020 the result found by this study confirmed this assertion that simpler sunshine based rs model angstrom model linear function of n n achieved better performance table 2 with the corresponding gpi value increased by 1 3 33 3 3 0 77 8 and 15 1 37 8 compared to ögelman model quadratic function of n n and bahel model cubic function of n n although sunshine based rs models provide more accurate results compared with other models temperature based models can be recommended as widely used alternative methods because air temperature data are more available than sunshine data fan et al 2018a used 20 temperature based empirical models to estimate rs in humid regions of china and concluded that temperature based models can be applied for daily global rs estimation with higher accuracy in the humid subtropical and tropical regions of china liu et al 2009a assessed 16 rs models including modified versions of the bristow campbell and hargreaves models across a wide range of agro ecological conditions in china and indicated that the rs estimates based on the daily air temperature were stable and robust bellido jiménez et al 2021 calculated rs at nine sites in southern spain and north carolina using the hargreaves samani and bristow campbell and the accuracy of the models improved after parameter calibration in this study the local calibrated temperature based models can provide reasonable results with the r2 nse and rmse values of the most suitable temperature based ranging from 0 65 to 0 75 0 42 0 67 and 3 65 4 52 mj m 2 d 1 respectively at four climatic zones of china considering structure similarity and accuracy discrepancy between hargreaves model tmz and smz and hunt model tcz and mpz we can speculatively conclude that temperature based models performance may be sensitive to climatic environments in the present study we further found that combined based models which considered precipitation or rh data generally obtained better estimates than the single sunshine based and temperature based models with the r2 nse and rmse values improved up to 81 3 277 3 and 28 9 respectively table 1 it is presumably because the models that included these meteorological variables better represented the effect of atmospheric extinction on rs chen et al 2004 nwokolo et al 2022 saud et al 2020 similar results also were obtained by fan et al 2018b that the combined based models could be better applied for daily global rs estimation with high accuracy after the comparison between sunshine based models and combined empirical models for estimating the daily horizontal global rs in humid regions of china similarly feng et al 2020 developed seven sunshine based models nine temperature based models and three combined based models for predicting rs in china and they found that the combined based models generally obtained the most accurate predictions thus we can conclude that the estimation accuracy of rs models is also inclined to meteorological independent variables however not always more complex empirical rs models obtained more accurate results than the simple ones based on the same meteorological variables when using the same meteorological data thereby indicating that the performance of the models was also sensitive to the model structure a more sophisticated model structure might explain more of the processes involved but increasing the number of parameters that need to be calibrated could also make them more susceptible to overfitting chen et al 2020a li et al 2015 wu et al 2022b similarly makade and jamil 2018 applied 10 different statistical error tests to compare 300 existing sunshine based models in india and found significant differences in the accuracy of the models due to their structures fan et al 2018a applied 20 temperature based empirical models for estimating rs in humid regions of china and they recommended their proposed novel model for estimating rs with acceptable accuracy when only air temperatures are available to summarize the accuracy of rs models for estimating solar radiation is sensitive to factors such as model structure climatic environment and meteorological independent variables therefore these factors should be taken into account when selecting the most appropriate model for estimating solar radiation at the four climatic zones in china 4 2 accuracy discrepancies among different optimization algorithms a modeling approach simplifies or approximates processes for estimating rs so empirical models will differ significantly from the actual problem presumably because of numerous assumptions and approximations sarker and newton 2007 these differences may lead to sophisticated models that include many mechanistic processes and empirical parameters using many empirical parameters generally leads to greater adaptability and the model may be closer to the real system but the problem of parameter acquisition could be exacerbated moreover problems such as correlations between parameters non uniqueness ill posedness and parameter equivalence will lead to the production of non unique empirical parameter estimates using traditional methods birdi et al 2021 bugajny and furmańczyk 2022 kovács and fekete 2019 mbonimpa et al 2015 tang et al 2018 and it is impossible to prove whether an empirical rs model gets the local optimal value intelligent optimization algorithms can effectively obtain unique globally optimal parameter estimates for mathematical models garcia and lôndero 2021 jiang et al 2021 mohanty et al 2017 saud et al 2020 used the k fold cross validation approach to optimize 25 empirical rs models for india from 1986 to 2000 and they found that the accuracy of the model was greatly improved wu et al 2022a used the whale optimization algorithm woa to optimize twelve empirical et0 models to improve estimates accuracy and the prediction accuracy of optimized temperature radiation and hybrid model was improved by 12 05 11 06 and 10 46 respectively however most previous studies hitherto applied the intelligent optimization algorithms to improve empirical et0 or rs models directly few research considered the effect of optimized empirical rs models on the accuracy improvement of et0 estimates in the present study we found that the et0 estimates improved significantly using the pm equation integrated with the empirical rs model which optimized by the most recommended intelligent optimization algorithms table 2 and the corresponding r2 nse and rmse values improved by 3 13 69 0 3 16 75 0 and 22 0 72 0 respectively compared to their original version furthermore the results showed that the mea was more suitable for optimizing the empirical parameters in the angstrom model hunt model and el sebaii model table 2 because these equations belong to low dimensional problems and the mea algorithm overcomes the shortcomings of ga and evolutionary strategies by transforming single layer population evolution into multi layer population evolution through its unique convergence and divergence processes to improve the global search efficiency of the algorithm dong et al 2022 however in the face of high dimensional problems the optimization strategy of the mea algorithm limits the optimization effect of ögelman fan and chen the search space of gsa grew exponentially with the size of the problem owing to the algorithm using gravity as a tool for information transmission which can efficiently realize optimal information sharing among individuals therefore this algorithm achieved better optimization effect when dealing with high dimensional problems rashedi et al 2009 wang et al 2021 moreover the information interaction process in gsa optimal algorithm not only spreads information within the group but also all individuals within the group can process information and change their search behavior according to the information they get so that the entire group can emerge some abilities and characteristics that individual individuals do not have ezzat et al 2021 mahmoudi and aghaie 2019 that is although individual behavior is simple in the group individuals can solve the overall goal through the interaction of the information they get and the spread of information in the whole group enables the problem to be solved more effectively than that solved by a single individual garg 2019 su et al 2021 the result of this study further confirmed these conclusions that the r2 nse and rmse values of pmgsa ögelman pmgsa fan and pmgsa chen were improved by 4 21 12 8 4 26 26 0 and 15 0 58 0 compared to pmmea ögelman pmmea fan and pmmea chen respectively table 2 to summarize despite the intelligent optimization algorithms having a higher capacity for parameter optimization in the et0 estimates using the pm equation which is integrated with the rs model compared with the traditional methods it is still necessary to select an optimal algorithm for each specific rs model by considering the model structure and algorithm characteristics 4 3 accuracy discrepancies among hybrid pm integrated with different rs models many studies have investigated alternative models for concisely estimating rs with reasonable precision and high stability using readily available meteorological variables fan et al 2018b feng et al 2020 rehman 1998 song et al 2020 sun et al 2015 trnka et al 2005 zhang et al 2021 however few studies have investigated the effects of optimizing rs models using swarm intelligent optimization algorithms on the accuracy of et0 estimates when integrated with the pm equation even though tabari et al 2015 have proved that the average accuracy of the et0 estimates increased by using 12 calibrated rs models and analyzed their effects on daily et0 calculation with the pm model in cool arid and semi arid climate areas of iran in the present study evaluations were conducted to determine the effects of the optimized empirical rs models when using the hybrid pm model for estimating et0 at four climatic zones of china and differences in accuracy were found between the optimized rs models for estimating et0 in particular the hybrid pm model integrated with combined rs models generally obtained better estimates than the single sunshine based models and temperature based models thereby indicating that introducing other variables into the models could improve their performance when estimating et0 at four climatic zones in china the results obtained in this study also showed that the hybrid pm models integrated with the optimized fan model chen model and el sebaii model were suitable for estimating et0 throughout china thereby demonstrating the broad applicability of combined rs models across various climatic zones in china the reason is that the rs is the main driving force of evapotranspiration and rs is strongly affected by atmospheric extinction which is related to the air density and atmospheric thickness bai and zong 2021 carra et al 2018 ma et al 2018 also concluded that the ta rh and rs are the main reasons for the variations in et0 which implied the importance of these meteorological data to the et0 estimation wang and zheng 2022 further proved that rs rh and pre exerted an overall stronger influence on et0 r2 0 50 than other factors therefore the accuracy of the et0 estimates improved after introducing rh and pre data into the pm model in this study thus more accurate et0 estimates could be obtained by considering additional atmospheric data such as the cloudiness value aerosols and vapor pressure deficit but except that the sunshine based models and temperature based models exert higher potential to replace combined models when integrating them into the pm for et0 estimation because of their less metrological data requirement and acceptable estimation accuracy as shown in table 2 the median values of r2 nse and rmse obtained by the hybrid pm which were integrated with the optimized sunshine based models ranged from 0 83 to 0 92 0 80 0 90 and 0 54 059 mm d 1 respectively moreover the median values of r2 nse and rmse obtained by the hybrid pm which were integrated with the optimized temperature based model which merely used temperature data as input ranged from 0 77 to 0 88 0 66 0 86 and 0 61 0 78 mm d 1 respectively as recommended by allen et al 1998 the sunshine based rs model was the most mainstream alternative method currently which has been successfully applicated in many research fan et al 2018b nwokolo et al 2022 yin et al 2008 this study further found the sunshine based rs model can be improved significantly by the intelligent optimization algorithm which was used to build the hybrid pm equation and the accuracy difference between the two types of hybrid pm models was not very obvious r2 10 at tmz tcz and smz and nearly 15 at mpz compared to combined based models moreover although temperature based rs models achieved the poorest performance for et0 estimation when integrated with pm the characteristic of minimum data requirement gives it a stronger application in china s vast climate changing regions qiu et al 2022 comprehensively reviewed 82 temperature based models for estimating daily rs using only temperature data and the results showed that these models can be successfully applied to predict daily rs in china with forecast temperature data for a lead time of 1 8 days ihaddadene et al 2019 used seven temperature based empirical models to estimate the daily average global solar radiation on the horizontal surface and the result suggested that the daily global solar radiation can be estimated successfully using only extreme air temperatures in south algeria furthermore significant spatial discrepancies exist in the accuracy performance of et0 estimation obtained by the hybrid pm equations across china deep seated reasons can be drawn from similar research about rs estimation using limited meteorological features specifically except for a relatively good estimation performance this study found the worst accuracy obtained by the hybrid pm equations integrated with sunshine based rs models appeared at the southwestern tmz northwestern tcz and southeastern mpz respectively fig 7a 7c which is presumably because that clearness index significantly affects the et0 estimation through rs estimation fan et al 2019 insisted that the sunshine based rs models performed similarly to the clearness index correlated ones on a daily basis while the clearness index exerted the same variety rule as our research on the other hand this study found that the estimation accuracy of temperature based hybrid pm exhibited a significant spatial gradient in china from north to south of china fig 7d 7f which was similar to the conclusion drawn by liu et al 2009a found that the accuracy of the temperature based rs models was affected mainly by the daily range of air temperature compared to the rs estimated models using limited input the combined based rs model contains more useful meteorological information which can be flexibly adjusted to cope with complex environmental features through appropriate parameter optimization to show national stability and high estimation accuracy across china fig 7g 7o and this conclusion is well supported by similar research results drawn by feng et al 2020 who concluded that more meteorological input improved the prediction accuracy of rs by providing more crucial information thus regardless of the availability of data at four climatic zones of china the most recommended radiation models which were integrated into the pm equation for estimating et0 ranked combined based sunshine based and temperature based rs models respectively but both the different types of rs models had their obvious advantages and disadvantages for et0 estimation and the estimated model was suggested to be selected by comprehensively considering the accuracy of the empirical model and the availability of meteorological data 5 conclusion in the present study particle swarm optimization pso gravitational search algorithm gsa and mind evolutionary algorithm mea were used to optimize sunshine based models temperature based models and combined based rs models respectively before integrating them into pm equations for estimating et0 at four climatic zones of china the main conclusions based on the results obtained in this study can be summarized as follows fan model manifested the best accurate estimates among the nine empirical rs models across the four climatic zones of china among the sunshine based models the angstrom model performed better in tmz tcz and mpz whereas ögelman performed better in smz respectively among the temperature based models the hunt model performed better in tmz and smz whereas the hargreaves model performed better in tcz and mpz respectively gsa performed better for the hybrid pm equations which were integrated with the ögelman model fan model and chen model whereas mea performed better for the hybrid pm equations which were integrated with the angstrom model hunt model and el sebaii model respectively moreover there was no difference in their optimum performance for the hybrid pm equation which was integrated with the hargreaves model after optimization pmgsa fan achieved the most accurate estimates of et0 at four climatic zones and the accuracy of the hybrid pm equations integrated with the optimized rs models can be ranked from best to worst as combined based sunshine based and temperature based hybrid pm equations respectively credit authorship contribution statement liwen xing conceptualization methodology software writing

2042,increased sea surface temperature evaporation air temperature and moisture holding capacity associated with climate change may the enhance transport of moisture to central asia ca resulting in increased extreme precipitation events epes changes in epes may affect the socioeconomic and ecological environment in typical arid and semi arid regions of ca therefore based on meteorological station data and four reanalyzed precipitation datasets we used the taylor diagram geo detector method and other methods to examine 10 epe indices in ca from 1950 to 2019 analyzed their spatial temporal trends and quantified the influence of large scale climate factors on epes the results showed that gswp3 w5e5 was the optimal option with better performance in terms of monthly and annual precipitation in ca overall epes in ca showed an increasing trend but an abrupt point was found in 1986 when very wet day precipitation r95p increased from 36 64 to 47 84 mm the increasing rate also changed from 0 8 to 5 06 mm 10a the changes in the northern hemisphere subtropical high intensity index nsi nino b area sea surface temperature anomaly index ninob asian zonal circulation index and atlantic multidecadal oscillation index are the main reasons for the increase in epes the nsi and ninob had the largest contributions to epes with at 44 32 and 43 80 respectively additionally two factor interactions had a more significant influence further analysis revealed that the abnormal warming of sea surface temperature and others led to the strengthen of water vapor transport in ca caused by a series of cyclones and anticyclonic anomalies in the westerly circulation zone leading to the increase of epes the results obtained in this study can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the changes in epes and provide a reference for water resource management and disaster prevention in ca keywords extreme precipitation gswp3 w5e5 large scale climate factors central asia data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global temperatures have increased significantly since the 1980s in 2012 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc fifth assessment report ar5 pointed out that global surface temperatures increased by approximately 0 85 c between 1980 and 2012 ipcc 2013 in 2021 ipcc ar6 indicated that rise in global temperature is expected to increase 1 5 c and 2 c in the 21st century ipcc 2021 in the context of global warming most changes in precipitation center around extreme conditions the occurrences trends and future predictions with respect to extreme precipitation events epes have become the focus of climate research deng et al 2018 donat et al 2016 duan et al 2019 wasko and nathan 2019 the intensity of epes has increased with an increase in the global mean surface temperature myhre et al 2019 the clausius clapeyron law states that a warmer atmosphere has higher water vapor holding capacity pińskwar et al 2019 an increased water holding capacity can potentially intensify the hydrological cycle process leading to an increase in epes han et al 2019 an increase in epes may lead to or aggravate a number of social economic and environmental problems on a global scale in particular it has severe influences for agriculture industry health and water pollution howarth et al 2019 pall et al 2011 rajeevan et al 2008 wang et al 2022b over the last few decades an overall increase in epes has been recorded duan et al 2013 mukherjee et al 2018 which is strongly related to anthropogenic increases in atmospheric temperature and associated moisture content balling et al 2016 this also implies greater risks and challenges for the future chang et al 2020 therefore we must monitor and forecast epes to reduce human losses research on epes is extensive and diverse covering global zolina et al 2010 intercontinental fleig et al 2015 panthou et al 2014 regional howarth et al 2019 shawul and chakma 2020 and national scales peng et al 2018 scherrer et al 2016 most findings show that the epe intensity has grown and will continue do so in the future however some differences have been observed at intercontinental regional and national scales for example epe indices show an increasing trend in asia south america and most of northwestern north america donat et al 2013 myhre et al 2019 concluded that the increase in annual total precipitation when the daily precipitation amount 99 percentile r99p and r99 97p was typically higher in europe and japan than that in the united states or australia while epe trend decreased significantly in africa panthou et al 2014 more frequent and more intense extreme events in the northeastern united states have been linked to factors such as tropical moisture frei et al 2015 howarth et al 2019 with rainfall of 24 h accumulated 150 mm increasing in frequency by 317 and the annual maximum daily precipitation increasing by a total of 58 mm howarth et al 2019 various regions within a single country may experience differing levels of epes mukherjee et al 2018 noted that epes have become more frequent and intense in india over the past few decades under the influence of anthropogenic warming whereas the maximum annual precipitation in the ganges plain has decreased due to the decrease in monsoon season precipitation in china 56 44 intensity and 66 23 frequency of rainfall stations have shown an increasing trend deng et al 2018 under the future 4 k climate projection scenario in which surface temperatures are 4 k higher than in pre industrial levels condition the annual average maximum precipitation in southern china may increase by approximately 18 compared with that in the past duan et al 2019 whereas epes in northern china have shown a decreasing trend peng et al 2018 in addition summer precipitation and the frequency of epes in arid northwest china have increased ning et al 2021 as a typical arid and semi arid region central asia ca has fragile ecosystems that are highly sensitive to climate change and resulting extreme events peng et al 2020 ma et al 2020 hu et al 2017 showed that the precipitation in ca increased slightly where epes showed an increasing trend the total summer precipitation epes and persistent epes in northern kazakhstan and the tianshan mountains showed a significantly increasing trend ma et al 2020 a gradual increase from mild to epes increases the risk of future flooding and soil erosion disasters yang et al 2020 therefore we must analyze the changes in epes in ca however the complex geographical environment and unique climate characteristics of ca lead to an uneven distribution of meteorological stations and lack of meteorological data in contrast reanalysis data products generally have continuous time series and broad coverage which provides optimal data support for examining epes in ca large scale atmospheric circulation plays a vital role in increasing epes blanc et al 2021 hong et al 2022 irannezhad et al 2022 shang et al 2022 xie et al 2021 recent studies have increased their focus on regional climate variability and large scale atmospheric circulation atif et al 2020 used frequency composite and correlation analyses to evaluate the statistics of epes and its teleconnections showing that the mid latitude circular global wave train cgt is associated with the el niño southern oscillation enso which affects the frequency of epes the impact of enso on the increase of epes is mainly through increasing the frequency of epes in winter gao et al 2020 methods such as the continuous wavelet transform cross wavelet transform wavelet transform coherence and pearson correlation have also been applied to the analysis of climate change and its driving factors agarwal et al 2016 guo et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 have shown that the sunspot number ssn and enso affect epe changes mainly by inhibiting or enhancing convection ren et al 2022 showed that the pacific north american teleconnection pna enso arctic oscillation ao and enso ao pna separately or simultaneously affect epe changes precipitation and epes are complex and diverse in ca studies have shown that the increase of the northern hemisphere subtropical high intensity nsi is conducive to the westward extension of the western pacific subtropical high and the westward transport of water vapor in the indian and pacific oceans chen et al 2020 changes in indices such as the tropical indian ocean dipole index iod and atlantic multidecadal oscillation index amo increase the water holding capacity of the atmosphere and zhang et al 2022a found that amo has an important effect on epes in tianshan mountains the asian zonal circulation index azi and asian meridional circulation index ami increased and the banded circulation was strengthened which enhanced water vapor transport and increased in epes hong et al 2022 found that combined the north atlantic oscillation nao and polar eurasian pattern pol affect the frequency of epes in western siberia while eastern siberia is influenced by scandinavian pattern sca additionally enso indian summer monsoon east asian summer monsoon eastern atlantic western russia negative phase enhanced horizontal and vertical advection and southern water vapor anomalies provide favorable conditions for epes in ca chen et al 2020 ma et al 2020 xie et al 2021 the convergence of water vapor anomalies from the arctic north atlantic and western pacific in northern ca also produce extensive epes in adjacent areas wang et al 2022a the fluctuation in precipitation and epes in ca is related to many factors such as the water cycle atmospheric circulation sea temperature anomalies and thermal anomalies over the qinghai tibet plateau and iranian plateau further increased sea surface temperature evaporation air temperature and moisture holding capacity associated with climate change may enhance transport of moisture to continental sites zhang et al 2017c 2023 even those far removed from ocean sources of moisture such as ca which is the most distant point from oceans of any region on earth large scale climate factors affect sea surface temperature and moisture storage capacity shen et al 2022 among others thus causing changes in epes therefore we seek a new method to quantify the influence of large scale climate factors on epes due to the scarcity of precipitation observation stations and data shortage in ca there are relatively few large temporal scale studies on the trends of epes although precipitation reanalysis data products have recently emerged all of them have significantly improved spatial and temporal accuracies the applicability of each data product in ca requires further evaluation based on this we used existing precipitation data from 721 climate observation stations in ca as the criterion and evaluated four reanalysis data products with longer time series higher resolution newer datasets and wider range of use ten epe indices out of 27 climate indices were proposed by the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi crd to characterize epe changes in ca the changes in epes in ca from 1950 to 2019 have been comprehensively analyzed and discussed for an extended period furthermore most correlation analyses between epes and large scale circulation factors have adopted a bivariate analysis method ren et al 2022 that is the influence of a single climate factor on epes few studies have focused on the influence of the interaction of two or more factors therefore we selected 12 large scale climate indices and investigated the contribution of single factor and two factor interactions to epes using the geo detector method gdm the main objectives of this study were as follows a determine the most accurate global reanalysis data product in ca and select the best alternative dataset for observational data in ca b analyze the temporal and spatial trends of epes in ca and c with the help of gdm quantify the influence of large scale climate factors on epes and explore the main influencing mechanism 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area ca is situated in the middle of the eurasian continent remote from the sea and is a well known arid and semiarid region ma et al 2020 as shown in fig 1 a ca mainly includes six parts kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan uzbekistan and xinjiang province china guo et al 2018 yang et al 2020 the terrain of ca is complex and varied including a series of basins e g tarim basin junggar basin and caspian basin

the elevations in western part of kazakhstan and turkmenistan are less than 150 m and those in pamir and kunlun mountains are 7500 m guo et al 2018 guo et al 2021 most areas of ca have a temperate continental climate with cold winters and hot summers scarce precipitation significant evaporation and large annual and daily temperature ranges zhang et al 2017a northern ca is dominated by rain fed agriculture with many irrigated agricultural areas zou et al 2020 affected by climate change and human activities ca suffers from water shortages fragile ecosystems and variable precipitation patterns guo et al 2018 yang et al 2020 based on the daily precipitation in ca from 1950 to 2019 the empirical orthogonal function eof rotated empirical orthogonal function reof and k means cluster analysis were combined to divide sub regions with similar precipitation variation characteristics in ca for details of the method see text s1 we used eof to determine the number of main modes of the six variable fields as the number of clusters in the k means cluster analysis reof to identify the spatial characteristics of the variable field and determined the area with the highest absolute value for each mode as the initial centroid of the k means clustering analysis finally we divided ca into five sub regions as shown in fig 1 b northern central asia nca western central asia wca southern central asia sca mid southern central asia msca and eastern central asia eca 2 2 data 2 2 1 precipitation data the national centers for environmental information ncei https www ncei noaa gov pub data ghcn collects daily observational precipitation data from 721 meteorological observation stations in ca the breakup of the former soviet union and complex geography and unique climatic characteristics of ca have led to the relocation or destruction of meteorological stations interruptions in precipitation observations and missing data records zhang et al 2017b thus necessitating the selection of alternative datasets for precipitation data in ca four reanalysis precipitation data products were selected the fifth generation european center for medium range weather forecasts atmospheric

method was used for bias correction in which the global precipitation climatology centre university of east anglia gpcc and climatic research unit cru on the monthly data were used for bias adjustment 20crv3 w5e5 is a combination of w5e5 v2 0 from 1979 to 2021 and the noaa cires doe 20th century reanalysis version 3 20crv3 data from 1901 to 1978 the homogenization method is the same as gswp3 w5e5 20crv3 era5 is a homogenized composition of 20crv3 from 1901 to 1978 and era5 from 1979 to 2021 in the same manner as gswp3 w5e5 to assess the quality of the reanalysis data products in space we used the collected data from 721 meteorological stations and interpolated each reanalysis dataset to the stations using a linear interpolation method we then filtered the data based on the available daily precipitation data from 721 meteorological stations to obtain 4 reanalysis station datasets with the same spatial and temporal characteristics as those of the meteorological station data for the next evaluation process 2 2 2 large scale climate data previous research has demonstrated that atmospheric circulation sea surface temperature sst anomalies and solar activity significantly impact epes in ca chen et al 2020 hong et al 2022 xie et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 considering the geographical location and climatic background of ca we summarized the existing research results and selected 12 teleconnection indices to study the influence of large scale climate factors on epes in ca see table s1 for details used the q value in the gdm to quantify the contribution rate of large scale climate factors to epes and carried out a two factor interaction analysis for details on gdm see section 2 3 4 the north atlantic oscillation index nao tropical indian ocean dipole index iod total sunspot

collaborative work environment kit https ljp gcess cn dct page 1 2 3 methods 2 3 1 extreme precipitation diagnosis domestic and foreign studies have proposed many methods to measure the intensity frequency and duration of epes presently the most commonly used category is the 11 epe indices 27 extreme climate indices in total proposed by the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi crd considering the universality and authority of the indices we used the 10 epe indices proposed by etccdi crd to characterize epes in ca i e the annual maximum 1 day precipitation rx1day

table s2 for details 2 3 2 evaluation methods for datasets taylor diagrams taylor 2001 can assess the overall simulation skills of models in reproducing spatial patterns of climate variables dong and dong 2021 guo et al 2021 they are one of the most common methods for assessing the property of climate models and dataset suitability yue et al 2021 we interpolated the four reanalysis datasets to the stations respectively and compared them with the observational data the correlation coefficient r central root mean square error rms and standard deviation sd of the four reanalysis datasets and the observational data were reflected in one figure with the taylor diagram which shows the consistency degree of the four reanalysis datasets and the observational data in addition we evaluated the performance of four reanalysis datasets in the annual cycle pattern the main method was to calculate the mean monthly precipitation and total precipitation for each season spring march april and may summer june july and august autumn september october and november winter december january and february from the observational data of the meteorological stations and four reanalysis data products the closer to the observational data the more accurate the reanalysis dataset we comprehensively evaluated the accuracy of the four reanalysis datasets in ca through the taylor diagram method and the performance of the reanalysis datasets in the annual cycle pattern so as to select the best alternative dataset of the observational data for trend analysis of extreme precipitation 2 3 3 statistical method in this study the sen s slope estimation method sen 1968 was used to calculate the trend of epe indices over time and combined with the mann kendall test kendall 1975 mann 1945 to determine the trend significance which is frequently used to examine temporal variations in meteorological data chen et al 2014 hu et al 2016 huang et al 2021 wu et al 2021 xu et al 2018 this method is a non parametric method which has the advantage that the sample does not need to follow a specific probability density distribution nor is it affected by a few outliers huang et al 2021 if there is a linear trend the change per unit time can be obtained using the slope estimation method the significance level is mainly expressed by z when z 1 96 it indicates that the trend is not significant when 1 96 z 2 58 the trend passes the 95 confidence level and when z 2 58 it passes 99 confidence level xu et al 2018 additionally we used the cumulative departure curve method to identify abrupt changes in the epe indices in the time series zhang et al 2019 and divided it into two periods before and after the abrupt changes for comparison and analysis this method represents the cumulative difference between the epe indices and the standard value multi year average after comparing them in the form of a line graph 2 3 4 quantifying the contribution of large scale climate factors the geo detector method gdm is a modern statistical tool for identifying spatial variability and discovering underlying causes yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2022a the core assumption is that if two variables x y have some regularity in the spatial distribution or time series then the independent variable x and dependent variable y have a statistical correlation wang et al 2016 gdm detects the consistency of the distribution pattern between y and x by stratifying or categorizing heterogeneity to measure the degree of explanation of x to y namely the q value the q value means that x explains 100 q y it has been employed in a variety fields of physical and anthropogenic sciences such as earth science local development health care and natural environment wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2022a gdm includes four detectors factor interaction ecological and risk detectors wang and hu 2012 the factor detector mainly detects the extent to which the independent variable x explains the changes in the dependent variable y and the interaction detector can assess whether the joint action of two independent variables x1 and x2 increases or decreases the explanatory power of the dependent variable y we used factor detector and interaction detector to calculate and compare the q of single factor and q after interaction between two factors respectively this indicates the contribution rate of a single large scale climate factor to epes and allows for an evaluation of whether there is an interaction between the two factors as well as the magnitude of the interaction i e whether it is linear or otherwise gdm requires x to be a type quantity based on the principle of the maximum q value we compared the results of the k means clustering method natural breakpoint method jenks and equal width method we finally used the k means method to discretize the large scale climate factors for descriptions of specific methods of gdm please refer to wang and hu 2012 the q value metric expression was calculated as follows 1 q 1 h 1 l n h σ h 2 n σ 2 1 ssw sst where h is the categorization or partition number of x or y n and nh are the number of units in the entire area and layer h respectively σ2 and σh 2 are the variances of the entire area and layer h on dependent variable y ssw is the sum of the variance within the layer sst is the total variance of the entire area q is the explanation contribution rate of the independent variable x to the dependent variable y and the q value range is 0 1 the higher the q the greater the explanatory power of x on y and vice versa 3 results 3 1 precipitation reanalysis dataset evaluation the performance of four reanalysis datasets in ca is shown in fig 2 note that in order to present the results more intuitively we used normalized rms and sd in fig 2 and rms and sd in the analysis see table s3 for details the rs values for era5 20crv3 era5 20crv3 w5e5 and gswp3 w5e5 were 0 74 0 71 0 82 and 0 88 respectively gswp3 w5e5 exhibited the smallest rms value of 16 0 whereas for era5 20crv3 era5 and 20crv3 w5e5 the values were 30 32 29 69 and 19 04 respectively in terms of the sd gswp3 w5e5 was closest to the observational data at 30 10 and 33 15 followed by 20crv3 w5e5 era5 and 20crv3 era5 were both above 40 with a large gap based on the taylor diagram the overall performance of gswp3 w5e5 was better than that of the other datasets in addition we also calculated and compared the rs rmss and sds of reanalysis datasets in each sub region see table s4 for details although there were differences in the performance of reanalysis datasets in sub regions gswp3 w5e5 remained the best performing dataset in sub regions of ca see text s2 for detailed analysis additionally we calculated the average monthly precipitation and total precipitation for each season from the observational data from the climate stations and four reanalysis datasets as evident from fig 3 a the average monthly precipitation trend of the four reanalysis data products and observational data showed good consistency but era5 and 20crv3 era5 exhibited an overall overestimation with the average overestimation being 14 86 and 15 89 mm respectively in contrast 20crv3 w5e5 and gswp3 w5e5 overestimated the precipitation by approximately 2 4 mm from january may and october december fig 3 b shows the seasonal precipitation of each dataset the average overestimation for gswp3 w5e5 was approximately 1 5 to 12 1 mm for 20crv3 w5e5 it was approximately 1 1 to 12 5 mm and for 20crv3 era5 and era5 it was approximately 28 5 53 0 mm and 29 0 49 4 mm respectively gswp3 w5e5 and 20crv3 w5e5 performed better than 20crv3 era5 and era5 in terms of precipitation in each season in summary based on the performance of average monthly precipitation and seasonal precipitation gswp3 w5e5 and 20crv3 w5e5 datasets were closer to the observational data however from the taylor diagram gswp3 w5e5 performed better than other reanalysis datasets therefore we selected gswp3 w5e5 to calculate and analyze the epe indices 3 2 analysis of changes in extreme precipitation indices 3 2 1 temporal variation in extreme precipitation indices using the gswp3 w5e5 dataset we first calculated the epe indices on a 0 5 0 5 grid followed by the averages and trends for the entire ca fig 4 and table s5 present the average annual series of 10 epe indices in ca from 1950 to 2019 except for cdd and cwd the other epe indices displayed significant increasing trends p 0 05 the average values of cdd and cwd were 77 32 and 4 77 d showing significant decreasing rates of 2 82 d 10a p 0 01 and 0 29 d 10a p 0 01 respectively in contrast days with daily precipitation higher than 10 and 20 mm r10mm r20mm showed significant increases at rates of 0 19 d 10a p 0 01 and 0 04 d 10a p 0 01 respectively similarly rx1day rx5day sdii r95p r99p and prcptot all increased at rates of 0 52 p 0 01 0 44 p 0 01 0 09 p 0 01 3 01 p 0 01 1 80 p 0 01 and 3 05 mm 10a p 0 05 respectively therefore the intensity and frequency of epes showed significant increasing trends which verifies the phenomenon of warm humidification in ca identical to the findings of tian et al 2022 and hu et al 2017 additionally we found that rx1day rx5day sdii r10mm r20mm r95p r99p and prcptot showed abrupt changes in 1986 fig s1 cdd showed an abrupt change in 1976 and cwd showed an abrupt change in 1978 as cdd and cwd reflect the longest consecutive period of dry and wet days and had a negligible relationship with the intensity and frequency of epes we finally determined the abrupt change to be in 1986 as listed in table 2 from 1950 to 1985 the average values of rx1day r10mm r95p and prcptot were 14 71 mm 3 39 d 36 64 mm and 224 29 mm respectively the increased rates were 0 29 mm 10a 0 13 d 10a 1 13 mm 10a and 1 85 mm 10a respectively from 1986 to 2019 the average values of rx1day r10mm r95p and prcptot became 16 71 mm 4 06 d 47 84 mm and 237 69 mm respectively the increasing rates became 0 67 mm 10a p 0 05 0 33 d 10a p 0 05 5 26 mm 10a p 0 01 and 3 46 mm 10a respectively additionally the increasing rates for r20mm and r99p accelerated rx5day and cdd showed decreasing trends from 1950 to 1985 but increasing trends from 1986 to 2019 the increasing rates were 0 86 mm 10a and 0 92 d 10a respectively the cwd showed a decreasing trend but the decreasing rate declined indicating an acceleration of the increasing rate of epes note the represents a decreasing trend of extreme precipitation indices the represents a significant level of 5 the represents a significant level of 1 in summary the intensity and frequency of epes in ca showed a significant increasing trend in the time series with abrupt changes occurring in 1986 from 1950 to 1985 epes showed an increasing trend but the rate was relatively slow after 1986 the increased rate of the epe indices was relatively large the increased rate of epes was accelerated 3 2 2 spatial variation in extreme precipitation indices the epe indices for the entire ca showed a significant increasing trend except for cdd and cwd approximately 73 99 of the grids of the other eight indices showed positive increasing trends however the epe indices showed heterogeneity among the five sub regions taking prcptot as an example fig s2 shows that the average values in msca and eca were 431 26 and 88 21 mm respectively with a large gap as shown in fig 5 89 91 71 and 53 of the grids in nca eca msca and sca showed increasing trends and the increasing rates were 8 88 p 0 01 2 75 p 0 01 2 46 and 0 53 mm 10a respectively while prcptot in wca decreased at a rate of 0 06 mm 10a approximately 92 of the grids in eca showed decreasing trends of cdd and the decreasing rate of 6 51 d 10a p 0 01 additionally rx1day rx5day r10mm r20mm r95p and r99p increased the fastest in nca sdii increased the fastest in msca the significance level was also above 1 overall epes in nca increased significantly and at the fastest rate followed by those in msca eca and wca epes in sca increased slightly 3 3 influence of large scale climate factors on extreme precipitation 3 3 1 contribution of single large scale climate factor fig 6 shows the contribution rates of the large scale climate factors to epe indices and the specific q values are shown in table s7 as can be seen from fig 6 the contribution rate of nsi to the epe indices in ca was the largest with an average contribution rate of 44 32 and the largest contribution rates of nsi to rx1day r20mm cdd and r99p were 45 the average contribution rate of ninob to the epe indices was 43 80 and the contribution rates to sdii r10mm cwd and r95p were 40 additionally the average contribution rates of the amo and sca were 27 91 and 26 62 respectively while those of the ami pol nao and tsn were all 10 as a whole nsi ninob amo and sca were the largest contributors to epes across ca at the same time it is indirectly proved that there is a correlation between epe indices and that the influence of large scale climate factors on the intensity frequency and duration of epes is similar fig 6 and table s7 also show the contribution rates of large scale climate factors to the epe indices in the sub regions in the sub regions the influence of various factors on the epe indices was different both ninob and nsi contributed significantly to the changes in epe indices and were the common driving factors in the five sub regions in addition the factors influencing epes in wca and eca were very similar mainly considering amo and sca however the differences in other sub regions were obvious azi had a greater influence on the epes in the sca iod has a prominent contribution in the nca and eam and amo had a greater impact in the msca 3 3 2 influence of the interaction of large scale climate factors we conducted a two factor interaction study based on the 12 large scale climate factors we used the interaction detector in the gdm to analyze the contribution rates of the two factors acting together with the epe indices both nonlinear enhancement q x1 x2 q x1 q x2 and two factor enhancement q x1 x2 max q x1 q x2 were observed in this study in ca the effect of two factor interactions on epe indices was clearly larger than that of a single factor as shown in fig 7 sam nsi had the strongest explanatory power for r95p and r99p accounting for 74 3 and 80 28 respectively with both showing nonlinear enhancement tsn nsi had the strongest explanatory power for rx5day r10mm and prcptot which were 68 20 69 47 and 69 33 respectively the explanatory power of iod nsi for rx1day eam nsi for sdii and r20mm iod sca for cdd and ninob amo for cwd was also very high 70 and all showed nonlinear enhancement the explanatory power of most of the other two factor interactions on the epe indices exhibited nonlinear enhancement illustrating that the explanatory power of most of the two factor interactions on the epe indices was far greater than that of the simple sum of the two factors as shown in fig 8 and table s8 in the sub regions the contribution rates of the interaction of climate factors to the epe indices showed significant differences nsi iod and nsi tsn had a great influence on epes in nca in the msca eam amo and iod nsi contributed significantly to most epe indices epes in wca was greatly influenced by ninob azi while eca was greatly influenced by ninob ami in sca azi nsi iod tsn and ninob azi had an impact on the epe indices we also found that most of the two factor interactions showed nonlinear enhancement but some showed a double factor enhancement in msca taking cwd as an example the contribution rate of ninob was 36 68 and that of azi was 21 16 whereas that of ninob azi was 55 41 which showed a double factor enhancement ninob nsi ninob sca and nsi sca also have a great contribution fig s3 shows the effects of the two factor interactions on other epe indices 4 discussion 4 1 applicability of gswp3 w5e5 dataset in central asia due to the scarcity of precipitation observation stations and the shortage of data in ca we had to choose an alternative dataset for the study of epes currently commonly used alternative datasets mainly include reanalysis data products and satellite precipitation products however most satellite precipitation products show less frequency of light and heavy precipitation shen et al 2010 zhao et al 2018 thereby underestimating the increase of epes in ca yang et al 2020 therefore the accuracy of reanalysis data products is very important for the study of epes in ca we selected four reanalysis datasets for comprehensive evaluation and we found that gswp3 w5e5 has the best performance in ca but 20crv3 era5 and era5 had poor characterization effects and overestimations this is consistent with the findings of sun et al 2021 however the performance of gswp3 w5e5 in different sub regions varied overall the applicability of gswp3 w5e5 in eca was higher than that in other sub regions whereas in msca the applicability of gswp3 w5e5 was relatively weak mainly owing to the high altitude and complex environmental conditions such as glaciers and snow cover thus leading to greater uncertainty yang et al 2020 gswp3 w5e5 demonstrated good applicability in ca which can be attributed to the advantages of its original datasets and bias correction method gswp3 w5e5 was composed of gswp3 and w5e5 data pieced together using the isimip3basd method lange 2019 gswp3 is based on the 20th century reanalysis dataset 20cr and is obtained through spectral fine tuning technology single integrated correction vertical weighted damping and other methods using gpcc precipitation observation data for bias correction yin et al 2018 the dataset was relatively stable in quality in the mid 20th century mengel et al 2021 and has been used in a number of climate impact assessments chang et al 2017 mengel et al 2021 schewe et al 2019 w5e5 combines land data from the wfde5 v2 0 dataset and ocean data from the era5 dataset mengel et al 2021 its original dataset uses more observation data than gswp3 and is therefore considered a more realistic dataset mengel et al 2021 the isimip3basd method mainly includes bias adjustment and statistical downscaling in which the bias adjustment is done using gpcc and cru on monthly data the advantage of this method lies in more robust deviation adjustment for extreme values and better preservation of the trend of each quantile lange 2019 the high accuracy and long time series of gswp3 w5e5 in ca provide data support for the study of epes in cases of limited observation data availability utilizing reanalysis data as a substitute is an effective approach therefore the accuracy of the reanalysis dataset was always the focus of study and seeking a higher accuracy and continuing to reduce the uncertainty of the dataset is still our goal 4 2 main influencing factors and driving mechanism of extreme precipitation in central asia we calculated the contributions of 12 large scale climate factors to 10 epe indices using gdm and found that the nsi ninob amo and sca had the largest contribution rates to epes in ca most of the two factor interactions showed nonlinear growth among them nsi iod nsi eam and nsi tsn had the largest contribution rates to epes in ca in agreement with the findings of zhang et al 2022a and ren et al 2022 who discovered that the combined effect of multiple factors has a more significant impact on epes than any single factor alone an abrupt change in epes took place in 1986 which is consistent with the findings of zhang et al 2019 and chen et al 2014 chen et al 2014 also found that the tibet plateau b index had an abrupt change in 1985 epes in northwest china had an abrupt change around 1986 and the two were significantly correlated therefore they inferred that the tibet plateau b index was an key contributor for the abrupt change in epes to explore the main reasons for the abrupt change in epes in ca in 1986 we used the cumulative anomaly method to examine the abrupt years for the 12 large scale climate indices fig s4 we found that ninob iod eam and nsi were mutated in 1986 azi was mutated in 1985 similar to the results obtained when exploring the possible factors affecting epes in ca using gdm the nsi ninob azi iod and eam may play important roles in the changes and abrupt changes in epes in ca large scale circulation changes were the main cause of epes in ca we combined the gdm results with that of existing studies to ascertain the main water vapor sources in ca and describe the atmospheric circulation activities that have important effects on epes in ca as shown in fig 9 ca lies in the key area of the westerly mode chen et al 2019 the change in westerly circulation is the main factor affecting precipitation in this region bothe et al 2012 chen et al 2011 liu et al 2018 the westerly circulation becomes stronger as the westerly index azi raises flow at 45 60 n speeds up on the 500 hpa isobaric surface zhang et al 2022a the results showed that westerly transport from the north atlantic and monsoon transport from the indian ocean and south china sea are important water vapor sources in ca chen et al 2020 xie et al 2021 temperature anomalies affect the timing of monsoons luo et al 2016 and ninob and iod which mainly represent the characteristics of sst changes in the indian ocean both had an upward trend growing by 0 015 and 0 0019 per year respectively during the study period amo has been in the warm phase since the late 1990s i e the surface of the north atlantic has been abnormally warm therefore with the increase in water vapor in the air the increase in the sst in the indian ocean may increase convection in the tropical indian ocean thus affecting convective precipitation in ca and southwest asia zhang et al 2022b through the quasi stationary wave train near 30 n the rise in the sst in the mid bottom latitudes of the north atlantic strengthens the anticyclonic anomalies over the indian peninsula and east asia and facilitates the movement of water vapor from the southwest to ca ma et al 2021 the influence of sst variation on precipitation is mainly reflected in the northern and southern ca water vapor from the north atlantic ocean indian ocean and a small amount from the arctic ocean converge to jointly affect winter and summer precipitation in the northern and southern ca xie et al 2021 additionally the large anticyclonic circulation near the arabian sea in winter strengthens water vapor transport from the arabian sea and north indian ocean to the tarim basin in ca bothe et al 2012 xie et al 2021 in summer anomalous water vapor over northern ca is related to the negative height anomaly near ca and the positive height anomaly near the arctic ocean leading to the transport of high latitude water vapor along the western border of the northern ca cyclone xie et al 2021 the northern cyclone anomaly dominates winter wetting in northeastern ca bothe et al 2012 since 1958 the eam has continued to weaken followed by a westward expansion of the western pacific subtropical high and an enhance in anticyclonic activity over mongolia resulting in an increased contribution of monsoon water vapor transport to precipitation in ca chen et al 2020 in this study the nsi showed an increasing trend which also verified this result in winter the negative nao may lead to a positive anomaly on the south side and a negative anomaly on the north side of ca the enhanced pressure gradient and abnormal westerly winds together yield more water vapor transport to ca huang et al 2013 aizen et al 2001 also found that the indices for the nao and western pacific oscillation wpo were inversely associated with the average precipitation in the mountains and plains of ca enso has exhibited an increasing trend in the last 60 years zhang et al 2022a the temperature rise in the indian ocean has been shown to an aspect of the enso signal the low pressure anomaly caused by enso strengthens the southwesterly and westerly winds from the indian and north atlantic oceans zhang et al 2018 thereby yielding a large amount of water vapor transport to ca xie et al 2021 ma et al 2020 found that the east atlanto west russia pattern changed negatively after 1999 resulting in abnormal negative and positive potential heights over ca and deepening of the trough in northern ca this was accompanied by abnormal water vapor transport from southern to eastern ca providing favorable conditions for the rise in precipitation and epes hong et al 2022 showed that more frequent epes are influenced by similar dipole patterns in the upper troposphere anomalous cyclones anticyclones in the west southeast troposphere and local anomalous cyclones in the lower troposphere the dipole model leads to anomalous divergence of the upper troposphere and formation of compensatory upward movement over the region and local anomalous cyclones lead to water vapor convergence which provides favorable dynamic and moisture conditions for epes in ca the siberian high and tibet plateau b index may also have important effects on climatic extremes in ca zhang et al 2019 the causes and mechanisms of epes are complex and multifaceted and its driving mechanisms are intricate our study focused on the influence of atmospheric circulation factors on epes in ca additionally global anthropogenic warming may promote atmospheric coupling at high middle and low latitudes increasing water vapor transport at lower latitudes and thus leading to increased winter precipitation in ca rakhmatova et al 2021 at the same time human activities can also change the time variability of annual precipitation konapala et al 2017 zou et al 2021b factors such as high vegetation coverage or coastal and lake conditions can increase air humidity and lead to more precipitation while high mountains can impede water vapor and lead to less precipitation therefore human activities ecosystems natural environments and meteorological elements have significant impacts on epes gao et al 2018 mukherjee et al 2018 zou et al 2021a and the effects of these factors differ in different regions therefore future research should comprehensively and systematically analyze the driving mechanisms of epes in ca at the same time past present and future changes in the mechanisms of epes require further investigation 5 conclusions in this study we evaluated the performance of four reanalysis precipitation products in ca analyzed the spatial and temporal trends of epes in ca from 1950 to 2019 and explored the main large scale climate factors affecting epes and their driving mechanisms the conclusions are as follows 1 gswp3 w5e5 was found to be the most accurate dataset and is therefore the best alternative dataset for examining epes in ca 2 the intensity frequency and duration of epes in ca exhibited a significant annual increase in the time series an abrupt change was detected in 1986 after which the rate of increase of the epe indices increased significantly 3 epes showed regional variations the rate of increase in nca was significantly higher than in other sub regions 4 the increase in epes was closely related to changes in the nsi ninob azi and amo the combined effect of the two factors was more significant than that of the single factor our analysis further revealed that westerly circulation was the main factor influencing precipitation in ca the abnormal warming of the sst and other factors resulted in a series of cyclones and anticyclonic anomalies in the westerly circulation zone which strengthen water vapor transport in ca leading to an increase in epes credit authorship contribution statement wei wei conceptualization

2042,increased sea surface temperature evaporation air temperature and moisture holding capacity associated with climate change may the enhance transport of moisture to central asia ca resulting in increased extreme precipitation events epes changes in epes may affect the socioeconomic and ecological environment in typical arid and semi arid regions of ca therefore based on meteorological station data and four reanalyzed precipitation datasets we used the taylor diagram geo detector method and other methods to examine 10 epe indices in ca from 1950 to 2019 analyzed their spatial temporal trends and quantified the influence of large scale climate factors on epes the results showed that gswp3 w5e5 was the optimal option with better performance in terms of monthly and annual precipitation in ca overall epes in ca showed an increasing trend but an abrupt point was found in 1986 when very wet day precipitation r95p increased from 36 64 to 47 84 mm the increasing rate also changed from 0 8 to 5 06 mm 10a the changes in the northern hemisphere subtropical high intensity index nsi nino b area sea surface temperature anomaly index ninob asian zonal circulation index and atlantic multidecadal oscillation index are the main reasons for the increase in epes the nsi and ninob had the largest contributions to epes with at 44 32 and 43 80 respectively additionally two factor interactions had a more significant influence further analysis revealed that the abnormal warming of sea surface temperature and others led to the strengthen of water vapor transport in ca caused by a series of cyclones and anticyclonic anomalies in the westerly circulation zone leading to the increase of epes the results obtained in this study can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the changes in epes and provide a reference for water resource management and disaster prevention in ca keywords extreme precipitation gswp3 w5e5 large scale climate factors central

predictions with respect to extreme precipitation events epes have become the focus of climate research deng et al 2018 donat et al 2016 duan et al 2019 wasko and nathan 2019 the intensity of epes has increased with an increase in the global mean surface temperature myhre et al 2019 the clausius clapeyron law states that a warmer atmosphere has higher water vapor holding capacity pińskwar et al 2019 an increased water holding capacity can potentially intensify the hydrological cycle process leading to an increase in epes han et al 2019 an increase in epes may lead to or aggravate a number of social economic and environmental problems on a global scale in particular it has severe influences for agriculture industry health and water pollution howarth et al 2019 pall et al 2011 rajeevan et al 2008 wang et al 2022b over the last few decades an overall increase in epes has been recorded duan et al 2013 mukherjee et al 2018 which is strongly related to anthropogenic increases in atmospheric temperature and associated moisture content balling et al 2016 this also implies greater risks and challenges for the future chang et al 2020 therefore we must monitor and forecast epes to reduce human losses research on epes is extensive and diverse covering global zolina et al 2010 intercontinental fleig et al 2015 panthou et al 2014 regional howarth et al 2019 shawul and chakma 2020 and national scales peng et al 2018 scherrer et al 2016 most findings show that the epe intensity has grown and will continue do so in the future however some differences have been observed at intercontinental regional and national scales for example epe indices show an increasing trend in asia south america and most of northwestern north america donat et al 2013 myhre et al 2019 concluded that the increase in annual total precipitation when the daily precipitation amount 99 percentile r99p and r99 97p was typically higher in europe and japan than that in the united states or australia while epe trend decreased significantly in africa panthou et al 2014 more frequent and more intense extreme events in the northeastern united states have been linked to factors such as tropical moisture frei et al 2015 howarth et al 2019 with rainfall of 24 h accumulated 150 mm increasing in frequency by 317 and the annual maximum daily precipitation increasing by a total of 58 mm howarth et al 2019 various regions within a single country may experience differing levels of epes mukherjee et al 2018 noted that epes have become more frequent and intense in india over the past few decades under the influence of anthropogenic warming whereas the maximum annual precipitation in the ganges plain has decreased due to the decrease in monsoon season precipitation in china 56 44 intensity and 66 23 frequency of rainfall stations have shown an increasing trend deng et al 2018 under the future 4 k climate projection scenario in which surface temperatures are 4 k higher than in pre industrial levels condition the annual average maximum precipitation in southern china may increase by approximately 18 compared with that in the past duan et al 2019 whereas epes in northern china have shown a decreasing trend peng et al 2018 in addition summer precipitation and the frequency of epes in arid northwest china have increased ning et al 2021 as a typical arid and semi arid region central asia ca has fragile ecosystems that are highly sensitive to climate change and resulting extreme events peng et al 2020 ma et al 2020 hu et al 2017 showed that the precipitation in ca increased slightly where epes showed an increasing trend the total summer precipitation epes and persistent epes in northern kazakhstan and the tianshan mountains showed a significantly increasing trend ma et al 2020 a gradual increase from mild to epes increases the risk of future flooding and soil erosion disasters yang et al 2020 therefore we must analyze the changes in epes in ca however the complex geographical environment and unique climate characteristics of ca lead to an uneven distribution of meteorological stations and lack of meteorological data in contrast reanalysis data products generally have continuous time series and broad coverage which provides optimal data support for examining epes in ca large scale atmospheric circulation plays a vital role in increasing epes blanc et al 2021 hong et al 2022 irannezhad et al 2022 shang et al 2022 xie et al 2021 recent studies have increased their focus on regional climate variability and large scale atmospheric circulation atif et al 2020 used frequency composite and correlation analyses to evaluate the statistics of epes and its teleconnections showing that the mid latitude circular global wave train cgt is associated with the el niño southern oscillation enso which affects the frequency of epes the impact of enso on the increase of epes is mainly through increasing the frequency of epes in winter gao et al 2020 methods such as the continuous wavelet transform cross wavelet transform wavelet transform coherence and pearson correlation have also been applied to the analysis of climate change and its driving factors agarwal et al 2016 guo et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 have shown that the sunspot number ssn and enso affect epe changes mainly by inhibiting or enhancing convection ren et al 2022 showed that the pacific north american teleconnection pna enso arctic oscillation ao and enso ao pna separately or simultaneously affect epe changes precipitation and epes are complex and diverse in ca studies have shown that the increase of the northern hemisphere subtropical high intensity nsi is conducive to the westward extension of the western pacific subtropical high and the westward transport of water vapor in the indian and pacific oceans chen et al 2020 changes in indices such as the tropical indian ocean dipole index iod and atlantic multidecadal oscillation index amo increase the water holding capacity of the atmosphere and zhang et al 2022a found that amo has an important effect on epes in tianshan mountains the asian zonal circulation index azi and asian meridional circulation index ami increased and the banded circulation was strengthened which enhanced water vapor transport and increased in epes hong et al 2022 found that combined the north atlantic oscillation nao and polar eurasian pattern pol affect the frequency of epes in western siberia while eastern siberia is influenced by scandinavian pattern sca additionally enso indian summer monsoon east asian summer monsoon eastern atlantic western russia negative phase enhanced horizontal and vertical advection and southern water vapor anomalies provide favorable conditions for epes in ca chen et al 2020 ma et al 2020 xie et al 2021 the convergence of water vapor anomalies from the arctic north atlantic and western pacific in northern ca also produce extensive epes in adjacent areas wang et al 2022a the fluctuation in precipitation and epes in ca is related to many factors such as the water cycle atmospheric circulation sea temperature anomalies and thermal anomalies over the qinghai tibet plateau and iranian plateau further increased sea surface temperature evaporation air temperature and moisture holding capacity associated with climate change may enhance transport of moisture to continental sites zhang et al 2017c 2023 even those far removed from ocean sources of moisture such as ca which is the most distant point from oceans of any region on earth large scale climate factors affect sea surface temperature and moisture storage capacity shen et al 2022 among others thus causing changes in epes therefore we seek a new method to quantify the influence of large scale climate factors on epes due to the scarcity of precipitation observation stations and data shortage in ca there are relatively few large temporal scale studies on the trends of epes although precipitation reanalysis data products have recently emerged all of them have significantly improved spatial and temporal accuracies the applicability of each data product in ca requires further evaluation based on this we used existing precipitation data from 721 climate observation stations in ca as the criterion and evaluated four reanalysis data products with longer time series higher resolution newer datasets and wider range of use ten epe indices out of 27 climate indices were proposed by the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi crd to characterize epe changes in ca the changes in epes in ca from 1950 to 2019 have been comprehensively analyzed and discussed for an extended period furthermore most correlation analyses between epes and large scale circulation factors have adopted a bivariate analysis method ren et al 2022 that is the influence of a single climate factor on epes few studies have focused on the influence of the interaction of two or more factors therefore we selected 12 large scale climate indices and investigated the contribution of single factor and two factor interactions to epes using the geo detector method gdm the main objectives of this study were as follows a determine the most accurate global reanalysis data product in ca and select the best alternative dataset for observational data in ca b analyze the temporal and spatial trends of epes in ca and c with the help of gdm quantify the influence of large scale climate factors on epes and explore the main influencing mechanism 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area ca is situated in the middle of the eurasian continent remote from the sea and is a well known arid and semiarid region ma et al 2020 as shown in fig 1 a ca mainly includes six parts kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan uzbekistan and xinjiang province china guo et al 2018 yang et al 2020 the terrain of ca is complex and varied including a series of basins e g tarim basin junggar basin and caspian basin plains e g northern plain of kazakhstan and mountains e g tianshan and kunlun mountains wang et al 2022a yang et al 2020 as well as vast deserts and gobi such as taklimakan and karakum guo et al 2018 the elevations in western part of kazakhstan and turkmenistan are less than 150 m and those in pamir and kunlun mountains are 7500 m guo et al 2018 guo et al 2021 most areas of ca have a temperate continental climate with cold winters and hot summers scarce precipitation significant evaporation and large annual and daily temperature ranges zhang et al 2017a northern ca is dominated by rain fed agriculture with many irrigated agricultural areas zou et al 2020 affected by climate change and human activities ca suffers from water shortages fragile ecosystems and variable precipitation patterns guo et al 2018 yang et al 2020 based on the daily precipitation in ca from 1950 to 2019 the empirical orthogonal function eof rotated empirical orthogonal function reof and k means cluster analysis were combined to divide sub regions with similar precipitation variation characteristics in ca for details of the method see text s1 we used eof to determine the number of main modes of the six variable fields as the number of clusters in the k means cluster analysis reof to identify the spatial characteristics of the variable field and determined the area with the highest absolute value for each mode as the initial centroid of the k means clustering analysis finally we divided ca into five sub regions as shown in fig 1 b northern central asia nca western central asia wca southern central asia sca mid southern central asia msca and eastern central asia eca 2 2 data 2 2 1 precipitation data the national centers for environmental information ncei https www ncei noaa gov pub data ghcn collects daily observational precipitation data from 721 meteorological observation stations in ca the breakup of the former soviet union and complex geography and unique climatic characteristics of ca have led to the relocation or destruction of meteorological stations interruptions in precipitation observations and missing data records zhang et al 2017b thus necessitating the selection of alternative datasets for precipitation data in ca four reanalysis precipitation data products were selected the fifth generation european center for medium range weather forecasts atmospheric reanalysis era5 third phase of global soil wetness project the watch forcing data methodology to era5 data on land and era5 data for the ocean gswp3 w5e5 the 20th century reanalysis version 3 era5

precipitation products table 1 era5 is a fifth generation reanalysis dataset https www ecmwf int released by the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf it integrates three models for the atmosphere land and ocean while combining model data model forecasts with global observational data using the laws of physics to form a complete and consistent global dataset in terms of precision and accuracy it has certain advantages hassler and lauer 2021 rakhmatova et al 2021 we converted the hourly precipitation data original horizontal resolution of 0 1 0 1 into daily precipitation data before proceeding to the next evaluation gswp3 w5e5 20crv3 era5 and 20crv3 w5e5 were obtained from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip https www isimip org with a horizontal resolution of 0 5 0 5 the gswp3 w5e5 product is a merged dataset gswp3 is the third phase of the global soil wetness project gswp3 v1 09 product from 1901 to 1978 and w5e5 1979 2019 applies the watch forcing data methodology to era5 wfde5 data on land and era5 data for the ocean to reduce the discontinuity during the 1978 1979 transition period in the homogenization process the isimip3basd v2 5 1 method was used for bias correction in which the global precipitation climatology centre university of east anglia gpcc and climatic research unit cru on the monthly data were used for bias adjustment 20crv3 w5e5 is a combination of w5e5 v2 0 from 1979 to 2021 and the noaa cires doe 20th century reanalysis version 3 20crv3 data from 1901 to 1978 the homogenization method is the same as gswp3 w5e5 20crv3 era5 is a homogenized composition of 20crv3 from 1901 to 1978 and era5 from 1979 to 2021 in the same manner as gswp3 w5e5 to assess the quality of the reanalysis data products in space we used the collected data from 721 meteorological stations and interpolated each reanalysis dataset to the stations using a linear interpolation method we then filtered the data based on the available daily precipitation data from 721 meteorological stations to obtain 4 reanalysis station datasets with the same spatial and temporal characteristics as those of the meteorological station data for the next evaluation process 2 2 2 large scale climate data previous research has demonstrated that atmospheric circulation sea surface temperature sst anomalies and solar activity significantly impact epes in ca chen et al 2020 hong et al 2022 xie et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 considering the geographical location and climatic background of ca we summarized the existing research results and selected 12 teleconnection indices to study the influence of large scale climate factors on epes in ca see table s1 for details used the q value in the gdm to quantify the contribution rate of large scale climate factors to epes and carried out a two factor interaction analysis for details on gdm see section 2 3 4 the north atlantic oscillation index nao tropical indian ocean dipole index iod total sunspot number index tsn nino b area sst anomaly index ninob asian zonal circulation index azi asian meridional circulation index ami northern hemisphere subtropical high intensity index nsi atlantic multidecadal oscillation index amo polar eurasian pattern index pol and scandinavian pattern index sca were obtained from 130 climate system indices from the national climate center at the china climate administration https cmdp ncc cma net monitoring cn index 130 php additionally the east asian summer monsoon index eam and south asian summer monsoon index sam were obtained from a collaborative work environment kit https ljp gcess cn dct page 1 2 3 methods 2 3 1 extreme precipitation diagnosis domestic and foreign studies have proposed many methods to measure the intensity frequency and duration of epes presently the most commonly used category is the 11 epe indices 27 extreme climate indices in total proposed by the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi crd considering the universality and authority of the indices we used the 10 epe indices proposed by etccdi crd to characterize epes in ca i e the annual maximum 1 day precipitation rx1day annual maximum consecutive 5 day precipitation rx5day simple precipitation intensity index sdii annual count of days when the daily precipitation amount 10 mm r10 mm annual count of days when the

annual total precipitation when the daily precipitation amount 95p r95p annual total precipitation when the daily precipitation amount 99p r99p and annual total precipitation on wet days prcptot see table s2 for details 2 3 2 evaluation methods for datasets taylor diagrams taylor 2001 can assess the overall simulation skills of models in reproducing spatial patterns of climate variables dong and dong 2021 guo et al 2021 they are one of the most common methods for assessing the property of climate models and dataset suitability yue et al 2021 we interpolated the four reanalysis datasets to the stations respectively and compared them with the observational data the correlation coefficient r central root mean square error rms and standard deviation sd of the four reanalysis datasets and the observational data were reflected in one figure with the taylor diagram which shows the consistency degree of the four reanalysis datasets and the observational data in addition we evaluated the performance of four reanalysis datasets in the annual cycle pattern the main method was to calculate the mean monthly precipitation and total precipitation for each season spring march april and may summer june july and august autumn september october and november winter december january and february from the observational data of the meteorological stations and four reanalysis data products the closer to the observational data the more accurate the reanalysis dataset we comprehensively evaluated the accuracy of the four reanalysis datasets in ca through the taylor diagram method and the performance of the reanalysis datasets in the annual cycle pattern so as to select the best alternative dataset of the observational data for trend analysis of extreme precipitation 2 3 3 statistical method in this study the sen s slope estimation method sen 1968 was used to calculate the trend of epe indices over time and combined with the mann kendall test kendall 1975 mann 1945 to determine the trend significance which is frequently used to examine temporal variations in meteorological data chen et al 2014 hu et al 2016 huang et al 2021 wu et al 2021 xu et al 2018 this method is a non parametric method which has the advantage that the sample does not need to follow a specific probability density distribution nor is it affected by a few outliers huang et al 2021 if there is a linear trend the change per unit time can be obtained using the slope estimation method the significance level is mainly expressed by z when z 1 96 it indicates that the trend is not significant when 1 96 z 2 58 the trend passes the 95 confidence level and when z 2 58 it passes 99 confidence level xu et al 2018 additionally we used the cumulative departure curve method to identify abrupt changes in the epe indices in the time series zhang et al 2019 and divided it into two periods before and after the abrupt changes for comparison and analysis this method represents the cumulative difference between the epe indices and the standard value multi year average after comparing them in the form of a line graph 2 3 4 quantifying the contribution of large scale climate factors the geo detector method gdm is a modern statistical tool for identifying spatial variability and discovering underlying causes yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2022a the core assumption is that if two variables x y have some regularity in the spatial distribution or time series then the independent variable x and dependent variable y have a statistical correlation wang et al 2016 gdm detects the consistency of the distribution pattern between y and x by stratifying or categorizing heterogeneity to measure the degree of explanation of x to y namely the q value the q value means that x explains 100 q y it has been employed in a variety fields of physical and anthropogenic sciences such as earth science local development health care and natural environment wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2022a gdm includes four detectors factor interaction ecological and risk detectors wang and hu 2012 the factor detector mainly detects the extent to which the independent variable x explains the changes in the dependent variable y and the interaction detector can assess whether the joint action of two independent variables x1 and x2 increases or decreases the explanatory power of the dependent variable y we used factor detector and interaction detector to calculate and compare the q of single factor and q after interaction between two factors respectively this indicates the contribution rate of a single large scale climate factor to epes and allows for an evaluation of whether there is an interaction between the two factors as well as the magnitude of the interaction i e whether it is linear or otherwise gdm requires x to be a type quantity based on the principle of the maximum q value we compared the results of the k means clustering method natural breakpoint method jenks and equal width method we finally used the k means method to discretize the large scale climate factors for descriptions of specific methods of gdm please refer to wang and hu 2012 the q value metric expression was calculated as follows 1 q 1 h 1 l n h σ h 2 n σ 2 1 ssw sst where h is the categorization or partition number of x or y n and nh are the number of units in the entire area and layer h respectively σ2 and σh 2 are the variances of the entire area and layer h on dependent variable y ssw is the sum of the variance within the layer sst is the total variance of the entire area q is the explanation contribution rate of the independent variable x to the dependent variable y and the q value range is 0 1 the higher the q the greater the explanatory power of x on y and vice versa 3 results 3 1 precipitation reanalysis dataset evaluation the performance of four reanalysis datasets in ca is shown in fig 2 note that in order to present the results more intuitively we used normalized rms and sd in fig 2 and rms and sd in the analysis see table s3 for details the rs values for era5 20crv3 era5 20crv3 w5e5 and gswp3 w5e5 were 0 74 0 71 0 82 and 0 88 respectively gswp3 w5e5 exhibited the smallest rms value of 16 0 whereas for era5 20crv3 era5 and 20crv3 w5e5 the values were 30 32 29 69 and 19 04 respectively in terms of the sd gswp3 w5e5 was closest to the observational data at 30 10 and 33 15 followed by 20crv3 w5e5 era5 and 20crv3 era5 were both above 40 with a large gap based on the taylor diagram the overall performance of gswp3 w5e5 was better than that of the other datasets in addition we also calculated and compared the rs rmss and sds of reanalysis datasets in each sub region see table s4 for details although there were differences in the performance of reanalysis datasets in sub regions gswp3 w5e5 remained the best performing dataset in sub regions of ca see text s2 for detailed analysis additionally we calculated the average monthly precipitation and total precipitation for each season from the observational data from the climate stations and four reanalysis datasets as evident from fig 3 a the average monthly precipitation trend of the four reanalysis data products and observational data showed good consistency but era5 and 20crv3 era5 exhibited an overall overestimation with the average overestimation being 14 86 and 15 89 mm respectively in contrast 20crv3 w5e5 and gswp3 w5e5 overestimated the precipitation by approximately 2 4 mm from january may and october december fig 3 b shows the seasonal precipitation of each dataset the average overestimation for gswp3 w5e5 was approximately 1 5 to 12 1 mm for 20crv3 w5e5 it was approximately 1 1 to 12 5 mm and for 20crv3 era5 and era5 it was approximately 28 5 53 0 mm and 29 0 49 4 mm respectively gswp3 w5e5 and 20crv3 w5e5 performed better than 20crv3 era5 and era5 in terms of precipitation in each season in summary based on the performance of average monthly precipitation and seasonal precipitation gswp3 w5e5 and 20crv3 w5e5 datasets were closer to the observational data however from the taylor diagram gswp3 w5e5 performed better than other reanalysis datasets therefore we selected gswp3 w5e5 to calculate and analyze the epe indices 3 2 analysis of changes in extreme precipitation indices 3 2 1 temporal variation in extreme precipitation indices using the gswp3 w5e5 dataset we first calculated the epe indices on a 0 5 0 5 grid followed by the averages and trends for the entire ca fig 4 and table s5 present the average annual series of 10 epe indices in ca from 1950 to 2019 except for cdd and cwd the other epe indices displayed significant increasing trends p 0 05 the average values of cdd and cwd were 77 32 and 4 77 d showing significant decreasing rates of 2 82 d 10a p 0 01 and 0 29 d 10a p 0 01 respectively in contrast days with daily precipitation higher than 10 and 20 mm r10mm r20mm showed significant increases at rates of 0 19 d 10a p 0 01 and 0 04 d 10a p 0 01 respectively similarly rx1day rx5day sdii r95p r99p and prcptot all increased at rates of 0 52 p 0 01 0 44 p 0 01 0 09 p 0 01 3 01 p 0 01 1 80 p 0 01 and 3 05 mm 10a p 0 05 respectively therefore the intensity and frequency of epes showed significant increasing trends which verifies the phenomenon of warm humidification in ca identical to the findings of tian et al 2022 and hu et al 2017 additionally we found that rx1day rx5day sdii r10mm r20mm r95p r99p and prcptot showed abrupt changes in 1986 fig s1 cdd showed an abrupt change in 1976 and cwd showed an abrupt change in 1978 as cdd and cwd reflect the longest consecutive period of dry and wet days and had a negligible relationship with the intensity and frequency of epes we finally determined the abrupt change to be in 1986 as listed in table 2 from 1950 to 1985 the average values of rx1day r10mm r95p and prcptot were 14 71 mm 3 39 d 36 64 mm and 224 29 mm respectively the increased rates were 0 29 mm 10a 0 13 d 10a 1 13 mm 10a and 1 85 mm 10a respectively from 1986 to 2019 the average values of rx1day r10mm r95p and prcptot became 16 71 mm 4 06 d 47 84 mm and 237 69 mm respectively the increasing rates became 0 67 mm 10a p 0 05 0 33 d 10a p 0 05 5 26 mm 10a p 0 01 and 3 46 mm 10a respectively additionally the increasing rates for r20mm and r99p accelerated rx5day and cdd showed decreasing trends from 1950 to 1985 but increasing trends from 1986 to 2019 the increasing rates were 0 86 mm 10a and 0 92 d 10a respectively the cwd showed a decreasing trend but the decreasing rate declined indicating an acceleration of the increasing rate of epes note the represents a decreasing trend of extreme precipitation indices the represents a significant level of 5 the represents a significant level of 1 in summary the intensity and frequency of epes in ca showed a significant increasing trend in the time series with abrupt changes occurring in 1986 from 1950 to 1985 epes showed an increasing trend but the rate was relatively slow after 1986 the increased rate of the epe indices was relatively large the increased rate of epes was accelerated 3 2 2 spatial variation in extreme precipitation indices the epe indices for the entire ca showed a significant increasing trend except for cdd and cwd approximately 73 99 of the grids of the other eight indices showed positive increasing trends however the epe indices showed heterogeneity among the five sub regions taking prcptot as an example fig s2 shows that the average values in msca and eca were 431 26 and 88 21 mm respectively with a large gap as shown in fig 5 89 91 71 and 53 of the grids in nca eca msca and sca showed increasing trends and the increasing rates were 8 88 p 0 01 2 75 p 0 01 2 46 and 0 53 mm 10a respectively while prcptot in wca decreased at a rate of 0 06 mm 10a approximately 92 of the grids in eca showed decreasing trends of cdd and the decreasing rate of 6 51 d 10a p 0 01 additionally rx1day rx5day r10mm r20mm r95p and r99p increased the fastest in nca sdii increased the fastest in msca the significance level was also above 1 overall epes in nca increased significantly and at the fastest rate followed by those in msca eca and wca epes in sca increased slightly 3 3 influence of large scale climate factors on extreme precipitation 3 3 1 contribution of single large scale climate factor fig 6 shows the contribution rates of the large scale climate factors to epe indices and the specific q values are shown in table s7 as can be seen from fig 6 the contribution rate of nsi to the epe indices in ca was the largest with an average contribution rate of 44 32 and the largest contribution rates of nsi to rx1day r20mm cdd and r99p were 45 the average contribution rate of ninob to the epe indices was 43 80 and the contribution rates to sdii r10mm cwd and r95p were 40 additionally the average contribution rates of the amo and sca were 27 91 and 26 62 respectively while those of the ami pol nao and tsn were all 10 as a whole nsi ninob amo and sca were the largest contributors to epes across ca at the same time it is indirectly proved that there is a correlation between epe indices and that the influence of large scale climate factors on the intensity frequency and duration of epes is similar fig 6 and table s7 also show the contribution rates of large scale climate factors to the epe indices in the sub regions in the sub regions the influence of various factors on the epe indices was different both ninob and nsi contributed significantly to the changes in epe indices and were the common driving factors in the five sub regions in addition the factors influencing epes in wca and eca were very similar mainly considering amo and sca however the differences in other sub regions were obvious azi had a greater influence on the epes in the sca iod has a prominent contribution in the nca and eam and amo had a greater impact in the msca 3 3 2 influence of the interaction of large scale climate factors we conducted a two factor interaction study based on the 12 large scale climate factors we used the interaction detector in the gdm to analyze the contribution rates of the two factors acting together with the epe indices both nonlinear enhancement q x1 x2 q x1 q x2 and two factor enhancement q x1 x2 max q x1 q x2 were observed in this study in ca the effect of two factor interactions on epe indices was clearly larger than that of a single factor as shown in fig 7 sam nsi had the strongest explanatory power for r95p and r99p accounting for 74 3 and 80 28 respectively with both showing nonlinear enhancement tsn nsi had the strongest explanatory power for rx5day r10mm and prcptot which were 68 20 69 47 and 69 33 respectively the explanatory power of iod nsi for rx1day eam nsi for sdii and r20mm iod sca for cdd and ninob amo for cwd was also very high 70 and all showed nonlinear enhancement the explanatory power of most of the other two factor interactions on the epe indices exhibited nonlinear enhancement illustrating that the explanatory power of most of the two factor interactions on the epe indices was far greater than that of the simple sum of the two factors as shown in fig 8 and table s8 in the sub regions the contribution rates of the interaction of climate factors to the epe indices showed significant differences nsi iod and nsi tsn had a great influence on epes in nca in the msca eam amo and iod nsi contributed significantly to most epe indices epes in wca was greatly influenced by ninob azi while eca was greatly influenced by ninob ami in sca azi nsi iod tsn and ninob azi had an impact on the epe indices we also found that most of the two factor interactions showed nonlinear enhancement but some showed a double factor enhancement in msca taking cwd as an example the contribution rate of ninob was 36 68 and that of azi was 21 16 whereas that of ninob azi was 55 41 which showed a double factor enhancement ninob nsi ninob sca and nsi sca also have a great contribution fig s3 shows the effects of the two factor interactions on other epe indices 4 discussion 4 1 applicability of gswp3 w5e5 dataset in central asia due to the scarcity of precipitation observation stations and the shortage of data in ca we had to choose an alternative dataset for the study of epes currently commonly used alternative datasets mainly include reanalysis data products and satellite precipitation products however most satellite precipitation products show less frequency of light and heavy precipitation shen et al 2010 zhao et al 2018 thereby underestimating the increase of epes in ca yang et al 2020 therefore the accuracy of reanalysis data products is very important for the study of epes in ca we selected four reanalysis datasets for comprehensive evaluation and we found that gswp3 w5e5 has the best performance in ca but 20crv3 era5 and era5 had poor characterization effects and overestimations this is consistent with the findings of sun et al 2021 however the performance of gswp3 w5e5 in different sub regions varied overall the applicability of gswp3 w5e5 in eca was higher than that in other sub regions whereas in msca the applicability of gswp3 w5e5 was relatively weak mainly owing to the high altitude and complex environmental conditions such as glaciers and snow cover thus leading to greater uncertainty yang et al 2020 gswp3 w5e5 demonstrated good applicability in ca which can be attributed to the advantages of its original datasets and bias correction method gswp3 w5e5 was composed of gswp3 and w5e5 data pieced together using the isimip3basd method lange 2019 gswp3 is based on the 20th century reanalysis dataset 20cr and is obtained through spectral fine tuning technology single integrated correction vertical weighted damping and other methods using gpcc precipitation observation data for bias correction yin et al 2018 the dataset was relatively stable in quality in the mid 20th century mengel et al 2021 and has been used in a number of climate impact assessments chang et al 2017 mengel et al 2021 schewe et al 2019 w5e5 combines land data from the wfde5 v2 0 dataset and ocean data from the era5 dataset mengel et al 2021 its original dataset uses more observation data than gswp3 and is therefore considered a more realistic dataset mengel et al 2021 the isimip3basd method mainly includes bias adjustment and statistical downscaling in which the bias adjustment is done using gpcc and cru on monthly data the advantage of this method lies in more robust deviation adjustment for extreme values and better preservation of the trend of each quantile lange 2019 the high accuracy and long time series of gswp3 w5e5 in ca provide data support for the study of epes in cases of limited observation data availability utilizing reanalysis data as a substitute is an effective approach therefore the accuracy of the reanalysis dataset was always the focus of study and seeking a higher accuracy and continuing to reduce the uncertainty of the dataset is still our goal 4 2 main influencing factors and driving mechanism of extreme precipitation in central asia we calculated the contributions of 12 large scale climate factors to 10 epe indices using gdm and found that the nsi ninob amo and sca had the largest contribution rates to epes in ca most of the two factor interactions showed nonlinear growth among them nsi iod nsi eam and nsi tsn had the largest contribution rates to epes in ca in agreement with the findings of zhang et al 2022a and ren et al 2022 who discovered that the combined effect of multiple factors has a more significant impact on epes than any single factor alone an abrupt change in epes took place in 1986 which is consistent with the findings of zhang et al 2019 and chen et al 2014 chen et al 2014 also found that the tibet plateau b index had an abrupt change in 1985 epes in northwest china had an abrupt change around 1986 and the two were significantly correlated therefore they inferred that the tibet plateau b index was an key contributor for the abrupt change in epes to explore the main reasons for the abrupt change in epes in ca in 1986 we used the cumulative anomaly method to examine the abrupt years for the 12 large scale climate indices fig s4 we found that ninob iod eam and nsi were mutated in 1986 azi was mutated in 1985 similar to the results obtained when exploring the possible factors affecting epes in ca using gdm the nsi ninob azi iod and eam may play important roles in the changes and abrupt changes in epes in ca large scale circulation changes were the main cause of epes in ca we combined the gdm results with that of existing studies to ascertain the main water vapor sources in ca and describe the atmospheric circulation activities that have important effects on epes in ca as shown in fig 9 ca lies in the key area of the westerly mode chen et al 2019 the change in westerly circulation is the main factor affecting precipitation in this region bothe et al 2012 chen et al 2011 liu et al 2018 the westerly circulation becomes stronger as the westerly index azi raises flow at 45 60 n speeds up on the 500 hpa isobaric surface zhang et al 2022a the results showed that westerly transport from the north atlantic and monsoon transport from the indian ocean and south china sea are important water vapor sources in ca chen et al 2020 xie et al 2021 temperature anomalies affect the timing of monsoons luo et al 2016 and ninob and iod which mainly represent the characteristics of sst changes in the indian ocean both had an upward trend growing by 0 015 and 0 0019 per year respectively during the study period amo has been in the warm phase since the late 1990s i e the surface of the north atlantic has been abnormally warm therefore with the increase in water vapor in the air the increase in the sst in the indian ocean may increase convection in the tropical indian ocean thus affecting convective precipitation in ca and southwest asia zhang et al 2022b through the quasi stationary wave train near 30 n the rise in the sst in the mid bottom latitudes of the north atlantic strengthens the anticyclonic anomalies over the indian peninsula and east asia and facilitates the movement of water vapor from the southwest to ca ma et al 2021 the influence of sst variation on precipitation is mainly reflected in the northern and southern ca water vapor from the north atlantic ocean indian ocean and a small amount from the arctic ocean converge to jointly affect winter and summer precipitation in the northern and southern ca xie et al 2021 additionally the large anticyclonic circulation near the arabian sea in winter strengthens water vapor transport from the arabian sea and north indian ocean to the tarim basin in ca bothe et al 2012 xie et al 2021 in summer anomalous water vapor over northern ca is related to the negative height anomaly near ca and the positive height anomaly near the arctic ocean leading to the transport of high latitude water vapor along the western border of the northern ca cyclone xie et al 2021 the northern cyclone anomaly dominates winter wetting in northeastern ca bothe et al 2012 since 1958 the eam has continued to weaken followed by a westward expansion of the western pacific subtropical high and an enhance in anticyclonic activity over mongolia resulting in an increased contribution of monsoon water vapor transport to precipitation in ca chen et al 2020 in this study the nsi showed an increasing trend which also verified this result in winter the negative nao may lead to a positive anomaly on the south side and a negative anomaly on the north side of ca the enhanced pressure gradient and abnormal westerly winds together yield more water vapor transport to ca huang et al 2013 aizen et al 2001 also found that the indices for the nao and western pacific oscillation wpo were inversely associated with the average precipitation in the mountains and plains of ca enso has exhibited an increasing trend in the last 60 years zhang et al 2022a the temperature rise in the indian ocean has been shown to an aspect of the enso signal the low pressure anomaly caused by enso strengthens the southwesterly and westerly winds from the indian and north atlantic oceans zhang et al 2018 thereby yielding a large amount of water vapor transport to ca xie et al 2021 ma et al 2020 found that the east atlanto west russia pattern changed negatively after 1999 resulting in abnormal negative and positive potential heights over ca and deepening of the trough in northern ca this was accompanied by abnormal water vapor transport from southern to eastern ca providing favorable conditions for the rise in precipitation and epes hong et al 2022 showed that more frequent epes are influenced by similar dipole patterns in the upper troposphere anomalous cyclones anticyclones in the west southeast troposphere and local anomalous cyclones in the lower troposphere the dipole model leads to anomalous divergence of the upper troposphere and formation of compensatory upward movement over the region and local anomalous cyclones lead to water vapor convergence which provides favorable dynamic and moisture conditions for epes in ca the siberian high and tibet plateau b index may also have important effects on climatic extremes in ca zhang et al 2019 the causes and mechanisms of epes are complex and multifaceted and its driving mechanisms are intricate our study focused on the influence of atmospheric circulation factors on epes in ca additionally global anthropogenic warming may promote atmospheric coupling at high middle and low latitudes increasing water vapor transport at lower latitudes and thus leading to increased winter precipitation in ca rakhmatova et al 2021 at the same time human activities can also change the time variability of annual precipitation konapala et al 2017 zou et al 2021b factors such as high vegetation coverage or coastal and lake conditions can increase air humidity and lead to more precipitation while high mountains can impede water vapor and lead to less precipitation therefore human activities ecosystems natural environments and meteorological elements have significant impacts on epes gao et al 2018 mukherjee et al 2018 zou et al 2021a and the effects of these factors differ in different regions therefore future research should comprehensively and systematically analyze the driving mechanisms of epes in ca at the same time past present and future changes in the mechanisms of epes require further investigation 5 conclusions in this study we evaluated the performance of four reanalysis precipitation products in ca analyzed the spatial and temporal trends of epes in ca from 1950 to 2019 and explored the main large scale climate factors affecting epes and their driving mechanisms the conclusions are as follows 1 gswp3 w5e5 was found to be the most accurate dataset and is therefore the best alternative dataset for examining epes in ca 2 the intensity frequency and duration of epes in ca exhibited a significant annual increase in the time series an abrupt change was detected in 1986 after which the rate of increase of the epe indices increased significantly 3 epes showed regional variations the rate of increase in nca was significantly higher than in other sub regions 4 the increase in epes was closely related to changes in the nsi ninob azi and amo the combined effect of the two factors was more significant than that of the single factor our analysis further revealed that westerly circulation was the main factor influencing precipitation in ca the abnormal warming of the sst and other factors resulted in a series of cyclones and anticyclonic anomalies in the westerly circulation zone which strengthen water vapor transport in ca leading to an increase in epes credit authorship contribution statement wei wei conceptualization

2043,timely and skilful forecasts of vegetation drought impacts should enable more proactive drought preparedness management and mitigation numerous previous studies found a temporal correlation between soil moisture and vegetation condition however a correlation across the full range of soil moisture and vegetation condition does not automatically translate into skill in forecasting infrequent events such as agricultural droughts here we develop a threshold or impact based forecasting framework to assess early warning capability ewc we analysed the skill and lead time achieved using soil moisture observations at multiple depths as predictors of subsequent vegetation drought impacts inferred from modis satellite observations at 93 sites across the united states forecast thresholds were expressed in terms of seasonally adjusted standardised anomalies z scores to distinguish climate related impacts from any seasonal vegetation cycle different combinations of soil moisture integration depth satellite vegetation indices and threshold levels were tested near infrared reflectance of vegetation nirv yielded a marginally better ewc than other indicators of vegetation drought impact the optimal soil moisture integration depth varied between land cover types from 0 to 10 cm for cropping systems to 0 100 cm for grassland and savanna the greatest skill improvements were achieved using similar z score threshold values for the soil moisture trigger and vegetation impact producing typical lead times of two to four weeks further research is recommended to combine the framework developed here with spatially continuous soil moisture analyses or forecasts available from remote sensing and land surface models keywords soil moisture early warning agricultural drought vegetation impact forecast data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is one of the most costly natural calamities with far reaching impacts on environment society and economy sheffield and wood 2012 van dijk et al 2013 the agriculture sector is often the worst impacted accounting for about 82 of overall socioeconomic loss fao 2021 the frequency and intensity of drought are projected to rise due to climate change with implications for global food security ipcc 2015 agricultural drought is said to occur when soil moisture availability has decreased to a level where plants manifest biochemical and morphological drought stress symptoms such as chlorophyll content decrease leaf wilting and senescence or stunted growth these impacts adversely affect crop yield and pasture quality and therefore agricultural productivity and profitability asoka and mishra 2015 flexas et al 2000 vicente serrano et al 2012 wilhite and glantz 1985 the impact of agricultural drought on vegetation can be captured by satellite instruments including optical remote sensing in the visible near infrared and shortwave infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum associated with leaf pigment concentration cell structure and water content respectively boken et al 2005 rouse 1974 since the 1980s several vegetation indices vis incorporating one or more of these features have been proposed as proxies for vegetation condition vis such as the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi tucker 1979 vegetation condition index

impacts over large regions aghakouchak et al 2015 hayes et al 2011 however it can be too late to mitigate drought impacts once vegetation changes become apparent kogan et al 2015 there is increasing interest in moving from reactive crisis response to proactive drought preparedness management and mitigation coughlan de perez et al 2015 such an approach relies on timely and skilful drought forecasts bachmair et al 2016a b coughlan de perez et al 2022 the present generation of drought early warning systems dews mainly monitors already existing drought conditions attempts have been made to enhance their forecasting capability in several countries and regions including the united states australia europe and africa hao et al 2017b hao et al 2018 approaches can be broadly categorised into three categories firstly by forecasting anomalies in hydro meteorological variables e g precipitation evaporative demand based on medium range weather prediction models and seasonal forecast

better understand and prepare for drought risk management e g the health of pastures or crops sutanto et al 2019 ward et al 2021 by convention thresholds that trigger drought warnings of different

and reduce the effectiveness of warnings potter et al 2021 the world meteorological organization wmo has advocated a change from hydro meteorological forecasts towards impact based forecasts and warning services with tailored forecasts of the probability and severity of specified impacts for different affected sectors wmo 2015 the first step towards this could be to relate hydro meteorological thresholds to appropriate thresholds of potential subsequent impacts in order to produce more meaningful warnings for different audiences which would be a prerequisite for more

spi or standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index bachmair et al 2016a b chatterjee et al 2022 chen et al 2014 liu et al 2020 studies to date quantified forecast potential using either pearson or spearman s rank correlation coefficient between actual or deseasonalised time series of satellite derived vis and soil moisture the anomaly correlation ac was also used to gain a more rigorous assessment of forecast skill between composited stress index of soil moisture and vegetation sehgal et al 2021a the soil moisture estimates were derived from in situ observation gu et al 2008 méndez barroso et al 2009 qiu et al 2014 wang et al 2007 land surface models ahmed et al 2017 crow et al 2012 satellite observations chen et al 2014 nicolai shaw et al 2017 or weather forecast model reanalyses asoka and mishra 2015 bolten and crow 2012 joiner et al 2018 tian et al 2019 the time lag associated with the strongest correlation ranges from a few days to several months depending on soil moisture integration depths ecosystems and climatic conditions ahmed et al 2017 joiner et al 2018 tian et al 2019 however such temporal correlation studies do not necessarily provide a good indication of skill and lead time for drought impacts droughts are defined as rare extreme events wilhite and glantz 1985 and found in the tail of the soil moisture and vi distributions therefore overall good temporal correlation does not necessarily mean that there is any practical predictive capacity for the small sample of statistically rare events this conceptual difference often leads to skill degradation when forecasting extreme events brust et al 2021 hao et al 2017a hoerling et al 2014 sutanto et al 2020 our objective was to explore the potential for forecasting infrequent vegetation drought impacts from soil moisture conditions as a step toward building an operational agricultural drought impact forecast system we developed a threshold based framework to add the information regarding forecast capabilities across multiple drought severity categories beyond the broad relationship demonstrated by prior temporal correlation analyses as the predictor we used in situ soil moisture measurements at different depths at 93 stations across the usa to select an appropriate predictand we evaluated a small number of optical vegetation condition indices calculated from modis satellite observations both predictor and predictand were adjusted for the predictable average seasonal cycle and expressed as a standardised anomaly z score to allow generalisation of the forecasting framework the f2 skill score was used as performance metric allowing a trade off between missed events against false alarms we aimed to examine the following research questions 1 do soil moisture observations have skill in forecasting subsequent vegetation drought impacts and if so what is the lead time 2 what combinations of standardised soil moisture and vegetation anomalies z threshold combinations hereafter can forecast vegetation drought impacts of increasing severity 3 how do soil moisture integration depth vegetation type and climate regime affect skill and lead time 2 data and methodology 2 1 in situ soil moisture observations in situ soil moisture data for 1 january 2003 to 31 december 2019 were collected from three national and two regional networks across the continental united states of america table 1 the soil climate analysis network scan https www wcc nrcs usda gov scan and the united states climate reference network uscrn https www ncdc noaa gov crn provide hourly neutron probe measurements of volumetric soil water content at five standard depths 5 10 20 50 and 100 cm the scan sites are mostly located in agricultural regions schaefer et al 2007 while the uscrn sites are associated with climate monitoring stations and likely to retain consistent land cover type over decades bell et al 2013 the ameriflux sites https ameriflux lbl gov sites are located at eddy covariance flux towers that measure carbon and water exchanges novick et al 2018 only a few flux sites were equipped with volumetric soil water content sensors that monitored half hourly at various soil depths typically 5 10 30 and 50 cm the illinois climate network icn https www isws illinois edu warm soil was established to support the agriculture sector by providing volumetric soil water content at four depths 5 10 20 and 50 cm warm 2020 the oklahoma mesonet okm https www mesonet org is an environmental monitoring network the fraction of soil saturation was measured at four depths 5 25 60 and 75 cm in okm based on heat capacity measurements at sub hourly time steps e g 5 and 30 min brock et al 1995 mcpherson et al 2007 sites were selected from each network based on the following criteria 1 record continuity and length 2 spatial homogeneity 3 the presence of rainfed non irrigated vegetation and 4 measurement depth first we calculated the daily average soil moisture at each sensor depth using the hourly or sub hourly observations with the highest quality flag missing daily averages were estimated using linear interpolation but records missing more than 15 of the daily averages in each year were excluded we only considered sites that had records for at least six years second at each site spatial homogeneity within a radius of 500 m was investigated using high resolution imagery google earth pro version 7 1 and the modis international geosphere biosphere programme igbp land cover product mcd12q1 friedl and sulla menashe 2019 we only retained sites with a stable and homogeneous land cover that had not been disturbed by fire occurrences during the study period third we excluded sites on cultivated land equipped with a centre pivot irrigation system or land cover with significant bare soil patches e g open shrubland fourth only sites with observations available to a depth of at least 50 cm were retained a total of 93 sites satisfied all criteria fig 1 33 okm sites 25 uscrn sites 20 scan sites nine icn sites and six ameriflux sites table s1 see supplementary information lists the geographic coordinates land cover types modis igbp aridity index climate regime and temporal coverage of the 93 sites they include 30 sites with 6 to 10 years of data and 63 sites with 11 to 17 years based on the igbp land cover product the 93 sites were categorised into five ecosystems grasslands gra 38 sites with 506 site years croplands cro 16 sites with 226 site years cropland natural vegetation mosaics cvm 17 sites with 225 site yeas savannas sav 11 sites with 151 site years and woody savannas wsa 11 sites with 126 site years several sites were located in natural ecosystems without any agricultural activity we retained these for comparative purposes for each site the soil moisture observations at multiple measurement depths were weighted to compute depth integrated soil moisture θd for the upper root zone d 10 cm shallow root zone d 30 cm and deep root zone d 100 cm at a daily time step the integration depths of soil moisture were loosely based on the vertical root distribution in different ecosystems arora and boer 2003 as well as soil layer definitions commonly used in global products such as gldas noah 0 10 10 40 and 40 100 cm rodell et al 2004 and era5 land 0 7 7 28 and 28 100 cm muñoz sabater et al 2021 the weights were determined by assuming that each sensor measured soil moisture for a layer bound by half the distance between the next higher and lower sensors where applicable 2 2 satellite derived vegetation indices we evaluated four satellite derived vegetation indices vis the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi tucker 1979 the enhanced vegetation index evi huete et al 2002 the normalized difference infrared index ndii yilmaz et al 2008 and the near infrared reflectance of vegetation nirv badgley et al 2017 ndvi and evi are two of the most widely used proxies of vegetation growth condition or vigour xue and su 2017 ndii has been used to estimate the equivalent water thickness of leaves and canopy yilmaz et al 2008 the nirv index was recently proposed as a better predictor of vegetation productivity badgley et al 2017 baldocchi 2020 all vis can be calculated using red blue near infrared and shortwave infrared reflectance measurements from the modis sensors table 2 we extracted atmospherically corrected nadir brdf adjusted reflectance nbar for each site from the collection 6 terra and aqua modis mcd43a4 daily data set for the 500 m pixel centred geographically closest to the reported soil moisture sites the daily modis data represent a weighted average of daily measurements over 16 days with the ninth day as the reporting date schaaf and wang 2015 hence reflectances can be influenced by vegetation condition before and after the nominal date depending on atmospheric conditions on different days within the period our study included 17 years 2003 2019 for which both terra and aqua modis data were available we only used retrievals marked as highest quality in all bands i e bitmask 0 in the quality assurance grid we excluded periods when ndvi was 0 15 to reduce the effect of snow ice and bare soil 2 3 definition of threshold soil moisture and vegetation condition events we wished to remove any recurrent seasonal cycle that might artificially inflate skill estimates first the mean of the four vis and three θd i e θ 10 θ 30 and θ 100 series was calculated for each day of the year doy t for their common period at each site this average seasonal pattern was adopted as the estimated average climatological cycle or climatology the anomalies of vi and θd were subsequently calculated as the difference between the observed values and climatology for the corresponding day t 1 a x t y x t y x t where x t is the period average value for day t x t y the daily value of the variable for day t of year y and a x t y the anomaly for day t of year y the anomalies of vi and θd were assumed to follow a normal distribution to make it easier to compare anomalies in various variables we standardised the anomalies of variables by subtracting the period mean anomaly at each time step t and then dividing by the period standard deviation of the anomaly the generic calculation of z scores for each variable was 2 z x t a x t y σ ax t where a x t y is the anomaly for day t of year y σ ax t the standard deviation of anomalies for day t and z x t the standardised anomaly or z score for day t the z score indicates how many standard deviations an anomaly is away from the mean seasonal cycle a negative score implies that the deviation is below the average thus negative z scores for soil moisture anomalies z θ represent drier than average soil moisture conditions and negative z scores for vi anomalies z vi represent a decline in vegetation condition fig 2 shows an example of daily time series of z scores for nirv versus three θd depths at a cropland site in the mid central united states we established a framework to identify θd falling below a defined threshold using z θ and the onset of vegetation drought impacts using z vi we subsequently calculated two key performance metrics lead time δt and the overall skill score f2 to evaluate the early warning capability ewc we restricted the analysis to the peak growing season to avoid the influence of phenological or temperature driven vegetation browning and senescence the peak growing season was determined by the land surface phenology approach where phenological dates were determined using dynamic thresholds or a particular derivative alongside the climatological curve of the vi zeng et al 2020 the mid green up and mid brown down points were the day of the year doy at which the smoothed vi climatology crosses above and again below 50 of the vi amplitude respectively fig 3 and the peak growing season was defined as the period between mid green up and mid brown down the pre green date was defined as the doy with the trough of vi climatology closest to the green up period if there were two phenological periods at a given site we only considered the period with the larger amplitude we defined the onset of vegetation drought impact as the first date doy during the peak growing season on which z vi fell below a chosen z threshold the soil moisture deficit should precede the vegetation impact therefore we iteratively extended the search window backwards until the pre green date and determined the onset of soil moisture deficiency as the last day preceding the impact event on which z θ fell below the specified threshold combining the predictor and predictand z scores we analysed a total of 36 z threshold combinations z θ z vi encompassing all z combinations between 2 5 and 0 0 at an increment step of 0 5 the experiment was repeated for all twelve combinations of the four vis and three θ depths 2 4 evaluation of early warning capability we defined the first occurrence of vi threshold exceedance of each site year as the onset of drought vegetation impact fig 4 if the z θ threshold was crossed before the z vi threshold fig 4a it was deemed a true positive tp occurrence that successfully triggered an early warning we found that z θ could fall below the threshold multiple times within the search window before a vi impact in such cases we only regarded the last preceding z θ threshold occurrence as a successful early warning while earlier occurrences were considered false positives fp triggering false alarms if z θ did not cross the threshold at all before vegetation decline fig 4b the event was classified as a false negative fn most of the time series is made up of days without drought conditions they can be considered true negatives tn but do not give a meaningful assessment of skill hence a skill metric that does not include tn the f2 score was chosen to quantify skill for each site year the true positives tp false positives fp and false negatives fn were counted the f2 score requires estimates of precision and recall defined as 3 precision tp tp fp 4 recall tp tp fn where tp fp and fn are the number of true positives false positives and false negatives respectively precision describes to the likelihood that a z θ event accurately anticipates a z vi event and penalises the measures for false alarms fp recall describes the proportion of vegetation decline events that were accurately anticipated by a z θ trigger and penalises missed z vi events fn the following skill score captures the trade off between precision and recall 5 f β score 1 β 2 precision recall β 2 precision recall the value of β is subjective and is chosen to reflect that recall is considered β times as important as precision values of 0 5 1 and 2 are commonly used for β we preferred overpredicting vegetation impact events rather than missing them we selected a value of 2 which weighs recall twice as much as precision to provide a composite score for the skill metric the resultant f2 skill score ranges from 0 to 1 with a higher score indicating better forecast skill the f2 score is a relative skill score with no specified standards for comparing it to a normative quality assessment e g good acceptable or poor however it can be used to compare the performance of different predictors and predictands within the same forecasting approach as done here for each z threshold combination precision recall and f2 scores are calculated separately for the three θ depths and four vis the results were compared and stratified according to land cover type and climate regime for each z threshold combination the lead time δt between the z θ trigger and the z vi event was computed for each site and year the four performance metrics precision recall f2 score and lead time provide perspectives on how well the z θ threshold predicts z vi events for different z score levels due to the nature of the forecasting framework and the formulation of the f2 score there is no direct method to determine whether a calculated skill score is significantly different from a naïve forecast instead we performed a control forecast experiment for which we expected no skill on theoretical grounds and could calculate a baseline or background skill score for the control experiment we sought to remove any temporal relationship between predictor and predictand by switching the first and the second part of the z θ time series without doing the same for z vi the first part was extended by half a year in the case of an odd number of years we consider the skill of the control forecast equivalent to that of a random forecast at least on average across several sites the average change in skill score between the original and control experiment can therefore be considered as the improvement from an unskilled forecast a statistical t test was applied for each experiment to determine whether the average change among sites n 93 was statistically significantly different from zero at p 0 05 2 5 analysis between vegetation types and climate regimes access to deeper soil moisture through greater rooting depth and the degree of adaptation to drought stress vary between vegetation types we used the earlier mentioned igbp land cover product to evaluate whether there were significant differences in aspects of forecast skill between different vegetation types we expected the shallowest rooting depth and the greatest vulnerability to dryness for croplands cro n 16 and cropland natural vegetation mosaics cvm n 17 conversely we anticipated woody savannas wsa n 11 might have the greatest rooting depth and be the least sensitive to dry conditions with grasslands gra n 38 and savannas sav n 11 having intermediate characteristics climate regime in particular aridity may be a key factor in determining viable vegetation growth form but also shapes other less pronounced physiological adaptations to water availability therefore we also compared the performance metrics of early warning capability for different aridity regimes the aridity index was calculated as the ratio of mean precipitation to mean potential evapotranspiration we used the same dryness classes as tian et al 2019 3 results 3 1 temporal characterisation of threshold events some of the characteristics of threshold events identified at different z θ and z vi threshold levels are shown in fig 5 depending on the thresholds chosen events occurred between 0 25 and 8 times per year fig 5a corresponding with return intervals of 0 1 to 4 years for a chosen threshold level z θ events tended to occur more frequently than z vi events especially for θ10 this can be explained by the greater short term variability in this shallow layer compared to greater soil depths or the larger scale and temporally composited vis these patterns were consistent between the four vis for the z θ 2 5 and z vi 2 5 thresholds the respective events showed a similar frequency of occurrence the number of sites reaching different thresholds for individual years during the 2003 2019 period shows a pattern of relatively wetter and dryer conditions across the 93 sites similar patterns were observed for z θ and z vi fig 5b and 5c the number of dryness affected sites was largest in 2012 80 while relatively high numbers were also observed in 2006 65 and 2011 50 near normal and moderate threshold events z θ 1 5 to z θ 0 0 occurred at the majority of the sites 70 in nearly every year only one in ten sites were affected by severe events z θ 2 5 and z vi 2 5 during most years 3 2 evaluation of potential capability in forecasting different proxies of vegetation degradations fig 6 presents the improved forecast skill score and expected lead time for selected in situ sites for any z threshold combination forecast potential was indicated where the f2 score showed a statistically significant improvement p 0 05 compared to the skill of the baseline control experiment across the 93 sites the experiment was repeated 432 times i e for three predictors θ10 θ30 and θ100 times four predictands ndvi evi ndii and nirv times 36 six times six z threshold combinations the distribution of f2 scores indicates that forecasting skill was poorer when using ndii compared to the other three vis with only marginal differences between ndvi evi and nirv fig 6a the median value of expected lead time was 12 to 30 days fig 6b without apparent differences among the four vis the greatest soil moisture integration depth showed both higher skill and lead time however 38 out of 93 i e 41 of sites are located on grassland and this dominance may have affected the result see section 3 4 3 3 influence of z threshold combinations different z θ z vi threshold combinations produce different skills and lead times in presenting these differences we focused on the results achieved with the vegetation condition index nirv because it showed marginally higher f2 scores among the four vis the f2 skill score its components recall and precision and the lead time δt for different z threshold combinations and three soil layer depths were calculated for all 93 sites subsequently the same metrics were calculated for the control experiment and the improvement and the statistical significance of that improvement were calculated the numbers shown in fig 7 represent median values of the distribution n 93 as a potentially better indicator of central tendency although mean values were near identical the corresponding numbers for the control experiment are shown in supplementary fig s1 a relatively high f2 score does not automatically imply a skilful forecast as the control experiment may achieve a similarly high f2 score for instance in forecasting more frequent vegetation impact events z vi 0 5 the control forecast produces a similar median f2 score of 0 57 fig s1 hence there is little or no skill in the forecasts from this z threshold combination overall the improvements appear to be greatest and most significant for intermediate z threshold combinations increasing by 0 1 to 0 3 f2 score units when using a threshold of z θ 1 5 to z θ 2 0 combined with z vi 1 5 to z vi 2 5 the improvement of recall and precision fig 7b and 7c show similar patterns as for the f2 score across z threshold combinations but the skill was greater in terms of recall increased by 0 2 0 4 than in precision increased by 0 1 0 2 these findings suggest that overall skill improvement is primarily due to the reduced number of false negatives which dominates recall the z threshold combinations producing significantly improved skill do not always result in increased lead times indeed decreases in lead time compared to the control forecasts also occurred fig 7d the pattern of improvements across the different forecast metrics is similar for the three soil moisture integration depths however θ100 showed improvements across a broader range of z threshold combinations 3 4 comparisons between vegetation types and climate regimes we compared the four forecast metrics f2 skill score recall precision and lead time between the identified ecosystems and climate regimes to limit the scope of the comparison we focused on vi impacts at z 1 5 this threshold level was chosen because of the significant skill improvement and the desire to forecast less frequent more severe impacts we summarised the improvement of skill score and the achieved forecasting performances and expected lead times in the average of significant z threshold combinations for the three soil layers for different ecosystems and climate regimes fig 8 savanna vegetation sav showed skill improvement with a relatively narrow distribution of values among sites the other vegetation types showed lesser f2 skill improvement and forecast skill improvement was close to zero for woody savanna wsa fig 8a crop dominant ecosystems cro and cvm showed greater skill improvements and produced the best forecasts at shallow integration depth θ 10 the other vegetation types achieved the best forecast using the greatest integration depth θ 100 fig 8b considering precision and recall individually helps understand the trade off between the two in producing the f2 score the upper soil layer produced the best f2 score for crop dominant ecosystems cro and cvm because of the higher precision while recall remained similar fig 8c and 8d for grasslands gra θ 100 produced significantly better recall and precision p 0 05 when compared to shallower integration depths among climate regimes the greatest skill improvement was found for arid sites especially when using θ 100 fig 8f the distribution of actual skill scores appeared similar among dryness categories median skill appeared to increase slightly from 0 42 for sub humid sites to 0 51 for arid sites but the differences were not statistically significant p 0 05 fig 8g similar to vegetation types lead time increased with integrated soil layer depth but there was no clear relationship with climate dryness fig 8e and 8j across all climate regimes the θ 100 produced higher skill scores than shallower soil with a median lead time of about two to four weeks 12 28 days fig 8g and 8j the difference in skill score for different soil depths was greatest for sub arid sites due to a combination of low precision and high recall this pattern was weaker for sub humid sites where median lead times were also shorter at around two to three weeks in summary vegetation impact forecasts based on a shallower integration depth produced better forecasts for cropping systems in contrast the 0 100 cm soil layer appeared to provide better forecasts than shallower depths for grassland and savanna vegetation types and in sub arid and arid regimes overall poor skill was found for woody savannas 4 discussion 4 1 limitations and uncertainties caveats and uncertainties in our evaluation framework derive from limitations associated with the in situ soil moisture measurements satellite derived vis and the forecasting framework applied we chose to use in situ soil moisture data as we expected that they would offer more accurate estimates of soil moisture over different depths than alternative approaches based on modelling or remote sensing we were unable to independently ascertain the fidelity of the reported measurements for the scan sites relative errors of 20 in the recorded data have been reported dirmeyer et al 2016 it is noted that any systematic proportional error or offset would not have affected the calculation of normalised z θ scores but random errors might another limitation of the available in situ soil moisture data is the available record length by most operational definitions droughts have a return time of around 25 to 30 years this definition creates a statistical challenge that affects almost all drought studies because field and satellite records are of similar length at best and typically shorter the available soil moisture records at root zone depths e g 50 cm and 100 cm were mostly less than fifteen years while the time series did contain one or even more true droughts at some sites for less rare events our results should be considered representative of dry events that are infrequent but do not always formally qualify as droughts there are also limitations in the satellite vegetation observations used we used negative thresholds in standardised z scores calculated from seasonally adjusted anomalies in satellite derived vis to determine the occurrence of agricultural drought impacts we avoided vi declines due to phenological and cropping cycles by confining our analysis to within the peak growing season and using seasonally adjusted anomalies these adjustments are a deliberate departure from many previous studies along with the focus on threshold event forecasting it creates a much more severe test of forecast skill one that better represents the true potential merit of an impact forecasting system a downside of this approach is that the skill metrics and lead time we determined are not easily compared to those reported in previous studies despite the caution in treating vis limitations remain for example negative vi anomalies during the peak growing season could have occurred for reasons other than soil moisture deficit such as pests and disease intensified grazing or harvesting extreme weather events such as hail or frost or a change to a crop with markedly different characteristics furthermore it was mentioned that the vis were derived from modis mcd43a4 temporal composites in the extreme case the observation used could represent conditions 8 days earlier or later than the nominal date if observations were unavailable on any of the other 15 days we expect this problem to have been limited by the prevalence of clear sky conditions during dry periods the vis themselves also have limitations in representing true vegetation condition for example saturation effects occur in some vis at high vegetation density which can reduce their sensitivity to vegetation decline especially during the peak growing season or if drought only affects the lowest vegetation layers xue and su 2017 4 2 merit of the forecasting framework past studies of vegetation drought impact forecasting have focused on measuring correlation this broad focus has limitations when interpreting derived forecast skill and lead time measures in a drought early warning context drought impacts are concentrated in one of the tails of the distribution forecasts across the full range of conditions can therefore easily produce a misleading estimate of the true skill and lead time of drought impact forecasts by definition there are few occurrences of extreme events in the record available to train forecasting models and this can degrade calculated forecast skill it also tends to cause an underprediction of severe drought impacts and overprediction of low intensity drought impacts brust et al 2021 sutanto et al 2020 we developed a threshold based forecasting framework to overcome these issues as best as possible our framework provides a simple approach to evaluate whether there is any potential in forecasting threshold drought impacts from thresholds in the dry tail of hydro meteorological predictors as we have shown the framework facilitates the selection of optimal predictor and response variables threshold combinations and other aspects of the forecast model configuration the framework also enables control or benchmark experiments to evaluate skill and skill improvements an important feature given the wide variety of available hydro meteorological and vegetation related products using the framework developed we concluded that the standardised anomaly of nirv marginally outperformed the other satellite derived vis this does not amount tooverwhelming evidence that it is a better indicator of vegetation drought impact although it does support recent studies highlighting the merit of this index nirv is thought to respond to the distribution of photosynthetic capacity with depth in canopies thus more accurately capturing changes in structurally complex landscapes badgley et al 2017 wang et al 2022 demonstrated that the nirv might be a better proxy of dryland vegetation productivity dynamics in the western united states several alternative vis could not be considered here future research could consider the sun induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif frankenberg et al 2011 which should more directly relate to photosynthesis and the vegetation optical depth vod liu et al 2011 a measure calculated from satellite microwave radiometry that reflects water status in all above ground biomass rather than only the leaves visible from above liu et al 2015 alternatives are also available for the predictor variable this study used in situ soil moisture observations at different depths to develop and trial the framework the application of the framework across larger areas would require spatial soil moisture estimates derived from remote sensing or models such as gldas rodell et al 2004 era5 land muñoz sabater et al 2021 furthermore using soil moisture forecasts could further extend the lead time for skilful forecasts depending on how the uncertainty in those soil moisture forecasts propagates into the forecasts of subsequent vegetation impacts on theoretical grounds the preferred combination of z score thresholds in a drought warning system might be to use identical thresholds for predictor and predictand and reflect rare events i e be strongly negative these are found along the diagonal near the bottom right of the matrices in fig 7 the most negative threshold of z 2 5 appeared unsuitable as a z θ trigger with low f2 scores resulting from a combination of low recall and low precision fig 7a this is probably due to the small number of true events reaching this threshold at most of the sites this limitation also reduces the statistical strength of our results for these more severe events better combinations do occur along the diagonal for θ10 and θ30 fig 7a but for θ100 a less negative z score thresholds for soil moisture than for vi appeared to produce better results the median lead time associated with the corresponding preferred z threshold combinations was 13 to 25 days i e about two to four weeks fig 7d 4 3 forecast skill and the trade off between missed events and false alarms the z threshold combinations producing the greatest improvement in f2 scores reflect a trade off between recall and precision i e failing to forecast impacts missed events and incorrectly doing so false alarms we used the fβ skill score metric to lend greater weight to avoiding missed events this choice was motivated by the view that missing events would be more problematic than issuing false alarms in drought early warning system dews potter et al 2021 however different weightings or skill metrics could be considered and might produce different optimal combinations of predictor predictand and other aspects of forecast model configuration inevitably in terms of the skill score chosen reducing the number of missed events i e improving recall will increase false alarms i e reduce precision in a dews this would contribute to the cry wolf problem causing warnings to carry less weight or even be ignored and fail to elicit the necessary response kelman and glantz 2014 thus selecting an appropriate threshold level for the impact that is being predicted is of critical concern potter et al 2021 our results fig 8b and 8c quantify this inevitable trade off between precision and recall an additional dimension of drought forecasting is the possibility of forecasting events of varying severity we investigated the scope for such a tiered approach by examining decreasing z threshold levels associated with impacts of increasing severity and return time our results suggest that forecasting relatively more frequent impacts i e 1 0 z 0 is associated with high recall and precision but forecast skill was similar to the control forecast the relatively high actual and control forecast skill were both due to overprediction overprediction is a known issue for interpreting skill scores for an unbalanced sample and one reason why we focused on skill improvements compared to the control experiment fig s1 nonetheless modest skill improvements still occurred for θ100 suggesting that skilful warning of mild vegetation impacts may be feasible for impacts of greater severity and lower frequency z 2 0 and z 1 5 simultaneously avoiding missed alarms and false alarms is more challenging the significant improvement in skill score compared to the control experiment demonstrated forecasting potential for the most severe impacts z 2 5 forecasts were less skilful due to a high number of false alarms as indicated by low precision we attribute this to the small number of events in the relatively short site records 4 4 differences between vegetation types and climate regimes different ecosystems and climate regimes sometimes showed differences in optimal θ depths these differences are assumed to reflect variations in access to soil moisture at different depths fig 8 thus for cropping systems θ10 appeared optimal for use in early warning rooting depths in annual crops can vary dramatically depending on growth stage swain et al 2013 the optimal θ10 may have been a compromise for reflecting vegetation response in these complex and dynamically changing ecosystems the deepest θ100 produced the best forecasts for savanna and grassland sites and vegetation in more arid climate regimes the savanna and grassland sites included in our data mostly comprised native grass species in sub arid and arid regions fig 1 these ecosystems may have adapted to their local environment giving them the ability to withstand short term soil moisture anomalies better than rain fed cropland or pasture species found or introduced in more humid climate regimes to maximise agricultural productivity nippert and holdo 2015 apparently the more deeply rooted vegetation component was dominant among the sites investigated in this study the savanna and woody savanna sites showed the least potential for impact forecasting this finding is consistent with studies by chen et al 2014 and nicolai shaw et al 2017 they also found that vegetation dynamics in woody savannas have a lower correlation with soil moisture conditions tian et al 2019 found that these ecosystems sometimes respond to water availability changes over months rather than weeks suggesting that soil moisture observations down to 100 cm may be insufficient to forecast drought impacts groundwater indices based on water balance models or satellite observations such as the groundwater resource index gri mendicino et al 2008 or grace groundwater drought index ggdi thomas et al 2017 might be more skilful in forecasting changes in savanna and forests ecosystems other studies have also found that soil moisture dynamics in deeper layers are more stable due to the longer memory ghannam et al 2016 soil moisture thresholds over larger integration depths are less frequently crossed in response to short term precipitation events or periods that do not saturate the profile unfortunately soil moisture estimates available from remote sensing reflect the moisture content of the top few centimetres of near surface soil only therefore they are less likely to be skilful in forecasting drought impacts unless used to inform estimates of deeper soil moisture e g through assimilation into land surface models tian et al 2019 the propagation of drought impacts was determined by characteristics such as water holding capability and seasonal drydown pathways in different soil profile depths and vegetation types with varied root water uptake characteristics sehgal et al 2021b swain et al 2013 as a result analyses of layer wise drought impact propagation from soil moisture to vegetation could benefit the operation of drought impact forecasting over large spatial scale by generalising forecast skills achieved by different groups identified based on factors such as soil layers vegetation types and climate regimes recent attention has been drawn to the relatively fast onset of some drought events such as the 2012 drought across the central united states which developed within a few weeks otkin et al 2018 pendergrass et al 2020 our results show that vegetation typically responds to soil moisture deficits within two to four weeks other studies derived similar results for shallow rooted vegetation asoka and mishra 2015 nicolai shaw et al 2017 tian et al 2019 such a relatively rapid response emphasises the need to develop drought impact forecasting methods that can predict daily or weekly rather than monthly if warnings are to be issued in a timely fashion pendergrass et al 2020 4 5 implications for early warning and future work we found that the lead time between soil moisture triggers and vegetation impacts was generally around two to four weeks however these lead times are associated with forecasts based on real time soil moisture observations they only consider latency in the availability of past observations conversely they do not consider the additional skill and lead time that may be derived from soil moisture forecasts instead of observations seasonal soil moisture outlooks such as those issued by the usa noaa climate prediction centre van den dool et al 2003 and the australian water outlook vogel et al 2021 have been found somewhat skilful for up to three months and therefore may extend lead time further to enable drought preparation several months in advance of course skill inevitably declines with lead time in these forecasts the expected time lag between soil moisture deficits and vegetation impacts of a few weeks also means that vegetation impact forecasts will be less informative for drought forecasts several months ahead future work could adopt the framework developed here to investigate enhancements and alternative approaches for example the in situ soil moisture observations can be replaced with ensemble soil moisture forecasts or hindcasts in a research setting based on a combination of weather forecasting and land surface model s this approach can connect the rainfall soil moisture vegetation forecasting chain and provide spatially continuous forecasts of vegetation impact 5 conclusions we proposed a framework to forecast the onset of drought vegetation impacts using in situ soil moisture observations at different depths as the predictor variable and satellite derived vegetation indices as the predictand we compared the skill and lead times achieved by forecasts for vegetation impacts of varying severity and across different ecosystems and climate regimes our main conclusions are as follows 1 standardised soil moisture anomalies could be used to forecast vegetation impacts with significant skill a challenge in improving forecast skill is the relatively high rate of false alarms when using in situ soil moisture daily observations 2 the lead time between soil moisture triggers and subsequent vegetation impacts was typically around two to four weeks this lead time could be extended using skilful forecasts rather than real time soil moisture observations 3 there is a typical trade off between recall and precision generally the optimal skill improvements were achieved using similar z thresholds for soil moisture trigger and vegetation impact for moderate severity events skill scores were less good for the most severe events z score 2 5 but this was associated with a small number of events given the limited record length on average 15 years among the 93 sites 4 the soil moisture integration depth that produced the best skill varied between ecosystems with shallow 0 10 cm moisture performing better for cropping systems and deeper 0 100 cm soil moisture being optimal for grassland and savanna as well as for drier environments credit authorship contribution statement yizhi li conceptualization methodology software validation

2043,timely and skilful forecasts of vegetation drought impacts should enable more proactive drought preparedness management and mitigation numerous previous studies found a temporal correlation between soil moisture and vegetation condition however a correlation across the full range of soil moisture and vegetation condition does not automatically translate into skill in forecasting infrequent events such as agricultural droughts here we develop a threshold or impact based forecasting framework to assess early warning capability ewc we analysed the skill and lead time achieved using soil moisture observations at multiple depths as predictors of subsequent vegetation drought impacts inferred from modis satellite observations at 93 sites across the united states forecast thresholds were expressed in terms of seasonally adjusted standardised anomalies z scores to distinguish climate related impacts from any seasonal vegetation cycle different combinations of soil moisture integration depth satellite vegetation indices and threshold levels were tested near infrared reflectance of vegetation nirv yielded a marginally better ewc than other indicators of vegetation drought impact the optimal soil moisture integration depth varied between land cover types from 0 to 10 cm for cropping systems to 0 100 cm for grassland and savanna the greatest skill improvements were achieved using similar z score threshold values for the soil moisture trigger and vegetation impact producing typical lead times of two to four weeks further research is recommended

soil moisture integration depths ecosystems and climatic conditions ahmed et al 2017 joiner et al 2018 tian et al 2019 however such temporal correlation studies do not necessarily provide a good indication of skill and lead time for drought impacts droughts are defined as rare extreme events wilhite and glantz 1985 and found in the tail of the soil moisture and vi distributions therefore overall good temporal correlation does not necessarily mean that there is any practical predictive capacity for the small sample of statistically rare events this conceptual difference often leads to skill degradation when forecasting extreme events brust et al 2021 hao et al 2017a hoerling et al 2014 sutanto et al 2020 our objective was to explore the potential for forecasting infrequent vegetation drought impacts from soil moisture conditions as a step toward building an operational agricultural drought impact forecast system we developed a threshold based framework to add the information regarding forecast capabilities across multiple drought severity categories beyond the broad relationship demonstrated by prior temporal correlation analyses as the predictor we used in situ soil moisture measurements at different depths at 93 stations across the usa to select an appropriate predictand we evaluated a small number of optical vegetation condition indices calculated from modis satellite observations both predictor and predictand were adjusted for the predictable average seasonal cycle and expressed as a standardised anomaly z score to allow generalisation of the forecasting framework the f2 skill score was used as performance metric allowing a trade off between missed events against false alarms we aimed to examine the following research questions 1 do soil moisture observations have skill in forecasting subsequent vegetation drought impacts and if so what is the lead time 2 what combinations of standardised soil moisture and vegetation anomalies z threshold combinations hereafter can forecast vegetation drought impacts of increasing severity 3 how do soil moisture integration depth vegetation type and climate regime affect skill and lead time 2

weights were determined by assuming that each sensor measured soil moisture for a layer bound by half the distance between the next higher and lower sensors where applicable 2 2 satellite derived vegetation indices we evaluated four satellite derived vegetation indices vis the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi tucker 1979 the enhanced vegetation index evi huete et al 2002 the normalized difference infrared index ndii yilmaz et al 2008 and the near infrared reflectance of vegetation nirv badgley et al 2017 ndvi and evi are two of the most widely used proxies of vegetation growth condition or vigour xue and su 2017 ndii has been used to estimate the equivalent water thickness of leaves and canopy yilmaz et al 2008 the nirv index was recently proposed as a better predictor of vegetation productivity badgley et al 2017 baldocchi 2020 all vis can be calculated using red blue near infrared and shortwave infrared reflectance measurements from the modis sensors table 2 we extracted atmospherically corrected nadir brdf adjusted reflectance nbar for each site from the collection 6 terra and aqua modis mcd43a4 daily data set for the 500 m pixel centred geographically closest to the reported soil moisture sites the daily modis data represent a weighted average of daily measurements over 16 days with the ninth day as the reporting date schaaf and wang 2015 hence reflectances can be influenced by vegetation condition before and after the nominal date depending on atmospheric conditions on different days within the period our study included 17 years 2003 2019 for which both terra and aqua modis data were available we only used retrievals marked as highest quality in all bands i e bitmask 0 in the quality assurance grid we excluded periods when ndvi was 0 15 to reduce the effect of snow ice and bare soil 2 3 definition of threshold soil moisture and vegetation condition events we wished to remove any recurrent seasonal cycle that might artificially inflate skill estimates first the mean of the four vis and three θd i e θ 10 θ 30 and θ 100 series was calculated for each day of the year doy t for their common period at each site this average seasonal pattern was adopted as the estimated average climatological cycle or climatology the anomalies of vi and θd were subsequently calculated as the difference between the observed values and climatology for the corresponding day t 1 a x t y x t y x t where x t is the period average value for day t x t y the daily value of the variable for day t of year y and a x t y the anomaly for day t of year y the anomalies of vi and θd were assumed to follow a normal distribution to make it easier to compare anomalies in various variables we standardised the anomalies of variables by subtracting the period mean anomaly at each time step t and then dividing by the period standard deviation of the anomaly the generic calculation of z scores for each variable was 2 z x t a x t y σ ax t where a x t y is the anomaly for day t of year y σ ax t the standard deviation of anomalies for day t and z x t the standardised anomaly or z score for day t the z score indicates how many standard deviations an anomaly is away from the mean seasonal cycle a negative score implies that the deviation is below the average thus negative z scores for soil moisture anomalies z θ represent drier than average soil moisture conditions and negative z scores for vi anomalies z vi represent a decline in vegetation condition fig 2 shows an example of daily time series of z scores for nirv versus three θd depths at a cropland site in the mid central united states we established a framework to identify θd falling below a defined threshold using z θ and the onset of vegetation drought impacts using z vi we subsequently calculated two key performance metrics lead time δt and the overall skill score f2 to evaluate the early warning capability ewc we restricted the analysis to the peak growing season to avoid the influence of phenological or temperature driven vegetation browning and senescence the peak growing season was determined by the land surface phenology approach where phenological dates were determined using dynamic thresholds or a particular derivative alongside the climatological curve of the vi zeng et al 2020 the mid green up and mid brown down points were the day of the year doy at which the smoothed vi climatology crosses above and again below 50 of the vi amplitude respectively fig 3 and the peak growing season was defined as the period between mid green up and mid brown down the pre green date was defined as the doy with the trough of vi climatology closest to the green up period if there were two phenological periods at a given site we only considered the period with the larger amplitude we defined the onset of vegetation drought impact as the first date doy during the peak growing season on which z vi fell below a chosen z threshold the soil moisture deficit should precede the vegetation impact therefore we iteratively extended the search window backwards until the pre green date and determined the onset of soil moisture deficiency as the last day preceding the impact event on which z θ fell below the specified threshold combining the predictor and predictand z scores we analysed a total of 36 z threshold combinations z θ z vi encompassing all z combinations between 2 5 and 0 0 at an increment step of 0 5 the experiment was repeated for all twelve combinations of the four vis and three θ depths 2 4 evaluation of early warning capability we defined the first occurrence of vi threshold exceedance of each site year as the onset of drought vegetation impact fig 4 if the z θ threshold was crossed before the z vi threshold fig 4a it was deemed a true positive tp occurrence that successfully triggered an early warning we found that z θ could fall below the threshold multiple times within the search window before a vi impact in such cases we only regarded the last preceding z θ threshold occurrence as a successful early warning while earlier occurrences were considered false positives fp triggering false alarms if z θ did not cross the threshold at all before vegetation decline fig 4b the event was classified as a false negative fn most of the time series is made up of days without drought conditions they can be considered true negatives tn but do not give a meaningful assessment of skill hence a skill metric that does not include tn the f2 score was chosen to quantify skill for each site year the true positives tp false positives fp and false negatives fn were counted the f2 score requires estimates of precision and recall defined as 3 precision tp tp fp 4 recall tp tp fn where tp fp and fn are the number of true positives false positives and false negatives respectively precision describes to the likelihood that a z θ event accurately anticipates a z vi event and penalises the measures for false alarms fp recall describes the proportion of vegetation decline events that were accurately anticipated by a z θ trigger and penalises missed z vi events fn the following skill score captures the trade off between precision and recall 5 f β score 1 β 2 precision recall β 2 precision recall the value of β is subjective and is chosen to reflect that recall is considered β times as important as precision values of 0 5 1 and 2 are commonly used for β we preferred overpredicting vegetation impact events rather than missing them we selected a value of 2 which weighs recall twice as much as precision to provide a composite score for the skill metric the resultant f2 skill score ranges from 0 to 1 with a higher score indicating better forecast skill the f2 score is a relative skill score with no specified standards for comparing it to a normative quality assessment e g good acceptable or poor however it can be used to compare the performance of different predictors and predictands within the same forecasting approach as done here for each z threshold combination precision recall and f2 scores are calculated separately for the three θ depths and four vis the results were compared and stratified according to land cover type and climate regime for each z threshold combination the lead time δt between the z θ trigger and the z vi event was computed for each site and year the four performance metrics precision recall f2 score and lead time provide perspectives on how well the z θ threshold predicts z vi events for different z score levels due to the nature of the forecasting framework and the formulation of the f2 score there is no direct method to determine whether a calculated skill score is significantly different from a naïve forecast instead we performed a control forecast experiment for which we expected no skill on theoretical grounds and could calculate a baseline or background skill score for the control experiment we sought to remove any temporal relationship between predictor and predictand by switching the first and the second part of the z θ time series without doing the same for z vi the first part was extended by half a year in the case of an odd number of years we consider the skill of the control forecast equivalent to that of a random forecast at least on average across several sites the average change in skill score between the original and control experiment can therefore be considered as the improvement from an unskilled forecast a statistical t test was applied for each experiment to determine whether the average change among sites n 93 was statistically significantly different from zero at p 0 05 2 5 analysis between vegetation types and climate regimes access to deeper soil moisture through greater rooting depth and the degree of adaptation to drought stress vary between vegetation types we used the earlier mentioned igbp land cover product to evaluate whether there were significant differences in aspects of forecast skill between different vegetation types we expected the shallowest rooting depth and the greatest vulnerability to dryness for croplands cro n 16 and cropland natural vegetation mosaics cvm n 17 conversely we anticipated woody savannas wsa n 11 might have the greatest rooting depth and be the least sensitive to dry conditions with grasslands gra n 38 and savannas sav n 11 having intermediate characteristics climate regime in particular aridity may be a key factor in determining viable vegetation growth form but also shapes other less pronounced physiological adaptations to water availability therefore we also compared the performance metrics of early warning capability for different aridity regimes the aridity index was calculated as the ratio of mean precipitation to mean potential evapotranspiration we used the same dryness classes as tian et al 2019 3 results 3 1 temporal characterisation of threshold events some of the characteristics of threshold events identified at different z θ and z vi threshold levels are shown in fig 5 depending on the thresholds chosen events occurred between 0 25 and 8 times per year fig 5a corresponding with return intervals of 0 1 to 4 years for a chosen threshold level z θ events tended to occur more frequently than z vi events especially for θ10 this can be explained by the greater short term variability in this shallow layer compared to greater soil depths or the larger scale and temporally composited vis these patterns were consistent between the four vis for the z θ 2 5 and z vi 2 5 thresholds the respective events showed a similar frequency of occurrence the number of sites reaching different thresholds for individual years during the 2003 2019 period shows a pattern of relatively wetter and dryer conditions across the 93 sites similar patterns were observed for z θ and z vi fig 5b and 5c the number of dryness affected sites was largest in 2012 80 while relatively high numbers were also observed in 2006 65 and 2011 50 near normal and moderate threshold events z θ 1 5 to z θ 0 0 occurred at the majority of the sites 70 in nearly every year only one in ten sites were affected by severe events z θ 2 5 and z vi 2 5 during most years 3 2 evaluation of potential capability in forecasting different proxies of vegetation degradations fig 6 presents the improved forecast skill score and expected lead time for selected in situ sites for any z threshold combination forecast potential was indicated where the f2 score showed a statistically significant improvement p 0 05 compared to the skill of the baseline control experiment across the 93 sites the experiment was repeated 432 times i e for three predictors θ10 θ30 and θ100 times four predictands ndvi evi ndii and nirv times 36 six times six z threshold combinations the distribution of f2 scores indicates that forecasting skill was poorer when using ndii compared to the other three vis with only marginal differences between ndvi evi and nirv fig 6a the median value of expected lead time was 12 to 30 days fig 6b without apparent differences among the four vis the greatest soil moisture integration depth showed both higher skill and lead time however 38 out of 93 i e 41 of sites are located on grassland and this dominance may have affected the result see section 3 4 3 3 influence of z threshold combinations different z θ z vi threshold combinations produce different skills and lead times in presenting these differences we focused on the results achieved with the vegetation condition index nirv because it showed marginally higher f2 scores among the four vis the f2 skill score its components recall and precision and the lead time δt for different z threshold combinations and three soil layer depths were calculated for all 93 sites subsequently the same metrics were calculated for the control experiment and the improvement and the statistical significance of that improvement were calculated the numbers shown in fig 7 represent median values of the distribution n 93 as a potentially better indicator of central tendency although mean values were near identical the corresponding numbers for the control experiment are shown in supplementary fig s1 a relatively high f2 score does not automatically imply a skilful forecast as the control experiment may achieve a similarly high f2 score for instance in forecasting more frequent vegetation impact events z vi 0 5 the control forecast produces a similar median f2 score of 0 57 fig s1 hence there is little or no skill in the forecasts from this z threshold combination overall the improvements appear to be greatest and most significant for intermediate z threshold combinations increasing by 0 1 to 0 3 f2 score units when using a threshold of z θ 1 5 to z θ 2 0 combined with z vi 1 5 to z vi 2 5 the improvement of recall and precision fig 7b and 7c show similar patterns as for the f2 score across z threshold combinations but the skill was greater in terms of recall increased by 0 2 0 4 than in precision increased by 0 1 0 2 these findings suggest that overall skill improvement is primarily due to the reduced number of false negatives which dominates recall the z threshold combinations producing significantly improved skill do not always result in increased lead times indeed decreases in lead time compared to the control forecasts also occurred fig 7d the pattern of improvements across the different forecast metrics is similar for the three soil moisture integration depths however θ100 showed improvements across a broader range of z threshold combinations 3 4 comparisons between vegetation types and climate regimes we compared the four forecast metrics f2 skill score recall precision and lead time between the identified ecosystems and climate regimes to limit the scope of the comparison we focused on vi impacts at z 1 5 this threshold level was chosen because of the significant skill improvement and the desire to forecast less frequent more severe impacts we summarised the improvement of skill score and the achieved forecasting performances and expected lead times in the average of significant z threshold combinations for the three soil layers for different ecosystems and climate regimes fig 8 savanna vegetation sav showed skill improvement with a relatively narrow distribution of values among sites the other vegetation types showed lesser f2 skill improvement and forecast skill improvement was close to zero for woody savanna wsa fig 8a crop dominant ecosystems cro and cvm showed greater skill improvements and produced the best forecasts at shallow integration depth θ 10 the other vegetation types achieved the best forecast using the greatest integration depth θ 100 fig 8b considering precision and recall individually helps understand the trade off between the two in producing the f2 score the upper soil layer produced the best f2 score for crop dominant ecosystems cro and cvm because of the higher precision while recall remained similar fig 8c and 8d for grasslands gra θ 100 produced significantly better recall and precision p 0 05 when compared to shallower integration depths among climate regimes the greatest skill improvement was found for arid sites especially when using θ 100 fig 8f the distribution of actual skill scores appeared similar among dryness categories median skill appeared to increase slightly from 0 42 for sub humid sites to 0 51 for arid sites but the differences were not statistically significant p 0 05 fig 8g similar to vegetation types lead time increased with integrated soil layer depth but there was no clear relationship with climate dryness fig 8e and 8j across all climate regimes the θ 100 produced higher skill scores than shallower soil with a median lead time of about two to four weeks 12 28 days fig 8g and 8j the difference in skill score for different soil depths was greatest for sub arid sites due to a combination of low precision and high recall this pattern was weaker for sub humid sites where median lead times were also shorter at around two to three weeks in summary vegetation impact forecasts based on a shallower integration depth produced better forecasts for cropping systems in contrast the 0 100 cm soil layer appeared to provide better forecasts than shallower depths for grassland and savanna vegetation types and in sub arid and arid regimes overall poor skill was found for woody savannas 4 discussion 4 1 limitations and uncertainties caveats and uncertainties in our evaluation framework derive from limitations associated with the in situ soil moisture measurements satellite derived vis and the forecasting framework applied we chose to use in situ soil moisture data as we expected that they would offer more accurate estimates of soil moisture over different depths than alternative approaches based on modelling or remote sensing we were unable to independently ascertain the fidelity of the reported measurements for the scan sites relative errors of 20 in the recorded data have been reported dirmeyer et al 2016 it is noted that any systematic proportional error or offset would not have affected the calculation of normalised z θ scores but random errors might another limitation of the available in situ soil moisture data is the available record length by most operational definitions droughts have a return time of around 25 to 30 years this definition creates a statistical challenge that affects almost all drought studies because field and satellite records are of similar length at best and typically shorter the available soil moisture records at root zone depths e g 50 cm and 100 cm were mostly less than fifteen years while the time series did contain one or even more true droughts at some sites for less rare events our results should be considered representative of dry events that are infrequent but do not always formally qualify as droughts there are also limitations in the satellite vegetation observations used we used negative thresholds in standardised z scores calculated from seasonally adjusted anomalies in satellite derived vis to determine the occurrence of agricultural drought impacts we avoided vi declines due to phenological and cropping cycles by confining our analysis to within the peak growing season and using seasonally adjusted anomalies these adjustments are a deliberate departure from many previous studies along with the focus on threshold event forecasting it creates a much more severe test of forecast skill one that better represents the true potential merit of an impact forecasting system a downside of this approach is that the skill metrics and lead time we determined are not easily compared to those reported in previous studies despite the caution in treating vis limitations remain for example negative vi anomalies during the peak growing season could have occurred for reasons other than soil moisture deficit such as pests and disease intensified grazing or harvesting extreme weather events such as hail or frost or a change to a crop with markedly different characteristics furthermore it was mentioned that the vis were derived from modis mcd43a4 temporal composites in the extreme case the observation used could represent conditions 8 days earlier or later than the nominal date if observations were unavailable on any of the other 15 days we expect this problem to have been limited by the prevalence of clear sky conditions during dry periods the vis themselves also have limitations in representing true vegetation condition for example saturation effects occur in some vis at high vegetation density which can reduce their sensitivity to vegetation decline especially during the peak growing season or if drought only affects the lowest vegetation layers xue and su 2017 4 2 merit of the forecasting framework past studies of vegetation drought impact forecasting have focused on measuring correlation this broad focus has limitations when interpreting derived forecast skill and lead time measures in a drought early warning context drought impacts are concentrated in one of the tails of the distribution forecasts across the full range of conditions can therefore easily produce a misleading estimate of the true skill and lead time of drought impact forecasts by definition there are few occurrences of extreme events in the record available to train forecasting models and this can degrade calculated forecast skill it also tends to cause an underprediction of severe drought impacts and overprediction of low intensity drought impacts brust et al 2021 sutanto et al 2020 we developed a threshold based forecasting framework to overcome these issues as best as possible our framework provides a simple approach to evaluate whether there is any potential in forecasting threshold drought impacts from thresholds in the dry tail of hydro meteorological predictors as we have shown the framework facilitates the selection of optimal predictor and response variables threshold combinations and other aspects of the forecast model configuration the framework also enables control or benchmark experiments to evaluate skill and skill improvements an important feature given the wide variety of available hydro meteorological and vegetation related products using the framework developed we concluded that the standardised anomaly of nirv marginally outperformed the other satellite derived vis this does not amount tooverwhelming evidence that it is a better indicator of vegetation drought impact although it does support recent studies highlighting the merit of this index nirv is thought to respond to the distribution of photosynthetic capacity with depth in canopies thus more accurately capturing changes in structurally complex landscapes badgley et al 2017 wang et al 2022 demonstrated that the nirv might be a better proxy of dryland vegetation productivity dynamics in the western united states several alternative vis could not be considered here future research could consider the sun induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif frankenberg et al 2011 which should more directly relate to photosynthesis and the vegetation optical depth vod liu et al 2011 a measure calculated from satellite microwave radiometry that reflects water status in all above ground biomass rather than only the leaves visible from above liu et al 2015 alternatives are also available for the predictor variable this study used in situ soil moisture observations at different depths to develop and trial the framework the application of the framework across larger areas would require spatial soil moisture estimates derived from remote sensing or models such as gldas rodell et al 2004 era5 land muñoz sabater et al 2021 furthermore using soil moisture forecasts could further extend the lead time for skilful forecasts depending on how the uncertainty in those soil moisture forecasts propagates into the forecasts of subsequent vegetation impacts on theoretical grounds the preferred combination of z score thresholds in a drought warning system might be to use identical thresholds for predictor and predictand and reflect rare events i e be strongly negative these are found along the diagonal near the bottom right of the matrices in fig 7 the most negative threshold of z 2 5 appeared unsuitable as a z θ trigger with low f2 scores resulting from a combination of low recall and low precision fig 7a this is probably due to the small number of true events reaching this threshold at most of the sites this limitation also reduces the statistical strength of our results for these more severe events better combinations do occur along the diagonal for θ10 and θ30 fig 7a but for θ100 a less negative z score thresholds for soil moisture than for vi appeared to produce better results the median lead time associated with the corresponding preferred z threshold combinations was 13 to 25 days i e about two to four weeks fig 7d 4 3 forecast skill and the trade off between missed events and false alarms the z threshold combinations producing the greatest improvement in f2 scores reflect a trade off between recall and precision i e failing to forecast impacts missed events and incorrectly doing so false alarms we used the fβ skill score metric to lend greater weight to avoiding missed events this choice was motivated by the view that missing events would be more problematic than issuing false alarms in drought early warning system dews potter et al 2021 however different weightings or skill metrics could be considered and might produce different optimal combinations of predictor predictand and other aspects of forecast model configuration inevitably in terms of the skill score chosen reducing the number of missed events i e improving recall will increase false alarms i e reduce precision in a dews this would contribute to the cry wolf problem causing warnings to carry less weight or even be ignored and fail to elicit the necessary response kelman and glantz 2014 thus selecting an appropriate threshold level for the impact that is being predicted is of critical concern potter et al 2021 our results fig 8b and 8c quantify this inevitable trade off between precision and recall an additional dimension of drought forecasting is the possibility of forecasting events of varying severity we investigated the scope for such a tiered approach by examining decreasing z threshold levels associated with impacts of increasing severity and return time our results suggest that forecasting relatively more frequent impacts i e 1 0 z 0 is associated with high recall and precision but forecast skill was similar to the control forecast the relatively high actual and control forecast skill were both due to overprediction overprediction is a known issue for interpreting skill scores for an unbalanced sample and one reason why we focused on skill improvements compared to the control experiment fig s1 nonetheless modest skill improvements still occurred for θ100 suggesting that skilful warning of mild vegetation impacts may be feasible for impacts of greater severity and lower frequency z 2 0 and z 1 5 simultaneously avoiding missed alarms and false alarms is more challenging the significant improvement in skill score compared to the control experiment demonstrated forecasting potential for the most severe impacts z 2 5 forecasts were less skilful due to a high number of false alarms as indicated by low precision we attribute this to the small number of events in the relatively short site records 4 4 differences between vegetation types and climate regimes different ecosystems and climate regimes sometimes showed differences in optimal θ depths these differences are assumed to reflect variations in access to soil moisture at different depths fig 8 thus for cropping systems θ10 appeared optimal for use in early warning rooting depths in annual crops can vary dramatically depending on growth stage swain et al 2013 the optimal θ10 may have been a compromise for reflecting vegetation response in these complex and dynamically changing ecosystems the deepest θ100 produced the best forecasts for savanna and grassland sites and vegetation in more arid climate regimes the savanna and grassland sites included in our data mostly comprised native grass species in sub arid and arid regions fig 1 these ecosystems may have adapted to their local environment giving them the ability to withstand short term soil moisture anomalies better than rain fed cropland or pasture species found or introduced in more humid climate regimes to maximise agricultural productivity nippert and holdo 2015 apparently the more deeply rooted vegetation component was dominant among the sites investigated in this study the savanna and woody savanna sites showed the least potential for impact forecasting this finding is consistent with studies by chen et al 2014 and nicolai shaw et al 2017 they also found that vegetation dynamics in woody savannas have a lower correlation with soil moisture conditions tian et al 2019 found that these ecosystems sometimes respond to water availability changes over months rather than weeks suggesting that soil moisture observations down to 100 cm may be insufficient to forecast drought impacts groundwater indices based on water balance models or satellite observations such as the groundwater resource index gri mendicino et al 2008 or grace groundwater drought index ggdi thomas et al 2017 might be more skilful in forecasting changes in savanna and forests ecosystems other studies have also found that soil moisture dynamics in deeper layers are more stable due to the longer memory ghannam et al 2016 soil moisture thresholds over larger integration depths are less frequently crossed in response to short term precipitation events or periods that do not saturate the profile unfortunately soil moisture estimates available from remote sensing reflect the moisture content of the top few centimetres of near surface soil only therefore they are less likely to be skilful in forecasting drought impacts unless used to inform estimates of deeper soil moisture e g through assimilation into land surface models tian et al 2019 the propagation of drought impacts was determined by characteristics such as water holding capability and seasonal drydown pathways in different soil profile depths and vegetation types with varied root water uptake characteristics sehgal et al 2021b swain et al 2013 as a result analyses of layer wise drought impact propagation from soil moisture to vegetation could benefit the operation of drought impact forecasting over large spatial scale by generalising forecast skills achieved by different groups identified based on factors such as soil layers vegetation types and climate regimes recent attention has been drawn to the relatively fast onset of some drought events such as the 2012 drought across the central united states which developed within a few weeks otkin et al 2018 pendergrass et al 2020 our results show that vegetation typically responds to soil moisture deficits within two to four weeks other studies derived similar results for shallow rooted vegetation asoka and mishra 2015 nicolai shaw et al 2017 tian et al 2019 such a relatively rapid response emphasises the need to develop drought impact forecasting methods that can predict daily or weekly rather than monthly if warnings are to be issued in a timely fashion pendergrass et al 2020 4 5 implications for early warning and future work we found that the lead time between soil moisture triggers and vegetation impacts was generally around two to four weeks however these lead times are associated with forecasts based on real time soil moisture observations they only consider latency in the availability of past observations conversely they do not consider the additional skill and lead time that may be derived from soil moisture forecasts instead of observations seasonal soil moisture outlooks such as those issued by the usa noaa climate prediction centre van den dool et al 2003 and the australian water outlook vogel et al 2021 have been found somewhat skilful for up to three months and therefore may extend lead time further to enable drought preparation several months in advance of course skill inevitably declines with lead time in these forecasts the expected time lag between soil moisture deficits and vegetation impacts of a few weeks also means that vegetation impact forecasts will be less informative for drought forecasts several months ahead future work could adopt the framework developed here to investigate enhancements and alternative approaches for example the in situ soil moisture observations can be replaced with ensemble soil moisture forecasts or hindcasts in a research setting based on a combination of weather forecasting and land surface model s this approach can connect the rainfall soil moisture vegetation forecasting chain and provide spatially continuous forecasts of vegetation impact 5 conclusions we proposed a framework to forecast the onset of drought vegetation impacts using in situ soil moisture observations at different depths as the predictor variable and satellite derived vegetation indices as the predictand we compared the skill and lead times achieved by forecasts for vegetation impacts of varying severity and across different ecosystems and climate regimes our main conclusions are as follows 1 standardised soil moisture anomalies could be used to forecast vegetation impacts with significant skill a challenge in improving forecast skill is the relatively high rate of false alarms when using in situ soil moisture daily observations 2 the lead time between soil moisture triggers and subsequent vegetation impacts was typically around two to four weeks this lead time could be extended using skilful forecasts rather than real time soil moisture observations 3 there is a typical trade off between recall and precision generally the optimal skill improvements were achieved using similar z thresholds for soil moisture trigger and vegetation impact for moderate severity events skill scores were less good for the most severe events z score 2 5 but this was associated with a small number of events given the limited record length on average 15 years among the 93 sites 4 the soil moisture integration depth that produced the best skill varied between ecosystems with shallow 0 10 cm moisture performing better for cropping systems and deeper 0 100 cm soil moisture being optimal for grassland and savanna as well as for drier environments credit authorship contribution statement yizhi li conceptualization methodology software validation

2044,flood control operation is one of the effective measures to reduce flood risks since flood forecasting plays a critical role in real time reservoir flood control operation it is necessary to involve forecasting uncertainty in the optimal reservoir operation to inform decision making it has always been a difficult task to reduce flood risks by adjusting flood control strategies to tackle this challenge this study developed a multi objective robust optimization methodology for real time reservoir flood control operation which mainly coped with forecast uncertainty three machine learning ml models including back propagation neural network bp long short term memory neural network lstm and extreme learning machine elm were adopted to forecast the short term reservoir inflow a stacking ensemble multi ml model sem was then applied to integrate the forecasting results of the above models furthermore a multi objective robust optimal operation model morou integrating both upstream and downstream safety was established to reduce flood risks and evaluate the impact of forecasting uncertainty on the reservoir operation to maximize the efficiency of reservoir utilization this study defined a new indicator of reservoir reserved capacity adaptation rrca as one of the optimization indicators to better solve the complex multi objective problem a scenario to point stp method was proposed for searching robust solutions of multi objective optimization models methodologies were validated through an application to the lishimen reservoir china three main conclusions were derived from the study 1 three ml models performed well in flood forecasting with bp being slightly better than the other two and the sem method was found to be able to incorporate the characteristics of each model outperforming the individual models 2 morou showed a narrower distribution of flood risk both upstream and downstream and achieved an approximately 1 5 reduction in the maximum value of the highest water level 3 rrca was verified to enable to reduce the discharge flow by an average of 4 52 without occupying additional flood control reservoir capacity confirming that it can be used as an optimization indicator to improve the utilization of the reservoir the proposed method can provide robust strategies for real time reservoir flood control under forecast uncertainty keywords machine learning models forecast uncertainty multi objective flood control operation robust optimization flood risk analysis data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction on a global scale floods often affect human society and normal life as one of the most dangerous disasters kundzewicz et al 2019 experts predict that extreme flooding will become more prevalent worldwide with rapid climate change klipalo et al 2022 in china almost two thirds of the area is regularly hit by floods which seriously affect economic development and threaten the survival of human beings quan pei et al 2015 reservoirs and other hydraulic structures are built to intercept floodwaters protect the safety of upstream and downstream and reduce the damage caused by floods reservoir flood control as a non engineering measure plays a very important role in weighing flood risk control and water resources utilization real time flood control operation aims to determine the reservoir scheduling process based on future flood forecasts in conjunction with the decision maker s preferences however based on the currently available techonology flood forecasting is of high uncertainty so it is essential to study how to maximize the effectiveness of optimal flood control operation under forecast uncertainty over the past decades many methods have been proposed to forecast floods which can be broadly classified as white box models black box models and gray box models in terms of physical mechanisms the white box model can reflect not only the input output relationship of each hydrological element in the basin but also the state of the hydrological process in the basin it can represent physical processes and its parameters have clear physical meanings such as topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 and mike she model jaber and shukla 2012 but they generally require a large amount of input information including meteorological data geographic data temperature humidity soil etc which would expend a lot of calculation costs guo et al 2021b unlike physically based models data driven models which we call black box models establish mathematical relationships by considering historical data on inputs and outputs ignoring physical processes within the watershed and reflecting cause and effect relationships between relevant hydrological elements osman et al 2020 typical ones such as the autoregressive model ar carlson et al 1970 and the autoregressive moving integrated average arima model lana et al 2021 have been widely used for hydrological prediction and forecast the mechanism of the grey box model is in between the above two with the continuous development of technology machine learning ml has gradually become a popular forecasting method with its unique advantages it can take all types of data as input build data driven models to seek intrinsic connections and make predictions about the target objects we need currently widely used ml models include decision trees neural networks support vector machines etc considering the computational rate as well as the extent of widespread application artificial neural networks anns are a typical machine learning model and have been used to deal with complex problems in the field of hydrology since 1990 s hsu et al 1995 kisi et al 2019 they are connected by numerous neurons with adjustable connection weights and have the features of massively parallel processing distributed information storage and good self organizing ability many studies have confirmed that anns can improve the accuracy of rainfall runoff predictions puttinaovarat and horkaew 2020 xie et al 2019 zhou et al 2020a especially anns using a back propagation algorithm in the training phase are called bp anns jain and srinivasulu 2004 which have been used as a major forecasting method in flood forecasting reservoir operation and water resources allocation deng et al 2021 han et al 2021 liu et al 2022a ma et al 2021 the bp neural network algorithm can theoretically approximate arbitrary functions and the basic structure consists of nonlinearly varying units with strong nonlinear mapping capability recurrent neural networks rnns a typical type in deep learning are designed to deal with long input sequences salinas et al 2020 to solve the inherent problems in traditional rnn hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 proposed long short term memory neural network lstm a model with good performance in water level prediction flood forecasting runoff prediction etc cui et al 2022 kim et al 2022 nguyen and bae 2020 won et al 2022 lstm can solve the problem of long term dependencies but it requires the same time steps for input and output cao et al 2022 however one shortcoming of training neural networks is that the gradient based algorithm is relatively slow in adjusting parameters extreme learning machine elm was then designed to overcome this weakness which can use single hidden layer feedforward neural networks slfns unlike traditional learning algorithms elm randomly selects hidden nodes determines the hidden layer weight parameters deviations and the output layer weights in a parsing calculation this method reduces training time to a great extent and produces the better generalization performances huang et al 2006 many case studies have demonstrated the advantages of elm models for learning and prediction anupam and pani 2020 kumar et al 2021 poursaeid et al 2022 although the above ml models are based on different mechanisms they can all demonstrate their respective advantages in forecasting to integrate the characteristics of each model integrated learning methods which can combine multiple ml models have been developed wolpert 1992 many excellent integrated learning methods have been derived such as boosting bagging and stacking boosting algorithm is an ensemble meta algorithm method that aims to improve the predictive performance of several given weaker algorithms which was introduced by freund and schapire 1997 barzegar et al 2021 combined the resampling methods with adaptive boosting adaboost categorical boosting catboost etc and the results showed that integrating resampling methods are promising tools to improve the accuracy the full designation of bagging is bootstrap aggregation approach belonging to the group of ml ensemble meta algorithms kadavi et al 2018 compared with boosting technique bagging improves predictive performance by decreasing variance corresponding to the landslide susceptibility model zhang et al 2022 unlike boosting and bagging which mainly consider homogeneous weak learners stacking usually considers heterogeneous weak learners stacking is a specific type of ensemble learning which can take advantage of different base models to generate theoretically more promising predictions breiman 1996 the essence of stacking is to learn several different weak learners and combine them by training a meta model and then output the final prediction wang et al 2021a compared the stacking model with separate models for water quality prediction and found that the stacking model had the best robustness in prediction mallick et al 2022 combined high resolution input and stacking ensemble algorithms for developing robust groundwater potentiality models support vector machine svm or linear regression lr can be selected to create the new stacking ensemble machine learning method as the meta model it has been stated that ensemble learning can overcome related shortcomings in ordinary learning of ml models zounemat kermani et al 2021 including statistical problems when the search space is too large for the available training data computational problems where the learning algorithm fails to find the optimum solution and representation problems when the learning algorithms lack appropriate fitness functions the existing studies have confirmed that real time reservoir operations are affected by many uncertainties including forecast error real time water level measurement error flood propagation uncertainty time delay of decision making uncertainty etc forecast errors are widely recognized as the primary factors affecting the reliability of reservoir operation strategies xu et al 2021a which could lead to flood risk thus it is necessary to consider the uncertainty of flood forecasting during reservoir scheduling optimal scheduling by combining various uncertainties can lead to higher reliability of the scheduling results not only coping with unanticipated practical situations but also reducing the risk of flooding at the same time borgomeo et al 2018 ramaswamy and saleh 2020 wang et al 2021c reservoir flood control uses the interception capabilities of reservoirs to control and regulate floods in a planned manner by providing specific executable plans to guide reservoirs to store or discharge floods upstream and downstream safety can be ensured and flood risk throughout the basin can be reduced real time flood scheduling is subject to time limitations which means it requires a timely response to flood forecast results in general reservoir scheduling is usually a multi objective optimization problem because the essence of reservoir flood scheduling is a process of constant trade off between conflicting demands moreover if forecast uncertainty is considered it would be a stochastic multi objective optimization problem rather than just a deterministic problem zhu et al 2020 there are two situations that can be triggered by errors in forecasting one situation is that the forecasted flow is lower than the actual incoming flow which would prevent the water stored in the reservoir from being discharged in time gabriel martin et al 2019 and result in the reservoir level being higher than the safety threshold meanwhile if a large amount of water is released in a short period of time it may bring risks to downstream the other situation is that the forecasted flow is higher than the actual incoming flow which would lead to a pre discharge to vacate the reservoir capacity resulting in a waste of water resources the above situations can be judged as flood risks caused by uncertain forecasts there have been many studies to reduce the frequency of these types of flood risks chen et al 2021a huang et al 2022 liu et al 2020 lu et al 2022 overall reducing flood risks through optimal flood control scheduling method requires further in depth study under the premise of ensuring safety during flood seasons the reservoir should also consider the degree of utilization of the reservoir capacity to improve the comprehensive benefits of the reservoir system to evaluate the contribution of reservoir flood control capacity to flood peak reduction hui and lund 2015 defined the flood control effectiveness indicator fce as the reduction of downstream flood flow by the utilization increment of reservoir unit flood control capacity further many subsequent studies have used it as one of the objective functions of the optimal scheduling model for optimization shrestha and kawasaki 2020 zhu et al 2022 in general real time reservoir flood control scheduling strongly depends on the forecasted incoming flow however the current studies have mostly focused on achieving a greater peak reduction rate by invoking less reservoir capacity ignoring the influence of future incoming runoff meanwhile flood control scheduling is a continuously occurring event usually lasting from a few hours to a few days it is thus also very important to pay attention to the extent of reservoir flood control capacity utilization during the entire scheduling period in addition when it comes to avoiding the risks associated with floods most studies focus on balancing the upstream and downstream benefits but ignore the risks caused by over utilizing reservoir flood control capacity or wasting a larger amount of flood control capacity we can call the former case an overly risky state and the latter case an overly conservative state there is a tricky problem that often occurs in solving multi objective flood control optimization scheduling model it is that all objective functions have their own optimization directions and the decision variables need to be optimized under the premise that all constraints are satisfied robust optimization watkins and mckinney 1997 yao et al 2021 is a newly introduced modeling method for studying uncertain optimization problems there is usually a trade off between the performance achieved under ideal conditions and the robustness of the system over a wide range of uncertainty borgomeo et al 2018 once the flood is uncontrollable it can bring disastrous consequences therefore it is more secure to incorporate robust optimization into the scheduling process robust optimization models are divided into two types non probabilistic and probabilistic models ben tal et al 2009 probabilistic models optimize the model performance under budgeted risk indices allowing for acceptable risks with greater flexibility and applicability ke and chung 2016 conversely non probabilistic models usually solve problems using minimax or maximin optimization methods the constraints are generally much stricter ensuring that the optimization solution obtained based on the robust control criterion is acceptable even in the worst case scenario many recent studies have shown that the combination of robust optimization strategies can embody the reservoir scheduling robustness under uncertainty nematollahi et al 2022 xu et al 2022 in our previous study we focused more on the application of forecast uncertainty in water resources allocation guo et al 2021d and we also adopted the robust parameterized policy in our previous published article its performance can be expressed through the principle of insufficient reason which suggests that the decision could be taken by assigning equal probability to all the states in the absence of knowledge on the probabilities associated with the different states however all of the above may encounter difficulties in the optimization process due to the fact that the objective function contains multiple risk indicators and the ultimate goal is to reduce each risk value it is difficult to choose the robust strategy from many alternatives in summary there are still significant challenges to better guide decision making through reservoir flood control scheduling under uncertain flood forecasts and searching for robust strategies to address these challenges this study aims to reduce the flood risks and achieve full utilization of reservoir flood control capacity throughout the scheduling process under uncertain flood forecasts to achieve the above objectives three ml models are adopted for flood forecasting in this study and stochastic forecast scenarios are then generated by stochastic simulation to serve as input to the optimal operation meanwhile the stacking ensemble model is used to integrate the forecast results of the three ml models in addition this study proposes a multi objective robust optimization of a real time reservoir operation model for flood control that considers upstream and downstream flood risks under forecast uncertainty intending to assess the degree of utilization of reservoir flood control capacity throughout the entire scheduling period this study defines the concept of reservoir reserved capacity adaptation rrca and uses it as one of the optimization objectives of the model to improve the efficiency of reservoir utilization rrca is applied within the entire scheduling process period rather than a single time period we also innovatively consider the impact of forecasted future incoming flows on the degree of reservoir flood control capacity utilization to better solve the complex multi objective problem a scenario to point stp method is proposed for searching robust solutions of multi objective optimization models the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the framework of the proposed methodology including machine learning models used for forecasting definition

section 2 4 establishes a multi objective robust optimization model of real time reservoir operation for flood control coping with forecast uncertainty 2 1 flood forecast using machine learning models 2 1 1 machine learning models there are many machine learning models applied in the field of flood forecasting and this section briefly presents a total of three models namely back propagation neural network model bp long short term memory neural network lstm and extreme learning machine elm which are adopted in this study back propagation neural network bp is a multilayer feedforward neural network trained according to the error back propagation algorithm and is one of the most widely used neural networks a neural network is composed of massive nodes and characterizes the architecture of the network with thresholds activation functions and connection weights wallis 1999 the network will adjust the weight matrix and threshold value through the forward transfer of network structure and reverse correction of the training function until the error between the predicted result and the actual one is smaller than allowed ke et al 2012 bp neural network can analyze the relationship between input and output in an integrated manner without the need to know the intrinsic connection of training data it can also find out the implicit connection and derive reasonable laws which can approach the actual situation with high accuracy and improve the accuracy of data prediction fig 2 a shows the structure of the bp neural network the long short term memory lstm neural network was proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 and is a special type of recurrent neural network rnn which aims to overcome the weakness of traditional rnn neural network learning long term dependency compared with the traditional recurrent neural network the lstm neural network also includes an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer but its internal structure is more cleverly designed by adding three gates an input gate a forget gate an output gate and an internal cell unit the input gate selectively records the input information and transfers it to the internal memory unit the forgetting gate selectively discards the information in the internal memory unit and the output gate is responsible for selectively outputting the information from the internal memory unit the structure of the lstm neural network is shown in fig 2 b extreme learning machine elm a new neural network model proposed by huang et al 2006 is a single hidden layer feed forward neural network slfns model it randomly chooses hidden nodes and analytically determines the output weights using a least squares method instead of iterative adjusting compared with other typical slfns using gradient based learning algorithms that learn parameters of a network in an iterative way elm not only involves less calculation work higher learning speed and stronger generalization ability but also has no requirements for some parameters such as terminating condition and learning rate chen et al 2018 the objective of the elm model is to minimize the error between the output value and the target value this means that a suitable set of parameters shall be found making the goal achievable the structure of elm is shown in fig 2 c 2 1 2 k fold cross validation neural networks often suffer from overfitting during the process of fitting the noise component of the data under this circumstance it performs well over the training dataset but shows poorly in prediction geisser 1975 proposed k fold cross validation to minimize the computation complexity and avoid over fitting the dataset can be divided into k partitions in the k fold cross validation approach and each time one of the k partitions is used as the test dataset while the other k 1 partitions are put together to form a training dataset tilekar et al 2022 this reduces the bias because most data are used to train the network barile et al 2022 fig 3 shows the process of typical k fold cross validation 2 1 3 stacking ensemble multi ml model sem as three different ml models were chosen for this study it was essential to introduce an integration model that could combine heterogeneous learners the stacking ensemble method which is currently widely used was chosen to train a metamodel that can combine them the stacking ensemble learning was proposed by wolpert 1992 taking advantage of mutual complementarity among the base models to enhance generalization ability the process of stacking ensemble learning can be roughly divided into two levels firstly the dataset is trained using diverse base models to obtain the learning results secondly the results are combined as the input of the meta model to be trained and the final prediction results can be obtained to prevent overfitting the outputs from the base models are not directly learned by the meta model gu et al 2022 the k fold cross validation method is used in this ensemble learning strategy the results of each fold test are stacked as a new dataset to be input to the meta model since the base models in this study are all machine learning models this method is called stacking ensemble multi ml model short for sem the specific process is shown in fig 4 taking the 4 fold as an example k 4 we divide the original training set into four folds which are denoted as fold1 fold2 fold3 and fold4 first of all we use the data of fold2 fold4 to train the base model a and make predictions for fold1 which is used as the meta features generated by base model a for fold1 similarly we use the data of fold1 fold3 fold4 to train the base model a and make predictions for fold2 which is used as the meta features generated by base model a for fold2 and so on finally we can obtain the meta features generated by base model a for the whole original training set in addition the same method is used to generate meta features for the base model b and c constituting the complete set of meta features for the training of the meta model for the test set we can make predictions each time the base model is trained and then average the predicted values in this study the base models include bp lstm and elm and linear regression is selected as the meta model to train the prediction results from the base models 2 2 reservoir reserved capacity adaptation rrca in the general flood control scheduling the inflow i will be stored in the reservoir within the appropriate range of water level while the outflow o of the reservoir is determined by considering the important downstream control cross sections the flood control capacity of the reservoir is the volume between the flood control high water level and the flood control limit water level which is used to control the flood and meet the flood control requirements of the downstream protection objects during the scheduling period the reservoir s ability to store flood water depends on the current remaining flood control capacity rfc rfc is the capacity value between the high flood control level and the current level of the reservoir which can be used to accommodate future floods to evaluate the degree of flood control capacity utilization many studies have been conducted however there is a gap in research on how to arrange reserved reservoir capacity throughout flood control scheduling of individual reservoir and it lacks practical significance to consider only the flood reduction rate without considering the impact of future incoming flows this study proposes a new indicator reservoir reserved capacity adaptation rrca compared with the indicators currently used to evaluate the efficiency of flood control capacity utilization the advantages of rrca are reflected in two aspects 1 it incorporates the forecasted inflow and the remaining capacity and evaluates the adaptability of the remaining flood control capacity of reservoirs to the forecasted inflow 2 it also takes the entire scheduling process as an optimization cycle rather than the scheduling unit time given that the reservoir s reserved capacity represents the ability to accommodate future floods the safety status of the reservoir is closely related to the following inflow and the outflow of the reservoir fig 5 a illustrates the inflow and outflow processes of the reservoir fig 5 b illustrates the usual process of the reservoir water level change during the scheduling period if the reserved reservoir capacity cannot accommodate the following incoming flood the reservoir would face the danger of storing water above the maximum level limit and be in a risky situation threatening the safety of the upstream as well as the reservoir itself on the contrary if the reserved reservoir capacity is much larger than the next incoming flood the reservoir has a larger flood control capacity that is not utilized in this situation the reservoir can store more flood water to reduce the risk of downstream flooding while retaining flood resources so that the flood control capacity of the reservoir can be more fully utilized during the entire scheduling process on the basis of the above analysis rrca was introduced to judge the degree of flood control capacity utilization of reservoirs throughout the entire flood control scheduling period while reflecting the adaptation of the remaining flood control capacity of the reservoir to the forecasted inflow we normalize the inflow and the reserved reservoir capacity at time t and obtain the ratio of the two which can be expressed as r t as shown in eq 1 1 r t n o r m a l i z e d i t n o r m a l i z e d v flood v t t 1 2 3 t where i t represents the inflow at time t m3 s v t is the reservoir capacity at time t m3 v flood represents the total flood control capacity of the reservoir m3 t is the total number of operation periods h normalized x represents the normalization process of x in order to achieve the goal of full utilization of reservoir flood control capacity it is desirable to make the r value as close as possible to 1 during the scheduling period nevertheless the reservoir capacity changes dynamically during the scheduling process as shown in eq 2 the rrca can be expressed as eqs 3 and 4 2 v t v 0 t 0 t d i t q t d t 3 rrca t 0 t d r t d t t d t 0 t 0 t d n o r m a l i z e d i t n o r m a l i z e d

respectively v 0 is the storage capacity at the initial moment m3 v t is the reservoir capacity at time t m3 i t and q t represent the inflow and outflow at time t m3 s fig 5 c illustrates the formulation of the rrca it should be noted that there is a large dependence of the application of rrca on the accuracy of flood forecasting 2 3 multi objective reservoir operation model under deterministic streamflow the determination of reservoir operation objective function plays a very important role in reservoir flood control a suitable objective function can increase the flood control efficiency of reservoirs and minimize the losses caused by floods this subsection establishes the optimal flood control operation model on the basis of the safety of the upstream and the downstream important flood control sections a multi objective reservoir flood control optimal operation model is constructed incorporating the rrca concept proposed in subsection 2 2 this model uses deterministic streamflow series as input which can be either stacked forecasting results by stacking ensemble multi ml model short for mosem or observation streamflow short for moob the dispatch unit is hour and the proposed model takes the discharge flow per hour as the decision variable 2 3 1 objective functions the optimal operation of reservoir flood control aims to make full use of reservoir flood control capacity and ensure the safety of upstream and downstream the objective functions of the proposed model are shown below 2 3 1 1 objective1 the downstream flood control objective is to minimize the maximum discharge throughout the scheduling process which we can also call it maximum peak reduction strategy expressed as 5 min f 1 min t 1 t q t 2 t 1 t where q t represents the discharge flow of the reservoir at time t m3 s t is the total number of operation periods h 2 3 1 2 objective2 the upstream flood control objective is to minimize the highest water level of the reservoir throughout the scheduling process expressed as 6 min f 2 min max z t t 1 t where z t represents the water level of the reservoir at time t m 2 3 1 3 objective3 the reservoir flood control efficiency objective is to minimize the absolute value of the difference between rrca and 1 7 min f 3 min 1 r r c a min 1 t 0 t d n o r m a l i z e d i t n o r m a l i z e d v flood v 0 t 0 t d i t q

constraints constraints include 1 mass balance equation 8 v t 1 v t i t q t e t δ t where v t and v t 1 represents the reservoir capacity at time t and t 1 m3 e t is the evaporation at time t m3 s i t

capacity curve and water level discharge capacity curve of the reservoir respectively there are many intelligent optimization algorithms for solving multi objective problems such as particle swarm algorithm genetic evolution algorithm gray wolf algorithm etc among them the widely used genetic evolutionary algorithm introduces the idea of probability in natural selection and the selection of individuals has a random nature it avoids the algorithm to fall into local optimum by variation mechanism and has strong search ability it is well known that the proportion of non dominated solutions is exponentially related to the number of targets in the set of randomly selected target vectors in this study we adopted non dominated sorting genetic algorithm iii nsga iii algorithm deb and jain 2014 for solving the proposed model this algorithm is an improved multi objective optimization algorithm based on nsga ii deb et al 2002 which is subject to some limitations such as difficulty in satisfying the constraints by using a random method to generate the initial population low performance of the optimal solution and very restricted spread uniformity suwal et al 2020 nsga iii decomposes the entire search space into multiple subspaces through a set of uniformly distributed multiple reference points and searches these subspaces in parallel during the evolutionary process for the purpose of maintaining population diversity as shown in many previous studies nsga iii can effectively solve multi objective optimization problems bahrami et al 2022 dariane et al 2021 liu et al 2022b sharma et al 2022 zhou et al 2020b we use this algorithm to obtain the pareto solution set of the model and further analyze the properties of its non inferior solutions since uncertain inputs were combined in the operation model the time required for the computation would increase multiplicatively with the number of stochastic scenarios and the number of populations to address this challenge liu et al 2018 proposed that the fork join parallel framework could be deployed to parallelize the chance constrained dynamic programming in a multi core environment for improving computational efficiency inspired by existing studies out work utilized a parallel algorithm that uses multiple computer processing cores to do the calculation simultaneously 2 4 multi objective robust optimization model coping with forecast uncertainty since flood forecasts have extremely high uncertainties the flood risk caused by the uncertainty should be considered when using flood forecast results as operation inputs incorporating the concept of robust optimization this section established a multi objective robust optimization reservoir operation model for flood control coping with flood forecast uncertainty morou 2 4 1 multi objective reservoir operation model for flood control 2 4 1 1 objective functions flood control optimization operation aims to utilize the flood control capacity of reservoirs and determine the discharge solutions when facing a stochastic forecast scenario different scheduling processes will have different flood risk values for the upstream and downstream herein the proposed model aims to reduce both the upstream and downstream risks under stochastic scenarios integrating the upstream and downstream flood protection objectives the proposed model includes the following five objective functions objective1 is to minimize the maximum probability of water level exceeding the level safety upper limit representing the upstream safety of the reservoir the probability refers that under various forecast scenarios the corresponding scheduling scheme will be generated by the calculation of the optimal scheduling model based on the inflow and outflow of the reservoir the process of water level change can be obtained by water balance calculation and then the probability of exceeding the safety limit can be judged according to the upper water level limit the objective function can be expressed as 14 min f 1 min max c o u n t z n t z up n t 1 t where z n t denotes the water level of scenario n at time t m z up is the water level safety upper limit m n is the total number of scenarios t is the number of operation periods h and c o u n t is the counting function objective2 is to minimize the maximum probability of release exceeding the safety upper limit representing the downstream safety of the reservoir the probability refers that under various forecast scenarios the corresponding scheduling scheme will be generated by the calculation of the optimal scheduling model based on the outflow of the reservoir the probability of exceeding the safety limit can be judged according to the upper discharge flow limit the objective function can be expressed as 15 min f 2 min max c o u n t q n t q up n t 1 t where q n t denotes the discharge flow of scenario n at time t m q up is the safety upper limit of outflow which is calculated backwards based on the safe flow of the downstream flood control section m3 s objective3 is to minimize the maximum proportion of the number of hours when the water level exceeds the upper limit to the total scheduling periods unit period hour which can be expressed as eq 16 when large floods are encountered it is unavoidable that the reservoir level will exceed the safety threshold consequently the risk should be controlled as much as possible by minimizing the number of periods that the water level exceeds the threshold 16 min f 3 min p r o b p e r i o d z n t z up min c o u n t z n t z up t 1 t n t similar to objective3 objective4 is to minimize the maximum proportion of the number of hours when the maximum outflow during the scheduling process exceeds the upper limit to the total scheduling periods unit period hour expressed as eq 17 when encountering large floods in order to ensure the safety of the reservoir itself sometimes it is necessary to sacrifice downstream safety to a certain extent the duration that the outflow exceeds the safe threshold should be shortened as much as possible 17 min f 4 min p r o b p e r i o d q n t q up min c o u n t q n t q up t 1 t n t objective5 is to minimize the maximum probability that the reservoir is in too risky or too conservative situation expressed as s risky and s conservative respectively s risky represents that the subsequent incoming flood may be much higher than the reservoir s capacity to intercept causing the risk of inability to contain the flood water s conservative represents that the subsequent incoming flood is much smaller than the reservoir s capacity to intercept indicating that there is a larger flood control capacity that fails to participate in the process the objective function is shown in eq 18 18 min f 5 min p r o b s risky o r s conservative min c o u n t n y rrca n 0 8 o r y rrca n 1 n t 1 t where y rrca n represents the value of rrca of scenario n which can be calculated by eq 4 based on practical considerations in this study we set a tolerance level of 20 for this risk so that the cases are identified as too risky situation when y rrca n 0 8 while the cases are identified as too conservative situation when y rrca n 1 2 4 1 2 constraints the constraints of the morou model are approximately the same as those of the model in section 2 3 however it should be noted that the morou model involves different forecast scenarios as input so the series of decision variables for different scenarios need to be constrained separately in the scheduling process consistent with model in subsection 2 3 the model presented in this subsection is also solved by the nsga iii algorithm 2 4 2 multi objective robust optimization in scenario to point stp method in multi objective optimization problems lots of studies incorporate the concept of robustness to search for pareto solution sets robust optimization gong et al 2021 is a modeling method for studying uncertain optimization problems in the early stages of development robust optimization was mainly about solving the worst case scenario in the most unfavorable situation later robust optimization was used to solve multi objective problems for all possible situations the constraint conditions are satisfied and the function value of the objective function in the worst case is optimized this implies that even under numerous uncertainties decision makers can choose options that can be adapted to all situations based on decision preferences in solving multi objective optimization problems measures of robust optimization can include the following borgomeo et al 2018 ①maximin select alternative with the least worst performance ②maximax select alternative that maximizes the best possible performance ③minimax regret select alternative that minimizes the worst case regret this study applies the minimax regret criterion to measure the robustness of the reservoir flood control scheduling options under a range of flood forecasting scenarios considering that the objective functions involve several indicators of risk values and the ultimate goal of optimization is to reduce each risk value it is important and challenging to select which alternative to use as the representative sequence for that individual for the next iteration of optimization this difficulty is because each population individual is processed to satisfy the constraints when faced with different forecast scenarios and then different alternatives are generated correspondingly this study proposes a method called scenario to point stp to solve this problem unlike previous studies which choose the value of the worst case scenario for each objective as the individual value for that objective to continue optimization this study considers all the index values of each scenario for all objectives in the robust optimization and translates the performance of each scenario into a specific value since there is a corresponding risk associated with the flood control scheduling scheme after its implementation which is not expected we need to define a metric to assess the acceptability of future risks and make it quantified therefore the regret value rv is adopted to represent the synthesized performance of each group of decision variables to further filter out the scheduling solution with robustness in this study the ideal state for flood scheduling is that each target risk value is zero as a result rv is defined as the difference between each risk value and zero that may arise when different strategies are implemented a higher value of rv indicates a higher risk and a more inappropriate scheduling solution the detailed application process is shown in the fig 6 suppose there is a population size of m and each individual needs to be handled to satisfy the constraints when faced with n forecast scenarios thus generating m n sets of alternatives for each of these n sets of alternatives their target values are calculated and thus regret values can be obtained according to the robust minimax regret criterion the solution with the largest regret value is selected as the representative solution for that individual and continues to be optimized iteratively which is essentially the worst case optimization ultimately we can achieve that in the face of different forecast scenarios even the most unfavorable case the solution we screened can satisfy our demand for risk avoidance and we call this set of solutions the worst case we can also extract solutions having the minimum regret value from each set of alternatives in the non inferior solutions as the final set of solutions which we call optimal case note that the extraction of the optimal case is limited to the treatment of the pareto front only 3 case study 3 1 study area and data description based on the data support a real case study of the lishimen lsm reservoir was employed to demonstrate the proposed real time reservoir operation model the lsm reservoir is located on shifeng creek in the jiaojiang river basin east china the jiaojiang river is the third major river in zhejiang province the lsm reservoir as the largest reservoir on the watershed of shifeng creek plays a very important role in flood control and prevention due to its strong regulation capacity the catchment area above the reservoir is 296 km2 and the total length of main stream above the dam site is 35 2 km the total reservoir capacity is 179 3 million m3 and the flood control capacity is 35 7 million m3 it is a large reservoir mainly for flood control and irrigation combined with water supply power generation and other uses the runoff in the jiaojiang river basin is mainly formed by precipitation and the inter annual and intra annual variations of runoff and precipitation are basically synchronized as the area is affected by typhoons floods can occur quickly threatening the safety of the upstream and downstream of the reservoir real time flood forecasting has high uncertainty and heavy rainfall floods in the jiaojiang river basin are relatively concentrated resulting in steep rise and fall of a flood the location of the lsm reservoir is illustrated in fig 7 the primary information for flood control of the lsm reservoir is listed in table 1 in this study both the rainfall observation data from 1987 to 2020 at six rainfall stations xiatian tuoxi sixie fangqian sijiakeng and lishimen and actural runoff data of the lsm reservoir were collected based on the integrity of available data a total of 22 floods were selected as the data set for constructing the flood forecasting model among them 16 floods of all data series were selected as the initial training set while 6 floods were selected as the test set table 2 shows the statistical characteristics of inflow runoff of flood events during the training and test periods it can be noted that the maximum and minimum values of the data are included in the training data set which guarantees that the model can thoroughly learn from historical hydrological events 3 2 numerical experiment setup 3 2 1 real time flood forecast and scenario simulation in real time flood forecasting many factors affect the forecast results including antecedent streamflow antecedent precipitation current precipitation antecedent evaporation and so on this study collected antecedent streamflow of the lsm reservoir and antecedent precipitation from six rainfall stations since evaporation observations are less available and are less important for flood forecasting than precipitation the effect of evaporation is not considered in this study q represents the streamflow and p n represents the precipitation from n th rainfall station xiaantian rainfall station tuoxi rainfall station sixie rainfall station fangqian rainfall station sijiakeng rainfall station and lishimen rainfall station determining the input variables involves finding the lags of precipitation that significantly influence the predicted flow sudheer et al 2002 proposed a data processing method to determine the appropriate driving factors as model inputs based on the inter correlation autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation properties of the data series cross correlation analysis between the rainfall and runoff in the study area suggested that the strength of relationship is significant up to a lag of 18 h combined with the rainfall situation at the current moment to be considered in the real time forecasting process a total of 114 variables are used as input factors for the forecast model in this case the streamflow is forecasted using the following equations 19 q t f p t 1 p t 1 1 p t 2 1 p t 18 1 p t 2 p t 1 2 p t 2 2 p t 18 2 p t n p t 1 n p t 2 n p t 18 n where f is the mapping function between inputs and outputs which can be modeled by bp lstm and elm in our study p t n represents the precipitation data at n rainfall station at time t in order to make the training process of the three models more standardized all input variables were normalized to the range of 0 1 and the min max normalization method was chosen in this case since the problem of overfitting is easy to occur in the process of machine learning the k fold cross validation method was introduced in this study to avoid this situation firstly the whole data was divided into two parts the training set and the test set the data in the training set was divided into k parts for each training one part of the training set was used as the validation set and the remaining k 1 parts were used for training the forecast results of the test set data under this training model could also be obtained this method allowed each data part to be trained and validated to reduce overfitting and improve model performance eventually the data consisted of three parts 1 training 2 validation and 3 test it should be noted that to ensure the integrity of each flood during training and validation the training set was divided according to the start and end of the flood when it was divided into k parts rather than uniformly by the length of the data at the hourly scale since the training set contained 16 floods we set k as four and each part included four floods a total of 22 events were used to establish the forecast models where 12 events were for training 4 were for validation and 6 were for testing selecting the hyper parameters of bp lstm and elm models such as the number of hidden layers hidden units the dropout rate and the learning rate remains a challenging task guo et al 2021c this study used the nash efficiency coefficient nse as the loss function while adaptive moment estimation adam was used as the optimizer adam is an update of the rmsprop optimizer the best trained parameter set was selected as the parameter value of the forecasting model by traversing the possible values of each parameter the determination of the set of alternative parameter values is dependent on experiences in order to fully demonstrate the uncertainty of forecasting and determine its impact on flood scheduling three machine learning forecasting models were used as the basis for random simulations and one flood event no 20040812 was selected for forecasting and scheduling of a real case this flood event was caused by severe typhoon rananim no 0413 in 2004 rananim with wide range and intensity made landfalls on the coast near shitang town wenling city zhejiang province at 20 00 on august 12 2004 and the lishimen reservoir was affected by it the whole flood started at 15 00 on august 12 and ended at 14 00 on august 14 lasting 48 h in total according to the rainfall data from the telemetry stations in the basin the average maximum hourly rainfall in the basin is 30 8 mm as for simulating forecast errors the stochastic streamflow series of 2004 were simulated by artificially transforming model parameters including the number of hidden layer nodes batch size dropout and so on the scenarios with nash efficiency coefficients lower than 0 75 were eliminated to ensure the reasonableness of the simulation results 100 sets of scenarios for each model were selected from the remaining flow series at equal intervals from high to low eventually forming a total of 300 sets of runoff scenario series from three models 3 2 2 real time reservoir operation for flood control in order to analyze the impact of the flood forecast uncertainty on the reservoir system and to evaluate the effectiveness of stacking ensemble multi ml model sem three numerical experiments are designed and applied to lsm denoted as morou mosem and moob respectively morou the multi objective robust optimization model coping with forecast uncertainty morou is used as the flood control operation model the stochastic inflow scenarios generated as described in section3 2 1 are served as input conditions for the optimal model mosem the multi objective reservoir operation model under flood forecast using sem is used as the flood control operation model the model input is deterministic inflow forecasting generated by stacking ensemble multi ml model sem moob to set up the control group actual observed series of inflow is used as model input the objective function and constraints of the model are the same as those of the mosem model and the only difference is the input of the model the nsga iii algorithm is run with parameters set as follows population size n 100 the maximum number of iterations 500 the encoding method ri these three experiments are implemented under the same condition including the same calculating workstation with intel r core tm i5 10400f cpu 2 90 ghz the same population size the same maximum number of iterations and the same encoding method real integer encoding the solution oriented findings resulting from the multiple choice criteria would help decision makers reframe more effective measures malka et al 2022 this study uses a multi criteria risk decision making method based on subject objective weights combination to filter out compromise solution from non inferior solutions the process of screening solutions includes the following steps first of all the indicators involved in the evaluation are determined and the subjective weight matrix of each indicator is given in this study the upstream and downstream indicators are set at the same level of importance the importance of upstream and downstream security affects the bias of the scheduling strategy if upstream safety is at a more important level the resulting scheduling scheme will focus more on lowering the maximum reservoir level by sacrificing downstream safety to some extent on the contrary if the downstream safety is more important the optimized scheduling scheme will focus more on reducing the maximum downstream flow of the reservoir to prevent exceeding the downstream safety flow the subjective weight matrix r can be set as r 1 1 1 1 secondly the subjective weight values are determined the common methods currently used include analytical hierarchical process method ahp weighted factor judgment table method delphi method etc in this study the subjective weights of each indicator are determined using the analytical hierarchical process method ahp which is a simple flexible and practical multi criteria decision making method for quantitative analysis of qualitative problems and has been used in many studies al sawaf et al 2022 chen et al 2021b mu et al 2022 its characteristic is to organize the various factors in a complex problem by dividing it into a multilevel hierarchical structure i e top level objectives middle level criteria and sub criteria and lower level alternatives ilderomi et al 2022 thirdly the objective weights are determined the popular methods available nowadays include entropy weight method coefficient of variation method regression analysis method etc in this study we use the entropy weight method ewm to show the dispersion degree of indicators and to determine the objective weights ewm is a comprehensive evaluation method that can be used for multiple objects and multiple indicators its evaluation results are mainly based on objective information almost independent of subjective factors and can avoid the interference of human factors to a large extent finally the combined weights are then derived using the linear weighted average method to comprehensively consider the influence of subjective experience as well as the influence of objective data distribution the ratio of subjective and objective weights to total weights is set at 1 2 each and then the combined weight value is obtained by linear weighting as the basis for evaluating the importance of each indicator the assumed weights of 1 2 each also reflect that subjectivity and objectivity are on equal level of importance when screening solutions in practice however decision makers can make adjustments according to the actual situation to further evaluate the impact of rrca on scheduling this study also builds a model that is basically the same as morou with the difference that objective 5 is not involved in the optimization which we call morou nof5 similarly we solve the model by using the nsga iii optimization algorithm to obtain the scheduling scheme for different forecast scenarios morou nof5 the objective function objective1 2 3 4 and constraints of the model are the same as those of the morou model objective5 is not retained 4 results 4 1 results of flood forecasting and scenario simulation 4 1 1 flood forecasting using ml model according to the numerical experimental setup in section 3 2 1 we obtained the forecast results of the three models which are presented by hydrographs and scatter plots shown in fig 8 different parts of dataset k 1 2 3 4 were selected as the validation set in k fold cross validation the evaluation indicators of forecast results of each model are shown in table 3 as observed in fig 8 it is clearly shown that the forecasted streamflow deviates gradually from the 1 1 line as streamflow gradually increases which indicates that the model forecasts better in small floods than in large floods this is because the number of large floods used for training and validation is relatively small making it difficult to fully extract the characteristics of large floods as a result the forecast results are somewhat worse than for other types of floods this can also be seen from the colors of the curves which are basically blue when at low flows but tend to be yellow when the flood event is larger or at the flood peak position comparing the results of the three models the results predicted by the bp model are relatively closer to the observation values the test set has a minimum value of 0 87 and a maximum value of 0 91 for nse with the prediction of the bp model while the results of the lstm model and elm model are relatively similar varying in the range of 0 84 0 87 and 0 87 0 88 respectively the overall performance of all three models is relatively good reflecting machine learning models advantages when k takes different values which means different events of floods are used as the training set there is a clear difference in the performance of the three models different ml models have different intrinsic mechanisms that lead to specific advantages in the training process based on data features as can be seen from fig 8 and table 3 the lstm model has the best performance when k is equal to 1 the bp model has the best performance when k is equal to 3 and the elm model has a more stable performance in the four test experiments this is due to the fact that different k values represent that the training set contains floods of different magnitudes when k is equal to 2 the big flood is divided into validation set and not included in the training set making it difficult for the model to capture the characteristics of various floods during the training process and consequently the model is not as well trained as the other sets k 1 3 4 for a comprehensive analysis of the prediction accuracy of the model the forecast results of test set of four test experiments were averaged and then compared the six flood events were analyzed separately as shown in fig 9 these six flood events include small ones with a return period of about five years e g 2005 2016 and large ones with a return period of nearly 100 years e g 2004 fig 9 presents the forecasting performance of the three models for different types of floods compared with 2004 and 2009 the forecast results of the ml models for 2005 and 2016 performed better further indicating that the uncertainty of the forecasts increases with the rise in flood magnitude to further investigate the impact of flood forecast uncertainty on flood control scheduling and to verify whether scheduling can effectively reduce flood risk the 2004 flood event was selected as a case study for the operation model 4 1 2 stochastic scenarios and stacking scenario simulation in this study the streamflow series of 2004 were simulated randomly by artificially transforming model parameters such as the number of hidden layer nodes batch size dropout and so on as described in subsection 3 2 1 to ensure the reasonableness of simulation results each streamflow series generated from the simulation was initially screened according to its nash efficiency coefficient value nse and scenarios with nse lower than 0 85 were eliminated the remaining scenarios were retained for further analysis to investigate the impact of forecast uncertainty on flood control scheduling in order to make the streamflow scenarios predicted by each model simulate the forecast errors in a wide variety of situations the remaining simulated streamflow scenarios were sorted by nash efficiency coefficients 100 sets of scenarios for each model were selected at equal intervals from high to low eventually forming a total of 300 sets of runoff scenarios fig 10 shows the inflow scenarios generated by the stochastic simulations of the three models it can be seen that the observations can be covered by the simulations this study also picked root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and regression coefficient r2 as forecast error evaluation indicators nash efficiency coefficients nse are generally used to verify the goodness of the hydrological model simulation results root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae are currently widely used in many studies in the evaluation of the prediction effect kim et al 2022 lei et al 2021 xie et al 2019 xu et al 2021b which can well reflect the deviation between the predicted value and the actual value and characterize the accuracy of the prediction the predictive performance of the model can also be assessed according to the regression coefficient r2 anupam and pani 2020 deng et al 2021 jiang et al 2020 the higher the value of r2 the higher the prediction accuracy the maximum and minimum values of the indicators for each model are shown in table 4 in order to analyze the effect of forecast uncertainty on reservoir operation it is also necessary to set up a control test group using deterministic flood forecast runoff series as input for the optimal scheduling solutions obtained in this way the flood risks can be calculated and analyzed in the face of different forecasted inflow scenarios in this study a stacking ensemble multi ml model sem was adopted and the forecast results of three ml models were used as input to synthesize the characteristics of three models then we selected linear regression as the second layer meta model the specific process is described in detail in subsection 2 1 3 eventually a unique runoff forecast sequence was obtained which we call it sem forecast as shown in fig 10 the overall trend of the runoff series by sem is generally consistent with the trend of the actual flood but it has smaller flood peak value compared to the actual observed series the indicators of sem forecast are shown in table 4 as shown in table 4 the prediction results after the integration of sem tend to incorporate the errors of each model with a nse value of 0 900 and a r2 value of 0 912 though the result of sem does not exceed the prediction accuracy of the best performing of three models it outperforms the worst performing in all indicators by comparing the indicators the predictions of the stacking approach are better than those of the individual models it can be concluded that sem successfully integrates the characteristics of the three models 4 2 results of flood control operation and risk analysis 4 2 1 flood control risk evaluation based on the multi objective robust optimization in scenario to point stp method introduced in section 2 4 2 each individual in the population can generate a set of scheduling strategies that satisfy the constraints according to different forecast scenarios therefore the regret values of the optimized solutions were calculated the set of solutions with the smallest regret value was the set of non inferior solutions for the optimal case and conversely the set of solutions with the largest regret value was the set for the worst case the distributions of the objectives of morou mosem and moob models are shown in fig 11 specifically the risks of upstream and downstream of the mosem model and moob model were calculated directly from non inferior solutions rather than through optimization for the worst case of the morou non inferior solution set the upstream and downstream flood risk probabilities vary in the range of 0 77 0 917 and 0 027 0 043 respectively the proportions of the number of hours in which flood risk occurs upstream and downstream to the entire operation periods vary in the range of 0 140 0 243 and 0 0 083 respectively for mosem the four risk values for upstream and downstream are distributed in 0 1 0 1 0 0 673 and 0 0 125 respectively when the observed inflow series were used as model input the risk values of its non inferior solution set were calculated under different forecast scenarios distributed in 0 0 917 0 1 0 0 406 and 0 0 104 respectively in comparison with mosem and moob morou has a much narrower distribution of risks for both upstream and downstream as shown in fig 11 the mean values of all risks of the morou are at the lowest level except for objective 1 and objective 4 however this is the risk distribution of worst case in the non inferior solution set obtained from morou which has already performed relatively better than mosem and moob for the optimal case of morou the mean values of all risk indicators are at the lowest level and perform a much narrower distribution varying in the range of 0 003 0 023 0 027 0 043 0 0001 0 0007 and 0 0 0208 respectively the above results demonstrate that when the forecast uncertainty is considered in the scheduling process both upstream and downstream flood risks can be effectively reduced as we all know flood forecasts have extremely high uncertainty and a wide range of error sources suppose the deterministic flood forecast is used as scheduling input in that case it will make its optimal scheduling scheme lack the flexibility to cope with different forecast scenarios and raise the flood risk threshold we can also analyze the performance of the morou model by comparing the distribution range of the maximum discharge flow of the reservoir and the maximum reservoir level during the flood scheduling process under different forecast scenarios according to the non inferior solutions to further explore the optimization mechanism of morou in reducing flood risks of upstream and downstream coping with forecast uncertainty fig 12 a shows the distribution range of the maximum discharge flow of the reservoir during the flood scheduling process in three different cases the maximum discharge distribution of the reservoir after optimal scheduling by the morou model is 876 18 m3 s 1006 48 m3 s while 341 25 m3 s 1217 60 m3 s for mosem and 677 29 m3 s 1303 41 m3 s for moob according to the safety discharge limit of the downstream flood control section the maximum discharge of the lsm reservoir cannot exceed 1000 m3 s when the discharge flow exceeds 1000 m3 s it exposes the downstream to the risk of inundation it can be seen that the morou model minimizes the downstream risk of the reservoir compared with mosem and moob although morou has some solutions with the maximum discharge slightly exceeding 1000 m3 s most of them are distributed between 870 m3 s and 930 m3 s which better ensures the downstream safety of the lsm reservoir fig 12 b shows the distribution of maximum reservoir levels in three comparative models the ranges of the maximum reservoir level for the three models vary in 176 93 m 180 85 m morou 176 74 m 184 29 m mosem and 177 68 m 182 74 m moob respectively according to the characteristics of the reservoir the upper water level for flood control of the lsm reservoir is 180 69 m with a return period of twenty years and the design flood level is 181 34 m with a return period of one hundred years it is clear that coping with forecasting uncertainty can make the distribution of the highest water level in the reservoir more concentrated and basically below the upper water level for flood control compared with morou the maximum water levels of mosem and moob present a wider distribution and most of them are above 180 m even higher than the design flood level which would bring a more significant flood risk to the reservoir upstream the extreme value of the maimum water level of morou is 180 848 m which decreased by 1 87 and 1 03 compared to mosem and moob respectively although the mean value 898 61 m3 s of the maximum release of morou is the largest among the three models it is desirable to increase the discharge flow to ensure the safety of the reservoir under the premise that the safe discharge is not exceeded it is mainly because the highest water levels of mosem and moob are mostly distributed above the flood limit level therefore to protect upstream safety it is necessary to increase the release to a certain extent the conventional optimal flood scheduling model is difficult to cope with flood forecasts with high uncertainty when there is a large error between the forecast result and the actual situation the optimal scheduling solution is no longer applicable and may even bring greater flood risks to the upstream and downstream threatening the safety of the reservoir consequently it is sensible to incorporate the forecast uncertainty into the optimal scheduling process which can effectively reduce the flood risks and make the scheduling solution meet the safety requirements even in the worst case 4 2 2 compromise solutions based on the approach described in subsection3 2 2 the compromise solutions of morou mosem and moob models were filtered out which were denoted as solution s solution d and solution o respectively it should be noted that there are two types of solution s one filtered from the set of worst case solutions and the other filtered from the set of best case solutions which do not contradict each other and exist simultaneously the values of each risk of the non inferior solutions which are also the values of the objective functions are shown in fig 13 a and fig 13 b it is clear that the risk values of solution s are not always smaller than the other two this is due to the fact that the morou model is optimized by the stp method so that the worst case scenario is optimized therefore the final set of non inferior solutions obtained is still within an acceptable range even for the worst case scenario in other words under this optimization method when choosing the optimal case in the non inferior solution set better performance can be achieved under each metric the best case compromise solution of morou can almost guarantee the safety of the upstream and downstream form flood risks overall it gives full play to the flood control role of the reservoir compared with solution o which uses the observed streamflow as the input to the model solution d using the deterministic inflow from the stacking model as the input can cause greater values at each risk this indicates that the forecast inflow scenario by the sem model is at a lower level than the observed series as a result the optimal scheduling scheme fails to release the flood in time making the distribution of the maximum water level higher and threatening the safety of the reservoir the detailed discharge process and the water level process of compromise solutions are shown in fig 14 although the maximum water level in solution s is the highest among the three compromise solutions it does not exceed the upper limit of the water level at the same time solution s successfully keeps the maximum discharge flow under the limit of 1000 m3 s compared to the maximum discharge flows of solution o and solution d which are 1303 41 m3 s and 1217 60 m3 s respectively solution s reduces the flood peak value by 22 78 and 17 34 solution s shows robustness in the face of different scenarios of forecast floods even in facing with the worst case scenario the highest water level of the reservoir during the scheduling process is within an acceptable range 4 2 3 performance analysis of rrca in the case study the proposed morou model was applied to the real time flood operation of the lsm reservoir and the scheduling solutions and the resulting flood risks were compared and analyzed coping with the flood forecast uncertainty to further evaluate the impact of rrca on scheduling this section mainly compares the optimization results of morou model and morou nof5 model fig 15 shows the distribution of the maximum discharge and the maximum water level of the non inferior solution set of the morou withf5 model and morou nof5 model respectively it can be seen that the distributions of the highest water level of the two optimization models are relatively close the mean values are similar with morou nof5 at 180 135 m and morou withf5 at 180 031 however the maximum discharge flow distributions represent a very obvious difference when objective 5 rrca is not involved in the optimization the average maximum discharge flow is 941 159 m3 s but when the optimization of objective 5 is incorporated in the optimal scheduling process the average maximum discharge flow is 898 608 m3 s which is about 4 52 lower than that of the morou nof5 model this demonstrates that the involvement of rrca in the optimal scheduling process allows the maximum water level of the reservoir to be maintained at a relatively stable level and the maximum discharge flow to be reduced to a lower level this further confirms that the degree of utilization of the reservoir s flood control capacity is improved throughout the scheduling process in this study we generated 300 sets of stochastic forecast scenarios in section 3 2 2 and the scheduling strategies were obtained based on different forecast scenarios they were subsequently optimized iteratively by the stp method to compose a non inferior solution set we calculated the mean values of rrca of the non inferior solutions from both morou nof5 and morou withf5 for different scenarios meanwhile the total inflow volumes for 300 forecast scenarios were also calculated the distributions are shown in fig 16 according to the comparison between fig 16 a and fig 16 b the distribution of the rrca values is closer to 1 when objective5 is involved in the optimization with an average value of 1 138 the rrca value calculated from the non inferior solution set of morou nof5 can reach up to 1 723 and the average value is 1 140 which is higher than that of the morou withf5 by observing the scatter plot of rrca value and the total amount of inflow volume it can be seen that there is a negative correlation between the two scenarios with greater flooding have the value of rrca closer to 1 this means that when larger floods are encountered the reservoir s flood control capacity can be fully utilized by introducing the concept of rrca for optimization while guaranteeing the safety of the upstream and downstream 5 discussion 5 1 flood forecasting and ensemble performance currently ml based forecasting methods have been widely used in hydrological forecasting and have shown good performance apaydin et al 2020 han et al 2021 kim et al 2022 nguyen and bae 2020 qu et al 2021 all three sets of forecasting models in this study have relatively good forecasting results which can be seen in table 3 it is clear for us that the precipitation and inflow forecasting are associated with uncertainty moreover the bp model has relatively better prediction results than the other two sets of models through testing different magnitudes of floods we also find that the forecast uncertainty increases with the magnitude of the flood as shown in fig 10 the forecasted runoff series obtained from the integration of multiple models can well respond to the trend of the measured runoff confirming that the forecasting characteristics of multiple models can be well integrated in this way similarly buhan et al 2020 developed a hybrid ensemble model based on three forecast models to produce a weighted average of the outputs of the individual models the difference with this study lies in the fact that it not only integrated multiple machine learning models but also incorporated the forecast results of hydrological models it can also be seen from table 4 that the prediction results after the integration of sem tend to incorporate the errors of each model with a nse value of 0 900 and a r2 value of 0 912 the result of sem is better than the worst performing in all indicators of three individual models demonstrating that sem can effectively integrates the characteristics of multiple models 5 2 robustness of optimal flood control operation in general optimal flood control scheduling that incorporates uncertain flood forecasts provides a better representation of robustness the purpose of robust optimization is to find a solution in which the constraints are satisfied for all possible cases and the function value is optimal for the worst case it not only avoids the risk in the planning process but also balances the cost and risk relationship of the system and effectively increases the feasibility of the model solution and the stability of the system zhang et al 2020 in this study we explored studies that aim at integrating flood forecasting in the process of real time flood control operation fig 11 demonstrates that the distributions of risk values for the morou model are somewhat narrower than those of moob and mosem there is also a reduction in the average risk values providing good evidence of the improved robustness of the scheduling scheme after combining the uncertainty forecasts similar conclusions can be drawn from the studies of wang et al 2021b hecht and kirshen 2019 and guo et al 2021a multiple robustness measures exist and the decision on which measure to adopt is still uncertain because different preferences can lead to potentially different choices and outcomes borgomeo et al 2018 mcphail et al 2018 to further explore this issue we proposed the stp method which considered all the risk values of each scenario simultaneously in the robust optimization translated the performance of each scenario into a specific value and then applied the worst case optimization this is because the scheduling strategies corresponding to each scenario may have different representations in different risk indicators in order to make optimal scheduling more meaningful it should be ensured as far as possible that the flood risk from the most unfavorable alternative among multiple options is also within the acceptable range therefore we chose to optimize the worst scenario in the iterative process in fig 11 the worst case of the morou model outperformed the other two models while the optimal case reduces each risk level further instead of optimizing the worst case scenario for each risk metric which neglects the overall applicability of the scheduling alternatives the stp method is more conducive for applications in practice 5 3 limitations and prospects for real time reservoir operations the process of reservoir scheduling is affected by many uncertainties including forecast error real time water level measurement error flood propagation uncertainty and the time delay of decision making uncertainty etc for better flood prediction and adopting the proper mitigation and protection measures it is critical to have comprehensive information about hydrological and hydraulic characteristics ardiclioglu et al 2022 streamflow forecasts play an important role in real time reservoir operation especially during the flood season wang et al 2021d the main focus of this study is to verify the impact of forecast uncertainty on improving the effectiveness of optimal flood control operations due to the limitation of the article length the implications arising from other types of uncertainty and the parameter sensitivity of the model will be further explored in our future research meanwhile in order to search for the most suitable set of parameters more quickly and efficiently an optimization algorithm is needed to optimize the parameters of predictive models dehghani et al 2019 as shown in the results in section 4 1 2 the sem model has an integrative effect on the individual models and similar findings can be found in other studies gu et al 2022 lee and ahn 2021 however there are many other types of ensemble methods which can be tried in future studies to test and evaluate the effectiveness of their respective applications another limitation in this study is that the number of flood events is not large enough in accordance with the characteristics of ml models a large amount of data can be beneficial for the models to learn better and improve the accuracy of prediction results in the follow up study we will collect as much data as possible for validation and apply other cases to confirm the generalizability of the methodology in this study the nsga iii algorithm deb and jain 2014 was used to solve the proposed multi objective reservoir operation model other methods such as particle swarm optimization pso nematollahi et al 2022 grey wolf optimization gwo darabi et al 2021 and whale optimization algorithm woa lai et al 2021 etc can be utilized as optimization algorithms different algorithms may also have an impact on the results which can be attempted for comparison in future studies 6 conclusions real time reservoir flood control scheduling is dependent on the accuracy of flood forecasting in order to improve the robustness of optimal reservoir scheduling this study focused on two major aspects firstly we adopted three ml models to obtain the forecast streamflow series generated 300 sets of scenarios by artificially transforming the hyperparameters available and then used the stacking ensemble model to combine the features of multiple models to get the integrated series in order to improve the degree of utilization of the reservoir s flood control capacity within the entire flood scheduling period under the premise of ensuring safety this study defined the concept of rrca as one of the objectives of the optimal scheduling model then we established a multi objective robust optimization of real time reservoir operation model integrating the risks that may arise in the scheduling process the optimal operation model used the streamflow scenarios predicted by ml models as input a comparative model was constructed to verify its effectiveness considering the maximum reservoir level the maximum discharge flow and the degree of reservoir capacity utilization the nsga iii algorithm was used for solving the models the proposed methodology was applied to the lsm reservoir and the following conclusions were drawn 1 all three ml models had good performance in forecasting the results predicted by the bp model were relatively closer to the observation values which had a minimum value of 0 87 and a maximum value of 0 91 for nse the prediction performances of lstm and elm were relatively more stable the stacking ensemble model was found to be able to incorporate the errors of each model with a nse value of 0 899 and a r2 value of 0 912 outperforming the base models 2 as the morou model considered the forecast uncertainty in the optimization process it had narrower distributions of flood risk both upstream and downstream than mosem and moob furthermore the distribution of the maximum water level in morou was at a much lower level but at the expense of a certain degree of increased release to ensure the safety of the upstream compared to mosem and moob morou achieved a 1 87 and 1 03 reduction in the maximum value of the highest water level respectively 3 the scenario to point stp method allowed the flood control scheduling scheme of the reservoir to have better robustness and the flood risks could be within acceptable limits even in the face of the most unfavorable scenario selecting the solution with the lowest regret value from the set of non inferior solutions as the final alternative further reduced the risk values 4 the introduction of rrca successfully reduced the distribution range of discharge flow without occupying additional flood control reservoir capacity throughout the scheduling process the average maximum discharge flow was reduced by 4 52 confirming that rrca can be used as an optimization indicator to improve the utilization of the reservoir throughout the scheduling process and fully exploit the flood control capacity overall the proposed method enables real time reservoir flood control operations to search for robust strategies under forecast uncertainty to cope with potential risks in the flood scheduling process the flood in this case study is of large magnitude and in future studies such a framework could be applied to floods with different return periods to test the adaptability to various types of floods credit authorship contribution statement xinting yu conceptualization methodology software writing original draft writing

2044,flood control operation is one of the effective measures to reduce flood risks since flood forecasting plays a critical role in real time reservoir flood control operation it is necessary to involve forecasting uncertainty in the optimal reservoir operation to inform decision making it has always been a difficult task to reduce flood risks by adjusting flood control strategies to tackle this challenge this study developed a multi objective robust optimization methodology for real time reservoir flood control operation which mainly coped with forecast uncertainty three machine learning ml models including back propagation neural network bp long short term memory neural network lstm and extreme learning machine elm were adopted to forecast the short term reservoir inflow a stacking ensemble multi ml model sem was then applied to integrate the forecasting results of the above models furthermore a multi objective robust optimal operation model morou integrating both upstream and downstream safety was established to reduce flood risks and evaluate the impact of forecasting uncertainty on the reservoir operation to maximize the efficiency of reservoir utilization this study defined a new indicator of reservoir reserved capacity adaptation rrca as one of the optimization indicators to better solve the complex multi objective problem a scenario to point stp method was proposed for searching robust solutions of multi objective optimization models methodologies were validated through an application to the lishimen reservoir china three main conclusions were derived from the study 1 three ml models performed well in flood forecasting with bp being slightly better than the other two and the sem method was found to be able to incorporate the characteristics of each model outperforming the individual models 2 morou showed a narrower distribution of flood risk both upstream and downstream and achieved an approximately 1 5 reduction in the maximum value of the highest water level 3 rrca was verified to enable to reduce the discharge flow by an average of 4 52 without occupying additional flood control reservoir capacity confirming that it can be used as an optimization indicator to improve the utilization of the reservoir the proposed method can provide robust strategies for real time reservoir flood control under forecast uncertainty keywords machine learning models forecast uncertainty multi objective flood control operation robust optimization flood risk analysis data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction on a global scale floods often affect human society and normal life as one of the most dangerous disasters kundzewicz et al 2019 experts predict that extreme flooding will become more prevalent worldwide with rapid climate change klipalo et al 2022 in china almost two thirds of the area is regularly hit by floods which seriously affect economic development and threaten the survival of human beings quan pei et al 2015 reservoirs and other hydraulic structures are built to intercept floodwaters protect the safety of upstream and downstream and reduce the damage caused by floods reservoir flood control as a non engineering measure plays a very important role in weighing flood risk control and water resources utilization real time flood control operation aims to determine the reservoir scheduling process based on future flood forecasts in conjunction with the decision maker s preferences however based on the currently available techonology flood forecasting is of high uncertainty so it is essential to study how to maximize the effectiveness of optimal flood control operation under forecast uncertainty over the past decades many methods have been proposed to forecast floods which can be broadly classified as white box models black box models and gray box models in terms of physical mechanisms the white box model can reflect not only the input output relationship of each hydrological element in the basin but also the state of the hydrological process in the basin it can represent physical processes and its parameters have clear physical meanings such as topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 and mike she model jaber and shukla 2012 but they generally require a large amount of input information including meteorological data geographic data temperature humidity soil etc which would expend a lot of calculation costs guo et al 2021b unlike physically based models data driven models which we call black box models establish mathematical relationships by considering historical data on inputs and outputs ignoring physical processes within the watershed and reflecting cause and effect relationships between relevant hydrological elements osman et al 2020 typical ones such as the autoregressive model ar carlson et al 1970 and the autoregressive moving integrated average arima model lana et al 2021 have been widely used for hydrological prediction and forecast the mechanism of the grey box model is in between the above two with the continuous development of technology machine learning ml has gradually become a popular forecasting method with its unique advantages it can take all types of data as input build data driven models to seek intrinsic connections and make predictions about the target objects we need currently widely used ml models include decision trees neural networks support vector machines etc considering the computational rate as well as the extent of widespread application artificial neural networks anns are a typical machine learning model and have been used to deal with complex problems in the field of hydrology since 1990 s hsu et al 1995 kisi et al 2019 they are connected by numerous neurons with adjustable connection weights and have the features of massively parallel processing distributed information storage and good self organizing ability many studies have confirmed that anns can improve the accuracy of rainfall runoff predictions puttinaovarat and horkaew 2020 xie et al 2019 zhou et al 2020a especially anns using a back propagation algorithm in the training phase are called bp anns jain and srinivasulu 2004 which have been used as a major forecasting method in flood forecasting reservoir operation and water resources allocation deng et al 2021 han et al 2021 liu et al 2022a ma et al 2021 the bp neural network algorithm can theoretically approximate arbitrary functions and the basic structure consists of nonlinearly varying units with strong nonlinear mapping capability recurrent neural networks rnns a typical type in deep learning are designed to deal with long input sequences salinas et al 2020 to solve the inherent problems in traditional rnn hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 proposed long short term memory neural network lstm a model with good performance in water level prediction flood forecasting runoff prediction etc cui et al 2022 kim et al 2022 nguyen and bae 2020 won et al 2022 lstm can solve the problem of long term dependencies but it requires the same time steps for input and output cao et al 2022 however one shortcoming of training neural networks is that the gradient based algorithm is relatively slow in adjusting parameters extreme learning machine elm was then designed to overcome this weakness which can use single hidden layer feedforward neural networks slfns unlike traditional learning algorithms elm randomly selects hidden nodes determines the hidden layer weight parameters deviations and the output layer weights in a parsing calculation this method reduces training time to a great extent and produces the better generalization performances huang et al 2006 many case studies have demonstrated the advantages of elm models for learning and prediction anupam and pani 2020 kumar et al 2021 poursaeid et al 2022 although the above ml models are based on different mechanisms they can all demonstrate their respective advantages in forecasting to integrate the characteristics of each model integrated learning methods which can combine multiple ml models have been developed wolpert 1992 many excellent integrated learning methods have been derived such as boosting bagging and stacking boosting algorithm is an ensemble meta algorithm method that aims to improve the predictive performance of several given weaker algorithms which was introduced by freund and schapire 1997 barzegar et al 2021 combined the resampling methods with adaptive boosting adaboost categorical boosting catboost etc and the results showed that integrating resampling methods are promising tools to improve the accuracy the full designation of bagging is bootstrap aggregation approach belonging to the group of ml ensemble meta algorithms kadavi et al 2018 compared with boosting technique bagging improves predictive performance by decreasing variance corresponding to the landslide susceptibility model zhang et al 2022 unlike boosting and bagging which mainly consider homogeneous weak learners stacking usually considers heterogeneous weak learners stacking is a specific type of ensemble learning which can take advantage of different base models to generate theoretically more promising predictions breiman 1996 the essence of stacking is to learn several different weak learners and combine them by training a meta model and then output the final prediction wang et al 2021a compared the stacking model with separate models for water quality prediction and found that the stacking model had the best robustness in prediction mallick et al 2022 combined high resolution input and stacking ensemble algorithms for developing robust groundwater potentiality models support vector machine svm or linear regression lr can be selected to create the new stacking ensemble machine learning method as the meta model it has been stated that ensemble learning can overcome related shortcomings in ordinary learning of ml models zounemat kermani et al 2021 including statistical problems when the search space is too large for the available training data computational problems where the learning algorithm fails to find the optimum solution and representation problems when the learning algorithms lack appropriate fitness functions the existing studies have confirmed that real time reservoir operations are affected by many uncertainties including forecast error real time water level measurement error flood propagation uncertainty time delay of decision making uncertainty etc forecast errors are widely recognized as the primary factors affecting the reliability of reservoir operation strategies xu et al 2021a which could lead to flood risk thus it is necessary to consider the uncertainty of flood forecasting during reservoir scheduling optimal scheduling by combining various uncertainties can lead to higher reliability of the scheduling results not only coping with unanticipated practical situations but also reducing the risk of flooding at the same time borgomeo et al 2018 ramaswamy and saleh 2020 wang et al 2021c reservoir flood control uses the interception capabilities of reservoirs to control and regulate floods in a planned manner by providing specific executable plans to guide reservoirs to store or discharge floods upstream and downstream safety can be ensured and flood risk throughout the basin can be reduced real time flood scheduling is subject to time limitations which means it requires a timely response to flood forecast results in general reservoir scheduling is usually a multi objective optimization problem because the essence of reservoir flood scheduling is a process of constant trade off between conflicting demands moreover if forecast uncertainty is considered it would be a stochastic multi objective optimization problem rather than just a deterministic problem zhu et al 2020 there are two situations that can be triggered by errors in forecasting one situation is that the forecasted flow is lower than the actual incoming flow which would prevent the water stored in the reservoir from being discharged in time gabriel martin et al 2019 and result in the reservoir level being higher than the safety threshold meanwhile if a large amount of water is released in a short period of time it may bring risks to downstream the other situation is that the forecasted flow is higher than the actual incoming flow which would lead to a pre discharge to vacate the reservoir capacity resulting in a waste of water resources the above situations can be judged as flood risks caused by uncertain forecasts there have been many studies to reduce the frequency of these types of flood risks chen et al 2021a huang et al 2022 liu et al 2020 lu et al 2022 overall reducing flood risks through optimal flood control scheduling method requires further in depth study under the premise of ensuring safety during flood seasons the reservoir should also consider the degree of utilization of the reservoir capacity to improve the comprehensive benefits of the reservoir system to evaluate the contribution of reservoir flood control capacity to flood peak reduction hui and lund 2015 defined the flood control effectiveness indicator fce as the reduction of downstream flood flow by the utilization increment of reservoir unit flood control capacity further many subsequent studies have used it as one of the objective functions of the optimal scheduling model for optimization shrestha and kawasaki 2020 zhu et al 2022 in general real time reservoir flood control scheduling strongly depends on the forecasted incoming flow however the current studies have mostly focused on achieving a greater peak reduction rate by invoking less reservoir capacity ignoring the influence of future incoming runoff meanwhile flood control scheduling is a continuously occurring event usually lasting from a few hours to a few days it is thus also very important to pay attention to the extent of reservoir flood control capacity utilization during the entire scheduling period in addition when it comes to avoiding the risks associated with floods most studies focus on balancing the upstream and downstream benefits but ignore the risks caused by over utilizing reservoir flood control capacity or wasting a larger amount of flood control capacity we can call the former case an overly risky state and the latter case an overly conservative state there is a tricky problem that often occurs in solving multi objective flood control optimization scheduling model it is that all objective functions have their own optimization directions and the decision variables need to be optimized under the premise that all constraints are satisfied robust optimization watkins and mckinney 1997 yao et al 2021 is a newly introduced modeling method for studying uncertain optimization problems there is usually a trade off between the performance achieved under ideal conditions and the robustness of the system over a wide range of uncertainty borgomeo et al 2018 once the flood is uncontrollable it can bring disastrous consequences therefore it is more secure to incorporate robust optimization into the scheduling process robust optimization models are divided into two types non probabilistic and probabilistic models ben tal et al 2009 probabilistic models optimize the model performance under budgeted risk indices allowing for acceptable risks with greater flexibility and applicability ke and chung 2016 conversely non probabilistic models usually solve problems using minimax or maximin optimization methods the constraints are generally much stricter ensuring that the optimization solution obtained based on the robust control criterion is acceptable even in the worst case scenario many recent studies have shown that the combination of robust optimization strategies can embody the reservoir scheduling robustness under uncertainty nematollahi et al 2022 xu et al 2022 in our previous study we focused more on the application of forecast uncertainty in water resources allocation guo et al 2021d and we also adopted the robust parameterized policy in our previous published article its performance can be expressed through the principle of insufficient reason which suggests that the decision could be taken by assigning equal probability to all the states in the absence of knowledge on the probabilities associated with the different states however all of the above may encounter difficulties in the optimization process due to the fact that the objective function contains multiple risk indicators and the ultimate goal is to reduce each risk value it is difficult to choose the robust strategy from many alternatives in summary there are still significant challenges to better guide decision making through reservoir flood control scheduling under uncertain flood forecasts and searching for robust strategies to address these challenges this study aims to reduce the flood risks and achieve full utilization of reservoir flood control capacity throughout the scheduling process under uncertain flood forecasts to achieve the above objectives three ml models are adopted for flood forecasting in this study and stochastic forecast scenarios are then generated by stochastic simulation to serve as input to the optimal operation meanwhile the stacking ensemble model is used to integrate the forecast results of the three ml models in addition this study proposes a multi objective robust optimization of a real time reservoir operation model for flood control that considers upstream and downstream flood risks under forecast uncertainty intending to assess the degree of utilization of reservoir flood control capacity throughout the entire scheduling period this study defines the concept of reservoir reserved capacity adaptation rrca and uses it as one of the optimization objectives of the model to improve the efficiency of reservoir utilization rrca is applied within the entire scheduling process period rather than a single time period we also innovatively consider the impact of forecasted future incoming flows on the degree of reservoir flood control capacity utilization to better solve the complex multi objective problem a scenario to point stp method is proposed for searching robust solutions of multi objective optimization models the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the framework of the proposed methodology including machine learning models used for forecasting definition of rrca and robust optimization operation model section 3 presents the application of the methodology with a case study of lishimen reservoir section 4 demonstrates the results of the case study

learning methods for incorporating multiple models section 2 2 introduces the new definition of reservoir reserved capacity adaptation rrca and proposes to incorporate it into the optimization model to improve the efficiency of reservoir utilization section 2 3 establishes the reservoir operation model using streamflow forecasted by stacking ensemble multi ml model sem or streamflow observed section 2 4 establishes a multi objective robust optimization model of real time reservoir operation for flood control coping with forecast uncertainty 2 1 flood forecast using machine learning models 2 1 1 machine learning models there are many machine learning models applied in the field of flood forecasting and this section briefly presents a total of three models namely back propagation neural network model bp long short term memory neural network lstm and extreme learning machine elm which are adopted in this study back propagation neural network bp is a multilayer feedforward neural network trained according to the error back propagation algorithm and is one of the most widely used neural networks a neural network is composed of massive nodes and characterizes the architecture of the network with thresholds activation functions and connection weights wallis 1999 the network will adjust the weight matrix and threshold value through the forward transfer of network structure and reverse correction of the training function until the error between the predicted result and the actual one is smaller than allowed ke et al 2012 bp neural network can analyze the relationship between input and output in an integrated manner without the need to know the intrinsic connection of training data it can also find out the implicit connection and derive reasonable laws which can approach the actual situation with high accuracy and improve the accuracy of data prediction fig 2 a shows the structure of the bp neural network the long short term memory lstm neural network was proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 and is a special type of recurrent neural network rnn which aims to overcome the weakness of traditional rnn neural network learning long term dependency compared with the traditional recurrent neural network the lstm neural network also includes an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer but its internal structure is more cleverly designed by adding three gates an input gate a forget gate an output gate and an internal cell unit the input gate selectively records the input information and transfers it to the internal memory unit the forgetting gate selectively discards the information in the internal memory unit and the output gate is responsible for selectively outputting the information from the internal memory unit the structure of the lstm neural network is shown in fig 2 b extreme learning machine elm a new neural network model proposed by huang et al 2006 is a single hidden layer feed forward neural network slfns model it randomly chooses hidden nodes and analytically determines the output weights using a least squares method instead of iterative adjusting compared with other typical slfns using gradient based learning algorithms that learn parameters of a network in an iterative way elm not only involves less calculation work higher learning speed and stronger generalization ability but also has no requirements for some parameters such as terminating condition and learning rate chen et al 2018 the objective of the elm model is to minimize the error between the output value and the target value this means that a suitable set of parameters shall be found making the goal achievable the structure of elm is shown in fig 2 c 2 1 2 k fold cross validation neural networks often suffer from overfitting during the process of fitting the noise component of the data under this circumstance it performs well over the training dataset but shows poorly in prediction geisser 1975 proposed k fold cross validation to minimize the computation complexity and avoid over fitting the dataset can be divided into k partitions in the k fold cross validation approach and each time one of the k partitions is used as the test dataset while the other k 1 partitions are put together to form a training dataset tilekar et al 2022 this reduces the bias because most data are used to train the network barile et al 2022 fig 3 shows the process of typical k fold cross validation 2 1 3 stacking ensemble multi ml model sem as three different ml models were chosen for this study it was essential to introduce an integration model that could combine heterogeneous learners the stacking ensemble method which is currently widely used was chosen to train a metamodel that can combine them the stacking ensemble learning was proposed by wolpert 1992 taking advantage of mutual complementarity among the base models to enhance generalization ability the process of stacking ensemble learning can be roughly divided into two levels firstly the dataset is trained using diverse base models to obtain the learning results secondly the results are combined as the input of the meta model to be trained and the final prediction results can be obtained to prevent overfitting the outputs from the base models are not directly learned by the meta model gu et al 2022 the k fold cross validation method is used in this ensemble learning strategy the results of each fold test are stacked as a new dataset to be input to the meta model since the base models in this study are all machine learning models this method is called stacking ensemble multi ml model short for sem the specific process is shown in fig 4 taking the 4 fold as an example k 4 we divide the original training set into four folds which are denoted as fold1 fold2 fold3 and fold4 first of all we use the data of fold2 fold4 to train the base model a and make predictions for fold1 which is used as the meta features generated by base model a for fold1 similarly we use the data of fold1 fold3 fold4 to train the base model a and make predictions for fold2 which is used as the meta features generated by base model a for fold2 and so on finally we can obtain the meta features generated by base model a for the whole original training set in addition the same method is used to generate meta features for the base model b and c constituting the complete set of meta features for the training of the meta model for the test set we can make predictions each time the base model is trained and then average the predicted values in this study the base models include bp lstm and elm and linear regression is selected as the meta model to train the prediction results from the base models 2 2 reservoir reserved capacity adaptation rrca in the general flood control scheduling the inflow i will be stored in the reservoir within the appropriate range of water level while the outflow o of the reservoir is determined by considering the important downstream control cross sections the flood control capacity of the reservoir is the volume between the flood control high water level and the flood control limit water level which is used to control the flood and meet the flood control requirements of the downstream protection objects during the scheduling period the reservoir s ability to store flood water depends on the current remaining flood control capacity rfc rfc is the capacity value between the high flood control level and the current level of the reservoir which can be used to accommodate future floods to evaluate the degree of flood control capacity utilization many studies have been conducted however there is a gap in research on how to arrange reserved reservoir capacity throughout flood control scheduling of individual reservoir and it lacks practical significance to consider only the flood reduction rate without considering the impact of future incoming flows this study proposes a new indicator reservoir reserved capacity adaptation rrca compared with the indicators currently used to evaluate the efficiency of flood control capacity utilization the advantages of rrca are reflected in two aspects 1 it incorporates the forecasted inflow and the remaining capacity and evaluates the adaptability of the remaining flood control capacity of reservoirs to the forecasted inflow 2 it also takes the entire scheduling process as an optimization cycle rather than the scheduling unit time given that the reservoir s reserved capacity represents the ability to accommodate future floods the safety status of the reservoir is closely related to the following inflow and the outflow of the reservoir fig 5 a illustrates the inflow and outflow processes of the reservoir fig 5 b illustrates the usual process of the reservoir water level change during the scheduling period if the reserved reservoir capacity cannot accommodate the following incoming flood the reservoir would face the danger of storing water above the maximum level limit and be in a risky situation threatening the safety of the upstream as well as the reservoir itself on the contrary if the reserved reservoir capacity is much larger than the next incoming flood the reservoir has a larger flood control capacity that is not utilized in this situation the reservoir can store more flood water to reduce the risk of downstream flooding while retaining flood resources so that the flood control capacity of the reservoir can be more fully utilized during the entire scheduling process on the basis of the above analysis rrca was introduced to judge the degree of flood control capacity utilization of reservoirs throughout the entire flood control scheduling period while reflecting the adaptation of the remaining flood control capacity of the reservoir to the forecasted inflow we normalize the inflow and the reserved reservoir capacity at time t and obtain the ratio of the two which can be expressed as r t as shown in eq 1 1 r t n o r m a l i z e d i t n o r m a l i z e d v flood v t t 1 2 3 t where i t represents the inflow at time t m3 s v t is the reservoir capacity at time t m3 v flood represents the total flood control capacity of the reservoir m3 t is the total number of operation periods h normalized x represents the normalization process of x in order to achieve the goal of full utilization of reservoir flood control capacity it is desirable to make the r value as close as possible to 1 during the scheduling period nevertheless the reservoir capacity changes dynamically during the scheduling process as shown in eq 2 the rrca can be expressed as eqs 3 and 4 2 v t v 0 t 0 t d i t q t d t 3 rrca t 0 t d r t d t t d t 0 t 0 t d n o r m a l i z e d i t n o r m a l i z e d

respectively v 0 is the storage capacity at the initial moment m3 v t is the reservoir capacity at time t m3 i t and q t represent the inflow and outflow at time t m3 s fig 5 c illustrates the formulation of the rrca it should be noted that there is a large dependence of the application of rrca on the accuracy of flood forecasting 2 3 multi objective reservoir operation model under deterministic streamflow the determination of reservoir operation objective function plays a very important role in reservoir flood control a suitable objective function can increase the flood control efficiency of reservoirs and minimize the losses caused by floods this subsection establishes the optimal flood control operation model on the basis of the safety of the upstream and the downstream important flood control sections a multi objective reservoir flood control optimal operation model is constructed incorporating the rrca concept proposed in subsection 2 2 this model uses deterministic streamflow series as input which can be either stacked forecasting results by stacking ensemble multi ml model short for mosem or observation streamflow short for moob the dispatch unit is hour and the proposed model takes the discharge flow per hour as the decision variable 2 3 1 objective functions the optimal operation of reservoir flood control aims to make full use of reservoir flood control capacity and ensure the safety of upstream and downstream the objective functions of the proposed model are shown below 2 3 1 1 objective1 the downstream flood control objective is to minimize the maximum discharge throughout the scheduling process which we can also call it maximum peak reduction strategy expressed as 5 min f 1 min t 1 t q t 2 t 1 t where q t represents the discharge flow of the reservoir at time t m3 s t is the total number of operation periods h 2 3 1 2 objective2 the upstream flood control objective is to minimize the highest water level of the reservoir throughout the scheduling process expressed as 6 min f 2 min max z t t 1 t where z t represents the water level of the reservoir at time t m 2 3 1 3 objective3 the reservoir flood control efficiency objective is to minimize the absolute value of the difference between rrca and 1 7 min f 3 min 1 r r c a min 1 t 0 t d n o r m a l i z e d i t n o r m a l i z e d v flood v 0 t 0 t d i t q

constraints constraints include 1 mass balance equation 8 v t 1 v t i t q t e t δ t where v t and v t 1 represents the reservoir capacity at time t and t 1 m3 e t is the evaporation at time t m3 s i t

capacity curve and water level discharge capacity curve of the reservoir respectively there are many intelligent optimization algorithms for solving multi objective problems such as particle swarm algorithm genetic evolution algorithm gray wolf algorithm etc among them the widely used genetic evolutionary algorithm introduces the idea of probability in natural selection and the selection of individuals has a random nature it avoids the algorithm to fall into local optimum by variation mechanism and has strong search ability it is well known that the proportion of non dominated solutions is exponentially related to the number of targets in the set of randomly selected target vectors in this study we adopted non dominated sorting genetic algorithm iii nsga iii algorithm deb and jain 2014 for solving the proposed model this algorithm is an improved multi objective optimization algorithm based on nsga ii deb et al 2002 which is subject to some limitations such as difficulty in satisfying the constraints by using a random method to generate the initial population low performance of the optimal solution and very restricted spread uniformity suwal et al 2020 nsga iii decomposes the entire search space into multiple subspaces through a set of uniformly distributed multiple reference points and searches these subspaces in parallel during the evolutionary process for the purpose of maintaining population diversity as shown in many previous studies nsga iii can effectively solve multi objective optimization problems bahrami et al 2022 dariane et al 2021 liu et al 2022b sharma et al 2022 zhou et al 2020b we use this algorithm to obtain the pareto solution set of the model and further analyze the properties of its non inferior solutions since uncertain inputs were combined in the operation model the time required for the computation would increase multiplicatively with the number of stochastic scenarios and the number of populations to address this challenge liu et al 2018 proposed that the fork join parallel framework could be deployed to parallelize the chance constrained dynamic programming in a multi core environment for improving computational efficiency inspired by existing studies out work utilized a parallel algorithm that uses multiple computer processing cores to do the calculation simultaneously 2 4 multi objective robust optimization model coping with forecast uncertainty since flood forecasts have extremely high uncertainties the flood risk caused by the uncertainty should be considered when using flood forecast results as operation inputs incorporating the concept of robust optimization this section established a multi objective robust optimization reservoir operation model for flood control coping with flood forecast uncertainty morou 2 4 1 multi objective reservoir operation model for flood control 2 4 1 1 objective functions flood control optimization operation aims to utilize the flood control capacity of reservoirs and determine the discharge solutions when facing a stochastic forecast scenario different scheduling processes will have different flood risk values for the upstream and downstream herein the proposed model aims to reduce both the upstream and downstream risks under stochastic scenarios integrating the upstream and downstream flood protection objectives the proposed model includes the following five objective functions objective1 is to minimize the maximum probability of water level exceeding the level safety upper limit representing the upstream safety of the reservoir the probability refers that under various forecast scenarios the corresponding scheduling scheme will be generated by the calculation of the optimal scheduling model based on the inflow and outflow of the reservoir the process of water level change can be obtained by water balance calculation and then the probability of exceeding the safety limit can be judged according to the upper water level limit the objective function can be expressed as 14 min f 1 min max c o u n t z n t z up n t 1 t where z n t denotes the water level of scenario n at time t m z up is the water level safety upper limit m n is the total number of scenarios t is the number of operation periods h and c o u n t is the counting function objective2 is to minimize the maximum probability of release exceeding the safety upper limit representing the downstream safety of the reservoir the probability refers that under various forecast scenarios the corresponding scheduling scheme will be generated by the calculation of the optimal scheduling model based on the outflow of the reservoir the probability of exceeding the safety limit can be judged according to the upper discharge flow limit the objective function can be expressed as 15 min f 2 min max c o u n t q n t q up n t 1 t where q n t denotes the discharge flow of scenario n at time t m q up is the safety upper limit of outflow which is calculated backwards based on the safe flow of the downstream flood control section m3 s objective3 is to minimize the maximum proportion of the number of hours when the water level exceeds the upper limit to the total scheduling periods unit period hour which can be expressed as eq 16 when large floods are encountered it is unavoidable that the reservoir level will exceed the safety threshold consequently the risk should be controlled as much as possible by minimizing the number of periods that the water level exceeds the threshold 16 min f 3 min p r o b p e r i o d z n t z up

upper limit to the total scheduling periods unit period hour expressed as eq 17 when encountering large floods in order to ensure the safety of the reservoir itself sometimes it is necessary to sacrifice downstream safety to a certain extent the duration that the outflow exceeds the safe threshold should be shortened as much as possible 17 min f 4 min p r o b p e r i o d q n t q up min c o u

represents that the subsequent incoming flood may be much higher than the reservoir s capacity to intercept causing the risk of inability to contain the flood water s conservative represents that the subsequent incoming flood is much smaller than the reservoir s capacity to intercept indicating that there is a larger flood control capacity that fails to participate in the process the objective

cases are identified as too conservative situation when y rrca n 1 2 4 1 2 constraints the constraints of the morou model are approximately the same as those of the model in section 2 3 however it should be noted that the morou model involves different forecast scenarios as input so the series of decision variables for different scenarios need to be constrained separately in the scheduling process consistent with model in subsection 2 3 the model presented in this subsection is also solved by the nsga iii algorithm 2 4 2 multi objective robust optimization in scenario to point stp method in multi objective optimization problems lots of studies incorporate the concept of robustness to search for pareto solution sets robust optimization gong et al 2021 is a modeling method for studying uncertain optimization problems in the early stages of development robust optimization was mainly about solving the worst case scenario in the most unfavorable situation later robust optimization was used to solve multi objective problems for all possible situations the constraint conditions are satisfied and the function value of the objective function in the worst case is optimized this implies that even under numerous uncertainties decision makers can choose options that can be adapted to all situations based on decision preferences in solving multi objective optimization problems measures of robust optimization can include the following borgomeo et al 2018 ①maximin select alternative with the least worst performance ②maximax select alternative that maximizes the best possible performance ③minimax regret select alternative that minimizes the worst case regret this study applies the minimax regret criterion to measure the robustness of the reservoir flood control scheduling options under a range of flood forecasting scenarios considering that the objective functions involve several indicators of risk values and the ultimate goal of optimization is to reduce each risk value it is important and challenging to select which alternative to use as the representative sequence for that individual for the next iteration of optimization this difficulty is because each population individual is processed to satisfy the constraints when faced with different forecast scenarios and then different alternatives are generated correspondingly this study proposes a method called scenario to point stp to solve this problem unlike previous studies which choose the value of the worst case scenario for each objective as the individual value for that objective to continue optimization this study considers all the index values of each scenario for all objectives in the robust optimization and translates the performance of each scenario into a specific value since there is a corresponding risk associated with the flood control scheduling scheme after its implementation which is not expected we need to define a metric to assess the acceptability of future risks and make it quantified therefore the regret value rv is adopted to represent the synthesized performance of each group of decision variables to further filter out the scheduling solution with robustness in this study the ideal state for flood scheduling is that each target risk value is zero as a result rv is defined as the difference between each risk value and zero that may arise when different strategies are implemented a higher value of rv indicates a higher risk and a more inappropriate scheduling solution the detailed application process is shown in the fig 6 suppose there is a population size of m and each individual needs to be handled to satisfy the constraints when faced with n forecast scenarios thus generating m n sets of alternatives for each of these n sets of alternatives their target values are calculated and thus regret values can be obtained according to the robust minimax regret criterion the solution with the largest regret value is selected as the representative solution for that individual and continues to be optimized iteratively which is essentially the worst case optimization ultimately we can achieve that in the face of different forecast scenarios even the most unfavorable case the solution we screened can satisfy our demand for risk avoidance and we call this set of solutions the worst case we can also extract solutions having the minimum regret value from each set of alternatives in the non inferior solutions as the final set of solutions which we call optimal case note that the extraction of the optimal case is limited to the treatment of the pareto front only 3 case study 3 1 study area and data description based on the data support a real case study of the lishimen lsm reservoir was employed to demonstrate the proposed real time reservoir operation model the lsm reservoir is located on shifeng creek in the jiaojiang river basin east china the jiaojiang river is the third major river in zhejiang province the lsm reservoir as the largest reservoir on the watershed of shifeng creek plays a very important role in flood control and prevention due to its strong regulation capacity the catchment area above the reservoir is 296 km2 and the total length of main stream above the dam site is 35 2 km the total reservoir capacity is 179 3 million m3 and the flood control capacity is 35 7 million m3 it is a large reservoir mainly for flood control and irrigation combined with water supply power generation and other uses the runoff in the jiaojiang river basin is mainly formed by precipitation and the inter annual and intra annual variations of runoff and precipitation are basically synchronized as the area is affected by typhoons floods can occur quickly threatening the safety of the upstream and downstream of the reservoir real time flood forecasting has high uncertainty and heavy rainfall floods in the jiaojiang river basin are relatively concentrated resulting in steep rise and fall of a flood the location of the lsm reservoir is illustrated in fig 7 the primary information for flood control of the lsm reservoir is listed in table 1 in this study both the rainfall observation data from 1987 to 2020 at six rainfall stations xiatian tuoxi sixie fangqian sijiakeng and lishimen and actural runoff data of the lsm reservoir were collected based on the integrity of available data a total of 22 floods were selected as the data set for constructing the flood forecasting model among them 16 floods of all data series were selected as the initial training set while 6 floods were selected as the test set table 2 shows the statistical characteristics of inflow runoff of flood events during the training and test periods it can be noted that the maximum and minimum values of the data are included in the training data set which guarantees that the model can thoroughly learn from historical hydrological events 3 2 numerical experiment setup 3 2 1 real time flood forecast and scenario simulation in real time flood forecasting many factors affect the forecast results including antecedent streamflow antecedent precipitation current precipitation antecedent evaporation and so on this study collected antecedent streamflow of the lsm reservoir and antecedent precipitation from six rainfall stations since evaporation observations are less available and are less important for flood forecasting than precipitation the effect of evaporation is not considered in this study q represents the streamflow and p n represents the precipitation from n th rainfall station xiaantian rainfall station tuoxi rainfall station sixie rainfall station fangqian rainfall station sijiakeng rainfall station and lishimen rainfall station determining the input variables involves finding the lags of precipitation that significantly influence the predicted flow sudheer et al 2002 proposed a data processing method to determine the appropriate driving factors as model inputs based on the inter correlation autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation properties of the data series cross correlation analysis between the rainfall and runoff in the study area suggested that the strength of relationship is significant up to a lag of 18 h combined with the rainfall situation at the current moment to be considered in the real time forecasting process a total of 114 variables are used as input factors for the forecast model in this case the streamflow is forecasted using the following equations 19 q t f p t 1 p t 1 1 p t 2 1 p t 18 1 p t 2 p t 1 2 p t 2 2 p t 18 2 p t n p t 1 n p t 2 n p t 18 n where f is the mapping function between inputs and outputs which can be modeled by bp lstm and elm in our study p t n represents the precipitation data at n rainfall station at time t in order to make the training process of the three models more standardized all input variables were normalized to the range of 0 1 and the min max normalization method was chosen in this case since the problem of overfitting is easy to occur in the process of machine learning the k fold cross validation method was introduced in this study to avoid this situation firstly the whole data was divided into two parts the training set and the test set the data in the training set was divided into k parts for each training one part of the training set was used as the validation set and the remaining k 1 parts were used for training the forecast results of the test set data under this training model could also be obtained this method allowed each data part to be trained and validated to reduce overfitting and improve model performance eventually the data consisted of three parts 1 training 2 validation and 3 test it should be noted that to ensure the integrity of each flood during training and validation the training set was divided according to the start and end of the flood when it was divided into k parts rather than uniformly by the length of the data at the hourly scale since the training set contained 16 floods we set k as four and each part included four floods a total of 22 events were used to establish the forecast models where 12 events were for training 4 were for validation and 6 were for testing selecting the hyper parameters of bp lstm and elm models such as the number of hidden layers hidden units the dropout rate and the learning rate remains a challenging task guo et al 2021c this study used the nash efficiency coefficient nse as the loss function while adaptive moment estimation adam was used as the optimizer adam is an update of the rmsprop optimizer the best trained parameter set was selected as the parameter value of the forecasting model by traversing the possible values of each parameter the determination of the set of alternative parameter values is dependent on experiences in order to fully demonstrate the uncertainty of forecasting and determine its impact on flood scheduling three machine learning forecasting models were used as the basis for random simulations and one flood event no 20040812 was selected for forecasting and scheduling of a real case this flood event was caused by severe typhoon rananim no 0413 in 2004 rananim with wide range and intensity made landfalls on the coast near shitang town wenling city zhejiang province at 20 00 on august 12 2004 and the lishimen reservoir was affected by it the whole flood started at 15 00 on august 12 and ended at 14 00 on august 14 lasting 48 h in total according to the rainfall data from the telemetry stations in the basin the average maximum hourly rainfall in the basin is 30 8 mm as for simulating forecast errors the stochastic streamflow series of 2004 were simulated by artificially transforming model parameters including the number of hidden layer nodes batch size dropout and so on the scenarios with nash efficiency coefficients lower than 0 75 were eliminated to ensure the reasonableness of the simulation results 100 sets of scenarios for each model were selected from the remaining flow series at equal intervals from high to low eventually forming a total of 300 sets of runoff scenario series from three models 3 2 2 real time reservoir operation for flood control in order to analyze the impact of the flood forecast uncertainty on the reservoir system and to evaluate the effectiveness of stacking ensemble multi ml model sem three numerical experiments are designed and applied to lsm denoted as morou mosem and moob respectively morou the multi objective robust optimization model coping with forecast uncertainty morou is used as the flood control operation model the stochastic inflow scenarios generated as described in section3 2 1 are served as input conditions for the optimal model mosem the multi objective reservoir operation model under flood forecast using sem is used as the flood control operation model the model input is deterministic inflow forecasting generated by stacking ensemble multi ml model sem moob to set up the control group actual observed series of inflow is used as model input the objective function and constraints of the model are the same as those of the mosem model and the only difference is the input of the model the nsga iii algorithm is run with parameters set as follows population size n 100 the maximum number of iterations 500 the encoding method ri these three experiments are implemented under the same condition including the same calculating workstation with intel r core tm i5 10400f cpu 2 90 ghz the same population size the same maximum number of iterations and the same encoding method real integer encoding the solution oriented findings resulting from the multiple choice criteria would help decision makers reframe more effective measures malka et al 2022 this study uses a multi criteria risk decision making method based on subject objective weights combination to filter out compromise solution from non inferior solutions the process of screening solutions includes the following steps first of all the indicators involved in the evaluation are determined and the subjective weight matrix of each indicator is given in this study the upstream and downstream indicators are set at the same level of importance the importance of upstream and downstream security affects the bias of the scheduling strategy if upstream safety is at a more important level the resulting scheduling scheme will focus more on lowering the maximum reservoir level by sacrificing downstream safety to some extent on the contrary if the downstream safety is more important the optimized scheduling scheme will focus more on reducing the maximum downstream flow of the reservoir to prevent exceeding the downstream safety flow the subjective weight matrix r can be set as r 1 1 1 1 secondly the subjective weight values are determined the common methods currently used include analytical hierarchical process method ahp weighted factor judgment table method delphi method etc in this study the subjective weights of each indicator are determined using the analytical hierarchical process method ahp which is a simple flexible and practical multi criteria decision making method for quantitative analysis of qualitative problems and has been used in many studies al sawaf et al 2022 chen et al 2021b mu et al 2022 its characteristic is to organize the various factors in a complex problem by dividing it into a multilevel hierarchical structure i e top level objectives middle level criteria and sub criteria and lower level alternatives ilderomi et al 2022 thirdly the objective weights are determined the popular methods available nowadays include entropy weight method coefficient of variation method regression analysis method etc in this study we use the entropy weight method ewm to show the dispersion degree of indicators and to determine the objective weights ewm is a comprehensive evaluation method that can be used for multiple objects and multiple indicators its evaluation results are mainly based on objective information almost independent of subjective factors and can avoid the interference of human factors to a large extent finally the combined weights are then derived using the linear weighted average method to comprehensively consider the influence of subjective experience as well as the influence of objective data distribution the ratio of subjective and objective weights to total weights is set at 1 2 each and then the combined weight value is obtained by linear weighting as the basis for evaluating the importance of each indicator the assumed weights of 1 2 each also reflect that subjectivity and objectivity are on equal level of importance when screening solutions in practice however decision makers can make adjustments according to the actual situation to further evaluate the impact of rrca on scheduling this study also builds a model that is basically the same as morou with the difference that objective 5 is not involved in the optimization which we call morou nof5 similarly we solve the model by using the nsga iii optimization algorithm to obtain the scheduling scheme for different forecast scenarios morou nof5 the objective function objective1 2 3 4 and constraints of the model are the same as those of the morou model objective5 is not retained 4 results 4 1 results of flood forecasting and scenario simulation 4 1 1 flood forecasting using ml model according to the numerical experimental setup in section 3 2 1 we obtained the forecast results of the three models which are presented by hydrographs and scatter plots shown in fig 8 different parts of dataset k 1 2 3 4 were selected as the validation set in k fold cross validation the evaluation indicators of forecast results of each model are shown in table 3 as observed in fig 8 it is clearly shown that the forecasted streamflow deviates gradually from the 1 1 line as streamflow gradually increases which indicates that the model forecasts better in small floods than in large floods this is because the number of large floods used for training and validation is relatively small making it difficult to fully extract the characteristics of large floods as a result the forecast results are somewhat worse than for other types of floods this can also be seen from the colors of the curves which are basically blue when at low flows but tend to be yellow when the flood event is larger or at the flood peak position comparing the results of the three models the results predicted by the bp model are relatively closer to the observation values the test set has a minimum value of 0 87 and a maximum value of 0 91 for nse with the prediction of the bp model while the results of the lstm model and elm model are relatively similar varying in the range of 0 84 0 87 and 0 87 0 88 respectively the overall performance of all three models is relatively good reflecting machine learning models advantages when k takes different values which means different events of floods are used as the training set there is a clear difference in the performance of the three models different ml models have different intrinsic mechanisms that lead to specific advantages in the training process based on data features as can be seen from fig 8 and table 3 the lstm model has the best performance when k is equal to 1 the bp model has the best performance when k is equal to 3 and the elm model has a more stable performance in the four test experiments this is due to the fact that different k values represent that the training set contains floods of different magnitudes when k is equal to 2 the big flood is divided into validation set and not included in the training set making it difficult for the model to capture the characteristics of various floods during the training process and consequently the model is not as well trained as the other sets k 1 3 4 for a comprehensive analysis of the prediction accuracy of the model the forecast results of test set of four test experiments were averaged and then compared the six flood events were analyzed separately as shown in fig 9 these six flood events include small ones with a return period of about five years e g 2005 2016 and large ones with a return period of nearly 100 years e g 2004 fig 9 presents the forecasting performance of the three models for different types of floods compared with 2004 and 2009 the forecast results of the ml models for 2005 and 2016 performed better further indicating that the uncertainty of the forecasts increases with the rise in flood magnitude to further investigate the impact of flood forecast uncertainty on flood control scheduling and to verify whether scheduling can effectively reduce flood risk the 2004 flood event was selected as a case study for the operation model 4 1 2 stochastic scenarios and stacking scenario simulation in this study the streamflow series of 2004 were simulated randomly by artificially transforming model parameters such as the number of hidden layer nodes batch size dropout and so on as described in subsection 3 2 1 to ensure the reasonableness of simulation results each streamflow series generated from the simulation was initially screened according to its nash efficiency coefficient value nse and scenarios with nse lower than 0 85 were eliminated the remaining scenarios were retained for further analysis to investigate the impact of forecast uncertainty on flood control scheduling in order to make the streamflow scenarios predicted by each model simulate the forecast errors in a wide variety of situations the remaining simulated streamflow scenarios were sorted by nash efficiency coefficients 100 sets of scenarios for each model were selected at equal intervals from high to low eventually forming a total of 300 sets of runoff scenarios fig 10 shows the inflow scenarios generated by the stochastic simulations of the three models it can be seen that the observations can be covered by the simulations this study also picked root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and regression coefficient r2 as forecast error evaluation indicators nash efficiency coefficients nse are generally used to verify the goodness of the hydrological model simulation results root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae are currently widely used in many studies in the evaluation of the prediction effect kim et al 2022 lei et al 2021 xie et al 2019 xu et al 2021b which can well reflect the deviation between the predicted value and the actual value and characterize the accuracy of the prediction the predictive performance of the model can also be assessed according to the regression coefficient r2 anupam and pani 2020 deng et al 2021 jiang et al 2020 the higher the value of r2 the higher the prediction accuracy the maximum and minimum values of the indicators for each model are shown in table 4 in order to analyze the effect of forecast uncertainty on reservoir operation it is also necessary to set up a control test group using deterministic flood forecast runoff series as input for the optimal scheduling solutions obtained in this way the flood risks can be calculated and analyzed in the face of different forecasted inflow scenarios in this study a stacking ensemble multi ml model sem was adopted and the forecast results of three ml models were used as input to synthesize the characteristics of three models then we selected linear regression as the second layer meta model the specific process is described in detail in subsection 2 1 3 eventually a unique runoff forecast sequence was obtained which we call it sem forecast as shown in fig 10 the overall trend of the runoff series by sem is generally consistent with the trend of the actual flood but it has smaller flood peak value compared to the actual observed series the indicators of sem forecast are shown in table 4 as shown in table 4 the prediction results after the integration of sem tend to incorporate the errors of each model with a nse value of 0 900 and a r2 value of 0 912 though the result of sem does not exceed the prediction accuracy of the best performing of three models it outperforms the worst performing in all indicators by comparing the indicators the predictions of the stacking approach are better than those of the individual models it can be concluded that sem successfully integrates the characteristics of the three models 4 2 results of flood control operation and risk analysis 4 2 1 flood control risk evaluation based on the multi objective robust optimization in scenario to point stp method introduced in section 2 4 2 each individual in the population can generate a set of scheduling strategies that satisfy the constraints according to different forecast scenarios therefore the regret values of the optimized solutions were calculated the set of solutions with the smallest regret value was the set of non inferior solutions for the optimal case and conversely the set of solutions with the largest regret value was the set for the worst case the distributions of the objectives of morou mosem and moob models are shown in fig 11 specifically the risks of upstream and downstream of the mosem model and moob model were calculated directly from non inferior solutions rather than through optimization for the worst case of the morou non inferior solution set the upstream and downstream flood risk probabilities vary in the range of 0 77 0 917 and 0 027 0 043 respectively the proportions of the number of hours in which flood risk occurs upstream and downstream to the entire operation periods vary in the range of 0 140 0 243 and 0 0 083 respectively for mosem the four risk values for upstream and downstream are distributed in 0 1 0 1 0 0 673 and 0 0 125 respectively when the observed inflow series were used as model input the risk values of its non inferior solution set were calculated under different forecast scenarios distributed in 0 0 917 0 1 0 0 406 and 0 0 104 respectively in comparison with mosem and moob morou has a much narrower distribution of risks for both upstream and downstream as shown in fig 11 the mean values of all risks of the morou are at the lowest level except for objective 1 and objective 4 however this is the risk distribution of worst case in the non inferior solution set obtained from morou which has already performed relatively better than mosem and moob for the optimal case of morou the mean values of all risk indicators are at the lowest level and perform a much narrower distribution varying in the range of 0 003 0 023 0 027 0 043 0 0001 0 0007 and 0 0 0208 respectively the above results demonstrate that when the forecast uncertainty is considered in the scheduling process both upstream and downstream flood risks can be effectively reduced as we all know flood forecasts have extremely high uncertainty and a wide range of error sources suppose the deterministic flood forecast is used as scheduling input in that case it will make its optimal scheduling scheme lack the flexibility to cope with different forecast scenarios and raise the flood risk threshold we can also analyze the performance of the morou model by comparing the distribution range of the maximum discharge flow of the reservoir and the maximum reservoir level during the flood scheduling process under different forecast scenarios according to the non inferior solutions to further explore the optimization mechanism of morou in reducing flood risks of upstream and downstream coping with forecast uncertainty fig 12 a shows the distribution range of the maximum discharge flow of the reservoir during the flood scheduling process in three different cases the maximum discharge distribution of the reservoir after optimal scheduling by the morou model is 876 18 m3 s 1006 48 m3 s while 341 25 m3 s 1217 60 m3 s for mosem and 677 29 m3 s 1303 41 m3 s for moob according to the safety discharge limit of the downstream flood control section the maximum discharge of the lsm reservoir cannot exceed 1000 m3 s when the discharge flow exceeds 1000 m3 s it exposes the downstream to the risk of inundation it can be seen that the morou model minimizes the downstream risk of the reservoir compared with mosem and moob although morou has some solutions with the maximum discharge slightly exceeding 1000 m3 s most of them are distributed between 870 m3 s and 930 m3 s which better ensures the downstream safety of the lsm reservoir fig 12 b shows the distribution of maximum reservoir levels in three comparative models the ranges of the maximum reservoir level for the three models vary in 176 93 m 180 85 m morou 176 74 m 184 29 m mosem and 177 68 m 182 74 m moob respectively according to the characteristics of the reservoir the upper water level for flood control of the lsm reservoir is 180 69 m with a return period of twenty years and the design flood level is 181 34 m with a return period of one hundred years it is clear that coping with forecasting uncertainty can make the distribution of the highest water level in the reservoir more concentrated and basically below the upper water level for flood control compared with morou the maximum water levels of mosem and moob present a wider distribution and most of them are above 180 m even higher than the design flood level which would bring a more significant flood risk to the reservoir upstream the extreme value of the maimum water level of morou is 180 848 m which decreased by 1 87 and 1 03 compared to mosem and moob respectively although the mean value 898 61 m3 s of the maximum release of morou is the largest among the three models it is desirable to increase the discharge flow to ensure the safety of the reservoir under the premise that the safe discharge is not exceeded it is mainly because the highest water levels of mosem and moob are mostly distributed above the flood limit level therefore to protect upstream safety it is necessary to increase the release to a certain extent the conventional optimal flood scheduling model is difficult to cope with flood forecasts with high uncertainty when there is a large error between the forecast result and the actual situation the optimal scheduling solution is no longer applicable and may even bring greater flood risks to the upstream and downstream threatening the safety of the reservoir consequently it is sensible to incorporate the forecast uncertainty into the optimal scheduling process which can effectively reduce the flood risks and make the scheduling solution meet the safety requirements even in the worst case 4 2 2 compromise solutions based on the approach described in subsection3 2 2 the compromise solutions of morou mosem and moob models were filtered out which were denoted as solution s solution d and solution o respectively it should be noted that there are two types of solution s one filtered from the set of worst case solutions and the other filtered from the set of best case solutions which do not contradict each other and exist simultaneously the values of each risk of the non inferior solutions which are also the values of the objective functions are shown in fig 13 a and fig 13 b it is clear that the risk values of solution s are not always smaller than the other two this is due to the fact that the morou model is optimized by the stp method so that the worst case scenario is optimized therefore the final set of non inferior solutions obtained is still within an acceptable range even for the worst case scenario in other words under this optimization method when choosing the optimal case in the non inferior solution set better performance can be achieved under each metric the best case compromise solution of morou can almost guarantee the safety of the upstream and downstream form flood risks overall it gives full play to the flood control role of the reservoir compared with solution o which uses the observed streamflow as the input to the model solution d using the deterministic inflow from the stacking model as the input can cause greater values at each risk this indicates that the forecast inflow scenario by the sem model is at a lower level than the observed series as a result the optimal scheduling scheme fails to release the flood in time making the distribution of the maximum water level higher and threatening the safety of the reservoir the detailed discharge process and the water level process of compromise solutions are shown in fig 14 although the maximum water level in solution s is the highest among the three compromise solutions it does not exceed the upper limit of the water level at the same time solution s successfully keeps the maximum discharge flow under the limit of 1000 m3 s compared to the maximum discharge flows of solution o and solution d which are 1303 41 m3 s and 1217 60 m3 s respectively solution s reduces the flood peak value by 22 78 and 17 34 solution s shows robustness in the face of different scenarios of forecast floods even in facing with the worst case scenario the highest water level of the reservoir during the scheduling process is within an acceptable range 4 2 3 performance analysis of rrca in the case study the proposed morou model was applied to the real time flood operation of the lsm reservoir and the scheduling solutions and the resulting flood risks were compared and analyzed coping with the flood forecast uncertainty to further evaluate the impact of rrca on scheduling this section mainly compares the optimization results of morou model and morou nof5 model fig 15 shows the distribution of the maximum discharge and the maximum water level of the non inferior solution set of the morou withf5 model and morou nof5 model respectively it can be seen that the distributions of the highest water level of the two optimization models are relatively close the mean values are similar with morou nof5 at 180 135 m and morou withf5 at 180 031 however the maximum discharge flow distributions represent a very obvious difference when objective 5 rrca is not involved in the optimization the average maximum discharge flow is 941 159 m3 s but when the optimization of objective 5 is incorporated in the optimal scheduling process the average maximum discharge flow is 898 608 m3 s which is about 4 52 lower than that of the morou nof5 model this demonstrates that the involvement of rrca in the optimal scheduling process allows the maximum water level of the reservoir to be maintained at a relatively stable level and the maximum discharge flow to be reduced to a lower level this further confirms that the degree of utilization of the reservoir s flood control capacity is improved throughout the scheduling process in this study we generated 300 sets of stochastic forecast scenarios in section 3 2 2 and the scheduling strategies were obtained based on different forecast scenarios they were subsequently optimized iteratively by the stp method to compose a non inferior solution set we calculated the mean values of rrca of the non inferior solutions from both morou nof5 and morou withf5 for different scenarios meanwhile the total inflow volumes for 300 forecast scenarios were also calculated the distributions are shown in fig 16 according to the comparison between fig 16 a and fig 16 b the distribution of the rrca values is closer to 1 when objective5 is involved in the optimization with an average value of 1 138 the rrca value calculated from the non inferior solution set of morou nof5 can reach up to 1 723 and the average value is 1 140 which is higher than that of the morou withf5 by observing the scatter plot of rrca value and the total amount of inflow volume it can be seen that there is a negative correlation between the two scenarios with greater flooding have the value of rrca closer to 1 this means that when larger floods are encountered the reservoir s flood control capacity can be fully utilized by introducing the concept of rrca for optimization while guaranteeing the safety of the upstream and downstream 5 discussion 5 1 flood forecasting and ensemble performance currently ml based forecasting methods have been widely used in hydrological forecasting and have shown good performance apaydin et al 2020 han et al 2021 kim et al 2022 nguyen and bae 2020 qu et al 2021 all three sets of forecasting models in this study have relatively good forecasting results which can be seen in table 3 it is clear for us that the precipitation and inflow forecasting are associated with uncertainty moreover the bp model has relatively better prediction results than the other two sets of models through testing different magnitudes of floods we also find that the forecast uncertainty increases with the magnitude of the flood as shown in fig 10 the forecasted runoff series obtained from the integration of multiple models can well respond to the trend of the measured runoff confirming that the forecasting characteristics of multiple models can be well integrated in this way similarly buhan et al 2020 developed a hybrid ensemble model based on three forecast models to produce a weighted average of the outputs of the individual models the difference with this study lies in the fact that it not only integrated multiple machine learning models but also incorporated the forecast results of hydrological models it can also be seen from table 4 that the prediction results after the integration of sem tend to incorporate the errors of each model with a nse value of 0 900 and a r2 value of 0 912 the result of sem is better than the worst performing in all indicators of three individual models demonstrating that sem can effectively integrates the characteristics of multiple models 5 2 robustness of optimal flood control operation in general optimal flood control scheduling that incorporates uncertain flood forecasts provides a better representation of robustness the purpose of robust optimization is to find a solution in which the constraints are satisfied for all possible cases and the function value is optimal for the worst case it not only avoids the risk in the planning process but also balances the cost and risk relationship of the system and effectively increases the feasibility of the model solution and the stability of the system zhang et al 2020 in this study we explored studies that aim at integrating flood forecasting in the process of real time flood control operation fig 11 demonstrates that the distributions of risk values for the morou model are somewhat narrower than those of moob and mosem there is also a reduction in the average risk values providing good evidence of the improved robustness of the scheduling scheme after combining the uncertainty forecasts similar conclusions can be drawn from the studies of wang et al 2021b hecht and kirshen 2019 and guo et al 2021a multiple robustness measures exist and the decision on which measure to adopt is still uncertain because different preferences can lead to potentially different choices and outcomes borgomeo et al 2018 mcphail et al 2018 to further explore this issue we proposed the stp method which considered all the risk values of each scenario simultaneously in the robust optimization translated the performance of each scenario into a specific value and then applied the worst case optimization this is because the scheduling strategies corresponding to each scenario may have different representations in different risk indicators in order to make optimal scheduling more meaningful it should be ensured as far as possible that the flood risk from the most unfavorable alternative among multiple options is also within the acceptable range therefore we chose to optimize the worst scenario in the iterative process in fig 11 the worst case of the morou model outperformed the other two models while the optimal case reduces each risk level further instead of optimizing the worst case scenario for each risk metric which neglects the overall applicability of the scheduling alternatives the stp method is more conducive for applications in practice 5 3 limitations and prospects for real time reservoir operations the process of reservoir scheduling is affected by many uncertainties including forecast error real time water level measurement error flood propagation uncertainty and the time delay of decision making uncertainty etc for better flood prediction and adopting the proper mitigation and protection measures it is critical to have comprehensive information about hydrological and hydraulic characteristics ardiclioglu et al 2022 streamflow forecasts play an important role in real time reservoir operation especially during the flood season wang et al 2021d the main focus of this study is to verify the impact of forecast uncertainty on improving the effectiveness of optimal flood control operations due to the limitation of the article length the implications arising from other types of uncertainty and the parameter sensitivity of the model will be further explored in our future research meanwhile in order to search for the most suitable set of parameters more quickly and efficiently an optimization algorithm is needed to optimize the parameters of predictive models dehghani et al 2019 as shown in the results in section 4 1 2 the sem model has an integrative effect on the individual models and similar findings can be found in other studies gu et al 2022 lee and ahn 2021 however there are many other types of ensemble methods which can be tried in future studies to test and evaluate the effectiveness of their respective applications another limitation in this study is that the number of flood events is not large enough in accordance with the characteristics of ml models a large amount of data can be beneficial for the models to learn better and improve the accuracy of prediction results in the follow up study we will collect as much data as possible for validation and apply other cases to confirm the generalizability of the methodology in this study the nsga iii algorithm deb and jain 2014 was used to solve the proposed multi objective reservoir operation model other methods such as particle swarm optimization pso nematollahi et al 2022 grey wolf optimization gwo darabi et al 2021 and whale optimization algorithm woa lai et al 2021 etc can be utilized as optimization algorithms different algorithms may also have an impact on the results which can be attempted for comparison in future studies 6 conclusions real time reservoir flood control scheduling is dependent on the accuracy of flood forecasting in order to improve the robustness of optimal reservoir scheduling this study focused on two major aspects firstly we adopted three ml models to obtain the forecast streamflow series generated 300 sets of scenarios by artificially transforming the hyperparameters available and then used the stacking ensemble model to combine the features of multiple models to get the integrated series in order to improve the degree of utilization of the reservoir s flood control capacity within the entire flood scheduling period under the premise of ensuring safety this study defined the concept of rrca as one of the objectives of the optimal scheduling model then we established a multi objective robust optimization of real time reservoir operation model integrating the risks that may arise in the scheduling process the optimal operation model used the streamflow scenarios predicted by ml models as input a comparative model was constructed to verify its effectiveness considering the maximum reservoir level the maximum discharge flow and the degree of reservoir capacity utilization the nsga iii algorithm was used for solving the models the proposed methodology was applied to the lsm reservoir and the following conclusions were drawn 1 all three ml models had good performance in forecasting the results predicted by the bp model were relatively closer to the observation values which had a minimum value of 0 87 and a maximum value of 0 91 for nse the prediction performances of lstm and elm were relatively more stable the stacking ensemble model was found to be able to incorporate the errors of each model with a nse value of 0 899 and a r2 value of 0 912 outperforming the base models 2 as the morou model considered the forecast uncertainty in the optimization process it had narrower distributions of flood risk both upstream and downstream than mosem and moob furthermore the distribution of the maximum water level in morou was at a much lower level but at the expense of a certain degree of increased release to ensure the safety of the upstream compared to mosem and moob morou achieved a 1 87 and 1 03 reduction in the maximum value of the highest water level respectively 3 the scenario to point stp method allowed the flood control scheduling scheme of the reservoir to have better robustness and the flood risks could be within acceptable limits even in the face of the most unfavorable scenario selecting the solution with the lowest regret value from the set of non inferior solutions as the final alternative further reduced the risk values 4 the introduction of rrca successfully reduced the distribution range of discharge flow without occupying additional flood control reservoir capacity throughout the scheduling process the average maximum discharge flow was reduced by 4 52 confirming that rrca can be used as an optimization indicator to improve the utilization of the reservoir throughout the scheduling process and fully exploit the flood control capacity overall the proposed method enables real time reservoir flood control operations to search for robust strategies under forecast uncertainty to cope with potential risks in the flood scheduling process the flood in this case study is of large magnitude and in future studies such a framework could be applied to floods with different return periods to test the adaptability to various types of floods credit authorship contribution statement xinting yu conceptualization methodology software writing original draft writing
