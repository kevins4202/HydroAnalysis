9010,recent studies have raised a concern that the adverse impact of global virtual water trade on water depletion might pose potential risks to future food trade and water security in this study we investigate the patterns and drivers of agricultural virtual water imports in china to explore efficient measures to promote the sustainability of agricultural virtual water trade the panel gravity model and the quantile regression are constructed in this research based on virtual water content and agricultural trade data of 245 categories of hs 6 bit encoded crop and animal products from 49 major exporters during 1998 2018 the main results are as follows 1 agricultural virtual water imports in china show a strong upward trend with an average annual growth rate of 13 09 and oil products occupy the largest share both the number of import sources extended margins and the import volume from each county intensive margins show an increasing trend but america makes the greatest contribution to virtual water imports of china 2 agricultural virtual water imports of china could well match the water resource endowment of exporters and could also achieve net global water savings which is beneficial to the sustainability of global water utilization 3 water and land resource endowments and economic scale of exporter as three essential supply factors have a positive impact on agricultural virtual water imports of china among demand factors water demand of product and economic scale of china has a positive effect while import price has a negative effect moreover supply and demand factors have a stronger impact at higher quantiles in addition trade cost factors including average tariff bilateral exchange rate and free trade assignment fta could also significantly affect agricultural virtual water imports data availability data will be made available on request keywords agricultural virtual water trade crop animal gravity model driving factors data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water scarcity and its threat to food security have gained continuous attention in water resource allocation and management in china fao reported that water resource per capita in china is only 1955 2 m3 accounting for 39 8 of the world average agricultural production accounts for the biggest proportion of water use in china berrittella et al 2008 tamea et al 2014 song et al 2020 according to water resources bulletin wrb agricultural water use accounts for 63 5 of the total water consumption in china of which more than 90 is used for farmland irrigation however the agricultural water shortage is still serious due to the increasing demand for food consumption ali et al 2017 as ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of china reported the average annual water shortage in agricultural production exceeds 30 km3 in china which severely restricts the domestic supply of agricultural products moreover climate change especially the frequent drought events has exacerbated agricultural water shortage which not only affects agricultural production but also poses great challenges to the ecological environment and sustainability of water use d odorico et al 2019 xia et al 2022 therefore it is essential to explore the possible measures to alleviate the water supply crisis which is becoming the greatest risk facing humanity virtual water trade has been considered as an efficient strategy to alleviate regional water shortage under globalization virtual water is originally proposed by allan 1993 1998 who defined it as the water embedded in the commodity how much water is used to produce products he argued that water scare countries could import water intensive products from water abundant countries to obtain food and alleviate domestic water scarcity allan 1998 moreover virtual water trade is crucial politically as it enables the political leadership to avoid confronting the water deficit and prevent a water crisis from turning into a water war allan 1998 hoekstra 2003 then virtual water trade has been widely applied to discussion on water food balance management mekonnen and hoekstra 2011a 2011b hoekstra and hung 2005 akoto danso et al 2019 for example mekonnen and hoekstra 2011a 2011b found that the global virtual water trade reached approximately 2320 km3 per year during 1996 2005 88 of which corresponded to the agricultural sector ali et al 2017 found that increased imports of virtual water significantly alleviate the water pressure in china and they predicted that virtual water import would continue to increase to satisfy the demand for food consumption and save domestic and global water resources from 2015 to 2030 however recent studies have also raised concerns about the potential adverse impacts of global virtual water trade on water consumption and depletion dalin et al 2017 noted that international virtual water trade embedded in food trade is exacerbating groundwater depletion which poses potential risks to future food trade and water security especially for the usa mexico iran and china rosa et al 2019 found that international agricultural trade is driving unsustainable irrigation water consumption mekonnen and hoekstra 2020 found that 43 of international blue water flows violate sustainable environmental flows and population growth dietary changes climate change and increased use of biofuels will further increase global water demand by 20 30 between 2010 and 2050 under the above reality two questions need to be further understood to promote the sustainability of virtual water trade in china that is 1 what is the patterns of agricultural virtual water imports of china does it relate to global unsustainable water use 2 how to promote the sustainability of agricultural virtual water flow in china to alleviate water stress and ensure food security that is what are the efficient driving factors of agricultural virtual water import in china numerous researches have investigated the patterns of virtual water flows at the global or regional level the first generally adopted method is input output model chen and chen 2013 tian et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 li et al 2021 the advantage of input output model is it could efficiently calculate the direct virtual water consumption and indirect virtual water consumption based on the economic input output tables and water use coefficient matrix for example chen and chen 2013 used a multi region input output model to evaluate the international virtual water trade for 112 countries and found that china the united states the association of southeast asian nations and the european union were the centers of world s virtual water trade tian et al 2018 further found that virtual water trade network for china has been relatively stable from 1995 to 2009 however this approach cannot accurately quantify the virtual water content of each specific commodity and it ignores the difference in water consumption coefficients between commodities li et al 2021 xia et al 2022 the second approach is to use virtual water content water footprint of specific commodities to measure the international virtual water trade chapagain et al 2006 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011a 2011b 2012 dalin et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 ali et al 2017 ye et al 2019 also the characteristics of virtual water trade in china with other countries have been widely investigated ali et al 2017 tian et al 2018 sun et al 2019 fan et al 2019 xia et al 2022 for example fan et al 2019 investigated the temporal and spatial characteristics of the international virtual water trade networks for crop products by constructing a virtual water trade network model and found that the structure of the network became more heterogeneous over time however most of previous studies mainly have focused on the impact of virtual water trade on importer in alleviating water pressure but ignored the possible impact on global water use namely global water saving effect also limited research has investigated product distribution of water saving effect another branch of literature also explored the drivers of virtual water flows which is a crucial step prior to the design and evaluation of agricultural water management policy duarte et al 2019 the earlier discussion mainly centered around the consistency of virtual water trade with trade theory wichelns 2004 ansink 2010 reimer 2012 for example wichelns 2004 noted that technology differences are of particular importance for explaining trade in water intensive commodities reimer 2012 argued that heckscher ohlin trade model as a theoretical model could explain the virtual water follow once it makes clear the water is a potential source of comparative advantage however the model cannot account for everything in a real trade world which means that relative water abundance is not consistently a good predictor of virtual trade flows then some empirical studies have come to different conclusions about the impact of water resource endowment on virtual water trade fracasso et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 han et al 2021 the first interested but controversial factor is water endowment for example fracasso et al 2016 showed that larger water resource endowments do not necessarily lead to a larger export of virtual water zhao et al 2019 and song et al 2020 found that water resource endowment has no significant influence on domestic virtual water trade han et al 2021 noted that the social indicators rather than the indicators in water use play an important role in virtual water trade however xia et al 2022 found that the water resource endowment is the most important factor in international virtual water trade for belt and road countries in addition some other studies also found that economic gravity factors and trade policy are essential factors in virtual water flow tamea et al 2014 d odorico et al 2019 ye et al 2019 delbourg and dinar 2020 for example sun et al 2019 concluded that the regional socio economic pattern and its evolution will affect the pattern of grain virtual water flows uninetti et al 2017 argued that population and geographical distance were the main drivers of virtual water trade networks however these studies did not bring unsustainable global water consumption into their discussion which cannot provide a clear implication for future agricultural water management from the econometric model perspective and gravity model was widely used to empirically estimate the impact of these drivers tamea et al 2014 xia et al 2022 as xia et al 2022 noted most studies have adopted cross section data of a certain year or years which cannot perfectly capture dynamic temporal changes of virtual water trade and panel data models could get a more accurate estimation moreover limited studies have investigated the heterogeneous effects of the aforementioned underlying factors on virtual water trade between different agricultural products or different import scales this is important to help virtual water importers implement differentiated water management strategies therefore the purpose of this paper is threefold first we investigate temporal and spatial the characteries the agricultural virtual water imports of china from 49 major countries during 1998 2018 245 categories of hs 6 bit encoded crop and animal products are selected to help us accurately capture the virtual water content of each specific product and the product structure of agricultural virtual water imports in china moreover we conduct a spatial match of distribution of the virtual water import of china with the local water resources in exporters this would answer whether agricultural water import of china violates the water resource endowment of exporters second we estimate the total global water saving effect of agricultural water import of china and the contribution of each product to global water saving effect based on the difference in virtual water content of 245 selected crop and animal products between china and exporters finally we construct a panel gravity model to empirically explore the essential drives of agricultural virtual water imports in china we further adopt sub sample regression and quantile regression to analyze the heterogeneity of driver s effects under different import scales our research can further provide important policy implications for future agricultural virtual water imports in china also the results have certain implications for other water scarce countries the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces method and data section 3 presents empirical results of patterns and drives of virtual water imports of china followed by the discussion section the final section provides conclusion 2 method and data 2 1 calculation of virtual water content the virtual water content of agricultural products is the amount of water resources consumed per unit mass of agricultural products allan 1993 the calculation of virtual water content for crops mainly adopts the penman monteith recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao specifically the calculation function can be expressed as 1 v ij w ij y ij where v ij m 3 t 1 is the virtual water content per unit mass of crop j in region i and y ij t is the total production of crop w ij m 3 is the total amount of water resources consumed by planting the crop although w ij cannot be directly observed it can be obtained by the water evapotranspiration of crops during the cumulative growth period et ij that is 2 w ij et ij k ij et 0 the crop coefficient k ij is mainly used to reflect the difference between the actual crop and the reference crop due to differences in climate conditions and crop traits the referenced water demand for crop et 0 m 3 is expressed as 3 et 0 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 1 e a e d γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n mj m 2 d 1 represents the net radiation at the surface in crop growing area and g mj m 2 d 1 is the soil heat flux is the slope of the vapor pressure curve γ is the dry humidity kpa 1 t represents the average temperature and u 1 m s 1 represents the wind speed at height of two meters from the ground e a and e d kpa denote the vapor pressure index at saturation and the actual vapor pressure index respectively the calculation of the virtual water content of animal products is more complicated than that of crops the water consumed of animal production mainly includes the water required for the growth of edible feed drinking water and water resources consumed by cleaning the animal growth environment mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 it is expressed as 4 wc i j wc feed i j wc drink i j wc service i j where wc feed i j m 3 t 1 is the water resources consumed in production of animal product j mainly including feed water wc feed i j m 3 t 1 drinking water wc drink i j m 3 t 1 and service water wc service i j m 3 t 1 and service water refers to the amount of water consumed in cleaning farmyard washing animals and performing other services necessary to maintain the environment the specific calculation process can be found in the study by meknonnen and hoekstra 2012 2 2 calculation of virtual water imports based on the virtual water content of the product some importers can import water resources in virtual form through agricultural trade which is called virtual water trade hoekstra and hung 2003 therefore virtual water import of china c from another country j at year t is calculated as follows 5 vwt cjt vwc i ag cjit where vwt cjt m 3 is virtual water import of china vwc ij m 3 t 1 is the virtual water content of the product i in country j according to meknonnen and hoekstra 2011 2012 the virtual water content is the sum of green water content and blue water content ag cjit t is the quantity of agricultural imports of china 2 3 driving factor model of agricultural virtual water imports of china the trade gravity model has been widely used to empirically investigate the driving factors of bilateral trade relationships and the model assumes that bilateral trade relationships are attracted by the economic gravity and inversely related to their distance anderson and wincoop 2003 the economic gravity consists of the supply ability of exporter and demand potential of importer and distance proxies for trade costs tamea et al 2014 fracasso et al 2016 xia et al 2022 therefore we construct a framework of driving factors for agricultural virtual water imports from three aspects supply demand and trade costs fig 1 the supply factors include resource endowments water and land resources and economic scale gdp of exporter to this specify since virtual water trade takes agricultural trade as the carrier virtual water trade also reflects agricultural production factors reimer 2012 among the natural resources freshwater resource endowment is directly related to the satisfaction of water resources in agricultural production xia et al 2022 land resource which is the dependent resource of water resource is another indispensable resource closely related to agricultural production fracasso 2014 fracasso et al 2016 in addition economic scale of exporter that is also taken as a basic gravity factor reflects the level of infrastructure construction and technology tamea et al 2014 the demand aspects mainly include economic scale of china water demand of product and price of virtual water product the expansion of economic scale in china would also increase the demand for water resources as agricultural virtual water is an indispensable resource for mankind tamea et al 2013 xia et al 2022 in addition the economic scale could reflect the level of income that positively affects the demand for water resources according to demand theory the price of virtual water product would negatively affect the demand for virtual water reimer 2012 the virtual water content of product as the demand for water resources in agricultural production will also affect the virtual water import the amount of water resources required for production will be higher if virtual water content of product is higher which will result in higher domestic production costs therefore china as a water scare country is more inclined to import water intensive agricultural products than to save domestic water resources the trade cost factors include import tariffs trade agreements exchange rates and bilateral geographic distance trade costs are the costs incurred in the process of bilateral transactions of products including transportation costs tariffs and non tariff costs in addition to the initial price of the product it also includes the costs incurred by bilateral trade policies in the final price of the product especially the tariff rates for bilateral trade specifically the higher the tariff the higher the cost of importing virtual water which in turn negatively affects the import scale of virtual water moreover countries that have signed the free trade agreement could not only enjoy lower tariffs but also have higher efficiency on bilateral customs clearance and transportation which will reduce trade costs and then lead to an increase in virtual water imports for example baier and bergstrand 2007 found that free trade agreements can double the trade of member countries on average another trade cost factor is the exchange rate that reflects the relative value or the purchasing power of currency to a certain extent therefore changes in the exchange rate will directly cause the actual prices of bilateral trade products to change accordingly kang and suzette 2018 for example the actual price is relatively low if the exchange rate of the exporter depreciates relative to the rmb which can effectively promote the virtual water import of agricultural products in china in addition to trade costs caused by policy factors the bilateral spatial geographic distance and the existence of common boundary reflect the actual transportation cost which is also widely incorporated into the trade gravity model based on the above analysis an empirical expanded log linear gravity model on the drivers of virtual water imports is constructed as 6 ln import ijt ln c β 1 ln gdp jt β 2 ln water jt β 3 ln land jt β 4 ln gdp t β 5 ln price ijt β 6 ln water content ijt β 7 ln tariff ijt β 8 ln exchange jt β 9 fta j t β 10 ln dis j β 11 wto jt β 12 border jt ε it where import ijt m 3 is virtual water imports from country j on product i in year t and c is a constant term the variables on supply factors include economic scale of exporter gdp jt million us dollar water resource water jt km 3 and land resource land jt thousand ha the variables on demand factors are economic scale in china gdp t million us dollar price of virtual water product price ijt us dollar kg 1 and virtual water content of the product water content ijt km 3 t 1 product import tariff tariff ijt bilateral exchange rate exchange jt whether to sign a bilateral free trade assignment fta jt and bilateral geographic distance dis j km are included in the trade cost factors in addition two dummy variables are added including whether they have a common border border jt and whether china has joined the wto ε it is an error term and β 1 β 2 β 12 are the parameter estimates to obtain consistent and efficient estimators ε it needs to satisfy the assumption of independent and identical distribution however unobserved fixed characteristics of exporters would cause heteroscedasticity therefore we used five different estimation methods to test the robustness of estimation specifically we employ two panel models including random effects panel model and fixed effects panel model as the general panel estimation approach addressing unobserved heterogeneity then the panel corrected standard errors model and the feasible generalized least square method fgls are used to further control the heteroscedasticity by adding weight matrices finally we adopt a poisson pseudo maximum likelihood ppml method to check whether zero value in trade affects the robustness of estimation we further conduct a quantile regression model to investigate the heterogeneous effects of the above drivers on virtual water imports of china according to koenker 2004 the econometric model of formula 2 can be written as 7 q y ijt τ x ijt x ijt β τ α i ε ijt where q y ijt τ x ijt represents the τ th quantile of dependent variable x ijt is a set of explanatory variables β τ is the estimated parameter at the τ th quantile and α i is an individual fixed effect in this study we select five general quantiles including 5 25 50 75 and 95 2 4 study area and data to empirically investigate virtual water imports of china we first obtain international agricultural trade data during 1998 2018 the importer is mainland china and exporters include 49 countries based on the importance of trade scale 245 crops and animal products are taken into consideration agricultura trade data is from the cpeii dataset then the virtual water content of crops and animals is obtained from the study by meknonnen and hoekstra 2011 2012 therefore the virtual water import is measured by the volume of virtual water import the data used to analyze the drivers of virtual water imports in china include supply factors demand factors and trade costs among factors water resource endowment and land resource endowment of exporters are from fao s global information system on water and agriculture https www fao org aquastat en economic scale per capital of china and exporters and exchange rate are from world bank database average applied tariff data are obtained from the wits database and bilateral geographic distance and common border are from the cepii database the import price of virtual water products is calculated by the value and volume of virtual water imports and the water demand of product is measured by the virtual water content of product 3 empirical results 3 1 virtual water content characteristics of agricultural products fig 2 presents the virtual water content characteristics of agricultural products in and 49 selected exporters among different products it can be found that virtual water content of animal products including beef pork mutton and chicken are highest 3000 m 3 t 1 for example virtual water content per ton of beef is 10 623 m 3 at global average level which means that the amount of water consumed per ton of beef production is massive and efficient water resource management in animal production are essential for water scarcity countries the virtual water content of oil products soybean rapeseed and peanut is between 1935 m 3 t 1 and 7086 m 3 t 1 and virtual water content of refined oil is much higher than that of raw materials for example the virtual water content of soybean oil is 4117 m 3 t 1 while the virtual water content of soybean is only 2107 m 3 t 1 the virtual water contents of grains rice maize and wheat and sugars sugar cane and sugar beets are around 1200 m 3 t 1 the virtual water content of horticultural including fresh fruits and vegetables is the lowest 800 m 3 t 1 which makes it possible to produce vegetables on a large scale with limited water resources in china it also should be noted that the daily consumption of oil and grain is higher than that of animal leading to higher water consumption in china although the virtual water content of oil and grain is less than that of animal we further compare the difference in technology efficiency of water use in agricultural production between china and select 49 countries using virtual water content index in general the virtual water contents of agricultural products between different countries show a certain difference for example the virtual water content of animal per unit mass in china is lower than that in america and asian but higher than that in europe indicating that the water use efficiency in europe is highest in animal production the virtual water content of grain per unit mass in china is lower than most of exporters take rice which is a dominant food crop as an example per ton of rice need to consume water resource about 795 m 3 in china the water demand for rice is about 1500 m 3 in spain indonesia and australia and over 2000 m 3 in brazil and thailand this means that water use efficiency in rice production in china is higher than that in other countries in addition the virtual water content of fresh fruit and vegetable between selected countries are relatively close table 1 further presents that the proportion of products that virtual water content in china is higher than that in 49 selected countries compared with the global average level only 28 98 of agricultural products in china have a higher virtual water content indicating that the agricultural water use efficiency is relatively high the proportion of products that virtual water content in china is higher than that in other countries is 1 65 93 91 in 49 selected countries the countries with a share of more than 50 are mainly located in europe and those with a share of less than 20 are mainly located in asia and africa reflecting that water use efficiency of china is higher than that of asia and africa but lower than that of europe 3 2 spatial temporal characteristics on agricultural virtual water imports in china fig 3 shows the trend of total temporal characteristics of agricultural virtual water imports and product distribution in china from 1998 to 2018 generally the total imported volume of agricultural virtual water has increased from 28 61 km3 in 1998 to 334 85 km3 in 2018 with an average annual growth rate of 13 09 the increase can be divided into three stages the first stage is from 1998 to 2002 when the overall scale of virtual water imports is relatively small and the annual virtual water imports are basically below 50 km3 in the second stage from 2003 to 2014 virtual water imports continue to increase and the average annual import growth rate remains between 6 35 and 22 31 in the third stage after 2014 the total import scale of virtual water is about 300 km3 per year but the average annual growth rate declines among five product categories the virtual water import from oil products occupies the largest share accounting for 66 67 89 94 which means that the virtual water imports are mainly driven by the imports of oil crops and edible oil products the second largest imported agricultural product is grain and the proportion of imports is about 2 82 22 42 and the share of virtual water imports from grain products shows a gradually declining trend with the implementation of the domestic grain price support policy in 2004 as ali et al 2017 noted china has made tremendous progress in agricultural production to meet the domestic food demand except for the demand for soybean although per unit of animal product consumes the highest amount of water resources in production virtual water import from animal products is relatively smaller than those from oil and grain products however the share of virtual water imports from animal products shows an increasing trend from 2 71 in 1998 to 8 27 in 2018 in addition horticultural and sugar products account for a small proportion of virtual water imports with a share of less than 5 fig 4 shows the spatial and temporal evolution of agricultural virtual water imports from 49 countries we can easily find that both the number of import sources extended margins and the of agricultural virtual water import from each county intensive margins show an increasing trend in china for example the number of the country who exports virtual water to china over 1 km3 is 8 in 1998 and the maximum export volume from each country is less than 5 km3 the number of countries increased to 10 11 15 and 25 in 2003 2008 2013 and 2018 respectively and the maximum export volume exceed 160 km3 in 2018 although agricultural virtual water imports show an increasing trend from most countries america occupies the highest share indicating that the spatial distribution of virtual water imports is highly concentrated for example the share of agricultural virtual water imports from canada the united states brazil and argentina accounted for 22 46 18 58 10 14 and 6 37 in 1998 respectively reflecting that china has a high dependence on the water resource in america the second largest import source is asia with a percentage of 10 8 26 0 which is followed by oceania and the main sources of imports in asia include thailand vietnam philippines india indonesia and malaysia the proportion of agricultural virtual water imports from europe fluctuated greatly ranging from 0 7 to 7 0 the proportion of imports from africa is relatively small but has been on the rise it should also be noted that australia and some asian countries have gradually emerged as new imported virtual water sources for china for example the import volume from australia thailand malaysia and indonesia also exceeded 10 km3 in 2018 which reduces china s dependence on virtual water imports from the americas to a certain extent 3 3 relationship between agricultural virtual water imports of china and global water use we further match the spatial distribution of virtual water imports in china with the spatial distribution of global water resource endowment table 2 among 49 selected countries 27 countries show a balanced relationship between water resource endowment and virtual water trade scale with china indicating that virtual water imported by china from these countries could well match local water resource endowment and would not pose great water resource stress to these countries this is also conducive to the stability of spatial structure of virtual water imports for china in addition only two countries have low water resource endowment but export a relatively high scale of virtual water which violates the factor endowment theory the possible reason is that the major import products from niger sudan is sesame and other oil products which has a high virtual water content based on the difference in the virtual water content of agricultural products we further calculated the net water savings of agricultural virtual water imports of china as shown in figs 5 and 6 the global net water savings of agricultural virtual water imports of china generally show an upward trend until reaching the peak in 2016 this indicates that agricultural virtual water imports of china can not only alleviate the domestic water crisis but also help conserve global water resources moreover virtual water import from oil and animal products makes a major contribution to global net water savings while virtual water import from grain products is detrimental to global net water savings since grain production in china has higher water use productivity this is consistent with the study by zhang et al 2016 who found that increasing soya beans imports boost global water conservation in the soya beans market from the perspective of spatial distribution brazil the united states argentina and new zealand are four major sources of positive water saving effects while australia canada malaysia and indonesia are four major sources of negative water saving effects 3 4 drivers of agricultural virtual water imports table 3 shows the influence of various factors on agricultural virtual water imports in china among the supply factors the gdp per capita of the exporter and the endowments of water resource and land resource have a significant impact on the agricultural virtual water imports in china specifically the elasticity estimates of the gdp per capita in the six models range from 0 054 to 0 386 all of which are significant at the level of 10 this means that every 10 increase in the economic scale of exporter can effectively increase agricultural virtual water imports of china by 0 54 3 86 this is consistent with the analysis by duarte et al 2019 that the gdp of the virtual water supplier plays an important role in the flow of virtual water trade the elasticity coefficient of the water resource endowment of exporter to agricultural virtual water import is estimated to be 0 015 0 141 which is significant at the 10 level this means that a 10 increase in the owned water resources in exporter may lead to an increase in the agricultural virtual water imports of china by 0 15 1 41 this also reflects that more water resources could be used to produce agricultural products when the available water resources on the supply side increase and virtual water of products might exceed domestic demand for virtual water thereby increasing virtual water exports to china this is consistent with the principle of comparative advantage in international trade reimer 2012 xia et al 2022 moreover the significantly positive effect of land resource endowment indicates that its increase can also effectively promote the importer of agricultural virtual water of china land resource is an essential element for agricultural production and an important medium for transforming water into virtual water embedded in agricultural products duarte et al 2019 therefore the land resource endowment of exporter could also affect the virtual water imports of china in terms of demand factors the impact of import price is stronger than that of gdp per capita of china and water demand of product the estimated coefficient of import price to agricultural virtual water import is 0 928 1 684 and the estimated coefficients are significant at the 10 level which is consistent with the demand theory the estimated coefficient of gdp per capita of china ranges from 0 537 to 1 016 indicating that economic development capacity and income level of importer has a significant positive impact which is also consistent with theoretical expectation and empirical literature on virtual water trade fracasso et al 2016 duarte et al 2019 the water demand of product has a significant positive impact on virtual water imports of china with an estimated elasticity of 0 293 1 190 this reflects that the higher water demand for agricultural product would lead to more pressure on domestic production in china and a greater likelihood that increasing imports of this product would save more water resources among the trade cost factors both the average tariff and the bilateral exchange rate have a significant negative impact while the fta and china s accession to the wto have a positive impact specifically the estimated elasticity of the average tariff is 0 401 0 085 which is relatively lower than the import price elasticity this means that both price and tariff could affect the final transaction price of the product but price is a more immediate and important factor the elasticity of the bilateral exchange rate is estimated to be 0 002 0 244 indicating that it may have a positive impact on agricultural virtual water imports of china when the value of the rmb is higher than that of foreign currencies but its impact is lower than that of price and tariff the exchange rate and settlement system between china and exporters is mainly denominated in us dollars therefore an increase in the real purchasing power of the rmb relative to the us dollar or other currencies would boost virtual water imports of china the estimated coefficient of the influence of bilateral geographic distance between china and the source country on virtual water imports is positive and significant at the 10 level this is not exactly as expected and there is a certain difference from the negative effect of geographic distance found in the classic gravity model the first possible reason is that the supply of agricultural virtual water is still mainly affected by factor endowments in the country making the source of imports come from the americas that are geographically far away and the closer asian countries have weaker water resources therefore although virtual water trade does not conform to the principle of minimum actual transportation cost for china it complies with the principle of minimum total trade cost in addition freund and weinhold 2004 also argued that the rapid development of internet may also disrupt the negative effect of geographic distance on trade to a certain extent making that the influence of geographic distance in our model may be different from that in traditional gravity model in addition it also shows that agricultural virtual water imports in china may be unreasonable in the geographical space configuration to a certain extent based on the difference in virtual water import we further construct a quantile regression to investigate the heterogeneity of the above factors on virtual water import between different import scales table 4 the results show that three supply factors including water resource land resource and economic scale of exporter have consistently and significantly positive effects in five quantile groups the elasticity coefficients of water and land resources are larger in the higher quantile group which indicates that the impact of resource endowment is strong on virtual water import of china with the increase of import scale the gdp per capita of exporter also shows an increasing impact with the increase of import scale excluding the 95 quantile group among demand factors import price shows a significantly negative effect on virtual water import of china at five quantile groups while gdp per capita of china and water demand of product have a significantly positive effect three demand factors show a higher impact on virtual water imports at higher quantiles but the impact of trade cost factors on virtual water imports of china shows some differences in different quantile groups for example the impact of exchange rate at the 95 quantile is much greater than that at the other four quantile groups average import tariff has a negative but insignificant effect at the 5 quantile a weak negative and significant effect at the 25 and 50 quantiles and a strong negative and significant effect at the 75 and 95 quantiles in addition the effect of fta on virtual water imports is quite close at the five quantiles indicating that the impact of fta on virtual water imports is quite robust across different import scales 4 discussion virtual water import is an effective strategy to alleviate domestic water shortage but the adverse impact of global virtual water trade on water depletion could pose potential risks to future food trade and water security especially for china in this study our results indicate that agricultural virtual water imports of china show an increasing trend and oil products especially soybean make the biggest contribution this is consistent with the previous studies by ali et al 2017 and xia et al 2022 who found that virtual water import could efficiently alleviate the domestic water resource pressure for china moreover our results reveal that virtual water import of china from these countries could well match local water resource endowment and would not pose water resource stress to these exporters and the virtual water import could achieve a positive global water saving effect which is beneficial to sustainable global agricultural water consumption compared with results from earlier studies our empirical results consistently support that the bilateral economic scales positively affect agricultural virtual water imports of china this means that agricultural water management based on the virtual water trade is highly and positively correlated with economic development tamea et al 2014 also the better water and land resource conditions of exporters tend to increase the virtual water export to china which is consistent with the comparative advantage theory xia et al 2022 our results also support the finding by reimer 2012 who argued that trade costs especially policy related trade costs in the agricultural sector had a negative effect on virtual water flow we further analyze the heterogeneity of the impact of selected factors on china s agricultural virtual water imports across five sub product categories animal horticulture grain oil and sugar products table 5 presents the regression results of the sub groups in general the estimated coefficients of the main influencing factors in the five sub samples are robust and consistent with the basic regression results however the estimated elasticities show heterogeneity in the strength of effects across the five categories for example the elasticity coefficients of the water resource endowment of exporter in five groups are 0 103 0 080 0 083 0 215 and 0 087 respectively indicating that the water resource endowment of exporter has a greater impact on the virtual water imports from animal and oil products the possible reason is that the water demand of these two agricultural products is higher than that of horticulture grain and sugar products which makes the water resources endowment of exporter have a greater impact on its production and therefore has a greater impact on virtual water import in china among economic and trade cost factors the gdp per capita of exporters has the greatest impact on virtual water imports in the animal products 0 494 followed by the oil products 0 406 the gdp per capita of china is not significant for horticulture and sugar products but has a significant positive effect on the other three categories the main reason is that the water demand of production in these two categories is low and the domestic production scale is relatively large so that the increase in domestic economic scale has a weakly impact on virtual water imports from these two in china based on our empirical results our policy implication for agricultural water management is that china could further integrate into international agricultural markets to satisfy the increasing domestic water and food consumption and alleviate water shortage first the establishment of free trade areas and the reduction of import tariffs with water abundant countries would be effective policy tools to maintain the virtual water import as water resource endowment of exporter has a greater impact on the virtual water imports of china from animal and oil products second the quantile regression results indicate that higher virtual water import from a certain country would induce a higher import disruption risk to reduce import risk china should further adopt an import diversification strategy to diversify the import risks and achieve a new increase of virtual water import based on the water and land endowments of potential exporters for example increasing imports of animal products e g beef from russia and new zealand will help china obtain virtual water and reduce imports of animal feed e g corn and soybean finally it is also necessary to develop and extend agricultural water saving technologies at a global scale to effectively improve utilization efficiency of water resources and promote the global sustainability of agricultural water use in addition this study has some limitations first the virtual water content of each crop is highly correlated with the climate condition and crop yield which is generally time varying across years however due to a lack of climate and yield data for each country we do not consider the time varying characteristics of virtual water content for each product second we mainly investigate patterns and driving factors of agricultural virtual water import of china agricultural virtual water export and its determinants could be further addressed in future research 5 conclusion water scarcity and its threat to food security have gained continuous attention in water allocation and management in china in this study we investigate temporal and spatial characteristics of agricultural virtual water imports in china from 49 major countries during 1998 2018 based on the virtual water content and agricultural trade data of 245 categories of hs 6 bit encoded crop and animal products we find that total virtual water imports of china show a strong upward trend from 28 61 km3 in 1998to 334 85 km3 in 2018 with an average annual growth rate of 13 09 oil products occupy the largest share accounting for 66 67 89 94 followed by grain products and animal products from the perspective of spatial distribution both the number of import sources extended margins and the imports of agricultural virtual water from each county intensive margins show an increasing trend in china however most virtual water imports are highly concentrated in the americas including canada the united states brazil and argentina in addition we also find that virtual water import of china could well match the local water resource endowment and virtual water import can conserve global water resources based on the difference in agricultural water use productivity we further construct a panel gravity model to explore the drives of agricultural virtual water imports in china the results show that supply factors including the gdp per capita of the exporter and the endowments of water resource and land resource have a significant and positive impact on virtual water imports of china the estimated elasticity of water and land resource endowment of exporter is greater for virtual water imports from animal and oil products among demand factors import price has a negative effect on virtual water imports of china while water demand of product and gdp per capita of china have a positive effect the elasticity of import price is stronger than that of gdp per capita of china and water demand of product in addition trade cost factors including average tariff bilateral exchange rate free trade assignment fta and geographic distance could also significantly affect the virtual water imports of china moreover the results of quantile regression show that supply and demand factors have a stronger impact on virtual water imports in china at higher quantiles declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have known competing financial interests or personal relationships

9010,recent studies have raised a concern that the adverse impact of global virtual water trade on water depletion might pose potential risks to future food trade and water security in this study we investigate the patterns and drivers of agricultural virtual water imports in china to explore efficient measures to promote the sustainability of agricultural virtual water trade the panel gravity model and the quantile regression are constructed in this research based on virtual water content and agricultural trade data of 245 categories of hs 6 bit encoded crop and animal products from 49 major exporters during 1998 2018 the main results are as follows 1 agricultural virtual water imports in china show a strong upward trend with an average annual growth rate of 13 09 and oil products occupy the largest share both the number of import sources extended margins and the import volume from each county intensive margins show an increasing trend but america makes the greatest contribution to virtual water imports of china 2 agricultural virtual water imports of china could well match the water resource endowment of exporters and could also achieve net global water savings which is beneficial to the sustainability of global water utilization 3 water and land resource endowments and economic scale of exporter as three essential supply factors have a positive impact on agricultural virtual water imports of china among demand factors water demand of product and economic scale of china has a positive effect while import price has a negative effect moreover supply and demand factors have a stronger impact at higher quantiles in addition trade cost factors including average tariff bilateral exchange rate and free trade assignment fta could also significantly affect agricultural virtual water imports data availability data will be made available on request keywords agricultural virtual water trade crop animal gravity model driving factors data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water scarcity and its threat to food security have gained continuous attention in water resource allocation and management in china fao reported that water resource per capita in china is only 1955 2 m3 accounting for 39 8 of the world average agricultural production accounts for the biggest proportion of water use in china berrittella et al 2008 tamea et al 2014 song et al 2020 according to water resources bulletin wrb agricultural water use accounts for 63 5 of the total water consumption in china of which more than 90 is used for farmland irrigation however the agricultural water shortage is still serious due to the increasing demand for food consumption ali et al 2017 as ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of china reported the average annual water shortage in agricultural production exceeds 30 km3 in china which severely restricts the domestic supply of agricultural products moreover climate change especially the frequent drought events has exacerbated agricultural water shortage which not only affects agricultural production but also poses great challenges to the ecological environment and sustainability of water use d odorico et al 2019 xia et al 2022 therefore it is essential to explore the possible measures to alleviate the water supply crisis which is becoming the greatest risk facing humanity virtual water trade has been considered as an efficient strategy to alleviate regional water shortage under globalization virtual water is originally proposed by allan 1993 1998 who defined it as the water embedded in the commodity how much water is used to produce products he argued that water scare countries could import water intensive products from water abundant countries to obtain food and alleviate domestic water scarcity allan 1998 moreover virtual water trade is crucial politically as it enables the political leadership to avoid confronting the water deficit and prevent a water crisis from turning into a water war allan 1998 hoekstra 2003 then virtual water trade has been widely applied to discussion on water food balance management mekonnen and hoekstra 2011a 2011b hoekstra and hung 2005 akoto danso et al 2019 for example mekonnen and hoekstra 2011a 2011b found that the global virtual water trade reached approximately 2320 km3 per year during 1996 2005 88 of which corresponded to the agricultural sector ali et al 2017 found that increased imports of virtual water significantly alleviate the water pressure in china and they predicted that virtual water import would continue to increase to satisfy the demand for food consumption and save domestic and global water resources from 2015 to 2030 however recent studies have also raised concerns about the potential adverse impacts of global virtual water trade on water consumption and depletion dalin et al 2017 noted that international virtual water trade embedded in food trade is exacerbating groundwater depletion which poses potential risks to future food trade and water security especially for the usa mexico iran and china rosa et al 2019 found that international agricultural trade is driving unsustainable irrigation water consumption mekonnen and hoekstra 2020 found that 43 of international blue water flows violate sustainable environmental flows and population growth dietary changes climate change and increased use of biofuels will further increase global water demand by 20 30 between 2010 and 2050 under the above reality two questions need to be further understood to promote the sustainability of virtual water trade in china that is 1 what is the patterns of agricultural virtual water imports of china does it relate to global unsustainable water use 2 how to promote the sustainability of agricultural virtual water flow in china to alleviate water stress and ensure food security that is what are the efficient driving factors of agricultural virtual water import in china numerous researches have investigated the patterns of virtual water flows at the global or regional level the first generally adopted method is input output model chen and chen 2013 tian et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 li et al 2021 the advantage of input output model is it could efficiently calculate the direct virtual water consumption and indirect virtual water consumption based on the economic input output tables and water use coefficient matrix for example chen and chen 2013 used a multi region input output model to evaluate the international virtual water trade for 112 countries and found that china the united states the association of southeast asian nations and the european union were the centers of world s virtual water trade tian et al 2018 further found that virtual water trade network for china has been relatively stable from 1995 to 2009 however this approach cannot accurately quantify the virtual water content of each specific commodity and it ignores the difference in water consumption coefficients between commodities li et al 2021 xia et al 2022 the second approach is to use virtual water content water footprint of specific commodities to measure the international virtual water trade chapagain et al 2006 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011a 2011b 2012 dalin et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 ali et al 2017 ye et al 2019 also the characteristics of virtual water trade in china with other countries have been widely investigated ali et al 2017 tian et al 2018 sun et al 2019 fan et al 2019 xia et al 2022 for example fan et al 2019 investigated the temporal and spatial characteristics of the international virtual water trade networks for crop products by constructing a virtual water trade network model and found that the structure of the network became more heterogeneous over time however most of previous studies mainly have focused on the impact of virtual water trade on importer in alleviating water pressure but ignored the possible impact on global water use namely global water saving effect also limited research has investigated product distribution of water saving effect another branch of literature also explored the drivers of virtual water flows which is a crucial step prior to the design and evaluation of agricultural water management policy duarte et al 2019 the earlier discussion mainly centered around the consistency of virtual water trade with trade theory wichelns 2004 ansink 2010 reimer 2012 for example wichelns 2004 noted that technology differences are of particular importance for explaining trade in water intensive commodities reimer 2012 argued that heckscher ohlin trade model as a theoretical model could explain the virtual water follow once it makes clear the water is a potential source of comparative advantage however the model cannot account for everything in a real trade world which means that relative water abundance is not consistently a good predictor of virtual trade flows then some empirical studies have come to different conclusions about the impact of water resource endowment on virtual water trade fracasso et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 han et al 2021 the first interested but controversial factor is water endowment for example fracasso et al 2016 showed that larger water resource endowments do not necessarily lead to a larger export of virtual water zhao et al 2019 and song et al 2020 found that water resource endowment has no significant influence on domestic virtual water trade han et al 2021 noted that the social indicators rather than the indicators in water use play an important role in virtual water trade however xia et al 2022 found that the water resource endowment is the most important factor in international virtual water trade for belt and road countries in addition some other studies also found that economic gravity factors and trade policy are essential factors in virtual water flow tamea et al 2014 d odorico et al 2019 ye et al 2019 delbourg and dinar 2020 for example sun et al 2019 concluded that the regional socio economic pattern and its evolution will affect the pattern of grain virtual water flows uninetti et al 2017 argued that population and geographical distance were the main drivers of virtual water trade networks however these studies did not bring unsustainable global water consumption into their discussion which cannot provide a clear implication for future agricultural water management from the econometric model perspective and gravity model was widely used to empirically estimate the impact of these drivers tamea et al 2014 xia et al 2022 as xia et al 2022 noted most studies have adopted cross section data of a certain year or years which cannot perfectly capture dynamic temporal changes of virtual water trade and panel data models could get a more accurate estimation moreover limited studies have investigated the heterogeneous effects of the aforementioned underlying factors on virtual water trade between different agricultural products or different import scales this is important to help virtual water importers implement differentiated water management strategies therefore the purpose of this paper is threefold first we investigate temporal and spatial the characteries the agricultural virtual water imports of china from 49 major countries during 1998 2018 245 categories of hs 6 bit encoded crop and animal products are selected to help us accurately capture the virtual water content of each specific product and the product structure of agricultural virtual water imports in china moreover we conduct a spatial match of distribution of the virtual water import of china with the local water resources in exporters this would answer whether agricultural water import of china violates the water resource endowment of exporters second we estimate the total global water saving effect of agricultural water import of china and the contribution of each product to global water saving effect based on the difference in virtual water content of 245 selected crop and animal products between china and exporters finally we construct a panel gravity model to empirically explore the essential drives of agricultural virtual water imports in china we further adopt sub sample regression and quantile regression to analyze the heterogeneity of driver s effects under different import scales our research can further provide important policy implications for future agricultural virtual water imports in china also the results have certain implications for other water scarce countries the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces method and data section 3 presents empirical results of patterns and drives of virtual water imports of china followed by the discussion section the final section provides conclusion 2 method and data 2 1 calculation of virtual water content the virtual water content of agricultural products is the amount of water resources consumed per unit mass of agricultural products allan 1993 the calculation of virtual water content for crops mainly adopts the penman monteith recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao specifically the calculation function can be expressed as 1 v ij w ij y ij where v ij m 3 t 1 is the virtual water content per unit mass of crop j in region i and y ij t is the total production of crop w ij m 3 is the total amount of water resources consumed by planting the crop although w ij cannot be directly observed it can be obtained by the water evapotranspiration of crops during the cumulative growth period et ij that is 2 w ij et ij k ij et 0 the crop coefficient k ij is mainly used to reflect the difference between the actual crop and the reference crop due to differences in climate conditions and crop traits the referenced water demand for crop et 0 m 3 is expressed as 3 et 0 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 1 e a e d γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n mj m 2 d 1 represents the net radiation at the surface in crop growing area and g mj m 2 d 1 is the soil heat flux is the slope of the vapor pressure curve γ is the dry humidity kpa 1 t represents the average temperature and u 1 m s 1 represents the wind speed at height of two meters from the ground e a and e d kpa denote the vapor pressure index at saturation and the actual vapor pressure index respectively the calculation of the virtual water content of animal products is more complicated than that of crops the water consumed of animal production mainly includes the water required for the growth of edible feed drinking water and water resources consumed by cleaning the animal growth environment mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 it is expressed as 4 wc i j wc feed i j wc drink i j wc service i j where wc feed i j m 3 t 1 is the water resources consumed in production of animal product j mainly including feed water wc feed i j m 3 t 1 drinking water wc drink i j m 3 t 1 and service water wc service i j m 3 t 1 and service water refers to the amount of water consumed in cleaning farmyard washing animals and performing other services necessary to maintain the environment the specific calculation process can be found in the study by meknonnen and hoekstra 2012 2 2 calculation of virtual water imports based on the virtual water content of the product some importers can import water resources in virtual form through agricultural trade which is called virtual water trade hoekstra and hung 2003 therefore virtual water import of china c from another country j at year t is calculated as follows 5 vwt cjt vwc i ag cjit where vwt cjt m 3 is virtual water import of china vwc ij m 3 t 1 is the virtual water content of the product i in country j according to meknonnen and hoekstra 2011 2012 the virtual water content is the sum of green water content and blue water content ag cjit t is the quantity of agricultural imports of china 2 3 driving factor model of agricultural virtual water imports of china the trade gravity model has been widely used to empirically investigate the driving factors of bilateral trade relationships and the model assumes that bilateral trade relationships are attracted by the economic gravity and inversely related to their distance anderson and wincoop 2003 the economic gravity consists of the supply ability of exporter and demand potential of importer and distance proxies for trade costs tamea et al 2014 fracasso et al 2016 xia et al 2022 therefore we construct a framework of driving factors for agricultural virtual water imports from three aspects supply demand and trade costs fig 1 the supply factors include resource endowments water and land resources and economic scale gdp of exporter to this specify since virtual water trade takes agricultural trade as the carrier virtual water trade also reflects agricultural production factors reimer 2012 among the natural resources freshwater resource endowment is directly related to the satisfaction of water resources in agricultural production xia et al 2022 land resource which is the dependent resource of water resource is another indispensable resource closely related to agricultural production fracasso 2014 fracasso et al 2016 in addition economic scale of exporter that is also taken as a basic gravity factor reflects the level of infrastructure construction and technology tamea et al 2014 the demand aspects mainly include economic scale of china water demand of product and price of virtual water product the expansion of economic scale in china would also increase the demand for water resources as agricultural virtual water is an indispensable resource for mankind tamea et al 2013 xia et al 2022 in addition the economic scale could reflect the level of income that positively affects the demand for water resources according to demand theory the price of virtual water product would negatively affect the demand for virtual water reimer 2012 the virtual water content of product as the demand for water resources in agricultural production will also affect the virtual water import the amount of water resources required for production will be higher if virtual water content of product is higher which will result in higher domestic production costs therefore china as a water scare country is more inclined to import water intensive agricultural products than to save domestic water resources the trade cost factors include import tariffs trade agreements exchange rates and bilateral geographic distance trade costs are the costs incurred in the process of bilateral transactions of products including transportation costs tariffs and non tariff costs in addition to the initial price of the product it also includes the costs incurred by bilateral trade policies in the final price of the product especially the tariff rates for bilateral trade specifically the higher the tariff the higher the cost of importing virtual water which in turn negatively affects the import scale of virtual water moreover countries that have signed the free trade agreement could not only enjoy lower tariffs but also have higher efficiency on bilateral customs clearance and transportation which will reduce trade costs and then lead to an increase in virtual water imports for example baier and bergstrand 2007 found that free trade agreements can double the trade of member countries on average another trade cost factor is the exchange rate that reflects the relative value or the purchasing power of currency to a certain extent therefore changes in the exchange rate will directly cause the actual prices of bilateral trade products to change accordingly kang and suzette 2018 for example the actual price is relatively low if the exchange rate of the exporter depreciates relative to the rmb which can effectively promote the virtual water import of agricultural products in china in addition to trade costs caused by policy factors the bilateral spatial geographic distance and the existence of common boundary reflect the actual transportation cost which is also widely incorporated into the trade gravity model based on the above analysis an empirical expanded log linear gravity model on the drivers of virtual water imports is constructed as 6 ln import ijt ln c β 1 ln gdp jt β 2 ln water jt β 3 ln land jt β 4 ln gdp t β 5 ln price ijt β 6 ln water content ijt β 7 ln tariff ijt β 8 ln exchange jt β 9 fta j t β 10 ln dis j β 11 wto jt β 12 border jt ε it where import ijt m 3 is virtual water imports from country j on product i in year t and c is a constant term the variables on supply factors include economic scale of exporter gdp jt million us dollar water resource water jt km 3 and land resource land jt thousand ha the variables on demand factors are economic scale in china gdp t million us dollar price of virtual water product price ijt us dollar kg 1 and virtual water content of the product water content ijt km 3 t 1 product import tariff tariff ijt bilateral exchange rate exchange jt whether to sign a bilateral free trade assignment fta jt and bilateral geographic distance dis j km are included in the trade cost factors in addition two dummy variables are added including whether they have a common border border jt and whether china has joined the wto ε it is an error term and β 1 β 2 β 12 are the parameter estimates to obtain consistent and efficient estimators ε it needs to satisfy the assumption of independent and identical distribution however unobserved fixed characteristics of exporters would cause heteroscedasticity therefore we used five different estimation methods to test the robustness of estimation specifically we employ two panel models including random effects panel model and fixed effects panel model as the general panel estimation approach addressing unobserved heterogeneity then the panel corrected standard errors model and the feasible generalized least square method fgls are used to further control the heteroscedasticity by adding weight matrices finally we adopt a poisson pseudo maximum likelihood ppml method to check whether zero value in trade affects the robustness of estimation we further conduct a quantile regression model to investigate the heterogeneous effects of the above drivers on virtual water imports of china according to koenker 2004 the econometric model of formula 2 can be written as 7 q y ijt τ x ijt x ijt β τ α i ε ijt where q y ijt τ x ijt represents the τ th quantile of dependent variable x ijt is a set of explanatory variables β τ is the estimated parameter at the τ th quantile and α i is an individual fixed effect in this study we select five general quantiles including 5 25 50 75 and 95 2 4 study area and data to empirically investigate virtual water imports of china we first obtain international agricultural trade data during 1998 2018 the importer is mainland china and exporters include 49 countries based on the importance of trade scale 245 crops and animal products are taken into consideration agricultura trade data is from the cpeii dataset then the virtual water content of crops and animals is obtained from the study by meknonnen and hoekstra 2011 2012 therefore the virtual water import is measured by the volume of virtual water import the data used to analyze the drivers of virtual water imports in china include supply factors demand factors and trade costs among factors water resource endowment and land resource endowment of exporters are from fao s global information system on water and agriculture https www fao org aquastat en economic scale per capital of china and exporters and exchange rate are from world bank database average applied tariff data are obtained from the wits database and bilateral geographic distance and common border are from the cepii database the import price of virtual water products is calculated by the value and volume of virtual water imports and the water demand of product is measured by the virtual water content of product 3 empirical results 3 1 virtual water content characteristics of agricultural products fig 2 presents the virtual water content characteristics of agricultural products in and 49 selected exporters among different products it can be found that virtual water content of animal products including beef pork mutton and chicken are highest 3000 m 3 t 1 for example virtual water content per ton of beef is 10 623 m 3 at global average level which means that the amount of water consumed per ton of beef production is massive and efficient water resource management in animal production are essential for water scarcity countries the virtual water content of oil products soybean rapeseed and peanut is between 1935 m 3 t 1 and 7086 m 3 t 1 and virtual water content of refined oil is much higher than that of raw materials for example the virtual water content of soybean oil is 4117 m 3 t 1 while the virtual water content of soybean is only 2107 m 3 t 1 the virtual water contents of grains rice maize and wheat and sugars sugar cane and sugar beets are around 1200 m 3 t 1 the virtual water content of horticultural including fresh fruits and vegetables is the lowest 800 m 3 t 1 which makes it possible to produce vegetables on a large scale with limited water resources in china it also should be noted that the daily consumption of oil and grain is higher than that of animal leading to higher water consumption in china although the virtual water content of oil and grain is less than that of animal we further compare the difference in technology efficiency of water use in agricultural production between china and select 49 countries using virtual water content index in general the virtual water contents of agricultural products between different countries show a certain difference for example the virtual water content of animal per unit mass in china is lower than that in america and asian but higher than that in europe indicating that the water use efficiency in europe is highest in animal production the virtual water content of grain per unit mass in china is lower than most of exporters take rice which is a dominant food crop as an example per ton of rice need to consume water resource about 795 m 3 in china the water demand for rice is about 1500 m 3 in spain indonesia and australia and over 2000 m 3 in brazil and thailand this means that water use efficiency in rice production in china is higher than that in other countries in addition the virtual water content of fresh fruit and vegetable between selected countries are relatively close table 1 further presents that the proportion of products that virtual water content in china is higher than that in 49 selected countries compared with the global average level only 28 98 of agricultural products in china have a higher virtual water content indicating that the agricultural water use efficiency is relatively high the proportion of products that virtual water content in china is higher than that in other countries is 1 65 93 91 in 49 selected countries the countries with a share of more than 50 are mainly located in europe and those with a share of less than 20 are mainly located in asia and africa reflecting that water use efficiency of china is higher than that of asia and africa but lower than that of europe 3 2 spatial temporal characteristics on agricultural virtual water imports in china fig 3 shows the trend of total temporal characteristics of agricultural virtual water imports and product distribution in china from 1998 to 2018 generally the total imported volume of agricultural virtual water has increased from 28 61 km3 in 1998 to 334 85 km3 in 2018 with an average annual growth rate of 13 09 the increase can be divided into three stages the first stage is from 1998 to 2002 when the overall scale of virtual water imports is relatively small and the annual virtual water imports are basically below 50 km3 in the second stage from 2003 to 2014 virtual water imports continue to increase and the average annual import growth rate remains between 6 35 and 22 31 in the third stage after 2014 the total import scale of virtual water is about 300 km3 per year but the average annual growth rate declines among five product categories the virtual water import from oil products occupies the largest share accounting for 66 67 89 94 which means that the virtual water imports are mainly driven by the imports of oil crops and edible oil products the second largest imported agricultural product is grain and the proportion of imports is about 2 82 22 42 and the share of virtual water imports from grain products shows a gradually declining trend with the implementation of the domestic grain price support policy in 2004 as ali et al 2017 noted china has made tremendous progress in agricultural production to meet the domestic food demand except for the demand for soybean although per unit of animal product consumes the highest amount of water resources in production virtual water import from animal products is relatively smaller than those from oil and grain products however the share of virtual water imports from animal products shows an increasing trend from 2 71 in 1998 to 8 27 in 2018 in addition horticultural and sugar products account for a small proportion of virtual water imports with a share of less than 5 fig 4 shows the spatial and temporal evolution of agricultural virtual water imports from 49 countries we can easily find that both the number of import sources extended margins and the of agricultural virtual water import from each county intensive margins show an increasing trend in china for example the number of the country who exports virtual water to china over 1 km3 is 8 in 1998 and the maximum export volume from each country is less than 5 km3 the number of countries increased to 10 11 15 and 25 in 2003 2008 2013 and 2018 respectively and the maximum export volume exceed 160 km3 in 2018 although agricultural virtual water imports show an increasing trend from most countries america occupies the highest share indicating that the spatial distribution of virtual water imports is highly concentrated for example the share of agricultural virtual water imports from canada the united states brazil and argentina accounted for 22 46 18 58 10 14 and 6 37 in 1998 respectively reflecting that china has a high dependence on the water resource in america the second largest import source is asia with a percentage of 10 8 26 0 which is followed by oceania and the main sources of imports in asia include thailand vietnam philippines india indonesia and malaysia the proportion of agricultural virtual water imports from europe fluctuated greatly ranging from 0 7 to 7 0 the proportion of imports from africa is relatively small but has been on the rise it should also be noted that australia and some asian countries have gradually emerged as new imported virtual water sources for china for example the import volume from australia thailand malaysia and indonesia also exceeded 10 km3 in 2018 which reduces china s dependence on virtual water imports from the americas to a certain extent 3 3 relationship between agricultural virtual water imports of china and global water use we further match the spatial distribution of virtual water imports in china with the spatial distribution of global water resource endowment table 2 among 49 selected countries 27 countries show a balanced relationship between water resource endowment and virtual water trade scale with china indicating that virtual water imported by china from these countries could well match local water resource endowment and would not pose great water resource stress to these countries this is also conducive to the stability of spatial structure of virtual water imports for china in addition only two countries have low water resource endowment but export a relatively high scale of virtual water which violates the factor endowment theory the possible reason is that the major import products from niger sudan is sesame and other oil products which has a high virtual water content based on the difference in the virtual water content of agricultural products we further calculated the net water savings of agricultural virtual water imports of china as shown in figs 5 and 6 the global net water savings of agricultural virtual water imports of china generally show an upward trend until reaching the peak in 2016 this indicates that agricultural virtual water imports of china can not only alleviate the domestic water crisis but also help conserve global water resources moreover virtual water import from oil and animal products makes a major contribution to global net water savings while virtual water import from grain products is detrimental to global net water savings since grain production in china has higher water use productivity this is consistent with the study by zhang et al 2016 who found that increasing soya beans imports boost global water conservation in the soya beans market from the perspective of spatial distribution brazil the united states argentina and new zealand are four major sources of positive water saving effects while australia canada malaysia and indonesia are four major sources of negative water saving effects 3 4 drivers of agricultural virtual water imports table 3 shows the influence of various factors on agricultural virtual water imports in china among the supply factors the gdp per capita of the exporter and the endowments of water resource and land resource have a significant impact on the agricultural virtual water imports in china specifically the elasticity estimates of the gdp per capita in the six models range from 0 054 to 0 386 all of which are significant at the level of 10 this means that every 10 increase in the economic scale of exporter can effectively increase agricultural virtual water imports of china by 0 54 3 86 this is consistent with the analysis by duarte et al 2019 that the gdp of the virtual water supplier plays an important role in the flow of virtual water trade the elasticity coefficient of the water resource endowment of exporter to agricultural virtual water import is estimated to be 0 015 0 141 which is significant at the 10 level this means that a 10 increase in the owned water resources in exporter may lead to an increase in the agricultural virtual water imports of china by 0 15 1 41 this also reflects that more water resources could be used to produce agricultural products when the available water resources on the supply side increase and virtual water of products might exceed domestic demand for virtual water thereby increasing virtual water exports to china this is consistent with the principle of comparative advantage in international trade reimer 2012 xia et al 2022 moreover the significantly positive effect of land resource endowment indicates that its increase can also effectively promote the importer of agricultural virtual water of china land resource is an essential element for agricultural production and an important medium for transforming water into virtual water embedded in agricultural products duarte et al 2019 therefore the land resource endowment of exporter could also affect the virtual water imports of china in terms of demand factors the impact of import price is stronger than that of gdp per capita of china and water demand of product the estimated coefficient of import price to agricultural virtual water import is 0 928 1 684 and the estimated coefficients are significant at the 10 level which is consistent with the demand theory the estimated coefficient of gdp per capita of china ranges from 0 537 to 1 016 indicating that economic development capacity and income level of importer has a significant positive impact which is also consistent with theoretical expectation and empirical literature on virtual water trade fracasso et al 2016 duarte et al 2019 the water demand of product has a significant positive impact on virtual water imports of china with an estimated elasticity of 0 293 1 190 this reflects that the higher water demand for agricultural product would lead to more pressure on domestic production in china and a greater likelihood that increasing imports of this product would save more water resources among the trade cost factors both the average tariff and the bilateral exchange rate have a significant negative impact while the fta and china s accession to the wto have a positive impact specifically the estimated elasticity of the average tariff is 0 401 0 085 which is relatively lower than the import price elasticity this means that both price and tariff could affect the final transaction price of the product but price is a more immediate and important factor the elasticity of the bilateral exchange rate is estimated to be 0 002 0 244 indicating that it may have a positive impact on agricultural virtual water imports of china when the value of the rmb is higher than that of foreign currencies but its impact is lower than that of price and tariff the exchange rate and settlement system between china and exporters is mainly denominated in us dollars therefore an increase in the real purchasing power of the rmb relative to the us dollar or other currencies would boost virtual water imports of china the estimated coefficient of the influence of bilateral geographic distance between china and the source country on virtual water imports is positive and significant at the 10 level this is not exactly as expected and there is a certain difference from the negative effect of geographic distance found in the classic gravity model the first possible reason is that the supply of agricultural virtual water is still mainly affected by factor endowments in the country making the source of imports come from the americas that are geographically far away and the closer asian countries have weaker water resources therefore although virtual water trade does not conform to the principle of minimum actual transportation cost for china it complies with the principle of minimum total trade cost in addition freund and weinhold 2004 also argued that the rapid development of internet may also disrupt the negative effect of geographic distance on trade to a certain extent making that the influence of geographic distance in our model may be different from that in traditional gravity model in addition it also shows that agricultural virtual water imports in china may be unreasonable in the geographical space configuration to a certain extent based on the difference in virtual water import we further construct a quantile regression to investigate the heterogeneity of the above factors on virtual water import between different import scales table 4 the results show that three supply factors including water resource land resource and economic scale of exporter have consistently and significantly positive effects in five quantile groups the elasticity coefficients of water and land resources are larger in the higher quantile group which indicates that the impact of resource endowment is strong on virtual water import of china with the increase of import scale the gdp per capita of exporter also shows an increasing impact with the increase of import scale excluding the 95 quantile group among demand factors import price shows a significantly negative effect on virtual water import of china at five quantile groups while gdp per capita of china and water demand of product have a significantly positive effect three demand factors show a higher impact on virtual water imports at higher quantiles but the impact of trade cost factors on virtual water imports of china shows some differences in different quantile groups for example the impact of exchange rate at the 95 quantile is much greater than that at the other four quantile groups average import tariff has a negative but insignificant effect at the 5 quantile a weak negative and significant effect at the 25 and 50 quantiles and a strong negative and significant effect at the 75 and 95 quantiles in addition the effect of fta on virtual water imports is quite close at the five quantiles indicating that the impact of fta on virtual water imports is quite robust across different import scales 4 discussion virtual water import is an effective strategy to alleviate domestic water shortage but the adverse impact of global virtual water trade on water depletion could pose potential risks to future food trade and water security especially for china in this study our results indicate that agricultural virtual water imports of china show an increasing trend and oil products especially soybean make the biggest contribution this is consistent with the previous studies by ali et al 2017 and xia et al 2022 who found that virtual water import could efficiently alleviate the domestic water resource pressure for china moreover our results reveal that virtual water import of china from these countries could well match local water resource endowment and would not pose water resource stress to these exporters and the virtual water import could achieve a positive global water saving effect which is beneficial to sustainable global agricultural water consumption compared with results from earlier studies our empirical results consistently support that the bilateral economic scales positively affect agricultural virtual water imports of china this means that agricultural water management based on the virtual water trade is highly and positively correlated with economic development tamea et al 2014 also the better water and land resource conditions of exporters tend to increase the virtual water export to china which is consistent with the comparative advantage theory xia et al 2022 our results also support the finding by reimer 2012 who argued that trade costs especially policy related trade costs in the agricultural sector had a negative effect on virtual water flow we further analyze the heterogeneity of the impact of selected factors on china s agricultural virtual water imports across five sub product categories animal horticulture grain oil and sugar products table 5 presents the regression results of the sub groups in general the estimated coefficients of the main influencing factors in the five sub samples are robust and consistent with the basic regression results however the estimated elasticities show heterogeneity in the strength of effects across the five categories for example the elasticity coefficients of the water resource endowment of exporter in five groups are 0 103 0 080 0 083 0 215 and 0 087 respectively indicating that the water resource endowment of exporter has a greater impact on the virtual water imports from animal and oil products the possible reason is that the water demand of these two agricultural products is higher than that of horticulture grain and sugar products which makes the water resources endowment of exporter have a greater impact on its production and therefore has a greater impact on virtual water import in china among economic and trade cost factors the gdp per capita of exporters has the greatest impact on virtual water imports in the animal products 0 494 followed by the oil products 0 406 the gdp per capita of china is not significant for horticulture and sugar products but has a significant positive effect on the other three categories the main reason is that the water demand of production in these two categories is low and the domestic production scale is relatively large so that the increase in domestic economic scale has a weakly impact on virtual water imports from these two in china based on our empirical results our policy implication for agricultural water management is that china could further integrate into international agricultural markets to satisfy the increasing domestic water and food consumption and alleviate water shortage first the establishment of free trade areas and the reduction of import tariffs with water abundant countries would be effective policy tools to maintain the virtual water import as water resource endowment of exporter has a greater impact on the virtual water imports of china from animal and oil products second the quantile regression results indicate that higher virtual water import from a certain country would induce a higher import disruption risk to reduce import risk china should further adopt an import diversification strategy to diversify the import risks and achieve a new increase of virtual water import based on the water and land endowments of potential exporters for example increasing imports of animal products e g beef from russia and new zealand will help china obtain virtual water and reduce imports of animal feed e g corn and soybean finally it is also necessary to develop and extend agricultural water saving technologies at a global scale to effectively improve utilization efficiency of water resources and promote the global sustainability of agricultural water use in addition this study has some limitations first the virtual water content of each crop is highly correlated with the climate condition and crop yield which is generally time varying across years however due to a lack of climate and yield data for each country we do not consider the time varying characteristics of virtual water content for each product second we mainly investigate patterns and driving factors of agricultural virtual water import of china agricultural virtual water export and its determinants could be further addressed in future research 5 conclusion water scarcity and its threat to food security have gained continuous attention in water allocation and management in china in this study we investigate temporal and spatial characteristics of agricultural virtual water imports in china from 49 major countries during 1998 2018 based on the virtual water content and agricultural trade data of 245 categories of hs 6 bit encoded crop and animal products we find that total virtual water imports of china show a strong upward trend from 28 61 km3 in 1998to 334 85 km3 in 2018 with an average annual growth rate of 13 09 oil products occupy the largest share accounting for 66 67 89 94 followed by grain products and animal products from the perspective of spatial distribution both the number of import sources extended margins and the imports of agricultural virtual water from each county intensive margins show an increasing trend in china however most virtual water imports are highly concentrated in the americas including canada the united states brazil and argentina in addition we also find that virtual water import of china could well match the local water resource endowment and virtual water import can conserve global water resources based on the difference in agricultural water use productivity we further construct a panel gravity model to explore the drives of agricultural virtual water imports in china the results show that supply factors including the gdp per capita of the exporter and the endowments of water resource and land resource have a significant and positive impact on virtual water imports of china the estimated elasticity of water and land resource endowment of exporter is greater for virtual water imports from animal and oil products among demand factors import price has a negative effect on virtual water imports of china while water demand of product and gdp per capita of china have a positive effect the elasticity of import price is stronger than that of gdp per capita of china and water demand of product in addition trade cost factors including average tariff bilateral exchange rate free trade assignment fta and geographic distance could also significantly affect the virtual water imports of china moreover the results of quantile regression show that supply and demand factors have a stronger impact on virtual water imports in china at higher quantiles declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have known competing financial interests or personal relationships

9011,due to high intensity agricultural production activities and the excessive use of chemical substances such as fertilizers and pesticides agricultural nonpoint source pollution has surpassed industrial and urban residential pollution to become the number one contributor to nonpoint source pollution in china promoting farmers participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management is a key link to achieve the goal of sustainable agricultural development based on an expanded theory of planned behavior we identified the key influencing factors of farmers participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management according to microsurvey data from 600 farmers in huai an china we used a structural equation model to analyze in depth the influence of farmers internal cognition and their perceptions of the external environment to explore the formation mechanism of their participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management behavior the study shows that first government regulations promote the green development of the agricultural market environment and social organizations and that farmers perceptions of the external environment strengthen the influence of their internal cognition but are not fully significant second farmers internal cognition can enhance their willingness to participate and the influence of attitudes is the strongest finally there is a positive relationship between the level of response of farmers participation in pollution control behavior and their perceived behavioral control and willingness to control based on the above analysis we propose policy recommendations in terms of government regulation market regulation organization construction and multisubject collaboration to mobilize the enthusiasm of various subjects and to improve the efficiency of agricultural nonpoint source pollution management keywords agricultural pollution polycentric governance behavior study farmers perception external environment data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction as a largely agricultural country china s agriculture is the foundation of national economic development at this stage china s population exceeds 1 4 billion ranking first in the world population growth has driven the rapid expansion of china s agricultural scale and with the rapid development of the agricultural economy the quantity and quality of china s agricultural products have been greatly improved at the same time agricultural production activities aimed at pursuing high yields and profits have led to the increasingly serious problem of agricultural nonpoint source pollution babin et al 2016 li et al 2022 agricultural nonpoint source pollution mainly refers to the pollution caused by applied fertilizers and pesticides agricultural straw livestock and poultry manure and domestic waste and other pollutants generated in agricultural production and life which enter water bodies through surface runoff or underground seepage processes zou et al 2020 agricultural nonpoint source pollution has now become an important source of pollution in water bodies and is an important reason for the decline in the quality of the agricultural production environment niu et al 2022 wang et al 2004 it has been confirmed that agricultural nonpoint source pollution is an important factor limiting the quality growth of the agricultural economy the reason is that agricultural nonpoint source pollution makes agricultural resources scarce causing a tragedy of the commons and seriously threatening the sustainable development of the agricultural economy stavi and lal 2013 furthermore agricultural nonpoint source pollution exacerbates soil and water pollution threatening the quality and safety of agricultural products and affecting people s health liu et al 2021 therefore the prevention and control of agricultural nonpoint source pollution are an inevitable requirement for promoting high quality agricultural development bai and sun 2022 wang et al 2004 however because agricultural nonpoint source pollution is characterized by fragmentation uncertainty and lag it is difficult to manage and regulate and the governance process is prone to fail if we rely solely on the government or the market for governance li et al 2022 lu and xie 2018a agricultural nonpoint source pollution involves many stakeholders and has a strong public attribute for the governance of public affairs ostrom et al 1999 put forward the polycentric governance theory based on long term empirical social investigation advocating the establishment of hierarchical hierarchical and phased diversity institutions to strengthen the collaborative governance among government market and society this theory overcomes the deficiency of relying solely on the government or the market restrains individual opportunism in collective behavior and realizes the sustainable development of public interest in the development of china s agricultural economy the agricultural environment is influenced in various ways by the government markets social organizations and farmers ao et al 2020 chen et al 2021a to promote the collaborative management of agricultural nonpoint source pollution by various actors the chinese government has proposed to build an environmental governance system involving the government the market society and the public requiring all actors to share responsibility for agricultural nonpoint source pollution management ao et al 2020 xi et al 2015 from the perspective of multisubject cogovernance government policy intervention changes in the market environment and guidance from social organizations can have an impact on farmers behaviors han et al 2022 kyeyamwa et al 2008 lane et al 2018 li et al 2013 in the multisubject cogovernance of agricultural nonpoint source pollution farmers as microscopic subjects of agricultural production and life are the main source of agricultural nonpoint source pollution and play a crucial role as one of the most important objects in the process of policy implementation tian et al 2018 it is important to explore the formation mechanism of their participation in governance behavior to control agricultural nonpoint source pollution and improve the agricultural production environment reviewing existing studies most scholars use the theory of planned behavior tpb to analyze the behavior of farmers based on the perspective of farmers according to the influence path of cognition intention behavior mahdavi 2021 maleksaeidi and keshavarz 2019 in which behavioral intentions are mainly influenced by the cognitive aspects of attitudes subjective norms and perceived behavioral control with individuals behavioral intentions directly influencing their behavioral responses shen et al 2020 sok et al 2021 since traditional linear regression models cannot handle complex path relationships with more than one dependent variable and joint cubic models cannot handle some latent variables that are not directly measurable e g intelligence motivation to learn intention a structural equation model sem can handle multiple latent variables and their indicators simultaneously and explore the causal relationships between the latent variables lanza castillo et al 2021 mahdavi 2021 moghadam et al 2020 savari et al 2021 researchers have used sems to study farmers intentions to engage in agri food safety practices li et al 2021a green production intentions aregay et al 2018 bayard and jolly 2007 cropland quality conservation behaviors bondori et al 2021 and pesticide use to reduce production risks wang et al 2018 these studies have found that attitudes subjective norms and perceived behavioral control were the main factors influencing farmers green production intentions and behaviors and all had a driving effect senger et al 2017 su et al 2021 1 1 objectives although there has been a great deal of scholarly research on the green production behavior of farmers there are several limitations that impede our understanding of farmers participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management behavior 1 most existing studies focus on only a certain dimension of farmers green production behavior few studies have exhaustively analyzed the behavioral responses of farmers participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management from the sources of agricultural nonpoint source pollution such as fertilizer application agricultural straw animal manure and domestic waste 2 most of the literature is based on the traditional tpb which analyzes the logic of farmers behavior under the cognition intention behavior path a comprehensive examination of the mechanism of the influence of the external environment such as the government the market and social organizations on farmers cognition from the perspective of multisubject governance is lacking 3 in the literature the analysis of multisubject governance of the ecological environment is mostly focused on the theoretical level few papers have conducted field research on the perception of governance by the government the market and social organizations from the farmer s perspective to fill the research gap in farmers participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management behavior the research objectives of this paper are using the field survey questionnaire data in huai an china and the structural equation model to analyze the influence of farmers perceptions of government regulation the market environment social organizations and farmers perceptions in the context of multisubject cogovernance and to investigate the formation mechanism of farmers participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management there are three main innovations in this paper 1 in terms of research objects this paper includes the green behavior of farmers related to agricultural production life and ecology within the scope of field research and analyzes in detail the behavioral responses of farmers participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management from multiple perspectives from the sources of agricultural nonpoint source pollution 2 the research method this paper combines polycentric governance theory and extends the traditional tpb by adding three latent variables government regulation market environment and social organization and examines the factors influencing farmers participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management behavior from multiple perspectives based on the logic of external environmental perception farmers internal cognition intention behavior 3 regarding the data sources based on the polycentric governance theory from the farmer perspective this paper uses primary data from farmers to investigate the perceptions of the government the market and social organizations in the field to complete traditional research on the multisubject comanagement of the ecological environment 2 material and methods 2 1 theoretical analysis according to the social psychology paradigm theories that explore the relationship between human psychology and behavior patterns include the theory of reasoned action tra and the tpb the tpb is an important theory that was proposed by ajzen 1991 and others based on the tra and that is applied in behavioral science research it is extremely influential as a behavioral prediction theory and has been widely used by scholars to study farmers behavioral motives and intentions the tpb argues that the most direct factor influencing individuals behavior is behavioral intentions which can be influenced by three cognitive dimensions attitudes subjective norms and perceived behavioral control at the same time according to the above analysis it is clear that farmers as micro subjects of agricultural production are influenced by factors such as the government the market and social organizations in their behavioral cognition therefore this paper integrates literature research and questionnaire research to introduce government regulation the market environment and social organizations to expand the tpb and further explore the logic and influence paths of farmers behavior the overall research framework of this paper is shown in fig 1 2 2 research hypotheses according to the literature there is a preliminary consensus that farmers as microentities of agricultural production are influenced by the government the market and social organizations in their behavioral perceptions in terms of government regulation the government adopts various regulatory instruments to regulate the market environment social organizations and farmers behavior to coordinate the relationship between economic development and environmental protection afsharipour et al 2021 li and zhou 2013 the government will punish violations of safe production practices based on the formulation of agricultural environmental laws and regulations and it will adopt incentives to subsidize green production behaviors liu et al 2022 farmers economic rationality will enhance their attitudes and subjective norms regarding green agricultural production after weighing the costs of violations liu and li 2020 the government will also enhance farmers environmental awareness and green development concepts through environmental education green farming training and other guidance measures this will enhance farmers perceived behavioral control of green production morrison 2006 vasstrom and normann 2019 leading to hypothesis h1 h1 government regulation has a positive effect on the market environment social organizations and farmers attitudes subjective norms and perceived behavioral control in terms of the market environment farmers as producers of agricultural products instinctively adjust their production decisions based on changes in the market prices of agricultural products and production factors as a way to increase productivity and maximize returns fiore et al 2017 montalvo 2008 farmers pay more attention to the price of agricultural products than the price of production factors ma and chang 2022 thus when the market value of green agricultural products increases it has a direct positive impact on farmers attitudes toward green production rajabion et al 2019 in the market farmers who compete with each other will take the initiative to learn from each other and enhance communication to prevent price differentials which affects farmers subjective norms tian et al 2022 zhao 2021 as farmers learn more about market demand and consumer purchasing preferences their knowledge and control over green production will gradually increase melovic et al 2020 leading to hypothesis h2 h2 the market environment has a positive impact on farmers attitudes subjective norms and perceived behavioral control in terms of social organizations farmers purchase and sell agricultural products through social organizations such as cooperatives and leading enterprises doing so can not only alleviate the degree of information asymmetry between consumers and producers but also reduce the production factor inputs and transaction costs in production cai et al 2016 hovelaque et al 2009 thus reducing farmers production costs and increasing their motivation and attitudes toward green production marcos matas et al 2013 in addition the members of the same agricultural social organization are mostly farmers in the same or adjacent villages farmers have strong imitation ability and conformity which is easy to form learning effect and affect the subjective norms of farmers merel et al 2015 pokharel and featherstone 2019 in production activities social organizations also regulate members production behavior and guide them to green production which helps farmers to enhance their control over green production qin and li 2011 wollni and fischer 2015 leading to hypothesis h3 h3 social organizations have a positive influence on farmers attitudes subjective norms and perceived behavioral control according to the tpb farmers intention to participate in agricultural nonpoint source pollution control will be affected by their attitudes subjective norms and perceived behavioral control in terms of attitudes previous studies have noted that positive environmental attitudes can often stimulate individuals positive environmental intentions feng and reisner 2011 pirani and secondi 2011 in terms of subjective norms with socioeconomic development agricultural nonpoint source pollution has been a focus of national and local governments through reward and punishment policy the government regulates the green production and living behavior of farmers has among farmers there is a strong copycat effect and conformity when their relatives friends after neighbors engage in agricultural nonpoint source pollution control which will enhance farmers governance intentions xu et al 2021b xue et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 in terms of perceived behavioral control farmers need to obtain information and invest certain funds and labor to carry out agricultural nonpoint source pollution control which is risky government subsidies training and guidance can alleviate the pressure on farmers chen and liu 2020 when farmers perceive that they have more resources and fewer obstacles the pressure on them will be lower their intention to act will be stronger and their control over their actions will also be stronger chen et al 2021b dong et al 2021 when farmers intention to manage is enhanced farmers will be more motivated to learn relevant knowledge and when farmers are more confident in their knowledge and ability to participate in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management it will directly influence their behavioral responses li et al 2021b lindstrom et al 2020 liu et al 2010 research has pointed out that farmers behavioral intentions have a significant mediating effect on the relationship between their cognition and behavioral responses and behavioral intentions are an important part of farmers action logic liu et al 2012 leading to hypotheses h4 and h5 h4 farmers attitudes subjective norms and perceived behavioral control have a significant effect on their intention to participate in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management h5 farmers perceived behavioral control and their intention to participate in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management have a significant effect on their behavioral response to management 2 3 study design and descriptive analysis 2 3 1 data sources and sample analysis huai an is located in the north central part of jiangsu province in the yangtze river delta region fig 2 it is the central city in northern jiangsu and the first city in the huaihe river ecological economic belt the agricultural economy is developing well however with the rapid development of the agricultural economy in huai an city the problem of agricultural nonpoint source pollution has become increasingly prominent according to the environmental situation bulletin of huai an city in 2021 the huai an area of hongze lake and gaoyou lake is in a state of eutrophication and the detection of the farmland recession section in huai an city shows that class v and inferior class v sections account for 10 7 additionally agricultural nonpoint source pollution factors such as chemical oxygen demand ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus exceed the standard in recent years in the treatment of agricultural nonpoint source pollution huai an city has actively responded to the call of national policies promulgated a number of policies actively promoted local markets social organizations and farmers to implement agricultural nonpoint source pollution control and implemented pollution control therefore huai an city has good representativeness to study agricultural nonpoint source pollution multisubject governance in 2020 the rural population of huai an in china totaled 1 5652 million of which huaiyin district and jinhu county were named as the first batch of counties and districts of agricultural product quality and safety in jiangsu province by the provincial department of agriculture and rural affairs the samples are representative therefore this paper selects gaojiayan town and sanshu town in huaiyin district and yintu town in jinhu county as the field study areas among them the town of gaojiayan has 19 administrative villages with a total area of 91 square kilometers and 5866 ha of agricultural acreage and the total number of farmers engaged in agricultural plantation related industries on the front line is 22 300 the town of sanshu has 15 administrative villages with a total area of 79 68 square kilometers and 4570 ha of agricultural acreage and the total number of farmers engaged in agricultural plantation related industries on the front line is 11 100 the town of yintu has 20 administrative villages with a total area of 133 07 square kilometers and 7000 ha of agricultural acreage and the total number of farmers engaged in agricultural plantation related industries on the front line is 11 600 according to the specific situation of farmers production in the sample town a number of sample villages are randomly selected and then a number of farmers are randomly selected as survey subjects in the sample villages selected to ensure the reasonableness of the questionnaire and the accuracy of data collection the researchers first conducted a prestudy in september 2021 distributing 100 questionnaires and collecting 85 copies after modifying and improving the questionnaire based on the results of the prestudy 600 questionnaires were distributed in the research area in january 2022 and 575 questionnaires were collected a total of 512 samples were acceptable for an effective response rate of 89 the surveyed samples cover different ages cultural levels economic statuses and degrees of agricultural nonpoint source pollution management which basically reflect the behavioral trends of farmers participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management the basic information of the 512 survey respondents is shown in fig 3 a total of 68 55 of the farmers surveyed were male and 31 45 were female in terms of the age structure the surveyed farmers were mainly above 40 years old 40 63 were above 50 years old and 30 08 were between 41 and 50 years old in terms of educational level junior high school and high school or junior college education accounted for 30 27 and 27 34 respectively the proportion of farmers whose agricultural income accounts for 20 30 of total income is 30 47 in terms of agricultural acreage the percentage of farmers with less than 0 2 hm 2 is 16 8 the proportion of farmers with 0 2 0 4 hm 2 is the highest at 44 14 the proportion of farmers with 0 4 0 6 hm 2 is 29 88 and the proportion of farmers with more than 0 6 hm 2 is 9 18 2 3 2 questionnaire design the variables in this paper were measured using a five point likert scale and farmers judged the statements in the questionnaire where 1 completely disagree 2 not quite agree 3 neither agree nor disagree 4 basically agree and 5 completely agree the observed variables were set and measured as shown in table 1 the table is divided into eight parts and each part contains three observation questions the first three parts reflect farmers perceptions of the external environment such as government regulation the market environment and social organizations it mainly examines whether the government provides technical guidance on pesticide and fertilizer application and implements incentives and penalties for production behavior whether fertilizer pesticide and agricultural product prices in the market affect farmers application of pesticides and fertilizers and whether the market trading environment affects the degree of farmers acceptance of the services provided by social organizations for the purchase of agricultural products the sale of agricultural products and technical guidance on green production the fourth fifth and sixth sections reflect the internal cognition of farmers attitudes subjective norms and perceived behavioral control they mainly examine the extent of farmers support for fertilizer and pesticide restrictions green production training and pollution payment the extent to which farmers production and living behaviors are influenced by family members neighbors and village committees and the extent to which farmers trust government training agricultural market development and their information capital and labor self confidence the seventh and eighth sections reflect the intention and actual action behavior of farmers to participate in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management they mainly examine the degree of farmers intention and action response to participate in the management of four agricultural nonpoint source pollution sources fertilizer and medicine application agricultural straw livestock and poultry manure and domestic waste 3 results 3 1 model selection and construction structural equation modeling originated from the disciplines of social psychology and econometrics and is now widely used as a mainstream linear modeling analysis technique in psychology economics and sociology in this paper multiple latent variables are used and there are corresponding causal relationships between each latent variable each latent variable contains multiple specific indicators structural equation modeling allows the independent and dependent variables to contain measurement errors can accurately confirm and detect complex path models and can simultaneously explore the relationships of multiple variables and predict and analyze the causal relationships between variables therefore this paper chooses an sem for this study based on the previous theoretical framework and research hypotheses this study adds three latent variables namely government regulation the market environment and social organizations to the traditional theoretical model of the tpb and constructs an sem based on the external environmental perception farmers internal cognition intention behavior logic a total of 8 latent variables and 24 observed variables were selected for the model which is shown in appendix a1 3 2 measurement model testing in this paper the measurement model was tested by validation factor analysis cfa to verify its reliability convergent validity and discriminant validity as can be seen in table 2 the cronbach s α and cr of the latent variables in this study were greater than 0 7 and the survey data had satisfactory reliability hair et al 2010 and the factor loading values of each observed question are all greater than 0 5 which indicates that the corresponding questions of each latent variable are highly representative in addition according to table 3 the ave values of all latent variables except government regulation and attitude are greater than 0 5 which indicates that the convergent validity is ideal although the ave values of government regulation and attitude are less than 0 5 they are both around 0 45 and the cr values of both are greater than 0 7 and the convergent validity of both is still sufficient according to the criteria proposed by tabachnick and fidell 2007 the results in table 3 show that all variables in this paper have good discriminant validity with ave square root values greater than the correlation coefficients with other variables fornell and larcker 1981 therefore the scales and data in this paper have sufficient reliability and validity in this paper the data from the field survey results are substituted into the model for fitting index calculation to test the overall fit of the structural equation as shown in table 4 the test values of absolutive relative and parsimony fit indices of the model all reach the fit range indicating that the structural equation model constructed in this paper has a good fit 3 3 model results analysis the parameters of the final model obtained by the correction were estimated the model standardized path coefficients are shown in appendix a 2 and the results of hypothesis testing among the variables of the model are shown in table 5 4 discussion through the analysis of the empirical results in this paper we found that the coefficient of the effect of government regulation on farmers subjective norms is negative and insignificant in the study area which is different from existing studies liu and li 2020 the reason for this phenomenon is that on the one hand china s agro environmental regulatory system is backward and the safety standards for agricultural product quality are not uniform on the other hand government incentives and penalties are not strong enough and although farmers attitudes toward green production have improved they still produce according to their own experience after weighing the pros and cons the implications for policy makers are first the chinese government should strengthen environmental regulation of agricultural production and establish uniform market access threshold standards for agricultural products and second the authorities should provide more specific and long term subsidy policies for farmers engaged in production activities to compensate farmers for the loss of private income caused by improving environmental quality and to provide a fundamental incentive for farmers to behave in an environmentally friendly manner in terms of market environment the effect of market environment on farmers subjective norms passed the significance test it indicates that in the market environment farmers as producers will change their production decisions accordingly according to the consumer demand for green agricultural products in order to obtain the maximum profit and the price changes of production factors in addition in the production market farmers as competitors of each other and facing the constraints of the market environment learn from each other and enhance communication to prevent price differentials thus strengthening farmers subjective norms geng et al 2017 also from the statistical results farmers perceptions of the market environment failed to effectively increase the motivation and perceived behavioral control of farmers attitudes towards participation in agricultural nonpoint pollution which is consistent with the findings of yu et al 2018 two reasons can explain this phenomenon on the one hand green production is characterized by high cost inputs and technical risks leading to uncertainty of farmers future returns zhu et al 2014 on the other hand in the process of selling green agricultural products consumers are at a disadvantage due to information asymmetry their inability to distinguish between the quality and safety of agricultural products and to understand the production process of agricultural products leads to the possibility of farmer opportunism the implication for policy makers is that uncertainty in agricultural markets leads to risk averse farmers tendency to use more fertilizers to ensure yields so authorities need to build consumer trust in green agricultural products at the market level expand market demand for green agricultural products and avoid the dilemma that consumers are afraid to consume and producers are afraid to produce chang et al 2019 the empirical results show that social organizations significantly and positively influence farmers attitudes and subjective norms compared with farmers own behavior of selling agricultural products and purchasing agricultural products social organization channels are not only convenient and objective but also can effectively reduce the degree of information asymmetry and transaction costs thus stimulating farmers green production behavior and increasing their motivation for green production and thus improve the subjective norms of farmers zheng and luo 2022 meanwhile we found that the effect of social organizations on the control of farmers perceptual behavior was not significant indicating that social organizations did not play a role in guiding farmers green production techniques liang and hendrikse 2016 pointed out that agricultural cooperatives should have good service functions that help to compensate for farmers deficiencies in access to agricultural technical services product marketing storage and logistics therefore authorities should strengthen the service management capacity of social organizations and enhance technical training to raise farmers awareness of green production and improve green production techniques the effects of farmers attitudes subjective norms and perceived behavioral control on farmers willingness to participate all passed the test the positive influence of farmers attitudes was the strongest which is consistent with the findings of scholars such as arvola et al 2008 who pointed out that attitudes are strong predictors of behavioral intentions indicating that farmers positive environmental attitudes are more likely to motivate their green production and living behaviors in addition the positive influence with subjective norms is smaller indicating that farmers willingness to adopt green production and living behaviors is less influenced by others suggesting that the exemplary role of party members and village cadres should be maximized to influence and motivate other villagers to strive to shape a good atmosphere of green production and living zheng and luo 2022 farmers perceived behavioral control also has a significant positive effect on farmers governance behavior and when farmers have more technology and information they have more control over their actions and are motivated to implement agricultural nonpoint source pollution management chen et al 2021 dong et al 2021 in addition farmers willingness to participate significantly influences farmers behavioral response to governance and the coefficient of influence is significantly larger than the path coefficient of the influence of perceived behavioral control on farmers willingness to participate indicating that farmers willingness to participate presents a mediating role as ajzen 1991 found that willingness is the most important predictor of one s behavior and the strength of farmers willingness to participate directly affects the degree of farmers behavioral response the policy implication is that the authorities should improve the emotional experience by holding green production training courses and other publicity measures to enrich the form of green participation of farmers enhance their confidence in the market sales prospect of green agricultural products improve their knowledge of green production and life and increase their own willingness to participate in agricultural nonpoint source pollution control 5 conclusions and recommendations this paper expands the traditional planned behavior tpb theory by adding potential variables such as government supervision market environment and social organization using the first hand structured questionnaire data and structural equation model of huai an farmers this paper comprehensively investigates the influencing mechanism of farmers cognition and the influencing factors of farmers participation in agricultural non point source pollution management from the perspective of multi agent governance there are the following findings first as the guide of the external environment farmers perceptions in terms of government regulation positively influence their perceptions in terms of the market environment and social organizations and the degree of influence on social organizations is stronger second the perception of the external environment will influence farmers cognition government regulation will positively influence farmers attitudes and perceived behavioral control the market environment will positively influence farmers subjective norms and social organizations will positively influence farmers attitudes and subjective norms third the influence of government regulation on farmers subjective regulation market environment on farmers attitude and perceived behavioral control and social organizations on farmers perceived behavioral control are not significant and the orderly synergy among multiple comanagement subjects of agricultural nonpoint source pollution is not fully realized fourth farmers perceived behavioral control and behavior intention positively influence their governance behaviors farmers attitudes have the strongest positive influence on behavior intention some policy suggestions can be drawn from the above conclusions first encourage leading agricultural enterprises agricultural cooperatives and large planters to build a multi body agricultural green production education and training system to improve farmers knowledge and cultivate new professional farmers secondly we make full use of the big data information platform adopt the online offline sales model expand the sales channels of high quality agricultural products improve the quality and safety information disclosure of agricultural products and encourage farmers to implement green production finally the boundaries of responsibilities of each governance body are clarified and through means such as governance performance assessment government funding and emissions trading the driving force of each body s participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management is enhanced and the efficiency of multiple co management is improved this study also has some limitations as well as some interesting future research directions due to the limitation of research ability the research sample only includes farmers in three towns in huai an therefore it is necessary to further expand the scope of research in the future to expand the global applicability of the results of this study in addition this study uses a single questionnaire data and statistical data in 2022 and the cross sectional data can t reflect the dynamic impact of policy environment changes on farmers participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution in the future we can consider exploring the subjective and objective factors that affect farmers participation in non point source pollution control in time series credit authorship

9011,due to high intensity agricultural production activities and the excessive use of chemical substances such as fertilizers and pesticides agricultural nonpoint source pollution has surpassed industrial and urban residential pollution to become the number one contributor to nonpoint source pollution in china promoting farmers participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management is a key link to achieve the goal of sustainable agricultural development based on an expanded theory of planned behavior we identified the key influencing factors of farmers participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management according to microsurvey data from 600 farmers in huai an china we used a structural equation model to analyze in depth the influence of farmers internal cognition and their perceptions of the external environment to explore the formation mechanism of their participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management behavior the study shows that first government regulations promote the green development of the agricultural market environment and social organizations and that farmers perceptions of the external environment strengthen the influence of their internal cognition but are not fully significant second farmers internal cognition can enhance their willingness to participate and the influence of attitudes is the strongest finally there is a positive relationship between the level of response of farmers participation in pollution control behavior and their perceived behavioral control and willingness to control based on the above analysis we propose policy recommendations in terms of government regulation market regulation organization construction and multisubject collaboration to mobilize the enthusiasm of various subjects and to improve the efficiency of agricultural nonpoint source pollution management keywords agricultural pollution polycentric governance behavior study farmers perception external environment data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction as a largely agricultural country china s agriculture is the foundation of national economic development at this stage china s population exceeds 1 4 billion ranking first in the world population growth has driven the rapid expansion of china s agricultural scale and with the rapid development of the agricultural economy the quantity and quality of china s agricultural products have been greatly improved at the same time agricultural production activities aimed at pursuing high yields and profits have led to the increasingly serious problem of agricultural nonpoint source pollution babin et al 2016 li et al 2022 agricultural nonpoint source pollution mainly refers to the pollution caused by applied fertilizers and pesticides agricultural straw livestock and poultry manure and domestic waste and other pollutants generated in agricultural production and life which enter water bodies through surface runoff or underground seepage processes zou et al 2020 agricultural nonpoint source pollution has now become an important source of pollution in water bodies and is an important reason for the decline in the quality of the agricultural production environment niu et al 2022 wang et al 2004 it has been confirmed that agricultural nonpoint source pollution is an important factor limiting the quality growth of the agricultural economy the reason is that agricultural nonpoint source pollution makes agricultural resources scarce causing a tragedy of the commons and seriously threatening the sustainable development of the agricultural economy stavi and lal 2013 furthermore agricultural nonpoint source pollution exacerbates soil and water pollution threatening the quality and safety of agricultural products and affecting people s health liu et al 2021 therefore the prevention and control of agricultural nonpoint source pollution are an inevitable requirement for promoting high quality agricultural development bai and sun 2022 wang et al 2004 however because agricultural nonpoint source pollution is characterized by fragmentation uncertainty and lag it is difficult to manage and regulate and the governance process is prone to fail if we rely solely on the government or the market for governance li et al 2022 lu and xie 2018a agricultural nonpoint source pollution involves many stakeholders and has a strong public attribute for the governance of public affairs ostrom et al 1999 put forward the polycentric governance theory based on long term empirical social investigation advocating the establishment of hierarchical hierarchical and phased diversity institutions to strengthen the collaborative governance among government market and society this theory overcomes the deficiency of relying solely on the government or the market restrains individual opportunism in collective behavior and realizes the sustainable development of public interest in the development of china s agricultural economy the agricultural environment is influenced in various ways by the government markets social organizations and farmers ao et al 2020 chen et al 2021a to promote the collaborative management of agricultural nonpoint source pollution by various actors the chinese government has proposed to build an environmental governance system involving the government the market society and the public requiring all actors to share responsibility for agricultural nonpoint source pollution management ao et al 2020 xi et al 2015 from the perspective of multisubject cogovernance government policy intervention changes in the market environment and guidance from social organizations can have an impact on farmers behaviors han et al 2022 kyeyamwa et al 2008 lane et al 2018 li et al 2013 in the multisubject cogovernance of agricultural nonpoint source pollution farmers as microscopic subjects of agricultural production and life are the main source of agricultural nonpoint source pollution and play a crucial role as one of the most important objects in the process of policy implementation tian et al 2018 it is important to explore the formation mechanism of their participation in governance behavior to control agricultural nonpoint source pollution and improve the agricultural production environment reviewing existing studies most scholars use the theory of planned behavior tpb to analyze the behavior of farmers based on the perspective of farmers according to the influence path of cognition intention behavior mahdavi 2021 maleksaeidi and keshavarz 2019 in which behavioral intentions are mainly influenced by the cognitive aspects of attitudes subjective norms and perceived behavioral control with individuals behavioral intentions directly influencing their behavioral responses shen et al 2020 sok et al 2021 since traditional linear regression models cannot handle complex path relationships with more than one dependent variable and joint cubic models cannot handle some latent variables that are not directly measurable e g intelligence motivation to learn intention a structural equation model sem can handle multiple latent variables and their indicators simultaneously and explore the causal relationships between the latent variables lanza castillo et al 2021 mahdavi 2021 moghadam et al 2020 savari et al 2021 researchers have used sems to study farmers intentions to engage in agri food safety practices li et al 2021a green production intentions aregay et al 2018 bayard and jolly 2007 cropland quality conservation behaviors bondori et al 2021 and pesticide use to reduce production risks wang et al 2018 these studies have found that attitudes subjective norms and perceived behavioral control were the main factors influencing farmers green production intentions and behaviors and all had a driving effect senger et al 2017 su et al 2021 1 1 objectives although there has been a great deal of scholarly research on the green production behavior of farmers there are several limitations that impede our understanding of farmers participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management behavior 1 most existing studies focus on only a certain dimension of farmers green production behavior few studies have exhaustively analyzed the behavioral responses of farmers participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management from the sources of agricultural nonpoint source pollution such as fertilizer application agricultural straw animal manure and domestic waste 2 most of the literature is based on the traditional tpb which analyzes the logic of farmers behavior under the cognition intention behavior path a comprehensive examination of the mechanism of the influence of the external environment such as the government the market and social organizations on farmers cognition from the perspective of multisubject governance is lacking 3 in the literature the analysis of multisubject governance of the ecological environment is mostly focused on the theoretical level few papers have conducted field research on the perception of governance by the government the market and social organizations from the farmer s perspective to fill the research gap in farmers participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management behavior the research objectives of this paper are using the field survey questionnaire data in huai an china and the structural equation model to analyze the influence of farmers perceptions of government regulation the market environment social organizations and farmers perceptions in the context of multisubject cogovernance and to investigate the formation mechanism of farmers participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management there are three main innovations in this paper 1 in terms of research objects this paper includes the green behavior of farmers related to agricultural production life and ecology within the scope of field research and analyzes in detail the behavioral responses of farmers participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management from multiple perspectives from the sources of agricultural nonpoint source pollution 2 the research method this paper combines polycentric governance theory and extends the traditional tpb by adding three latent variables government regulation market environment and social organization and examines the factors influencing farmers participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management behavior from multiple perspectives based on the logic of external environmental perception farmers internal cognition intention behavior 3 regarding the data sources based on the polycentric governance theory from the farmer perspective this paper uses primary data from farmers to investigate the perceptions of the government the market and social organizations in the field to complete traditional research on the multisubject comanagement of the ecological environment 2 material and methods 2 1 theoretical analysis according to the social psychology paradigm theories that explore the relationship between human psychology and behavior patterns include the theory of reasoned action tra and the tpb the tpb is an important theory that was proposed by ajzen 1991 and others based on the tra and that is applied in behavioral science research it is extremely influential as a behavioral prediction theory and has been widely used by scholars to study farmers behavioral motives and intentions the tpb argues that the most direct factor influencing individuals behavior is behavioral intentions which can be influenced by three cognitive dimensions attitudes subjective norms and perceived behavioral control at the same time according to the above analysis it is clear that farmers as micro subjects of agricultural production are influenced by factors such as the government the market and social organizations in their behavioral cognition therefore this paper integrates literature research and questionnaire research to introduce government regulation the market environment and social organizations to expand the tpb and further explore the logic and influence paths of farmers behavior the overall research framework of this paper is shown in fig 1 2 2 research hypotheses according to the literature there is a preliminary consensus that farmers as microentities of agricultural production are influenced by the government the market and social organizations in their behavioral perceptions in terms of government regulation the government adopts various regulatory instruments to regulate the market environment social organizations and farmers behavior to coordinate the relationship between economic development and environmental protection afsharipour et al 2021 li and zhou 2013 the government will punish violations of safe production practices based on the formulation of agricultural environmental laws and regulations and it will adopt incentives to subsidize green production behaviors liu et al 2022 farmers economic rationality will enhance their attitudes and subjective norms regarding green agricultural production after weighing the costs of violations liu and li 2020 the government will also enhance farmers environmental awareness and green development concepts through environmental education green farming training and other guidance measures this will enhance farmers perceived behavioral control of green production morrison 2006 vasstrom and normann 2019 leading to hypothesis h1 h1 government regulation has a positive effect on the market environment social organizations and farmers attitudes subjective norms and perceived behavioral control in terms of the market environment farmers as producers of agricultural products instinctively adjust their production decisions based on changes in the market prices of agricultural products and production factors as a way to increase productivity and maximize returns fiore et al 2017 montalvo 2008 farmers pay more attention to the price of agricultural products than the price of production factors ma and chang 2022 thus when the market value of green agricultural products increases it has a direct positive impact on farmers attitudes toward green production rajabion et al 2019 in the market farmers who compete with each other will take the initiative to learn from each other and enhance communication to prevent price differentials which affects farmers subjective norms tian et al 2022 zhao 2021 as farmers learn more about market demand and consumer purchasing preferences their knowledge and control over green production will gradually increase melovic et al 2020 leading to hypothesis h2 h2 the market environment has a positive impact on farmers attitudes subjective norms and perceived behavioral control in terms of social organizations farmers purchase and sell agricultural products through social organizations such as cooperatives and leading enterprises doing so can not only alleviate the degree of information asymmetry between consumers and producers but also reduce the production factor inputs and transaction costs in production cai et al 2016 hovelaque et al 2009 thus reducing farmers production costs and increasing their motivation and attitudes toward green production marcos matas et al 2013 in addition the members of the same agricultural social organization are mostly farmers in the same or adjacent villages farmers have strong imitation ability and conformity which is easy to form learning effect and affect the subjective norms of farmers merel et al 2015 pokharel and featherstone 2019 in production activities social organizations also regulate members production behavior and guide them to green production which helps farmers to enhance their control over green production qin and li 2011 wollni and fischer 2015 leading to hypothesis h3 h3 social organizations have a positive influence on farmers attitudes subjective norms and perceived behavioral control according to the tpb farmers intention to participate in agricultural nonpoint source pollution control will be affected by their attitudes subjective norms and perceived behavioral control in terms of attitudes previous studies have noted that positive environmental attitudes can often stimulate individuals positive environmental intentions feng and reisner 2011 pirani and secondi 2011 in terms of subjective norms with socioeconomic development agricultural nonpoint source pollution has been a focus of national and local governments through reward and punishment policy the government regulates the green production and living behavior of farmers has among farmers there is a strong copycat effect and conformity when their relatives friends after neighbors engage in agricultural nonpoint source pollution control which will enhance farmers governance intentions xu et al 2021b xue et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 in terms of perceived behavioral control farmers need to obtain information and invest certain funds and labor to carry out agricultural nonpoint source pollution control which is risky government subsidies training and guidance can alleviate the pressure on farmers chen and liu 2020 when farmers perceive that they have more resources and fewer obstacles the pressure on them will be lower their intention to act will be stronger and their control over their actions will also be stronger chen et al 2021b dong et al 2021 when farmers intention to manage is enhanced farmers will be more motivated to learn relevant knowledge and when farmers are more confident in their knowledge and ability to participate in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management it will directly influence their behavioral responses li et al 2021b lindstrom et al 2020 liu et al 2010 research has pointed out that farmers behavioral intentions have a significant mediating effect on the relationship between their cognition and behavioral responses and behavioral intentions are an important part of farmers action logic liu et al 2012 leading to hypotheses h4 and h5 h4 farmers attitudes subjective norms and perceived behavioral control have a significant effect on their intention to participate in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management h5 farmers perceived behavioral control and their intention to participate in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management have a significant effect on their behavioral response to management 2 3 study design and descriptive analysis 2 3 1 data sources and sample analysis huai an is located in the north central part of jiangsu province in the yangtze river delta region fig 2 it is the central city in northern jiangsu and the first city in the huaihe river ecological economic belt the agricultural economy is developing well however with the rapid development of the agricultural economy in huai an city the problem of agricultural nonpoint source pollution has become increasingly prominent according to the environmental situation bulletin of huai an city in 2021 the huai an area of hongze lake and gaoyou lake is in a state of eutrophication and the detection of the farmland recession section in huai an city shows that class v and inferior class v sections account for 10 7 additionally agricultural nonpoint source pollution factors such as chemical oxygen demand ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus exceed the standard in recent years in the treatment of agricultural nonpoint source pollution huai an city has actively responded to the call of national policies promulgated a number of policies actively promoted local markets social organizations and farmers to implement agricultural nonpoint source pollution control and implemented pollution control therefore huai an city has good representativeness to study agricultural nonpoint source pollution multisubject governance in 2020 the rural population of huai an in china totaled 1 5652 million of which huaiyin district and jinhu county were named as the first batch of counties and districts of agricultural product quality and safety in jiangsu province by the provincial department of agriculture and rural affairs the samples are representative therefore this paper selects gaojiayan town and sanshu town in huaiyin district and yintu town in jinhu county as the field study areas among them the town of gaojiayan has 19 administrative villages with a total area of 91 square kilometers and 5866 ha of agricultural acreage and the total number of farmers engaged in agricultural plantation related industries on the front line is 22 300 the town of sanshu has 15 administrative villages with a total area of 79 68 square kilometers and 4570 ha of agricultural acreage and the total number of farmers engaged in agricultural plantation related industries on the front line is 11 100 the town of yintu has 20 administrative villages with a total area of 133 07 square kilometers and 7000 ha of agricultural acreage and the total number of farmers engaged in agricultural plantation related industries on the front line is 11 600 according to the specific situation of farmers production in the sample town a number of sample villages are randomly selected and then a number of farmers are randomly selected as survey subjects in the sample villages selected to ensure the reasonableness of the questionnaire and the accuracy of data collection the researchers first conducted a prestudy in september 2021 distributing 100 questionnaires and collecting 85 copies after modifying and improving the questionnaire based on the results of the prestudy 600 questionnaires were distributed in the research area in january 2022 and 575 questionnaires were collected a total of 512 samples were acceptable for an effective response rate of 89 the surveyed samples cover different ages cultural levels economic statuses and degrees of agricultural nonpoint source pollution management which basically reflect the behavioral trends of farmers participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management the basic information of the 512 survey respondents is shown in fig 3 a total of 68 55 of the farmers surveyed were male and 31 45 were female in terms of the age structure the surveyed farmers were mainly above 40 years old 40 63 were above 50 years old and 30 08 were between 41 and 50 years old in terms of educational level junior high school and high school or junior college education accounted for 30 27 and 27 34 respectively the proportion of farmers whose agricultural income accounts for 20 30 of total income is 30 47 in terms of agricultural acreage the percentage of farmers with less than 0 2 hm 2 is 16 8 the proportion of farmers with 0 2 0 4 hm 2 is the highest at 44 14 the proportion of farmers with 0 4 0 6 hm 2 is 29 88 and the proportion of farmers with more than 0 6 hm 2 is 9 18 2 3 2 questionnaire design the variables in this paper were measured using a five point likert scale and farmers judged the statements in the questionnaire where 1 completely disagree 2 not quite agree 3 neither agree nor disagree 4 basically agree and 5 completely agree the observed variables were set and measured as shown in table 1 the table is divided into eight parts and each part contains three observation questions the first three parts reflect farmers perceptions of the external environment such as government regulation the market environment and social organizations it mainly examines whether the government provides technical guidance on pesticide and fertilizer application and implements incentives and penalties for production behavior whether fertilizer pesticide and agricultural product prices in the market affect farmers application of pesticides and fertilizers and whether the market trading environment affects the degree of farmers acceptance of the services provided by social organizations for the purchase of agricultural products the sale of agricultural products and technical guidance on green production the fourth fifth and sixth sections reflect the internal cognition of farmers attitudes subjective norms and perceived behavioral control they mainly examine the extent of farmers support for fertilizer and pesticide restrictions green production training and pollution payment the extent to which farmers production and living behaviors are influenced by family members neighbors and village committees and the extent to which farmers trust government training agricultural market development and their information capital and labor self confidence the seventh and eighth sections reflect the intention and actual action behavior of farmers to participate in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management they mainly examine the degree of farmers intention and action response to participate in the management of four agricultural nonpoint source pollution sources fertilizer and medicine application agricultural straw livestock and poultry manure and domestic waste 3 results 3 1 model selection and construction structural equation modeling originated from the disciplines of social psychology and econometrics and is now widely used as a mainstream linear modeling analysis technique in psychology economics and sociology in this paper multiple latent variables are used and there are corresponding causal relationships between each latent variable each latent variable contains multiple specific indicators structural equation modeling allows the independent and dependent variables to contain measurement errors can accurately confirm and detect complex path models and can simultaneously explore the relationships of multiple variables and predict and analyze the causal relationships between variables therefore this paper chooses an sem for this study based on the previous theoretical framework and research hypotheses this study adds three latent variables namely government regulation the market environment and social organizations to the traditional theoretical model of the tpb and constructs an sem based on the external environmental perception farmers internal cognition intention behavior logic a total of 8 latent variables and 24 observed variables were selected for the model which is shown in appendix a1 3 2 measurement model testing in this paper the measurement model was tested by validation factor analysis cfa to verify its reliability convergent validity and discriminant validity as can be seen in table 2 the cronbach s α and cr of the latent variables in this study were greater than 0 7 and the survey data had satisfactory reliability hair et al 2010 and the factor loading values of each observed question are all greater than 0 5 which indicates that the corresponding questions of each latent variable are highly representative in addition according to table 3 the ave values of all latent variables except government regulation and attitude are greater than 0 5 which indicates that the convergent validity is ideal although the ave values of government regulation and attitude are less than 0 5 they are both around 0 45 and the cr values of both are greater than 0 7 and the convergent validity of both is still sufficient according to the criteria proposed by tabachnick and fidell 2007 the results in table 3 show that all variables in this paper have good discriminant validity with ave square root values greater than the correlation coefficients with other variables fornell and larcker 1981 therefore the scales and data in this paper have sufficient reliability and validity in this paper the data from the field survey results are substituted into the model for fitting index calculation to test the overall fit of the structural equation as shown in table 4 the test values of absolutive relative and parsimony fit indices of the model all reach the fit range indicating that the structural equation model constructed in this paper has a good fit 3 3 model results analysis the parameters of the final model obtained by the correction were estimated the model standardized path coefficients are shown in appendix a 2 and the results of hypothesis testing among the variables of the model are shown in table 5 4 discussion through the analysis of the empirical results in this paper we found that the coefficient of the effect of government regulation on farmers subjective norms is negative and insignificant in the study area which is different from existing studies liu and li 2020 the reason for this phenomenon is that on the one hand china s agro environmental regulatory system is backward and the safety standards for agricultural product quality are not uniform on the other hand government incentives and penalties are not strong enough and although farmers attitudes toward green production have improved they still produce according to their own experience after weighing the pros and cons the implications for policy makers are first the chinese government should strengthen environmental regulation of agricultural production and establish uniform market access threshold standards for agricultural products and second the authorities should provide more specific and long term subsidy policies for farmers engaged in production activities to compensate farmers for the loss of private income caused by improving environmental quality and to provide a fundamental incentive for farmers to behave in an environmentally friendly manner in terms of market environment the effect of market environment on farmers subjective norms passed the significance test it indicates that in the market environment farmers as producers will change their production decisions accordingly according to the consumer demand for green agricultural products in order to obtain the maximum profit and the price changes of production factors in addition in the production market farmers as competitors of each other and facing the constraints of the market environment learn from each other and enhance communication to prevent price differentials thus strengthening farmers subjective norms geng et al 2017 also from the statistical results farmers perceptions of the market environment failed to effectively increase the motivation and perceived behavioral control of farmers attitudes towards participation in agricultural nonpoint pollution which is consistent with the findings of yu et al 2018 two reasons can explain this phenomenon on the one hand green production is characterized by high cost inputs and technical risks leading to uncertainty of farmers future returns zhu et al 2014 on the other hand in the process of selling green agricultural products consumers are at a disadvantage due to information asymmetry their inability to distinguish between the quality and safety of agricultural products and to understand the production process of agricultural products leads to the possibility of farmer opportunism the implication for policy makers is that uncertainty in agricultural markets leads to risk averse farmers tendency to use more fertilizers to ensure yields so authorities need to build consumer trust in green agricultural products at the market level expand market demand for green agricultural products and avoid the dilemma that consumers are afraid to consume and producers are afraid to produce chang et al 2019 the empirical results show that social organizations significantly and positively influence farmers attitudes and subjective norms compared with farmers own behavior of selling agricultural products and purchasing agricultural products social organization channels are not only convenient and objective but also can effectively reduce the degree of information asymmetry and transaction costs thus stimulating farmers green production behavior and increasing their motivation for green production and thus improve the subjective norms of farmers zheng and luo 2022 meanwhile we found that the effect of social organizations on the control of farmers perceptual behavior was not significant indicating that social organizations did not play a role in guiding farmers green production techniques liang and hendrikse 2016 pointed out that agricultural cooperatives should have good service functions that help to compensate for farmers deficiencies in access to agricultural technical services product marketing storage and logistics therefore authorities should strengthen the service management capacity of social organizations and enhance technical training to raise farmers awareness of green production and improve green production techniques the effects of farmers attitudes subjective norms and perceived behavioral control on farmers willingness to participate all passed the test the positive influence of farmers attitudes was the strongest which is consistent with the findings of scholars such as arvola et al 2008 who pointed out that attitudes are strong predictors of behavioral intentions indicating that farmers positive environmental attitudes are more likely to motivate their green production and living behaviors in addition the positive influence with subjective norms is smaller indicating that farmers willingness to adopt green production and living behaviors is less influenced by others suggesting that the exemplary role of party members and village cadres should be maximized to influence and motivate other villagers to strive to shape a good atmosphere of green production and living zheng and luo 2022 farmers perceived behavioral control also has a significant positive effect on farmers governance behavior and when farmers have more technology and information they have more control over their actions and are motivated to implement agricultural nonpoint source pollution management chen et al 2021 dong et al 2021 in addition farmers willingness to participate significantly influences farmers behavioral response to governance and the coefficient of influence is significantly larger than the path coefficient of the influence of perceived behavioral control on farmers willingness to participate indicating that farmers willingness to participate presents a mediating role as ajzen 1991 found that willingness is the most important predictor of one s behavior and the strength of farmers willingness to participate directly affects the degree of farmers behavioral response the policy implication is that the authorities should improve the emotional experience by holding green production training courses and other publicity measures to enrich the form of green participation of farmers enhance their confidence in the market sales prospect of green agricultural products improve their knowledge of green production and life and increase their own willingness to participate in agricultural nonpoint source pollution control 5 conclusions and recommendations this paper expands the traditional planned behavior tpb theory by adding potential variables such as government supervision market environment and social organization using the first hand structured questionnaire data and structural equation model of huai an farmers this paper comprehensively investigates the influencing mechanism of farmers cognition and the influencing factors of farmers participation in agricultural non point source pollution management from the perspective of multi agent governance there are the following findings first as the guide of the external environment farmers perceptions in terms of government regulation positively influence their perceptions in terms of the market environment and social organizations and the degree of influence on social organizations is stronger second the perception of the external environment will influence farmers cognition government regulation will positively influence farmers attitudes and perceived behavioral control the market environment will positively influence farmers subjective norms and social organizations will positively influence farmers attitudes and subjective norms third the influence of government regulation on farmers subjective regulation market environment on farmers attitude and perceived behavioral control and social organizations on farmers perceived behavioral control are not significant and the orderly synergy among multiple comanagement subjects of agricultural nonpoint source pollution is not fully realized fourth farmers perceived behavioral control and behavior intention positively influence their governance behaviors farmers attitudes have the strongest positive influence on behavior intention some policy suggestions can be drawn from the above conclusions first encourage leading agricultural enterprises agricultural cooperatives and large planters to build a multi body agricultural green production education and training system to improve farmers knowledge and cultivate new professional farmers secondly we make full use of the big data information platform adopt the online offline sales model expand the sales channels of high quality agricultural products improve the quality and safety information disclosure of agricultural products and encourage farmers to implement green production finally the boundaries of responsibilities of each governance body are clarified and through means such as governance performance assessment government funding and emissions trading the driving force of each body s participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution management is enhanced and the efficiency of multiple co management is improved this study also has some limitations as well as some interesting future research directions due to the limitation of research ability the research sample only includes farmers in three towns in huai an therefore it is necessary to further expand the scope of research in the future to expand the global applicability of the results of this study in addition this study uses a single questionnaire data and statistical data in 2022 and the cross sectional data can t reflect the dynamic impact of policy environment changes on farmers participation in agricultural nonpoint source pollution in the future we can consider exploring the subjective and objective factors that affect farmers participation in non point source pollution control in time series credit authorship

9012,it was necessary and challenging to utilize the saline alkali land in coastal region for agricultural development to desalinate salty lands for potential crop cultivation a two year field experiment with an optimized tillage under a drip irrigation with five levels of salty water ecw 0 7 3 2 4 7 6 2 7 8 ds m 1 respectively was conducted in the bohai rim region china results showed that following an enhanced leaching the soil moisture content with each treatment increased significantly throughout the whole soil profile while soil salinity within the main root zone dropped by 52 5 3 8 with no obvious differences among treatments throughout the regular leaching irrigation period the soil matric potential smp was often below the threshold of 5 kpa during the primary water consumption stage of tomato plants and the salt leaching efficiency was lower than that during the enhanced leaching period and the salt leaching rate within the main root zone decreased linearly as the ecw increased final measurements at the end of the experiment the soil salinity and the sodium adsorption ratio of the main root zone declined by 87 1 94 7 and 58 4 63 7 respectively while the reduction rate of soil cations ranged from 98 8 to 89 5 following the order of mg2 ca2 k na indicating that leached saline soil around root zones were suitable for tomato cultivation thus we recommend that 1 a larger irrigation quota be applied e g 10 mm watering or a rigid irrigation program be scheduled according to smp with no limit on daily maximum irrigation times 2 two irrigation modes and a three

soil salt leaching bohai rim region data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction lack of fresh water has limited the acreage of agricultural lands and crop yields in many countries worldwide rational utilization of mild saline water to replace fresh one in the regions where salty water is available for agricultural use has been a common goal however many studies have found that saline water might have been a solution to wet the farm lands due to unavailability of water source but could be prone for salt accumulations and the secondary soil salinization in dry semi dry or semi humid regions feng et al 2015 huang et al 2011 kitamura et al 2006 li et al 2022 wang et al 2022 unlike arable farm lands high sodium contents of saline soils in coastal regions can be reduced by a proper irrigation with less salty water for reclamation of saline lands li et al 2015 li et al 2018a guo and liu 2015 2020 zhang et al 2019 moreover there have been several studies and reports in china on various types of soil salinity managements concluding that reclamation of saline lands and crop productions could be synchronized through choosing an appropriate irrigation system an optimized watering program and suitable crops dong et al 2022 li et al 2018a li and kang 2020 sun et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 saline soil is widely distributed along the mainland coast of china covering about 10 000 km2 yu and chen 1999 among which the mildly and lightly salinized alkali lands have been fully utilized for cultivation of some salt tolerant grains cotton and oil crops while the heavily salinized ones are still deserted without being effectively exploited due to the magnitude of challenges encountered even though many researchers have attempted to build up a vegetation and to develop coastal salty lands for agricultural uses in the absence of fresh water guo et al 2015 2020 solved a problem of soil drought and salt buildup in spring by mulching the soil surface with a layer of frozen saline irrigation water during winter and then using the summer precipitation as fresh water to grow salt tolerant plants in the areas where saline water was available li et al 2015 li 2018a and zhang et al 2019 used a filtration layer of sands and gravels to separate the top arable and bottom original soils followed by a high frequency drip irrigation with the electricity conductivity of irrigation water ecw at 0 8 7 8 ds m 1 to grow herbaceous and flowering plants they found that soil salinity and the sodium adsorption ratio sar decreased rapidly and significantly that simultaneous soil desalination and plant growth were achievable and realistic and that the 0 120 cm soil layer above the sand gravel layer had changed from extremely heavy salty soil to slightly or unsalted one in two years in order to reduce the cost and time duration in saline alkali soil reclamation for agricultural uses and to seek for an ideal and proper irrigation system with saline water feng et al 2022 attempted the possibility of growing tomato in the coastal silt saline land through setting up underneath desalinating pipes and a high frequent drip irrigation system with salinized water ecw values ranging from 0 8 to 7 8 ds m 1 the results indicated that when the water ecw was kept below 3 9 ds m 1 and the soil matrix potential smp maintained above 5 kpa in the soil 20 cm beneath the emitters for a short period of enhanced leaching irrigation the general soil salinity was reduced greatly and high quality tomatoes grown successfully however the dynamic distribution characteristics of soil water salt and cations in association with different soil profiles during the whole process of the experiment under the high frequent drip irrigation were not fully reported those three aspects of the entire desalination process are very important to understand how this drip saline water irrigated system works and its functional and practical mechanism would shade some profound and meaningful lights on the effective desalination of deserted saline lands alone the coastal regions in china therefore this study was aiming at 1 desalination of coastal saline lands for agricultural uses through a pipe ridge drip irrigation system 2 determination and optimization of a watering program for growing tomatoes with mild salinized water available in the bohai rim region brr and 3 revelation of distributions and dynamics of salty water and deposited salts within various soil profiles alone with their underline impact on tomato roots and soil salt cations this study helps to make better use of saline water to obtain higher tomato yield in the brr 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was conducted at the international eco city of caofeidian district 39 20 n 118 54 e in the northwest of bohai gulf china from 2015 to 2016 where is under the influence of a typical semi humid monsoon climate with an annual precipitation of approximately 554 9 mm mostly during june to september the annual average temperature is 11 4 and the soil profile down to a 100 cm deep soil was made of silt 80 31 1 67 sand 19 05 1 50 and clay 0 64 0 19 a typical deserted coastal silt salt affected land according to the united states department of agriculture standards of soil texture classes with some sporadic suaeda suaeda glauca bge plants as the landscaping vegetation the mean electricity conductivity of the soil salinity ece sodium adsorption ratio sar and ph of the saturated paste phe of the 0

accounted for 11 5 the soil bulk density of initial saline soil was 1 60 g cm3 2 2 experimental design and field setup irrigation water at five salinized levels with the ecw value at 0 7 3 2 4 7 6 2 and 7 8 ds m was designated as t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 respectively they were obtained by mixing fresh well water 0 7 ds m and highly saline shallow groundwater 70 ds m accordingly ionic composition of each irrigation water treatment was shown in table 1 each treatment consisted of 3 replications and 15 plots in total in a design of a completely randomized block to reduce soil bulk density make the soil more homogeneous and provide an efficient way for discharging leached salts the top soil was removed to a depth of 60 cm the corrugated discharging pipes in 63 mm diameter were laid on the bottom of 4 8 m 4 8 m plots with a 2 4 m line spacing and then refilled with the unearthed soil prior to the experiment each plot consisted of 6 ridges 80 cm apart each ridge was 480 cm long 20 cm high 20 cm wide on top and 20 cm wide on furrow bottom sixteen tomato seedlings with 30 40 day old were transplanted in the center of each ridge at a spacing of 30 cm both in june 8 2015 and may 24 2016 respectively the planting layout drip tubes setting and location of the tensiometer were shown in fig 1 2 3 drip watering schedule irrigation procedures were described in detail by feng et al 2022 a gravity dependent dripping system at a low running pressure 0 45 m was adopted drip tubes with 30 cm apart emitters were placed in the center of ridge 3 cm away from the planted seedlings a two stage watering schedule was carried out throughout the experiment during the stage ι enhanced leaching period the watering started right after tomato seedlings being transplanted until the field scout ec of the top 10 cm thick soil on the ridge dropped below 3 ds m 1 the watering system was set up to turn off or on again whenever a water pool or runoff was detected or disappeared on the soil surface the irrigation duration and depth in 2015 and 2016 were 3 and 5 days 32 and 54 mm respectively in the stage ⅱ regular leaching irrigation period all treatments had received a 6 mm deep irrigation water at a maximum irrigation frequency of once a day until smp values fell below 5 kpa taking the daily maximum evapotranspiration of field tomato 5 6 mm d 1 into consideration according to fao recommendations https www fao org land water databases and software crop information tomato en during the stage ⅱ the watering durations in 2015 and 2016 was 93 and 108 days and a high watering frequency for treatments t1 to t5 in 2015 was once every 1 6 1 6 2 1 1 7 and 2 2 days and in 2016 were once every 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 9 and 1 6 days respectively 2 4 fertilization scheme the same amount of fertilizer accounting for about 80 of the total usage by local farmers in regular soils was applied for each treatment the daily amount of fertilizers was determined through dividing the total quantity for fertilizers by 100 days supposedly needed for the whole tomato growing season after transplanting the fertilizer was mixed with irrigation water according to its watering schedule the yearly amounts of pure n p and k were 173 3 23 0 and 28 9 kg ha 1 in 2015 but were 202 2 26 8 and 33 7 kg ha 1 in 2016 respectively since the growing period in 2016 was 15 days longer than that in 2015 2 5 measurements the average daily precipitation and other meteorological data were available with the automatic weather station near the trial site the rainfall during the entire tomato growing season in 2015 and 2016 were 284 6 and 456 4 mm respectively fig 2 the smp values monitored by tensiometers that were installed at 20 cm deep soil with all five treatments were recorded twice a day at 8 00 and 16 00 with the smp threshold set at 5 kpa to turn on the irrigation system fig 3 the soil samples were taken at 0 10 20 30 and 40 cm from the emitters perpendicular to the drip lines and at an interval of 10 cm to a depth of 100 cm from each plot once before planting and in 5 11 17 26 40 60 79 and 95 day after planting dap in 2015 respectively and plus once more at the end of growing season in 2016 all soil samples were divided into two parts one was dried at 105 in the oven to a constant weight and another portion was air dried first and then passed through a 1 mm sieve and saturated using the method proposed by rhoades et al 1999 measurements of ece and soluble salt cations were based on extracts of saturated soil obtained by centrifugation 3180 g 30 min the ece value

golden software inc golden co usa 3 results 3 1 distribution of tomato roots as shown in fig 4 the maximum root depth with all t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments were about 50 60 cm in both years the root distribution in the furrow side was less about 7 in average over the both years and shallower than that in the ridge side compared with the data collected in 2015 a higher total root dry matter from the ridge center to the furrow center at a depth of 60 cm with a smaller proportion of roots distributed in the ridge side in 2016 in the ridge side of five treatments the root dry mass within 0 30 cm deep soil accounted for 97 5 92 5 98 9 99 4 and 97 9 of the total root dry mass in 2015 respectively the root dry mass within 0 30 cm deep soil accounted for 99 5 89 1 98 9 98 5 and 99 9 of the root dry mass in the ridge side of soil profile in 2016 the tomato root dry mass in the ridge side accounted for 82 0 82 6 88 3 94 6 and 95 0 of the total root dry mass respectively the root dry mass within the 0 30 cm deep soil in the ridge side accounted for 92 9 91 6 91 7 93 0 and 98 2 of the root dry mass in the ridge side of soil profile fig 4 as the ecw increased each year the dry matter of roots resulted in a trend of the increase first and then of the decline subsequently the maximum biomass was mainly obtained in t2 and the minimum ones in t5 the dry matter of the roots increased when ecw 4 7 ds m 1 and decreased when ecw 4 7 ds m 1 3 2 dynamic and distribution of soil moisture content during the growing season smc for each treatment increased significantly throughout the soil profile after the enhanced leaching stage ⅰ ended especially in the main root zone fig 5 compared with the initial smc in 2015 the smc average value within the 0 100 cm soil profile with each treatment increased by 17 2 after the enhanced leaching stage then fluctuated at a level around 21 6 g g and finally settled at about 22 0 g g in the main root zone with each treatment the smc average value increased by 37 7 after the enhanced leaching stage ⅰ then lingered at a level of around 21 0 g g till the end of growing season in conclusion the average smc within the main root zone had relatively larger fluctuation but it was overall consistent with smc within the whole soil profile with the experimental salty water drip irrigation system the smc throughout the soil profiles of five treatments were uniform with nearly no difference at the end of tomato growing season in 2015 and 2016 fig 6 3 3 dynamic and distribution of soil ec e during the growing season as shown in fig 7 and fig 8 the average sslr within the 0 100 cm soil profile and within the main root zone with all t1 t5 treatments were 19 0 1 2 and 52 5 3 8 after the irrigation stage ⅰ in 2015 the sslr reduction did not change much among treatments but there were some differences between some treatments in terms of its distribution in various soil profiles fig 8a the following investigations on sslr revealed that the decrease of soil salinity became slower and remained stable at 39 8 4 7 and 80 7 5 8 on average respectively within the 0 100 cm soil profile and within the main root zone with all t1 t5 treatment at the end of growing season in 2015 at the end of growing season in 2016 fig 8c the final sslr within the 100 cm depth profile and within the main root zone for each treatment was 65 3 64 4 62 0 58 5

decreased linearly as the ecw increased p 0 05 the sslrs within the main root zone and within the 0 1 m deep soil increased linearly as the applied water amount of those increased while only the linear correlation relationship between the sslr within the main root zone in 2015 and irrigation amount was significant at p 0 05 level 3 4 distribution of soil cations 3 4 1 soil sodium content

shown from fig 9 to fig 12 a significant decline of scc occurred in the main root zone throughout the soil profile and the decreasing magnitude increased in 2016 in table 2 the sclr of na ca2 mg2 k with the t1 t5 treatments within the main root zone both in 2015 and 2016 without k in 2016 decreased linearly with the incremental ecw value and the increasing number of corresponding cations in irrigation water p 0 05 the sclr of na ca2 mg2 and k with the t1 t5 treatments within the main root zone in 2015 increased linearly with an increasingly supplied water amount the added amount of both

13b 4 discussion 4 1 drip irrigation schedule and ecw on the soil water and salt dynamics after the initial enhanced leaching stage ended smc with each of the treatments increased significantly to a high level throughout the different soil profiles especially in the main root zone meanwhile the soil ece within the 0 100 cm soil profile and within the main root zone with the t1 t5 treatments dropped by 19 0 1 2 and 52 5 3 8 on average respectively this stage used 32 mm amount of irrigation water plus 37 6 mm rainfall accounting for 10 4 12 2 of the seasonal applied water amount for all treatments for three days during the regular leaching irrigation stage ⅱ a higher smp 5 kpa was controlled to manage the irrigation schedule the actual irrigation frequency was once every 1 8 days for the treatments on average indicating that the irrigation frequencies were high which proved to be helpful in soil desalination through maintaining soil water adequately available while leaching soluble salts abrol et al 1988 although some smp values were lower than 5 kpa during the growing period due to higher daily water consumption the smc throughout the soil profile was kept at a high level and only slight reduction of the smc within the main root zone occurred during the corresponding growing stage which provided a basic condition for soil salt leaching due to a continuous downward flow of water similar results were also reported from the studies on saline sodic soil improvement using the high frequency drip irrigation concept dong et al 2022 li et al 2018a sun et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 our study also indicated that nearly no differences among treatments in seasonal average smc within 0 100 cm soil profile and within the main root zone roughly 252 348 mm irrigation water was used plus 247 mm rainfall within 93 day period in the irrigation stage ⅱ in 2015 obviously the salt leaching efficiency in the stage ⅱ was much lower than that in the irrigation stage ⅰ the possible reasons for the decrease were that 1 the daily irrigation amount was insufficient in the irrigation stage ⅱ 2 the evapotranspiration by plants increased and the water drainage decreased in the stage ⅱ ning et al 2021 2022 3 the initial smc was higher in the stage ii than the stage i ma et al 2006 oster et al 1972 so the unsaturated soil water flow in the stage ii became less effective li et al 2015 prichard et al 1985 and 4 the accumulation of irrigation water generally reduced the salt leaching efficiency wu and wang 2010 the sslrs within the main root zone decreased linearly alone with increased ecw values p 0 05 and similar results were reported by rhoades et al 1992 and li et al 2018a as well 4 2 effect of irrigation water quality on soil cation leaching after the experiment the abundance of soil cations were in the order of mg2 ca2 k na this result was opposite to the desalination one in the coastal salt affected soil with deionized water in the order of na k ca2 mg2 reported in a previous room soil column experiment li et al 2018b but the same findings were found that the differences between the reduction of mg2 ca2 and k were not significant p 0 05 therefore the sclr of na was higher or lower than the sclr of mg2 ca2 and k was the main difference between our finding and li et al 2018b due to the different performance in this study 1 the sclr of na was only slightly higher than that of three other cations li et al 2018b 2 na took up 87 of the total cation content in irrigation water and followed by mg2 ca2 k content and when extra na in the irrigated saline water entered into the soil the na reduction became slower than the three other cations 3 the amount of na that entered into the soil was more than the reduced difference between na and the other cations sar decline occurred in this study is consistent with the previous findings by li et al 2015 2018a derived from the same experimental site on salt affected soil besides na is not the necessary nutrient for plants but k and other moderately required ones such as mg2 and ca2 are however as mentioned above the contents of k mg2 and ca2 in the main root zone were very low at the end of both growing seasons indicating a possibly inadequate amounts of k mg2 and ca2 to cause a poor crop growth and even the diseases such as the blossom end rot in tomato due to calcium deficiency especially under salt stress condition hagassou et al 2019 reitz et al 2021 but there was still an advantage of this operational irrigation condition i e to ultimately avoid non point source contamination caused by continuous leaching 4 3 optimization proposal of coastal silt salt affected wasteland agricultural exploitation 1 it can be seen from the dynamic of smp irrigation quota with 6 mm and limitation of maximum irrigation frequency at once a day was not enough to satisfy the crop consumption and meanwhile keep the smp above 5 kpa when the staged crop evapotranspiration was high dong et al 2022 found that the smp was higher than 5 kpa during the irrigation stage when 5 kpa smp irrigation threshold and 10 mm quota were operated in the saline area of yellow river basin therefore a larger irrigation quota was suggested e g 10 mm or a rigid irrigation schedule should be operated according to the smp without the limitation of daily maximum irrigation frequency this change would accelerate the soil desalination process 2 according to the sslr response to various irrigation water salinities two irrigation modes for tomato planting in coastal silt salt affected wasteland were recommended as follows a the synchronous mode of soil desalination for a high crop yield with this irrigation mode to obtain the maximized output of tomatoes the watering schedules were divided into three stages stage ⅰ in which ecw value at 7 8 ds m or less was intensively used to rinse the rhizometic soil for more than a 90 of the seedling growth rate feng et al 2022 stage ⅱ in which the smp was monitored and kept above 5 kpa at 20 cm directly beneath the emitters during the normal leaching process through using salty water ecw value below 3 9 ds m 1 and stage ⅲ when the soil ece value adjacent to the buried pipes was lower than 4 ds m 1 the smp at 20 cm directly beneath the emitters was set up to maintain it above 20 kpa wan et al 2007 through using salty irrigation water with its ec value below 3 9 ds m 1 feng et al 2022 this mode was able to use local mildly salty water with a low ecw instead of fresh water for alleviation soil salinity around roots ensuring the crop growth a high tomato yield and utilization of saline lands at the same time b the mode of pre desalination in saline soil previous researches indicate that even highly salinized irrigation water can be effective in desalinating saline sodic lands reeve and bower 1960 ning et al 2022 given the condition of no fresh or mild salty water available leaching of soil salts can be achieved through using abundant highly salty water prior to cultivating crops specifically our drip irrigation system with highly salty water ecw value at 7 8 ds m 1 or higher can be used for an enhanced leaching of salts from saline soils before planting crops tomato plants are ready to be planted once the soil ece above underground pipes is lower than 4 ds m 1 or reaches the equilibrium state of higher than 4 ds m 1 after planting the three stage irrigation schedule discussed above could then be applied to grow tomatoes or other crops it s worth noting that some of the soil water and nutrient leached into the deeper soil during the irrigation stages ⅰ and ⅱ desalination processes it is recommended that a less amount of fertilizer than that used routinely be considered since a high yield of crop production is not the ultimate goal in the desalination process to pursue a higher tomato yield in the irrigation stage ⅲ it is recommended to apply sufficient fertilizer with the suggested irrigation schedule the losses of water and fertilizer will also decrease in this stage 5 conclusion the drip irrigation water at five salinized levels with the ecw value at 0 7 3 2 4 7 6 2 and 7 8 ds m 1 respectively was tested in this study after an initial enhanced leaching stage ⅰ the drip watering was set up to begin when smp underneath the emitters at the 20 cm deep soil was below 5 kpa at a maximum irrigation frequency of once a day with a 6 mm quota results derived from the two year experiment have indicated that the smc in each treatment increased significantly to a high level throughout the whole soil profile after the enhanced leaching stage ⅰ ended while the soil salinity within the main root zone dropped by 52 5 3 8 with no obviously difference among treatments p 0 05 during the regular leaching irrigation stage ii the smp value was often below the set 5 kpa threshold during the primary crop water consumption period the salt leaching efficiency was lower and the soil salt leaching rate within the main root zone decreased linearly as the ecw increased a low salt soil zone was constantly formed year by year in the soil under the drip point line with all treatments at the end of experiment the decline of soil salinity and sar within the main root zone reached by 87 1 94 7 and 58 4 63 7 respectively the reduction rate of soil cations were ranged from 98 8 to 89 5 following the order of mg2 ca2 k na thus two optimized measures were recommend 1 a larger irrigation quota be suggested e g 10 mm or a frequent irrigation schedule be operated according to the smp without limitation of daily maximum irrigation times 2 the two modes and a three stage irrigation schedule for tomato planting in coastal silt salt affected wasteland be applied to make better use of saline water to obtain higher tomato yield this study helps to make better use of saline water for agricultural developments of heavy saline lands in the brr of china and other similar

9012,it was necessary and challenging to utilize the saline alkali land in coastal region for agricultural development to desalinate salty lands for potential crop cultivation a two year field experiment with an optimized tillage under a drip irrigation with five levels of salty water ecw 0 7 3 2 4 7 6 2 7 8 ds m 1 respectively was conducted in the bohai rim region china results showed that following an enhanced leaching the soil moisture content with each treatment increased significantly throughout the whole soil profile while soil salinity within the main root zone dropped by 52 5 3 8 with no obvious differences among treatments throughout the regular leaching irrigation period the soil matric potential smp was often below the threshold of 5 kpa during the primary water consumption stage of tomato plants and the salt leaching efficiency was lower than that during the enhanced leaching period and the salt leaching rate within the main root zone decreased linearly as the ecw increased final measurements at the end of the experiment the soil salinity and the sodium adsorption ratio of the main root zone declined by 87 1 94 7 and 58 4 63 7 respectively while the reduction rate of soil cations ranged from 98 8 to 89 5 following the order of mg2 ca2 k na indicating that leached saline soil around root zones were suitable for tomato cultivation thus we recommend that 1 a

soil salt leaching bohai rim region data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction lack of fresh water has limited the acreage of agricultural lands and crop yields in many countries worldwide rational utilization of mild saline water to replace fresh one in the regions where salty water is available for agricultural use has been a common goal however many studies have found that saline water might have been a solution to wet the farm lands due to unavailability of water source but could be prone for salt accumulations and the secondary soil salinization in dry semi dry or semi humid regions feng et al 2015 huang et al 2011 kitamura et al 2006 li et al 2022 wang et al 2022 unlike arable farm lands high sodium contents of saline soils in coastal regions can be reduced by a proper irrigation with less salty water for reclamation of saline lands li et al 2015 li et al 2018a guo and liu 2015 2020 zhang et al 2019 moreover there have been several studies and reports in china on various types of soil salinity managements concluding that reclamation of saline lands and crop productions could be synchronized through choosing an appropriate irrigation system an optimized watering program and suitable crops dong et al 2022 li et al 2018a li and kang 2020 sun et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 saline soil is widely distributed along the mainland coast of china covering about 10 000 km2 yu and chen 1999 among which the mildly and lightly salinized alkali lands have been fully utilized for cultivation of some salt tolerant grains cotton and oil crops while the heavily salinized ones are still deserted without being effectively exploited due to the magnitude of challenges encountered even though many researchers have attempted to build up a vegetation and to develop coastal salty lands for agricultural uses in the absence of fresh water guo et al 2015 2020 solved a problem of soil drought and salt buildup in spring by mulching the soil surface with a layer of frozen saline irrigation water during winter and then using the summer precipitation as fresh water to grow salt tolerant plants in the areas where saline water was available li et al 2015 li 2018a and zhang et al 2019 used a filtration layer of sands and gravels to separate the top arable and bottom original soils followed by a high frequency drip irrigation with the electricity conductivity of irrigation water ecw at 0 8 7 8 ds m 1 to grow herbaceous and flowering plants they found that soil salinity and the sodium adsorption ratio sar decreased rapidly and significantly that simultaneous soil desalination and plant growth were achievable and realistic and that the 0 120 cm soil layer above the sand gravel layer had changed from extremely heavy salty soil to slightly or unsalted one in two years in order to reduce the cost and time duration in saline alkali soil reclamation for agricultural uses and to seek for an ideal and proper irrigation system with saline water feng et al 2022 attempted the possibility of growing tomato in the coastal silt saline land through setting up underneath desalinating pipes and a high frequent drip irrigation system with salinized water ecw values ranging from 0 8 to 7 8 ds m 1 the results indicated that when the water ecw was kept below 3 9 ds m 1 and the soil matrix potential smp maintained above 5 kpa in the soil 20 cm beneath the emitters for a short period of enhanced leaching irrigation the general soil salinity was reduced greatly and high quality tomatoes grown successfully however the dynamic distribution characteristics of soil water salt and cations in association with different soil profiles during the whole process of the experiment under the high frequent drip irrigation were not fully reported those three aspects of the entire desalination process are very important to understand how this drip saline water irrigated system works and its functional and practical mechanism would shade some profound and meaningful lights on the effective desalination of deserted saline lands alone the coastal regions in china therefore this study was aiming at 1 desalination of coastal saline lands for agricultural uses through a pipe ridge drip irrigation system 2 determination and optimization of a watering program for growing tomatoes with mild salinized water available in the bohai rim region brr and 3 revelation of distributions and dynamics of salty water and deposited salts within various soil profiles alone with their underline impact on tomato roots and soil salt cations this study helps to make better use of saline water to obtain higher tomato yield in the brr 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was conducted at the international eco city of caofeidian district 39 20 n 118 54 e in the northwest of bohai gulf china from 2015 to 2016 where is under the influence of a typical semi humid monsoon climate with an annual precipitation of approximately 554 9 mm mostly during june to september the annual average temperature is 11 4 and the soil profile down to a 100 cm deep soil was made of silt 80 31 1 67 sand 19 05 1 50 and clay 0 64 0 19 a typical deserted coastal silt salt affected land according to the united states department of agriculture standards of soil texture classes with some sporadic suaeda suaeda glauca bge plants as the landscaping vegetation the mean electricity conductivity of the soil salinity ece sodium adsorption ratio sar and ph of the saturated paste phe of the 0

accounted for 11 5 the soil bulk density of initial saline soil was 1 60 g cm3 2 2 experimental design and field setup irrigation water at five salinized levels with the ecw value at 0 7 3 2 4 7 6 2 and 7 8 ds m was designated as t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 respectively they were obtained by mixing fresh well water 0 7 ds m and highly saline shallow groundwater 70 ds m accordingly ionic composition of each irrigation water treatment was shown in table 1 each treatment consisted of 3 replications and 15 plots in total in a design of a completely randomized block to reduce soil bulk density make the soil more homogeneous and provide an efficient way for discharging leached salts the top soil was removed to a depth of 60 cm the corrugated discharging pipes in 63 mm diameter were laid on the bottom of 4 8 m 4 8 m plots with a 2 4 m line spacing and then refilled with the unearthed soil prior to the experiment each plot consisted of 6 ridges 80 cm apart each ridge was 480 cm long 20 cm high 20 cm wide on top and 20 cm wide on furrow bottom sixteen tomato seedlings with 30 40 day old were transplanted in the center of each ridge at a spacing of 30 cm both in june 8 2015 and may 24 2016 respectively the planting layout drip tubes setting and location of the tensiometer were shown in fig 1 2 3 drip watering schedule irrigation procedures were described in detail by feng et al 2022 a gravity dependent dripping system at a low running pressure 0 45 m was adopted drip tubes with 30 cm apart emitters were placed in the center of ridge 3 cm away from the planted seedlings a two stage watering schedule was carried out throughout the experiment during the stage ι enhanced leaching period the watering started right after tomato seedlings being transplanted until the field scout ec of the top 10 cm thick soil on the ridge dropped below 3 ds m 1 the watering system was set up to turn off or on again whenever a water pool or runoff was detected or disappeared on the soil surface the irrigation duration and depth in 2015 and 2016 were 3 and 5 days 32 and 54 mm respectively in the stage ⅱ regular leaching irrigation period all treatments had received a 6 mm deep irrigation water at a maximum irrigation frequency of once a day until smp values fell below 5 kpa taking the daily maximum evapotranspiration of field tomato 5 6 mm d 1 into consideration according to fao recommendations https www fao org land water databases and software crop information tomato en during the stage ⅱ the watering durations in 2015 and 2016 was 93 and 108 days and a high watering frequency for treatments t1 to t5 in 2015 was once every 1 6 1 6 2 1 1 7 and 2 2 days and in 2016 were once every 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 9 and 1 6 days respectively 2 4 fertilization scheme the same amount of fertilizer accounting for about 80 of the total usage by local farmers in regular soils was applied for each treatment the daily amount of fertilizers was determined through dividing the total quantity for fertilizers by 100 days supposedly needed for the whole tomato growing season after transplanting the fertilizer was mixed with irrigation water according to its watering schedule the yearly amounts of pure n p and k were 173 3 23 0 and 28 9 kg ha 1 in 2015 but were 202 2 26 8 and 33 7 kg ha 1 in 2016 respectively since the growing period in 2016 was 15 days longer than that in 2015 2 5 measurements the average daily precipitation and other meteorological data were available with the automatic weather station near the trial site the rainfall during the entire tomato growing season in 2015 and 2016 were 284 6 and 456 4 mm respectively fig 2 the smp values monitored by tensiometers that were installed at 20 cm deep soil with all five treatments were recorded twice a day at 8 00 and 16 00 with the smp threshold set at 5 kpa to turn on the irrigation system fig 3 the soil samples were taken at 0 10 20 30 and 40 cm from the emitters perpendicular to the drip lines and at an interval of 10 cm to a depth of 100 cm from each plot once before planting and in 5 11 17 26 40 60 79 and 95 day after planting dap in 2015 respectively and plus once more at the end of growing season in 2016 all soil samples were divided into two parts one was dried at 105 in the oven to a constant weight and another portion was air dried first and then passed through a 1 mm sieve and saturated using the method proposed by rhoades et al 1999 measurements of ece and soluble salt cations were based on extracts of saturated soil obtained by centrifugation 3180 g 30 min the ece value

golden software inc golden co usa 3 results 3 1 distribution of tomato roots as shown in fig 4 the maximum root depth with all t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 treatments were about 50 60 cm in both years the root distribution in the furrow side was less about 7 in average over the both years and shallower than that in the ridge side compared with the data collected in 2015 a higher total root dry matter from the ridge center to the furrow center at a depth of 60 cm with a smaller proportion of roots distributed in the ridge side in 2016 in the ridge side of five treatments the root dry mass within 0 30 cm deep soil accounted for 97 5 92 5 98 9 99 4 and 97 9 of the total root dry mass in 2015 respectively the root dry mass within 0 30 cm deep soil accounted for 99 5 89 1 98 9 98 5 and 99 9 of the root dry mass in the ridge side of soil profile in 2016 the tomato root dry mass in the ridge side accounted for 82 0 82 6 88 3 94 6 and 95 0 of the total root dry mass respectively the root dry mass within the 0 30 cm deep soil in the ridge side accounted for 92 9 91 6 91 7 93 0 and 98 2 of the root dry mass in the ridge side of soil profile fig 4 as the ecw increased each year the dry matter of roots resulted in a trend of the increase first and then of the decline subsequently the maximum biomass was mainly obtained in t2 and the minimum ones in t5 the dry matter of the roots increased when ecw 4 7 ds m 1 and decreased when ecw 4 7 ds m 1 3 2 dynamic and distribution of soil moisture content during the growing season smc for each treatment increased significantly throughout the soil profile after the enhanced leaching stage ⅰ ended especially in the main root zone fig 5 compared with the initial smc in 2015 the smc average value within the 0 100 cm soil profile with each treatment increased by 17 2 after the enhanced leaching stage then fluctuated at a level around 21 6 g g and finally settled at about 22 0 g g in the main root zone with each treatment the smc average value increased by 37 7 after the enhanced leaching stage ⅰ then lingered at a level of around 21 0 g g till the end of growing season in conclusion the average smc within the main root zone had relatively larger fluctuation but it was overall consistent with smc within the whole soil profile with the experimental salty water drip irrigation system the smc throughout the soil profiles of five treatments were uniform with nearly no difference at the end of tomato growing season in 2015 and 2016 fig 6 3 3 dynamic and distribution of soil ec e during the growing season as shown in fig 7 and fig 8 the average sslr within the 0 100 cm soil profile and within the main root zone with all t1 t5 treatments were 19 0 1 2 and 52 5 3 8 after the irrigation stage ⅰ in 2015 the sslr reduction did not change much among treatments but there were some differences between some treatments in terms of its distribution in various soil profiles fig 8a the following investigations on sslr revealed that the decrease of soil salinity became slower and remained stable at 39 8 4 7 and 80 7 5 8 on average respectively within the 0 100 cm soil profile and within the main root zone with all t1 t5 treatment at the end of growing season in 2015 at the end of growing season in 2016 fig 8c the final sslr within the 100 cm depth profile and within the main root zone for each treatment was 65 3 64 4 62 0 58 5

decreased linearly as the ecw increased p 0 05 the sslrs within the main root zone and within the 0 1 m deep soil increased linearly as the applied water amount of those increased while only the

13b 4 discussion 4 1 drip irrigation schedule and ecw on the soil water and salt dynamics after the initial enhanced leaching stage ended smc with each of the treatments increased significantly to a high level throughout the different soil profiles especially in the main root zone meanwhile the soil ece within the 0 100 cm soil profile and within the main root zone with the t1 t5 treatments dropped by 19 0 1 2 and 52 5 3 8 on average respectively this stage used 32 mm amount of irrigation water plus 37 6 mm rainfall accounting for 10 4 12 2 of the seasonal applied water amount for all treatments for three days during the regular leaching irrigation stage ⅱ a higher smp 5 kpa was controlled to manage the irrigation schedule the actual irrigation frequency was once every 1 8 days for the treatments on average indicating that the irrigation frequencies were high which proved to be helpful in soil desalination through maintaining soil water adequately available while leaching soluble salts abrol et al 1988 although some smp values were lower than 5 kpa during the growing period due to higher daily water consumption the smc throughout the soil profile was kept at a high level and only slight reduction of the smc within the main root zone occurred during the corresponding growing stage which provided a basic condition for soil salt leaching due to a continuous downward flow of water similar results were also reported from the studies on saline sodic soil improvement using the high frequency drip irrigation concept dong et al 2022 li et al 2018a sun et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 our study also indicated that nearly no differences among treatments in seasonal average smc within 0 100 cm soil profile and within the main root zone roughly 252 348 mm irrigation water was used plus 247 mm rainfall within 93 day period in the irrigation stage ⅱ in 2015 obviously the salt leaching efficiency in the stage ⅱ was much lower than that in the irrigation stage ⅰ the possible reasons for the decrease were that 1 the daily irrigation amount was insufficient in the irrigation stage ⅱ 2 the evapotranspiration by plants increased and the water drainage decreased in the stage ⅱ ning et al 2021 2022 3 the initial smc was higher in the stage ii than the stage i ma et al 2006 oster et al 1972 so the unsaturated soil water flow in the stage ii became less effective li et al 2015 prichard et al 1985 and 4 the accumulation of irrigation water generally reduced the salt leaching efficiency wu and wang 2010 the sslrs within the main root zone decreased linearly alone with increased ecw values p 0 05 and similar results were reported by rhoades et al 1992 and li et al 2018a as well 4 2 effect of irrigation water quality on soil cation leaching after the experiment the abundance of soil cations were in the order of mg2 ca2 k na this result was opposite to the desalination one in the coastal salt affected soil with deionized water in the order of na k ca2 mg2 reported in a previous room soil column experiment li et al 2018b but the same findings were found that the differences between the reduction of mg2 ca2 and k were not significant p 0 05 therefore the sclr of na was higher or lower than the sclr of mg2 ca2 and k was the main difference between our finding and li et al 2018b due to the different performance in this study 1 the sclr of na was only slightly higher than that of three other cations li et al 2018b 2 na took up 87 of the total cation content in irrigation water and followed by mg2 ca2 k content and when extra na in the irrigated saline water entered into the soil the na reduction became slower than the three other cations 3 the amount of na that entered into the soil was more than the reduced difference between na and the other cations sar decline occurred in this study is consistent with the previous findings by li et al 2015 2018a derived from the same experimental site on salt affected soil besides na is not the necessary nutrient for plants but k and other moderately required ones such as mg2 and ca2 are however as mentioned above the contents of k mg2 and ca2 in the main root zone were very low at the end of both growing seasons indicating a possibly inadequate amounts of k mg2 and ca2 to cause a poor crop growth and even the diseases such as the blossom end rot in tomato due to calcium deficiency especially under salt stress condition hagassou et al 2019 reitz et al 2021 but there was still an advantage of this operational irrigation condition i e to ultimately avoid non point source contamination caused by continuous leaching 4 3 optimization proposal of coastal silt salt affected wasteland agricultural exploitation 1 it can be seen from the dynamic of smp irrigation quota with 6 mm and limitation of maximum irrigation frequency at once a day was not enough to satisfy the crop consumption and meanwhile keep the smp above 5 kpa when the staged crop evapotranspiration was high dong et al 2022 found that the smp was higher than 5 kpa during the irrigation stage when 5 kpa smp irrigation threshold and 10 mm quota were operated in the saline area of yellow river basin therefore a larger irrigation quota was suggested e g 10 mm or a rigid irrigation schedule should be operated according to the smp without the limitation of daily maximum irrigation frequency this change would accelerate the soil desalination process 2 according to the sslr response to various irrigation water salinities two irrigation modes for tomato planting in coastal silt salt affected wasteland were recommended as follows a the synchronous mode of soil desalination for a high crop yield with this irrigation mode to obtain the maximized output of tomatoes the watering schedules were divided into three stages stage ⅰ in which ecw value at 7 8 ds m or less was intensively used to rinse the rhizometic soil for more than a 90 of the seedling growth rate feng et al 2022 stage ⅱ in which the smp was monitored and kept above 5 kpa at 20 cm directly beneath the emitters during the normal leaching process through using salty water ecw value below 3 9 ds m 1 and stage ⅲ when the soil ece value adjacent to the buried pipes was lower than 4 ds m 1 the smp at 20 cm directly beneath the emitters was set up to maintain it above 20 kpa wan et al 2007 through using salty irrigation water with its ec value below 3 9 ds m 1 feng et al 2022 this mode was able to use local mildly salty water with a low ecw instead of fresh water for alleviation soil salinity around roots ensuring the crop growth a high tomato yield and utilization of saline lands at the same time b the mode of pre desalination in saline soil previous researches indicate that even highly salinized irrigation water can be effective in desalinating saline sodic lands reeve and bower 1960 ning et al 2022 given the condition of no fresh or mild salty water available leaching of soil salts can be achieved through using abundant highly salty water prior to cultivating crops specifically our drip irrigation system with highly salty water ecw value at 7 8 ds m 1 or higher can be used for an enhanced leaching of salts from saline soils before planting crops tomato plants are ready to be planted once the soil ece above underground pipes is lower than 4 ds m 1 or reaches the equilibrium state of higher than 4 ds m 1 after planting the three stage irrigation schedule discussed above could then be applied to grow tomatoes or other crops it s worth noting that some of the soil water and nutrient leached into the deeper soil during the irrigation stages ⅰ and ⅱ desalination processes it is recommended that a less amount of fertilizer than that used routinely be considered since a high yield of crop production is not the ultimate goal in the desalination process to pursue a higher tomato yield in the irrigation stage ⅲ it is recommended to apply sufficient fertilizer with the suggested irrigation schedule the losses of water and fertilizer will also decrease in this stage 5 conclusion the drip irrigation water at five salinized levels with the ecw value at 0 7 3 2 4 7 6 2 and 7 8 ds m 1 respectively was tested in this study after an initial enhanced leaching stage ⅰ the drip watering was set up to begin when smp underneath the emitters at the 20 cm deep soil was below 5 kpa at a maximum irrigation frequency of once a day with a 6 mm quota results derived from the two year experiment have indicated that the smc in each treatment increased significantly to a high level throughout the whole soil profile after the enhanced leaching stage ⅰ ended while the soil salinity within the main root zone dropped by 52 5 3 8 with no obviously difference among treatments p 0 05 during the regular leaching irrigation stage ii the smp value was often below the set 5 kpa threshold during the primary crop water consumption period the salt leaching efficiency was lower and the soil salt leaching rate within the main root zone decreased linearly as the ecw increased a low salt soil zone was constantly formed year by year in the soil under the drip point line with all treatments at the end of experiment the decline of soil salinity and sar within the main root zone reached by 87 1 94 7 and 58 4 63 7 respectively the reduction rate of soil cations were ranged from 98 8 to 89 5 following the order of mg2 ca2 k na thus two optimized measures were recommend 1 a larger irrigation quota be suggested e g 10 mm or a frequent irrigation schedule be operated according to the smp without limitation of daily maximum irrigation times 2 the two modes and a three stage irrigation schedule for tomato planting in coastal silt salt affected wasteland be applied to make better use of saline water to obtain higher tomato yield this study helps to make better use of saline water for agricultural developments of heavy saline lands in the brr of china and other similar

9013,the majority of pulses provide nutritional security to humankind apart from having environmental service in enriching soil health cultivated over 95 75 million hectares the average pulse productivity is around 1 0 t ha 1 pulses perform better under irrigated conditions irrigation water as a critical input ensures enhancing productivity for pulse crops the irrigation water used by pulses varies widely it is as low as 5 7 mm during rainy season to 609 mm during the dry season accordingly the average water productivity of major pulse ranges from 0 67 to 7 51 kg ha 1mm 1 various innovative approaches for enhancing water productivity can be adopted which help minimize water losses thereby increasing yields adopting micro irrigation for pulses reduces water consumption and thereby increases yield substantially under water limited situations deficit or critical stage based pulses irrigation also ensures higher water productivity bed planting ridge and furrow planting are proven methods for pulses to increase water productivity by 20 40 due to easy aeration reduced lodging and easy access to intercultural operations however irrigation methods have a more significant impact on the quality of pulses pulse production functions show a linear relationship with irrigation water as one of the inputs during the growing period this paper emphasizes the strategies followed globally to enhance the water productivity of major pulses like chickpeas cowpeas pigeon peas lentils black and green gram and beans keywords deficit irrigation micro irrigations pulses residual crops and water productivity functions data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction pulses are one of the important ingredients in a global vegetarian diet commonly known as poor man s protein source as they contain 20 25 of protein singh 2011 marwein and ray 2019 yadav et al 2019 they also provide environmental services in restoring soil health intact the production of pulses varies widely under rain fed and irrigated conditions pulses which are mainly grown in rain fed situations experience moisture stress which is one of the reasons for low productivity however under irrigated conditions productivity enhances up to three times that of a rain fed situation singh et al 2010 therefore proper utilization of irrigation water under moisture stress situations can increase water productivity and also economic yield the total amount of water used i e amount of rainfall along with irrigation water if provided any during the growth period can be defined as the water use for pulse crop water is the most crucial input for agricultural production and is becoming a major limiting factor in agriculture because of the unpredictable nature of rainfall and increasing demands from other sectors gowda et al 2009a marwein et al 2017 globally agriculture accounts for more than 80 of all freshwater used by humans most of which is for crop production morison et al 2008 rain fed agriculture accounts for 60 of production in developing countries and during the 21st century most of the water used for crop production is derived from rain fed soil moisture even though irrigation benefits only 10 of agricultural water consumption and covers 20 of cropped land it accounts for 40 of total food production to meet the increasing food demand and to ensure nutritional food security the food and agriculture organisation fao has predicted to expand irrigated land to about 45 m ha in 93 developing countries by 2030 fao 2006 the value of water productivity which is one of the yardsticks for measuring how efficiently pulse crops use water needs to be enhanced by suitable means water productivity is a simple ratio of crop yield to total amount of water used by the crop during its growing period and can be improved by increasing output with the same amount of water or by producing the same output with less water mustafa et al 2008 this also means obtaining more crop yield per unit of irrigation water kijne et al 2003 irrigation scheduling can be managed precisely using efficient water management technologies to meet crop water demands holding the promise of increasing yield and quality besides conserving water kadasiddappa et al 2017 efficient water management practices such as micro irrigation can enhance water productivity under arid and semi arid conditions optimal water utilization can be achieved by adopting deficit irrigation practices and critical growth stages of irrigation in which minimum yields are compromised to obtain more water productivity adopting deficit irrigation also leads to an 8 increase in water productivity for chickpeas under arid conditions jabow et al 2015 due to water shortage irrigation water applied must be quantified to predict the changes in yield similarly crop water production functions cwpfs are also indicators for efficient utilization of applied water in nexus with yield cwpfs define optimum water application for maximizing economic benefit varzi 2016 globally pulses share is only 5 of the total protein consumption to bridge the growing demand and raise their per capita availability countries made efforts to increase production and explore trade opportunities to augment domestic supply the main objective of this paper is to analyze the water productivity of major pulse crops cultivated around the globe with suitable critical suggestions for necessary improvement 2 global pulses production from the end of the 20th century until the first decade of the 21st century global pulses production grew at an annual rate of 1 3 stagnari et al 2017 statista 2020 the combined percentage share of pea chickpeas and dry bean is around 65 in global major pulses production the respective percentage share in dry beans 32 peas 19 chickpeas 14 cowpea 7 broad bean 7 lentil 6 and others 15 has been reported by several researchers gowda et al 2009b dhivya et al 2020 marwein and ray 2021 over the past few years the demand for pulses has been increasing steadily causing a gap between production and consumption this gap might increase because of an increase in population leading to more consumption india the second most populous country in the world will require around 39 mt of total pulses by 2050 which will require an annual growth rate of 2 2 statista 2022 the global pulse production during the last decade is shown in fig 1 it can be depicted from fig 1 that in 2017 the production was highest and reached 94 79 m t however an average of 70 m t of production was maintained annually during the last decade globally average pulse production and productivity in major continents are shown in fig 2 it may be noted from fig 2 that asia produces the maximum pulse 29 07 m t whereas the productivity is highest in europe the percentage share of pulse production in the three continents asia europe and america is more than 80 more than 45 of world pulses are produced from the asia continent which was the highest among all continents with continent africa being the second highest with the production of 12 86 m t pulse productivity was recorded highest in europe with more than 2 0 t ha 1 while it was lowest in africa 0 6 t ha 1 major pulse producing countries with production and area coverage under different pulses are shown in fig 3 under asian countries higher production is recorded for india china and myanmar similarly higher production is also recorded in ethiopia an african country the usa canada and brazil are major producers and under european country russia produces more among all the countries india is the largest producer of pulses accounting for 25 of total pulses production occupying an area of 30 5 m ha with an average productivity of 0 66 t ha 1 statista 2022 even though the area and production were highest the productivity was much lower the productivity was highest in canada with 2 03 t ha 1 3 water consumption and potential yield of pulse pulse crops require less irrigation water than cereals gowda et al 2009b however water used for pulses also varied widely which may be due to varieties used in trials or may be due to agro climatic conditions where the field experiments were carried out the water used by five major pulse crops is presented in table 1 black gram grown during the summer season required higher water than that grown during the winter the range of water used varies between 400 and 500 mm for chickpeas the range is 330 440 mm green gram cultivated during the rainy season in myanmar uses less irrigation water 5 7 mm however the rainy season grown green gram uses 210 325 mm of irrigation water in india winter season grown lentils and gram used around 175 5 mm of water in india the water used for pigeon peas varies between 540 and 600 mm it may be noted that the water used for the long duration pulse is more than the short duration apart from location and agro climatic condition there is a variation in yield as recorded for major pulse crops around the globe yield also depends on the method of irrigation taken up different irrigation methods have been shown to substantially impact pulse production this is because the quantum of water used is less under micro irrigation than other irrigation methods the yield performance of major crops under a surface irrigation system is presented in table 2 the ridge and furrow method of irrigation showed a better result with yield enhancement it may be due to optimum soil moisture with a uniform flow of water lesser weed competition because of the lesser area of the wetted periphery and enhanced yield attributes in the case of chickpeas pramanik et al 2009 pawar et al 2013 and cowpea by lawand et al 1993 somasundaram et al 2000 ridges and furrows gave more yields due to proper maintenance of soil air water equilibrium throughout the rhizosphere growth period which gave more nitrogen fixation and resulted in favorable enhancement of growth attributes in contrast vijayalakshmi and rajagopal 1995 claimed that the yield of black gram is highest in flat beds due to an increase in the soil moisture retention capacity combined with enhanced soil moisture status resulting in improved seed development in black gram for pigeon peas sharma et al 2018 found that higher seed yield under ridge and furrow treatment was due to higher dry matter production which resulted in higher production of photosynthesis resulting in the superiority of yield attributing characters and ultimately high yield as compared to conventional planting or flatbed planting bed planting has been shown to increase water productivity by 20 40 reduce seed rate provision easy access to intercultural operations easy aeration and reduce lodging aggarwal and goswami 2003 fahong et al 2004 jani et al 2008 because pulses are vulnerable to water stress or flooding the bed planting approach helps provide moisture to the crop by changing the soil environment indian council agricultural research icar an institute of repute under the government of india implementing teaching research and extension through the umbrella of networking institutions via the all india coordinated on pulses improvement project aicpip made best efforts to popularise pulse production due to high operational expenses farmers are not practicing pulse cultivation however with icar aicrp intervention broad bed furrow planting in pigeon pea groundnut and other pulse crops gained popularity and was accepted by farmers optimal crop stand proper irrigation scheduling and proper drainage resulted in higher productivity stagnari et al 2017 jadav et al 2020 3 1 water conservation technologies water conservation with appropriate agro technologies also referred to as resource conservation techniques rct involving new crop production technologies usually associated with a reduction in tillage operations mechanical operations appropriate crop or animal husbandry with suitable crop s or cropping farming systems and more biomass crop or residue retention on the soil surface two basic principles of rcts viz no tillage and retention of nearly 20 25 of crop residue on the soil surface ali et al 2014 hedayetullah and sadhukhan 2018 found that the broadcasting of chickpea seed in standing rice before 15 days of its harvest relay crop resulted in higher yield 1 44 and 1 41 t ha 1 for two consecutive years mulching is also one of the resource conservation techniques where organic and inorganic materials are applied on the soil surface as a blanket table 3 presents the effect of mulching on water productivity and yield of different pulses mulching resulted in increasing water productivity and yield of pulses mulching affects soil moisture content and temperature which influences crop output various organic mulches can help alleviate in situ soil moisture stress marwein et al 2017 dhivya et al 2020 organic mulching reduces soil disturbance at the surface allowing soil moisture to be conserved baumhardt and jones 2002 zhang et al 2009 icrisat 2016 for example mitra and bhattacharya 2005 reported that for green gram cultivation an application of straw mulch 5 t ha 1 resulted in 1 3 1 7 times higher seed yield of green gram compared to non mulch control similarly in cowpea choudhary et al 2013 revealed that the application of plastic mulch and straw mulch significantly increased the number of branches per plant seeds per pod and seed yield over control or dust mulch compared to no mulch in garden pea paddy straw mulching 10 t ha 1 significantly increased pods per plant green pod weight per plant and green pod output saroch and sandal 2014 in pigeon peas mathukia et al 2015 found that plant height branches per plant pods per plant and grains per pod were highest under wheat straw mulch grain yield under wheat straw mulch 1 38 t ha 1 was at par with grain yield under groundnut shell mulch 1 32 t ha 1 singh and rana 2006 fym organic mulch kaolin spray was having highest water productivity in mustard and lentil cropping systems where the mustard equivalent yields are also found to be highest similarly in both ground nuts and lentils rice straw mulch was found with high yield and water productivity banik and sharma 2008 in summer mung bean mulch application at 25 days after sowing was found to be effective with the highest water productivity and yield over mulching at sowing time and control ram et al 2016 according to sarkar et al 2016 application of black polyethylene mulch in chickpeas led to 8 increase in water productivity and a 9 yield enhancement over control no mulch however it was highest over organic mulches such as straw mulch or water hyacinth mulch by 6 and 14 in pigeon peas rao et al 2018 reported that silver mulch was more effective than black mulch but under control straw mulch and black plastic mulch jadav et al 2020 found that black plastic mulch was more effective by 48 over control and 6 over organic straw mulch considering economic yield 4 performance of pulses under different methods of irrigation the practice of irrigation always aims to obtain the maximum yield of marketable products from a given quantity of applied water there is a positive response of pulse crops to all methods of irrigation however under micro irrigation systems the value of water productivity increases desta et al 2015 kumari et al 2017 micro irrigation involving drip fertigation and sprinkler irrigation is very effective for on farm allocation and management of precious water chaudhury et al 2005 the water productivity and yields of major pulses irrigated at different stages are presented in table 4 in the event of acute moisture stress one or two irrigations directly applied to the root zone of the crops enhance crop performance hence choosing an appropriate irrigation method is necessary to increase efficiency and save water farmers need to recognize critical growth stages when maximum yield response to irrigation will occur during the initial stages the crop uses water for germination and water shortage will prevent seeds to germinate reducing crop stand per area and severely affecting final yield water deficit during the reproductive stage reduces the number of grains and grain weight decreasing the yield various irrigation scheduling approaches viz soil moisture depletion pattern sensitive crop growth stage and cumulative evaporation climatological approaches and combination of approaches are used for maximizing crop growth and benefit tolk and howell 2003 zhang 2003 payero et al 2005 admasu et al 2019 one of the important approaches for effective on farm water management of allocated precious irrigation water is drip and sprinkler irrigation praharaj et al 2016 goyal and ray 2022 it has several advantages over conventional methods of irrigation practices viz enhances both conveyance and water productivity direct application to the root zone of plants can be combined with other nutrients agrochemicals inputs and frequent intervals in precise quantities as per the crop water requirement chaudhury et al 2005 moreover fertilizers can be combined with drip water thus the precision application of water results in lesser weeds and pests and greater pod retention ramamurthy et al 2009 the yield water productivity and pulse water used under micro irrigations are presented in table 5 it may be noted from table 5 that the water requirement is substantially less thereby enhancement of water productivity black gram yield performance was significantly better under a sprinkler irrigation system this is because the consumption of water in sprinkler irrigation was less however the adoption of sprinkler irrigation at 100 pan evaporation increased yields by 9 4 over the surface and the adoption of sprinkler irrigation at 50 pan evaporation led to an increase of water productivity by 53 over the surface method kumar and yadav 2018 similarly rao et al 2016 reported that adopting drip and sprinklers decreased water consumption by 37 and 30 but increased yield by 31 and 67 and water productivity by 12 and 26 over the surface method of irrigation moreover in summer pulses micro irrigation management showed a significant improvement in seed yield 31 with water saving 11 less water use and 43 2 enhanced water productivity recorded in summer mung bean with precision tillage carried out by laser leveler praharaj et al 2015a thus adopting micro irrigation enhances pulse production and increases water productivity the performance of major pulses viz black gram chickpea cowpea green gram mungbean pea and pigeon pea under different irrigation methods and strategies to enhance productivity is presented under the following structured sub sections 4 1 blackgram black gram is a potential pulse crop that contains 26 protein almost three times that of cereals and other minerals and vitamins it fixes nitrogen n and is equivalent to 22 10 kg n ha 1 which has been estimated to supplement 59 000 tonnes of urea annually dhivya and ray 2020 velayutham and chandrasekaran 2002 reported that two times irrigating through a sprinkler at 2 0 cm depth black gram yielded 1 50 t ha 1 and water productivity of 38 kg ha 1 mm 1 black gram grown under rain fed situations showed yield difference when a dry spell coincides with the flowering stage wang et al 2003 nilanthi et al 2014 singh et al 2018b however under irrigated situations more yield has been recorded sprinklers irrigated on rice fallow black gram recorded enhancement in yield and yield attributes over flooding sprinkler irrigation resulted in a seed yield of 0 81 t ha 1 followed by flooding with 0 73 t ha 1 this might be due to excess soil moisture with flooding which prolonged the vegetative period even after flowering and reduced seed yield kalpana and selvi 2008 flood irrigation at branching flowering and podding resulted in higher yields of 0 85 t ha 1 malliswari et al 2008 adt 5 black gram variety yielded higher over pbg 4 and vbn bg 6 under both sprinkler and surface irrigation methods the seed yield of adt 5 with sprinkler irrigation at 100 pan evaporation was 1 21 t ha 1 and was at par with surface irrigation at 1 18 t ha 1 water saving under the sprinkler and 100 pan evaporation based irrigation was 23 1 and 25 4 respectively compared to surface irrigation kumar et al 2018 similarly black gram variety vbn 11 irrigated under 75 etc crop evapotranspiration resulted in higher plant height 40 45 cm the number of branches per plant 19 68 haulm yield 1 78 t ha 1 as compared to a surface method of irrigation vishnu et al 2021 similarly black gram performed better under the maize black gram cropping system also during the rainy season a 0 8 t ha 1 yield was recorded and during winter highest yield 1 2 t ha 1 was obtained with drip fertigation and 100 recommended doses of water soluble fertilizers this treatment resulted in a 37 increase in yield over surface application ramah 2019 sprinkler irrigated black gram sown by machine under flatbed conditions used less water 431 2 mm and recorded higher water productivity 2 08 kg ha 1 mm 1 as well as saving of water up to 14 5 and higher yield of 1 29 t ha 1 as compared to the conventional practices of check basin irrigation kannan 2019 the performance of black gram under an organic environment was found to be better with a yield of 1 04 t ha 1 organic amendments seed priming mulching and manuring had significantly influenced the growth and yield of black gram dhivya and ray 2020 4 2 chickpea chickpea is one of the major pulses which contributes around 40 to the global pulse basket mansourifar et al 2011 moghaddam et al 2017 it performs better under a micro irrigation system chickpea yield was recorded highest under lewa low efficiency water application over the sprinkler surface and rain fed system the reported yields of 1 58 1 56 1 33 and and 1 02 t ha 1 under lewa sprinkler surface and rainfed systems were recorded lewa leads to 20 yield increase and 30 50 energy saving over the surface irrigation method singh et al 2006 irrigation at specific phases of crop growth viz one irrigation at pod filling stage with 50 mm of irrigation water or irrigation of 40 mm whenever soil moisture reaches the threshold of 25 of plant available water could be good agronomical practice to obtain seed yield of 2 35 and 2 3 t ha 1 respectively rinaldi et al 2008 skipping irrigation also proves better in improving water productivity terminating irrigation at the budding stage resulted in significant yield loss compared to termination at the flowering stage however chickpeas cultivated under normal irrigation yielded a higher of 2 12 t ha 1 as compared to termination at the budding 1 14 t ha 1 and flowering stage 1 37 t ha 1 hadi et al 2013 deficit irrigation practice shows that water stress during the vegetative stage enhances yield by 34 and water productivity by 16 as compared to full irrigation hirich et al 2014 whereas ahmed et al 2013 revealed that skipping one irrigation during flowering led to a significant reduction in growth and yield parameters similarly acharya et al 2015 found that the highest grain yield 2 31 t ha 1 was produced when irrigation was supplied at the vegetative stage followed by irrigation supplied at the flowering stage 2 29 t ha 1 and pod fill stage 2 10 t ha 1 respectively rain fed chickpeas resulted in higher yield 1 8 t ha 1 and higher water productivity 2 63 kg ha 1cm 1 as compared to irrigation treatments which had a detrimental effect on yield ali 2017 drip irrigation when provided at 100 pan evaporation recorded the highest seed yield of 1 78 t ha 1 compared to the lowest yield of 1 26 t ha 1 under drip irrigation when provided at 40 pan evaporation but in contrast irrigation at 40 pan evaporation registered the highest water productivity 7 24 kg ha 1mm 1 with the lowest water use 175 mm muniyappa et al 2017 drip irrigated chickpeas under the plain region recorded a higher return 2 13 t ha 1 than drip on ridges 2 01 t ha 1 the yield obtained under flood furrow and rain fed methods was 1 64 1 82 and 1 08 t ha 1 respectively singhal et al 2018 similarly ramesh et al 2020 reported that drip irrigation under clay loam soils at 30 and 50 days after sowing das was beneficial over rain fed higher seed yield 2 31 t ha 1 was recorded under drip at 30 and 50 das and thereby 46 14 more than rain fed 1 58 t ha 1 chickpea performs better under sole drip irrigation and sometimes integrates with mulching seed yield was recorded at 1 77 and 1 68 t ha 1 for drip irrigation with mulch with irrigation frequency at 1 day and 2 day interval respectively in india which was about 82 and 73 higher over the check basin 1 14 t ha 1 similarly there is an increment in water productivity of 5 4 and 5 2 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively as against 3 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 recorded in the check basin kumar et al 2021 on the other hand drip irrigated with silver poly mulching recorded higher yield and water productivity 3 9 t ha 1 and 17 21 kg ha 1 mm 1 over flood irrigation 1 74 t ha 1 and 3 74 kg ha 1 mm 1 rao et al 2021 4 3 cowpea it was reported that cowpea did not respond to ridge and furrow irrigation however being deep rooted cowpea performs well under sandy soils and is more tolerant to drought dadson et al 2003 and irrigation is essential to maximize yield akarsh et al 2020 found that irrigation at 15 days interval gave higher green pea yield 4 29 t ha 1 and b c 2 38 but in contrast lower water productivity was observed hence irrigation based at 0 6 cumulative pan evaporation cpe can be the next option under a limited water supply 4 4 green gram mini sprinkler irrigated green gram recorded the highest grain and haulm yield of 1 10 and 3 42 t ha 1 respectively however border irrigated green gram yielded less dabhi et al 1998 sprinkler irrigation increased yield by 39 7 over surface irrigation and resulted in a water saving of 49 8 velayutham and chandrasekaran 2002 on the other hand webber et al 2006 opined that compared to all irrigation methods an adaptation of alternate furrow irrigation in green gram resulted in a 25 water savings iipr 2014 reported that using micro irrigations a precision tillage significantly improved seed yield 31 with 11 water saving the adoption of sprinkler irrigation resulted in a 27 increase in yields over conventional irrigation and a 47 increase in net income the reported yield under the sprinkler and conventional irrigation was 1 43 and 1 04 t ha 1 respectively luxmini et al 2015 4 5 mung bean deficit irrigation at the flowering or reproductive stage was noted as the most sensitive growth stage with a 24 9 yield reduction and the lowest water productivity 2 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 yield increased linearly with the amount of irrigation applied at all the other stages but when water is scarce 50 uniform deficit irrigation can give the highest water productivity with 46 water saving ambachew et al 2014 sprinkler irrigation was advantageous for enhancing the irrigation efficiency even for 2 months duration of mung bean crop with 20 less water use and higher water productivity 24 over flood or normal irrigation at podding and seed setting iipr 2014 4 6 pea crop stage at around 50 flowering in field peas found to be more critical for irrigation water used for arkel pea variety under flood drip and micro sprinkler systems was 387 5 244 7 and 273 5 mm respectively rao et al 2016 also added that the percentage of water saving under micro sprinkler irrigation is less than the drip irrigation water productivity under micro sprinkler 2 65 kg ha 1 mm 1 was higher than under drip 2 49 kg ha 1 mm 1 irrigation and significantly higher than under conventional irrigation system 1 17 kg ha 1 mm 1 fertigation with micro sprinkler led to 60 9 less use of water and 10 0 higher green pod yield consequently water productivity increased by 3 12 times over surface irrigation with recommended doses of fertilizer saroch et al 2015 using real time soil moisture based drip irrigation arunadevi et al 2022 reported that the total amount of water applied under soil matric potential of i1 20 k pa i2 40 k pa i3 60 k pa and i4 80 k pa treatments was 170 9 163 1 159 2 and 153 7 mm respectively the maximum value of water use efficiency 11 kg ha 1 mm 1 was found in i2 treatment 4 7 pigeon pea pigeon pea is one promising pulse contributing to around 16 of the pulse food basket singh 2011 kumbhar et al 2015 singh et al 2018a it is sensitive to both types of irrigation and the number of irrigation seed yield with two irrigations was significantly higher 1 65 t ha 1 over one irrigation 1 43 t ha 1 and control 1 09 t ha 1 with protective irrigation pramod 2007 scheduling irrigation at 0 3 irrigation water cumulative pan evaporation iw cpe recorded higher water productivity 22 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 with water usage of 60 mm over scheduling at 0 9 iw cpe resulted in lower water productivity 5 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 with water requirement of 300 mm reddy et al 2008 drip irrigated at flowering and pod development registered higher water productivity 3 68 kg ha 1mm 1 compared to flooding 3 2 kg ha 1mm 1 where irrigation is given at all critical stages suresh et al 2013 irrigation at 120 of daily pan evaporation scheduled recorded significantly highest seed yield 3 01 t ha 1 and water productivity 4 33 kg ha 1mm 1 rani and sudhakar 2018 singh et al 2018a gave a comparative performance of pigeon peas under different establishment techniques conventional tillage ct minimum tillage mt reduced tillage rt zero tillage zt and broad bed furrow method bbf showed a significant difference in yield water productivity was highest in bbf 3 7 kg ha 1mm 1 bbf followed by zt 3 2 kg ha 1mm 1 mt 3 1 kg ha 1mm 1 and ct 3 1 kg ha 1mm 1 water productivity was significantly higher in short duration cultivar 3 5 kg ha 1mm 1 than in long duration 3 1 kg ha 1mm 1 vimalendran and latha 2014 claimed that drip irrigation performed better over the surface method with grain yield of 2 81 and 2 58 t ha 1 respectively there was an increased yield of 45 47 over surface irrigation with recommended doses of fertilizers through conventional fertilizer application 1 90 and 1 79 t ha 1 similarly pigeon pea performance at different stages concerning irrigation was also studied by praharaj et al 2017 they reported that drip irrigation at the branching and podding stage with 20 mm and providing ¼ of n ¼ of k at each stage resulted in higher yields of 3 46 t ha 1 but was at par with furrow irrigations 3 26 t ha 1 provided with full basal npk doses however water productivity was higher 6 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 under drip at branching with 20 mm of water and half doses at n and k megharani et al 2020 reported that sole cropping of pigeon pea with irrigation at 75 of cumulative pan evaporation resulted in higher yield 2 75 t ha 1 under drip irrigation as compared to intercropping with green gram black gram and soybean 5 pulses crop water production relationship the relationship between the marketable yield obtained and the total amount of water consumed by the crop through evapotranspiration et is defined as the crop water production function cwpf over a century of research has shown that et and yield are linearly correlated throughout the growing season the yield dependent variable depends on the amount of water used independent variable in various forms linearly crop output increases linearly as available water increases up to about 50 of the water used after losses occur as the amount of available water approaches adequacy due to system non uniformity and imprecision as well as soil homogeneity then the function takes a curvilinear shape crop water production functions for pulse crops are presented in table 6 applying more water after the whole crop water demand is met may reduce crop output owing to waterlogging lack of air in the root zone nutrient leaching and plant diseases english 1990 singh and bhushan 1980 quantified that for chickpeas in the field 110 240 mm of water was used similarly seed yield linearly increased with post flowering water in the range of 185 221 mm for field peas in australia mc donald 1995 reported that the average yields ranges from 0 87 to 1 29 t ha 1 the difference was largely related to the average rainfall 200 400 mm range received zhang 2003 found that for grain legume crops in northern syria the productivity of applied water gradually increases with an increase in water supply and reaches a plateau at maximum water productivity the maximum water productivity of chickpeas is about 5 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 and for lentils it is about 4 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 oweis et al 2004 quantified the relationship between yields and et of chickpeas for early normal and late sowing as linear the resulting equations gave a higher correlation and more realistic values of et ranging from 48 to 95 mm with an average of 73 mm jalota et al 2006 reported that yields of chickpeas under irrigated conditions could be achieved with more availability of soil water at sowing and avoiding water stress at flowering pod filling and grain developmental stages according to ilhe et al 2009 the yield follows the second order polynomial relationship with the depth of irrigation water used but yield increases as the depth of water is applied to 3 12 cm with a yield of 2 59 t ha 1 later on there is no increase in yields with an increase in water depth the mean yield range was 1 02 2 59 t ha 1 for major irrigated crops in southern alberta bennet and harms 2011 computed the relationship between alfalfa crop yield and field water supply fws as linear where fws is taken in mm which is equal to irrigation at 80 efficiency effective growing season precipitation stored soil moisture depletion dogan et al 2013 in chickpea opined that irrigation amounts were regressed with yield using a polynomial model the amount of irrigation water supplied ranges from 200 to 250 mm the yield obtained was 1 95 t ha 1 and biomass as 6 0 t ha 1 jabow et al 2015 found that grain yield varied from 0 23 to 1 47 t ha 1 and et range from 2009 to 3590 m3 ha 1 within this range yield increased by 58 6 kg ha 1 for each 100 m3 increase in et whereas et threshold value is 1264 m3 ha 1 similarly bhowmik et al 2020 computed the relationship between cowpea seed yield and the quantity of irrigation water applied as a linear relationship they also observed that the highest reduction in seed yield was observed with deficit irrigation scheduled at 60 mm cumulative pan evaporation cpe 9 9 followed by cpe 50 mm 5 5 on the other hand in broad bean patra et al 2021 reported that seed yield increased with the amount of irrigation water marketable yield responded linearly with increasing seasonal water application and reached a peak of 4 76 t ha 1 with 200 mm of irrigation water with a water productivity of 19 36 kg ha 1mm 1 6 strategies for enhancing water productivity of pulses among the farmers pulses are not selected as the first choice because of their low productivity over the past few years the demand for pulses been growing causing a gap between supply and consumption this gap might increase because of an increase in population there will be a requirement of 39 m t total pulses by 2050 which will require an annual growth rate of 2 2 the mean agricultural productivity of irrigated areas is 2 8 t ha 1 which is higher than the mean productivity of rain fed agriculture 1 1 t ha 1 arora 2013 kijne et al 2003 so there is a need to enhance productivity which can be done through cultivating pulses under irrigated and efficient water management practices some salient strategies for pulse production enhancement are adequate drainage critical stage based irrigation and deficit irrigation described in the following sub sections 6 1 adequate drainage creating a drainage facility does influence the yield of pulses as irrigation and drainage go hand in hand while providing irrigation we need to be assured about the removal of excess water also for rain fed pulse it is mandatory to have drainage provision excess soil moisture or water logging during the rainy season and unseasonal rainfall even during winter creates unfavourable conditions for crop growth including reduced aeration hampered nodulation reduced nutrient uptake and a favourable environment for blight and seedling rot resulting in reduced crop stand and poor yield praharaj et al 2015a the effect of suitable land configurations such as ridge and raised bed planting have a role in maintaining optimum plant population and crop productivity over flat planting or broadcasting singh et al 2015 ridges made at 60 75 cm height leaving 30 cm wide furrows for rainwater drainage yield better results over flatbed planting two to three rows of short duration legumes such as mung bean and urd bean can be successfully planted on ridges pigeon pea cultivated on ridges yields more when compared to yields produced on flat beds in lowland soils that become waterlogged during the rainy season singh et al 1998 suggested planting pigeon peas on raised beds ridges and furrows and ridges and furrows enhanced yield by 44 and 37 respectively over the standard flatbed method they observed that ridge building loosens the soil increases water infiltration and percolation and prevents water from pooling in the field raised bed system of planting has a similar beneficial effect praharaj et al 2015b the water productivity of pigeon pea cluster bean and green gram under furrow irrigated raised bed firbs was 76 44 and 54 more than that of their flat sown crops also firbs resulted in a 22 higher grain yield of pigeon pea 8 of cluster beans and 15 of green gram compared with flat sown crops dhindwal et al 2006 6 2 critical stage irrigation critical stage based irrigation has promising potential for scheduling irrigation under deficit conditions it can also be followed most of the pulse crops show better response in yield while irrigating during the flowering stage the critical growth period is a growth stageplant s growth stage at which moisture stress exercises the greatest influence on both the quantity and quality of produce marwein and ray 2019 hirich et al 2014 reported that providing water stress during the vegetative stage increased yield by 34 and crop water productivity by 16 as providing water stress during the vegetative stage increased yield by 34 and crop water productivity by 16 compared to full irrigation moisture stress during the flowering pod fill period has a drastic impact on yield some pulse crops like red gram black gram and green gram are grown in the summer season as irrigated crops need 3 4 irrigations at critical stages like germination flowering and pod formation kannan 2019 6 3 deficit irrigation this method is mostly practiced under arid and semi arid agro climatic conditions to enhance water productivity deficit irrigation is a practice where a crop is irrigated with water below the full requirement for optimal plant growth the main role of such practice is to reduce the amount of water used for irrigating crops and positively improve the response of plants to a certain degree of water deficit thereby increasing the crop s water productivity chai et al 2016 the yield and water productivity for pulse under deficit irrigation are presented in table 7 it may be inferred from table 7 that supplying water at 15 days interval decreased yield but enhanced water productivity by 6 06 compared to full irrigation in chickpeas jabow et al 2015 similarly for mung bean hussen et al 2019 found that irrigating crops with 100 of crop water requirement resulted in higher yields 1 12 t ha 1 but lower water productivity in contrast irrigating crops with 50 water used increased water productivity by 24 over full irrigation thus deficit irrigation may be treated as an important tool to reduce irrigation water use under water limiting situations fereres and soriano 2007 jabow et al 2015 admasu et al 2019 7 conclusions one of the major constraints in pulse production is limitation of irrigation water hence efficient water management strategies like micro irrigations critical stage based irrigations resource conservation techniques bed planting mulching etc play an important role in increasing water productivity besides conserving in situ soil moisture micro irrigation practice in pulse increases 31 yield and 43 water productivity deficit irrigation strategy should be encouraged in arid and semi arid regions which increased water productivity to a tune of 24 ridge planting of pulses enhances water productivity to a tune of 22 compared to the normal method mulching practices also recorded yield enhancement of up to 9 hence involving these practices not only ensures better pulse productivity but also assures natural nitrogen fixation for better soil health declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

9013,the majority of pulses provide nutritional security to humankind apart from having environmental service in enriching soil health cultivated over 95 75 million hectares the average pulse productivity is around 1 0 t ha 1 pulses perform better under irrigated conditions irrigation water as a critical input ensures enhancing productivity for pulse crops the irrigation water used by pulses varies widely it is as low as 5 7 mm during rainy season to 609 mm during the dry season accordingly the average water productivity of major pulse ranges from 0 67 to 7 51 kg ha 1mm 1 various innovative approaches for enhancing water productivity can be adopted which help minimize water losses thereby increasing yields adopting micro irrigation for pulses reduces water consumption and thereby increases yield substantially under water limited situations deficit or critical stage based pulses irrigation also ensures higher water productivity bed planting ridge and furrow planting are proven methods for pulses to increase water productivity by 20 40 due to easy aeration reduced lodging and easy access to intercultural operations however irrigation methods have a more significant impact on the quality of pulses pulse production functions show a linear relationship with irrigation water as one of the inputs during the growing period this paper emphasizes the strategies followed globally to enhance the water productivity of major pulses like chickpeas cowpeas pigeon peas lentils black and green gram and beans keywords deficit irrigation micro irrigations pulses residual crops and water productivity functions data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction pulses are one of the important ingredients in a global vegetarian diet commonly known as poor man s protein source as they contain 20 25 of protein singh 2011 marwein and ray 2019 yadav et al 2019 they also provide environmental services in restoring soil health intact the production of pulses varies widely under rain fed and irrigated conditions pulses which are mainly grown in rain fed situations experience moisture stress which is one of the reasons for low productivity however under irrigated conditions productivity enhances up to three times that of a rain fed situation singh et al 2010 therefore proper utilization of irrigation water under moisture stress situations can increase water productivity and also economic yield the total amount of water used i e amount of rainfall along with irrigation water if provided any during the growth period can be defined as the water use for pulse crop water is the most crucial input for agricultural production and is becoming a major limiting factor in agriculture because of the unpredictable nature of rainfall and increasing demands from other sectors gowda et al 2009a marwein et al 2017 globally agriculture accounts for more than 80 of all freshwater used by humans most of which is for crop production morison et al 2008 rain fed agriculture accounts for 60 of production in developing countries and during the 21st century most of the water used for crop production is derived from rain fed soil moisture even though irrigation benefits only 10 of agricultural water consumption and covers 20 of cropped land it accounts for 40 of total food production to meet the increasing food demand and to ensure nutritional food security the food and agriculture organisation fao has predicted to expand irrigated land to about 45 m ha in 93 developing countries by 2030 fao 2006 the value of water productivity which is one of the yardsticks for measuring how efficiently pulse crops use water needs to be enhanced by suitable means water productivity is a simple ratio of crop yield to total amount of water used by the crop during its growing period and can be improved by increasing output with the same amount of water or by producing the same output with less water mustafa et al 2008 this also means obtaining more crop yield per unit of irrigation water kijne et al 2003 irrigation scheduling can be managed precisely using efficient water management technologies to meet crop water demands holding the promise of increasing yield and quality besides conserving water kadasiddappa et al 2017 efficient water management practices such as micro irrigation can enhance water productivity under arid and semi arid conditions optimal water utilization can be achieved by adopting deficit irrigation practices and critical growth stages of irrigation in which minimum yields are compromised to obtain more water productivity adopting deficit irrigation also leads to an 8 increase in water productivity for chickpeas under arid conditions jabow et al 2015 due to water shortage irrigation water applied must be quantified to predict the changes in yield similarly crop water production functions cwpfs are also indicators for efficient utilization of applied water in nexus with yield cwpfs define optimum water application for maximizing economic benefit varzi 2016 globally pulses share is only 5 of the total protein consumption to bridge the growing demand and raise their per capita availability countries made efforts to increase production and explore trade opportunities to augment domestic supply the main objective of this paper is to analyze the water productivity of major pulse crops cultivated around the globe with suitable critical suggestions for necessary improvement 2 global pulses production from the end of the 20th century until the first decade of the 21st century global pulses production grew at an annual rate of 1 3 stagnari et al 2017 statista 2020 the combined percentage share of pea chickpeas and dry bean is around 65 in global major pulses production the respective percentage share in dry beans 32 peas 19 chickpeas 14 cowpea 7 broad bean 7 lentil 6 and others 15 has been reported by several researchers gowda et al 2009b dhivya et al 2020 marwein and ray 2021 over the past few years the demand for pulses has been increasing steadily causing a gap between production and consumption this gap might increase because of an increase in population leading to more consumption india the second most populous country in the world will require around 39 mt of total pulses by 2050 which will require an annual growth rate of 2 2 statista 2022 the global pulse production during the last decade is shown in fig 1 it can be depicted from fig 1 that in 2017 the production was highest and reached 94 79 m t however an average of 70 m t of production was maintained annually during the last decade globally average pulse production and productivity in major continents are shown in fig 2 it may be noted from fig 2 that asia produces the maximum pulse 29 07 m t whereas the productivity is highest in europe the percentage share of pulse production in the three continents asia europe and america is more than 80 more than 45 of world pulses are produced from the asia continent which was the highest among all continents with continent africa being the second highest with the production of 12 86 m t pulse productivity was recorded highest in europe with more than 2 0 t ha 1 while it was lowest in africa 0 6 t ha 1 major pulse producing countries with production and area coverage under different pulses are shown in fig 3 under asian countries higher production is recorded for india china and myanmar similarly higher production is also recorded in ethiopia an african country the usa canada and brazil are major producers and under european country russia produces more among all the countries india is the largest producer of pulses accounting for 25 of total pulses production occupying an area of 30 5 m ha with an average productivity of 0 66 t ha 1 statista 2022 even though the area and production were highest the productivity was much lower the productivity was highest in canada with 2 03 t ha 1 3 water consumption and potential yield of pulse pulse crops require less irrigation water than cereals gowda et al 2009b however water used for pulses also varied widely which may be due to varieties used in trials or may be due to agro climatic conditions where the field experiments were carried out the water used by five major pulse crops is presented in table 1 black gram grown during the summer season required higher water than that grown during the winter the range of water used varies between 400 and 500 mm for chickpeas the range is 330 440 mm green gram cultivated during the rainy season in myanmar uses less irrigation water 5 7 mm however the rainy season grown green gram uses 210 325 mm of irrigation water in india winter season grown lentils and gram used around 175 5 mm of water in india the water used for pigeon peas varies between 540 and 600 mm it may be noted that the water used for the long duration pulse is more than the short duration apart from location and agro climatic condition there is a variation in yield as recorded for major pulse crops around the globe yield also depends on the method of irrigation taken up different irrigation methods have been shown to substantially impact pulse production this is because the quantum of water used is less under micro irrigation than other irrigation methods the yield performance of major crops under a surface irrigation system is presented in table 2 the ridge and furrow method of irrigation showed a better result with yield enhancement it may be due to optimum soil moisture with a uniform flow of water lesser weed competition because of the lesser area of the wetted periphery and enhanced yield attributes in the case of chickpeas pramanik et al 2009 pawar et al 2013 and cowpea by lawand et al 1993 somasundaram et al 2000 ridges and furrows gave more yields due to proper maintenance of soil air water equilibrium throughout the rhizosphere growth period which gave more nitrogen fixation and resulted in favorable enhancement of growth attributes in contrast vijayalakshmi and rajagopal 1995 claimed that the yield of black gram is highest in flat beds due to an increase in the soil moisture retention capacity combined with enhanced soil moisture status resulting in improved seed development in black gram for pigeon peas sharma et al 2018 found that higher seed yield under ridge and furrow treatment was due to higher dry matter production which resulted in higher production of photosynthesis resulting in the superiority of yield attributing characters and ultimately high yield as compared to conventional planting or flatbed planting bed planting has been shown to increase water productivity by 20 40 reduce seed rate provision easy access to intercultural operations easy aeration and reduce lodging aggarwal and goswami 2003 fahong et al 2004 jani et al 2008 because pulses are vulnerable to water stress or flooding the bed planting approach helps provide moisture to the crop by changing the soil environment indian council agricultural research icar an institute of repute under the government of india implementing teaching research and extension through the umbrella of networking institutions via the all india coordinated on pulses improvement project aicpip made best efforts to popularise pulse production due to high operational expenses farmers are not practicing pulse cultivation however with icar aicrp intervention broad bed furrow planting in pigeon pea groundnut and other pulse crops gained popularity and was accepted by farmers optimal crop stand proper irrigation scheduling and proper drainage resulted in higher productivity stagnari et al 2017 jadav et al 2020 3 1 water conservation technologies water conservation with appropriate agro technologies also referred to as resource conservation techniques rct involving new crop production technologies usually associated with a reduction in tillage operations mechanical operations appropriate crop or animal husbandry with suitable crop s or cropping farming systems and more biomass crop or residue retention on the soil surface two basic principles of rcts viz no tillage and retention of nearly 20 25 of crop residue on the soil surface ali et al 2014 hedayetullah and sadhukhan 2018 found that the broadcasting of chickpea seed in standing rice before 15 days of its harvest relay crop resulted in higher yield 1 44 and 1 41 t ha 1 for two consecutive years mulching is also one of the resource conservation techniques where organic and inorganic materials are applied on the soil surface as a blanket table 3 presents the effect of mulching on water productivity and yield of different pulses mulching resulted in increasing water productivity and yield of pulses mulching affects soil moisture content and temperature which influences crop output various organic mulches can help alleviate in situ soil moisture stress marwein et al 2017 dhivya et al 2020 organic mulching reduces soil disturbance at the surface allowing soil moisture to be conserved baumhardt and jones 2002 zhang et al 2009 icrisat 2016 for example mitra and bhattacharya 2005 reported that for green gram cultivation an application of straw mulch 5 t ha 1 resulted in 1 3 1 7 times higher seed yield of green gram compared to non mulch control similarly in cowpea choudhary et al 2013 revealed that the application of plastic mulch and straw mulch significantly increased the number of branches per plant seeds per pod and seed yield over control or dust mulch compared to no mulch in garden pea paddy straw mulching 10 t ha 1 significantly increased pods per plant green pod weight per plant and green pod output saroch and sandal 2014 in pigeon peas mathukia et al 2015 found that plant height branches per plant pods per plant and grains per pod were highest under wheat straw mulch grain yield under wheat straw mulch 1 38 t ha 1 was at par with grain yield under groundnut shell mulch 1 32 t ha 1 singh and rana 2006 fym organic mulch kaolin spray was having highest water productivity in mustard and lentil cropping systems where the mustard equivalent yields are also found to be highest similarly in both ground nuts and lentils rice straw mulch was found with high yield and water productivity banik and sharma 2008 in summer mung bean mulch application at 25 days after sowing was found to be effective with the highest water productivity and yield over mulching at sowing time and control ram et al 2016 according to sarkar et al 2016 application of black polyethylene mulch in chickpeas led to 8 increase in water productivity and a 9 yield enhancement over control no mulch however it was highest over organic mulches such as straw mulch or water hyacinth mulch by 6 and 14 in pigeon peas rao et al 2018 reported that silver mulch was more effective than black mulch but under control straw mulch and black plastic mulch jadav et al 2020 found that black plastic mulch was more effective by 48 over control and 6 over organic straw mulch considering economic yield 4 performance of pulses under different methods of irrigation the practice of irrigation always aims to obtain the maximum yield of marketable products from a given quantity of applied water there is a positive response of pulse crops to all methods of irrigation however under micro irrigation systems the value of water productivity increases desta et al 2015 kumari et al 2017 micro irrigation involving drip fertigation and sprinkler irrigation is very effective for on farm allocation and management of precious water chaudhury et al 2005 the water productivity and yields of major pulses irrigated at different stages are presented in table 4 in the event of acute moisture stress one or two irrigations directly applied to the root zone of the crops enhance crop performance hence choosing an appropriate irrigation method is necessary to increase efficiency and save water farmers need to recognize critical growth stages when maximum yield response to irrigation will occur during the initial stages the crop uses water for germination and water shortage will prevent seeds to germinate reducing crop stand per area and severely affecting final yield water deficit during the reproductive stage reduces the number of grains and grain weight decreasing the yield various irrigation scheduling approaches viz soil moisture depletion pattern sensitive crop growth stage and cumulative evaporation climatological approaches and combination of approaches are used for maximizing crop growth and benefit tolk and howell 2003 zhang 2003 payero et al 2005 admasu et al 2019 one of the important approaches for effective on farm water management of allocated precious irrigation water is drip and sprinkler irrigation praharaj et al 2016 goyal and ray 2022 it has several advantages over conventional methods of irrigation practices viz enhances both conveyance and water productivity direct application to the root zone of plants can be combined with other nutrients agrochemicals inputs and frequent intervals in precise quantities as per the crop water requirement chaudhury et al 2005 moreover fertilizers can be combined with drip water thus the precision application of water results in lesser weeds and pests and greater pod retention ramamurthy et al 2009 the yield water productivity and pulse water used under micro irrigations are presented in table 5 it may be noted from table 5 that the water requirement is substantially less thereby enhancement of water productivity black gram yield performance was significantly better under a sprinkler irrigation system this is because the consumption of water in sprinkler irrigation was less however the adoption of sprinkler irrigation at 100 pan evaporation increased yields by 9 4 over the surface and the adoption of sprinkler irrigation at 50 pan evaporation led to an increase of water productivity by 53 over the surface method kumar and yadav 2018 similarly rao et al 2016 reported that adopting drip and sprinklers decreased water consumption by 37 and 30 but increased yield by 31 and 67 and water productivity by 12 and 26 over the surface method of irrigation moreover in summer pulses micro irrigation management showed a significant improvement in seed yield 31 with water saving 11 less water use and 43 2 enhanced water productivity recorded in summer mung bean with precision tillage carried out by laser leveler praharaj et al 2015a thus adopting micro irrigation enhances pulse production and increases water productivity the performance of major pulses viz black gram chickpea cowpea green gram mungbean pea and pigeon pea under different irrigation methods and strategies to enhance productivity is presented under the following structured sub sections 4 1 blackgram black gram is a potential pulse crop that contains 26 protein almost three times that of cereals and other minerals and vitamins it fixes nitrogen n and is equivalent to 22 10 kg n ha 1 which has been estimated to supplement 59 000 tonnes of urea annually dhivya and ray 2020 velayutham and chandrasekaran 2002 reported that two times irrigating through a sprinkler at 2 0 cm depth black gram yielded 1 50 t ha 1 and water productivity of 38 kg ha 1 mm 1 black gram grown under rain fed situations showed yield difference when a dry spell coincides with the flowering stage wang et al 2003 nilanthi et al 2014 singh et al 2018b however under irrigated situations more yield has been recorded sprinklers irrigated on rice fallow black gram recorded enhancement in yield and yield attributes over flooding sprinkler irrigation resulted in a seed yield of 0 81 t ha 1 followed by flooding with 0 73 t ha 1 this might be due to excess soil moisture with flooding which prolonged the vegetative period even after flowering and reduced seed yield kalpana and selvi 2008 flood irrigation at branching flowering and podding resulted in higher yields of 0 85 t ha 1 malliswari et al 2008 adt 5 black gram variety yielded higher over pbg 4 and vbn bg 6 under both sprinkler and surface irrigation methods the seed yield of adt 5 with sprinkler irrigation at 100 pan evaporation was 1 21 t ha 1 and was at par with surface irrigation at 1 18 t ha 1 water saving under the sprinkler and 100 pan evaporation based irrigation was 23 1 and 25 4 respectively compared to surface irrigation kumar et al 2018 similarly black gram variety vbn 11 irrigated under 75 etc crop evapotranspiration resulted in higher plant height 40 45 cm the number of branches per plant 19 68 haulm yield 1 78 t ha 1 as compared to a surface method of irrigation vishnu et al 2021 similarly black gram performed better under the maize black gram cropping system also during the rainy season a 0 8 t ha 1 yield was recorded and during winter highest yield 1 2 t ha 1 was obtained with drip fertigation and 100 recommended doses of water soluble fertilizers this treatment resulted in a 37 increase in yield over surface application ramah 2019 sprinkler irrigated black gram sown by machine under flatbed conditions used less water 431 2 mm and recorded higher water productivity 2 08 kg ha 1 mm 1 as well as saving of water up to 14 5 and higher yield of 1 29 t ha 1 as compared to the conventional practices of check basin irrigation kannan 2019 the performance of black gram under an organic environment was found to be better with a yield of 1 04 t ha 1 organic amendments seed priming mulching and manuring had significantly influenced the growth and yield of black gram dhivya and ray 2020 4 2 chickpea chickpea is one of the major pulses which contributes around 40 to the global pulse basket mansourifar et al 2011 moghaddam et al 2017 it performs better under a micro irrigation system chickpea yield was recorded highest under lewa low efficiency water application over the sprinkler surface and rain fed system the reported yields of 1 58 1 56 1 33 and and 1 02 t ha 1 under lewa sprinkler surface and rainfed systems were recorded lewa leads to 20 yield increase and 30 50 energy saving over the surface irrigation method singh et al 2006 irrigation at specific phases of crop growth viz one irrigation at pod filling stage with 50 mm of irrigation water or irrigation of 40 mm whenever soil moisture reaches the threshold of 25 of plant available water could be good agronomical practice to obtain seed yield of 2 35 and 2 3 t ha 1 respectively rinaldi et al 2008 skipping irrigation also proves better in improving water productivity terminating irrigation at the budding stage resulted in significant yield loss compared to termination at the flowering stage however chickpeas cultivated under normal irrigation yielded a higher of 2 12 t ha 1 as compared to termination at the budding 1 14 t ha 1 and flowering stage 1 37 t ha 1 hadi et al 2013 deficit irrigation practice shows that water stress during the vegetative stage enhances yield by 34 and water productivity by 16 as compared to full irrigation hirich et al 2014 whereas ahmed et al 2013 revealed that skipping one irrigation during flowering led to a significant reduction in growth and yield parameters similarly acharya et al 2015 found that the highest grain yield 2 31 t ha 1 was produced when irrigation was supplied at the vegetative stage followed by irrigation supplied at the flowering stage 2 29 t ha 1 and pod fill stage 2 10 t ha 1 respectively rain fed chickpeas resulted in higher yield 1 8 t ha 1 and higher water productivity 2 63 kg ha 1cm 1 as compared to irrigation treatments which had a detrimental effect on yield ali 2017 drip irrigation when provided at 100 pan evaporation recorded the highest seed yield of 1 78 t ha 1 compared to the lowest yield of 1 26 t ha 1 under drip irrigation when provided at 40 pan evaporation but in contrast irrigation at 40 pan evaporation registered the highest water productivity 7 24 kg ha 1mm 1 with the lowest water use 175 mm muniyappa et al 2017 drip irrigated chickpeas under the plain region recorded a higher return 2 13 t ha 1 than drip on ridges 2 01 t ha 1 the yield obtained under flood furrow and rain fed methods was 1 64 1 82 and 1 08 t ha 1 respectively singhal et al 2018 similarly ramesh et al 2020 reported that drip irrigation under clay loam soils

performs better under sole drip irrigation and sometimes integrates with mulching seed yield was recorded at 1 77 and 1 68 t ha 1 for drip irrigation with mulch with irrigation frequency at 1 day and 2 day interval respectively in india which was about 82 and 73 higher over the check basin 1 14 t ha 1 similarly there is an increment in water productivity of 5 4 and 5 2 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively as against 3 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 recorded in the check basin kumar et al 2021 on the other hand drip irrigated with silver poly mulching recorded higher yield and water productivity 3 9 t ha 1 and 17 21 kg ha 1 mm 1 over flood irrigation 1 74 t ha 1 and 3 74 kg ha 1 mm 1 rao et al 2021 4 3 cowpea it was reported that cowpea did not respond to ridge and furrow irrigation however being deep rooted cowpea performs well under sandy soils and is more tolerant to drought dadson et al 2003 and irrigation is essential to maximize yield akarsh et al 2020 found that irrigation at 15 days interval gave higher green pea yield 4 29 t ha 1 and b c 2 38 but in contrast lower water productivity was observed hence irrigation based at 0 6 cumulative pan evaporation cpe can be the next option under a limited water supply 4 4 green gram mini sprinkler irrigated green gram recorded the highest grain and haulm yield of 1 10 and 3 42 t ha 1 respectively however border irrigated green gram yielded less dabhi et al 1998 sprinkler irrigation increased yield by 39 7 over surface irrigation and resulted in a water saving of 49 8 velayutham and chandrasekaran 2002 on the other hand webber et al 2006 opined that compared to all irrigation methods an adaptation of alternate furrow irrigation in green gram resulted in a 25 water savings iipr 2014 reported that using micro irrigations a precision tillage significantly improved seed yield 31 with 11 water saving the adoption of sprinkler irrigation resulted in a 27 increase in yields over conventional irrigation and a 47 increase in net income the reported yield under the sprinkler and conventional irrigation was 1 43 and 1 04 t ha 1 respectively luxmini et al 2015 4 5 mung bean deficit irrigation at the flowering or reproductive stage was noted as the most sensitive growth stage with a 24 9 yield reduction and the lowest water productivity 2 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 yield increased linearly with the amount of irrigation applied at all the other stages but when water is scarce 50 uniform deficit irrigation can give the highest water productivity with 46 water saving ambachew et al 2014 sprinkler irrigation was advantageous for enhancing the irrigation efficiency even for 2 months duration of mung bean crop with 20 less water use and higher water productivity 24 over flood or normal irrigation at podding and seed setting iipr 2014 4 6 pea crop stage at around 50 flowering in field peas found to be more critical for irrigation water used for arkel pea variety under flood drip and micro sprinkler systems was 387 5 244 7 and 273 5 mm respectively rao et al 2016 also added that the percentage of water saving under micro sprinkler irrigation is less than the drip irrigation water productivity under micro sprinkler 2 65 kg ha 1 mm 1 was higher than under drip 2 49 kg ha 1 mm 1 irrigation and significantly higher than under conventional irrigation system 1 17 kg ha 1 mm 1 fertigation with micro sprinkler led to 60 9 less use of water and 10 0 higher green pod yield consequently water productivity increased by 3 12 times over surface irrigation with recommended doses of fertilizer saroch et al 2015 using real time soil moisture based drip irrigation arunadevi et al 2022 reported that the total amount of water applied under soil matric potential of i1 20 k pa i2 40 k pa i3 60 k pa and i4 80 k pa treatments was 170 9

the pulse food basket singh 2011 kumbhar et al 2015 singh et al 2018a it is sensitive to both types of irrigation and the number of irrigation seed yield with two irrigations was significantly higher 1 65 t ha 1 over one irrigation 1 43 t ha 1 and control 1 09 t ha 1 with protective irrigation pramod 2007 scheduling irrigation at 0 3 irrigation water cumulative pan evaporation iw cpe recorded higher water productivity 22 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 with water usage of 60 mm over scheduling at 0 9 iw cpe resulted in lower water productivity 5 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 with water requirement of 300 mm reddy et al 2008 drip irrigated at flowering and pod development registered higher water productivity 3 68 kg ha 1mm 1 compared to flooding 3 2 kg ha 1mm 1 where irrigation is given at all critical stages suresh

gave a comparative performance of pigeon peas under different establishment techniques conventional tillage ct minimum tillage mt reduced tillage rt zero tillage zt and broad bed furrow method bbf showed a significant difference in yield water productivity was highest in bbf 3 7 kg ha 1mm 1 bbf followed by zt 3 2 kg ha 1mm 1 mt 3 1 kg ha 1mm 1 and ct 3 1 kg ha 1mm 1 water productivity was significantly higher in short duration cultivar 3 5 kg ha 1mm 1 than in long duration 3 1 kg ha 1mm 1 vimalendran and latha 2014 claimed that drip irrigation performed better over the surface method with grain yield of 2 81 and 2 58 t ha 1 respectively there was an increased yield of 45 47 over surface irrigation with recommended doses of fertilizers through conventional fertilizer application 1 90 and 1 79 t ha 1 similarly pigeon pea performance at different stages concerning irrigation was also studied by praharaj et al 2017 they reported that drip irrigation at the branching and podding stage with 20 mm and providing ¼ of n ¼ of k at each stage resulted in higher yields of 3 46 t ha 1 but was at par with furrow irrigations 3 26 t ha 1 provided with full basal npk doses however water productivity was higher 6 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 under drip at branching with 20 mm of water and half doses at n and k megharani et al 2020 reported that sole cropping of pigeon pea with irrigation at 75 of cumulative pan evaporation resulted in higher yield 2 75 t ha 1 under drip irrigation as compared to intercropping with green gram black gram and soybean 5 pulses crop water production relationship the relationship between the marketable yield obtained and the total amount of water consumed by the crop through evapotranspiration et is defined as the crop water production function cwpf over a century of research has shown that et and yield are linearly correlated throughout the growing season the yield dependent variable depends on the amount of water used independent variable in various forms linearly crop output increases linearly as available water increases up to about 50 of the water used after losses occur as the amount of available water approaches adequacy due to system non uniformity and imprecision as well as soil homogeneity then the function takes a curvilinear shape crop water production functions for pulse crops are presented in table 6 applying more water after the whole crop water demand is met may reduce crop output owing to waterlogging lack of air in the root zone nutrient leaching and plant diseases english 1990 singh and bhushan 1980 quantified that for chickpeas in the field 110 240 mm of water was used similarly seed yield linearly increased with post flowering water in the range of 185 221 mm for field peas in australia mc donald 1995 reported that the average yields ranges from 0 87 to 1 29 t ha 1 the difference was largely related to the average rainfall 200 400 mm range received zhang 2003 found that for grain legume crops in northern syria the productivity of applied water gradually increases with an increase in water supply and reaches a plateau at maximum water productivity the maximum water productivity of chickpeas is about 5 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 and for lentils it is about 4 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 oweis et al 2004 quantified the relationship between yields and et of chickpeas for early normal and late sowing as linear the resulting equations gave a higher correlation and more realistic values of et ranging from 48 to 95 mm with an average of 73 mm jalota et al 2006 reported that yields of chickpeas under irrigated conditions could be achieved with more availability of soil water at sowing and avoiding water stress at flowering pod filling and grain developmental stages according to ilhe et al 2009 the yield follows the second order polynomial relationship with the depth of irrigation water used but yield increases as the depth of water is applied to 3 12 cm with a yield of 2 59 t ha 1 later on there is no increase in yields with an increase in water depth the mean yield range was 1 02 2 59 t ha 1 for major irrigated crops in southern alberta bennet and harms 2011 computed the relationship between alfalfa crop yield and field water supply fws as linear where fws is taken in mm which is equal to irrigation at 80 efficiency effective growing season precipitation stored soil moisture depletion dogan et al 2013 in chickpea opined that irrigation amounts were regressed with yield using a polynomial model the amount of irrigation water supplied ranges from 200 to 250 mm the yield obtained was 1 95 t ha 1 and biomass as 6 0 t ha 1 jabow et al 2015 found that grain yield varied from 0 23 to 1 47 t ha 1 and et range from 2009 to 3590 m3 ha 1 within this range yield increased by 58 6 kg ha 1 for each 100 m3 increase in et whereas et threshold value is 1264 m3 ha 1 similarly bhowmik et al 2020 computed the relationship between cowpea seed yield and the quantity of irrigation water applied as a linear relationship they also observed that the highest reduction in seed yield was observed with deficit irrigation scheduled at 60 mm cumulative pan evaporation cpe 9 9 followed by cpe 50 mm 5 5 on the other hand in broad bean patra et al 2021 reported that seed yield increased with the amount of irrigation water marketable yield responded linearly with increasing seasonal water application and reached a peak of 4 76 t ha 1 with 200 mm of irrigation water with a water productivity of 19 36 kg ha 1mm 1 6 strategies for enhancing water productivity of pulses among the farmers pulses are not selected as the first choice because of their low productivity over the past few years the demand for pulses been growing causing a gap between supply and consumption this gap might increase because of an increase in population there will be a requirement of 39 m t total pulses by 2050 which will require an annual growth rate of 2 2 the mean agricultural productivity of irrigated areas is 2 8 t ha 1 which is higher than the mean productivity of rain fed agriculture 1 1 t ha 1 arora 2013 kijne et al 2003 so there is a need to enhance productivity which can be done through cultivating pulses under irrigated and efficient water management practices some salient strategies for pulse production enhancement are adequate drainage critical stage based irrigation and deficit irrigation described in the following sub sections 6 1 adequate drainage creating a drainage facility does influence the yield of pulses as irrigation and drainage go hand in hand while providing irrigation we need to be assured about the removal of excess water also for rain fed pulse it is mandatory to have drainage provision excess soil moisture or water logging during the rainy season and unseasonal rainfall even during winter creates unfavourable conditions for crop growth including reduced aeration hampered nodulation reduced nutrient uptake and a favourable environment for blight and seedling rot resulting in reduced crop stand and poor yield praharaj et al 2015a the effect of suitable land configurations such as ridge and raised bed planting have a role in maintaining optimum plant population and crop productivity over flat planting or broadcasting singh et al 2015 ridges made at 60 75 cm height leaving 30 cm wide furrows for rainwater drainage yield better results over flatbed planting two to three rows of short duration legumes such as mung bean and urd bean can be successfully planted on ridges pigeon pea cultivated on ridges yields more when compared to yields produced on flat beds in lowland soils that become waterlogged during the rainy season singh et al 1998 suggested planting pigeon peas on raised beds ridges and furrows and ridges and furrows enhanced yield by 44 and 37 respectively over the standard flatbed method they observed that ridge building loosens the soil increases water infiltration and percolation and prevents water from pooling in the field raised bed system of planting has a similar beneficial effect praharaj et al 2015b the water productivity of pigeon pea cluster bean and green gram under furrow irrigated raised bed firbs was 76 44 and 54 more than that of their flat sown crops also firbs resulted in a 22 higher grain yield of pigeon pea 8 of cluster beans and 15 of green gram compared with flat sown crops dhindwal et al 2006 6 2 critical stage irrigation critical stage based irrigation has promising potential for scheduling irrigation under deficit conditions it can also be followed most of the pulse crops show better response in yield while irrigating during the flowering stage the critical growth period is a growth stageplant s growth stage at which moisture stress exercises the greatest influence on both the quantity and quality of produce marwein and ray 2019 hirich et al 2014 reported that providing water stress during the vegetative stage increased yield by 34 and crop water productivity by 16 as providing water stress during the vegetative stage increased yield by 34 and crop water productivity by 16 compared to full irrigation moisture stress during the flowering pod fill period has a drastic impact on yield some pulse crops like red gram black gram and green gram are grown in the summer season as irrigated crops need 3 4 irrigations at critical stages like germination flowering and pod formation kannan 2019 6 3 deficit irrigation this method is mostly practiced under arid and semi arid agro climatic conditions to enhance water productivity deficit irrigation is a practice where a crop is irrigated with water below the full requirement for optimal plant growth the main role of such practice is to reduce the amount of water used for irrigating crops and positively improve the response of plants to a certain degree of water deficit thereby increasing the crop s water productivity chai et al 2016 the yield and water productivity for pulse under deficit irrigation are presented in table 7 it may be inferred from table 7 that supplying water at 15 days interval decreased yield but enhanced water productivity by 6 06 compared to full irrigation in chickpeas jabow et al 2015 similarly for mung bean hussen et al 2019 found that irrigating crops with 100 of crop water requirement resulted in higher yields 1 12 t ha 1 but lower water productivity in contrast irrigating crops with 50 water used increased water productivity by 24 over full irrigation thus deficit irrigation may be treated as an important tool to reduce irrigation water use under water limiting situations fereres and soriano 2007 jabow et al 2015 admasu et al 2019 7 conclusions one of the major constraints in pulse production is limitation of irrigation water hence efficient water management strategies like micro irrigations critical stage based irrigations resource conservation techniques bed planting mulching etc play an important role in increasing water productivity besides conserving in situ soil moisture micro irrigation practice in pulse increases 31 yield and 43 water productivity deficit irrigation strategy should be encouraged in arid and semi arid regions which increased water productivity to a tune of 24 ridge planting of pulses enhances water productivity to a tune of 22 compared to the normal method mulching practices also recorded yield enhancement of up to 9 hence involving these practices not only ensures better pulse productivity but also assures natural nitrogen fixation for better soil health declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

9014,assessment of irrigation in arid and semiarid regions is imperative to ensure the sustainable use of limited water resources and guarantee food production therefore this study aimed to assess actual evapotranspiration eta derived from the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal model with and without satellite image fusion as input of a soil water balance in a pilot area of sugarcane in the semiarid region of brazil a fusion of landsat sensors and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis images was completed through a spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm script developed using cloud computing and its performance in estimating key variables for the radiation balance was evaluated eta and irrigation were daily estimated between june 2015 and may 2016 by combining starfm with sebal and evaluated according to the bowen ratio technique and irrigation data in addition one minute surface meteorological elements at the satellite overpass times were used starfm performed well with rmse of 17 00 w m 2 2 28 k 0 07 and 0 01 for rn ts ndvi and albedo respectively the metrics employed to evaluate eta estimates indicated that the sebal starfm has low mean errors pbias 2 75 and rmse 0 97 mm d 1 and 16 66 mm month 1 and high coefficient of determination 0 87 for daily eta et24 and 0 91 for monthly eta in comparison with sebal using landsat only images pbias 5 25 rmse 0 97 mm d 1 and 17 66 mm month 1 r² 0 92 adding fused images resulted in a better fit of the estimated cumulative et24 curve to the measured et24 the water balance indicated that the cultivated cane suffered water stress which was better represented by estimates using the et24 curve with the addition of fused images than landsat images alone although this increase in temporal resolution of the estimated et24 data indicated a greater water consumption it informs a quantity that would be sufficient to meet the water demand of the crops keywords remote sensing google earth engine evapotranspiration water right data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction when considering water consumption by the agricultural sector one must quantify the water demand of crops and the efficiency of the irrigation system used from the environmental economic and sustainability points of view associated with the environmental issues of weather and climate one must assess the actual evapotranspiration eta produced by vegetated surfaces a variable that has gained prominence in studies using orbital remotely sensed images due to the monetary cost benefit free availability of multispectral images of the earth s surface and spatial cost benefit scanning hundreds of km in one scene several models that use satellite image inputs are available to compute eta such as two source energy balance norman et al 1995 surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution and with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007a atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi anderson et al 2007 and the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop senay et al 2013 these models have been used by various agencies for assessing water consumption by irrigated crops and for managing water resources such as the idaho department of water resources idwr daugherty water for food global institute dwfi united states geological survey usgs and recently the national water agency ana among these techniques the most renowned validated and widely used continue to be the sebal model and its primary variant metric jaafar and ahmad 2020 due to their extensive use it is possible to evaluate eta accuracy in various climatic zones crop types or validation methodologies bastiaanssen et al 2005 stated that the overall accuracy of eta from sebal for single day events and for scales on the order of 100 ha is 15 the authors also claim that space and temporal integration increases accuracy resulting in smaller seasonal differences 1 5 however daily sebal eta estimates may contain uncertainties observed in different studies grosso et al 2018 obtained poorer results in a rainfed maize under non optimal field conditions saline soils song et al 2015 and peddinti e kisekka 2022 also pointed out that one source eta models which do not consider transpiration and evaporation as separate processes such as sebal and metric might contain uncertainties due to different temperatures and resistances to energy exchange in heterogeneous vegetated surfaces which depends on the micrometeorological interactions between the soil and the canopy mhawej et al 2020 observed that some sebal validations studies have several limitations 1 high biases in some studies 2 low spatial resolution validations and 3 low temporal resolution validations despite the poor performance observed by some authors many well conducted studies please see table 1a in appendix indicate that on average eta estimated by sebal exhibit a daily mean absolute error mae mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 equal to 0 41 mm 10 25 0 62 mm and 0 83 respectively on a monthly basis mae mre rmse and r² are 23 15 mm 8 61 28 07 mm 0 94 non military satellites that have a fine spatial resolution especially in the thermal bands are generally associated with low temporal resolution due to the nature of their orbits and instrumental limitations gao et al 2015 on the other hand satellites operating in higher temporal resolution present coarser spatial resolution gebremichael et al 2010 long et al 2011 ramírez cuesta et al 2019 and li et al 2021 found significant uncertainties in using coarser resolution sensors with better temporal resolution e g moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis to determine eta by models such as sebal and metric these models depend on extreme pixel selection to determine energy balance components which in turn rely on fine spatial resolution this situation makes it difficult to reliably estimate water consumption in irrigated agriculture that is crucial to improve irrigation management and diminish the possible conflict by the use of water given this adversity the algorithm spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm gao et al 2006 2015 was developed with the proposal to increase the frequency of images available in a given area combining the spatial resolution of the landsat series sensors with the temporal resolution of the modis sensors on board the terra and aqua platforms the technique is based on a deterministic weight function of the spectral similarity temporal difference and spatial distance between pixels imaged by pairs of landsat modis images knipper et al 2020 despite the increasing use of this model in two source energy balance models cammalleri et al 2013 2014 yang et al 2017 2018 knipper et al 2020 it has not yet been used with sebal remote sensing based studies are powerful tools to evaluate water used for irrigation in arid and semiarid environments and are essentials in regions with intense agricultural activity and a lack of measured surface data undoubtedly these areas require more attention in the consumptive use of water for irrigation since conflicts in the various sectors of society manifest themselves mainly in regions with low availability of water resources this scenario describes the semiarid petrolina juazeiro irrigation area in brazil this agricultural hotspot represents a place in which drought events marengo et al 2020 allied with climate change silva et al 2021 can intensify the consumptive water use and consequently apply pressure on ensuring food water energy and economic security in this region a significant challenge today which is likely to further intensify in the future even after numerous validation studies the lack of reliable and practical applications of sebal in a soil water balance model is due to a lack of surface visible and thermal radiative information at an adequate resolution both spatial and temporal considering this the objective of this research was to assess evapotranspiration and soil water balance results from sebal model with and without a satellite image fusion approach using satellite images and surface meteorological data in a sugarcane pilot area of the brazilian semiarid region to this end the performance of estimating key variables used to obtain eta was evaluated as well as the use of sebal with starfm in estimating eta as input for a soil water balance model the code used to access process and export the data in cloud computing was published this is the first study that proposed a methodology to integrate a satellite data fusion model with sebal 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the pilot area is an irrigated sugarcane saccharum officinarum spp field of 15 ha fig 1 var vat 90 212 second ratoon in vertisol with double rows at a spacing of 1 3 1 0 m under subsurface drip irrigation this field belongs to the petrolina juazeiro agriculture area the largest irrigated agriculture area in the semiarid region of brazil agência nacional de águas brazil 2017a it is located in the sub middle são francisco watershed a water resource essential for other consumptive uses like hydroelectric energy municipal and animal husbandry agência nacional de águas brazil 2017b according to inmet 2020 the average annual rainfall is 482 mm in recent decades the native vegetation of this region caatinga has been replaced by rainfed and irrigated agriculture mainly due to the creation of the public irrigation projects implemented in the early 1970 s these perimeters irrigated areas currently cover approximately 70 000 ha ferreira et al 2020 and are developed by government authorities to include parcel field units area for agricultural activity social and instrumental infrastructure water capture conveyance storage distribution or drainage equipment and irrigation services administrative and maintenance agência nacional de águas brazil 2017a the local economy is highly dependent on this agricultural productive apparatus which plays an important socioeconomic role it is important to mention that between the years 2015 and early 2016 the useful volume of the sobradinho hydroelectric plant reservoir reached percentages below 5 which were the lowest storage levels ever recorded ana 2020b and ana 2020c a consequence of the prolonged drought that began in 2012 marengo et al 2020 according to silva et al 2021 the effects of climate change and the increase in consumptive demand for water in this region may significantly reduce water availability reducing the energy production of the region by approximately 30 50 in the coming decades this irrigated area accounts for 77 of water demands in the são francisco river agência nacional de águas brazil 2017b the main river in the region fourteen thousand hectares of the irrigated area in juazeiro is covered by sugarcane and part of it is irrigated through subsurface drip systems the cultivation of this crop is directly linked to the production of ethanol and sugar and is justified by the plant s adaptability to the tropical climate under the high availability of water solar radiation and nutrients silva et al 2011 according to vieira 2012 the average productivity of the subsurface drip irrigated areas was 115 t ha 1 in 2011 which is much higher than the national 72 44 t ha 1 according to conab 2014 and the international 70 t ha 1 based on the countries with the highest productivity according to matos et al 2020 averages for sugarcane in the study area the irrigation is applied through subsurface drip systems which according to personal communication with growers presents an application efficiency equal to or greater than 90 an experiment was carried out in this field to measure daily eta et24 data using the bowen ratio method and the criteria adopted by perez et al 1999 et24 tower the measurements were collected between june 24 2015 and may 30 2016 by a 7 m high micrometeorological bowen ratio tower installed in a sugarcane field fig 1 for more details about the experiment see carvalho et al 2018 these data were used to validate the satellite based eta estimates made in this research to pursue the validation eta estimated using satellite images were averaged over an upwind source area considering 4 pixels for the tower similar to li et al 2017 and yang et al 2017 the locations of

eta based on the latent heat flux obtained as a residual from the energy balance equation the algorithm combines multispectral data usually from satellite sensors that capture the surface radiance in the solar and thermal portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and complementary data obtained through a meteorological station located in the study area in this study the sebal algorithm s execution

landsat sensors either etm or oli tirs fig 2a and for the images produced after the starfm application fig 2b fig 2 highlights the moments in which image metadata and weather data are essential the soil heat flux g w m 2 can be obtained according to the empirical equation developed by bastiaanssen 2000 which represents values close to noon 3 g t s 0 0038 0 0074 α 1 0 98 ndvi 4 r n where ts is the surface temperature c α is the surface albedo and ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index see appendix a the sensible heat flux h w m 2 was determined by the classical aerodynamic equation solved through an internal calibration technique that had its genesis in the work of bastiaanssen 1995 in the creation of sebal the technique computes h by specifying its values at two extreme conditions in the satellite image based on knowledge of available energy and surface conditions bastiaanssen et al 1998 stated in sebal that a general assumption of an evaporative fraction le rn g of 100 at wet surfaces is a safe approximation and therefore the le can be determined in a so called wet pixel or cold pixel chosen in a local water body or in a well vegetated field on the other hand a dry pixel or hot pixel is chosen in a bare soil area where it is assumed that available energy is used only to h le 0 after assuming these approximations we interpolated the surface energy balance of all other pixels between these two extremes considering a linear relationship between the surface temperature and the air temperature dt then an iterative calibration process is completed to correct the stability of the atmosphere at the end of the calibration the biases related to estimations of rn g and other intermediate components are in turn removed when eta is computed for all pixels of the image appendix b and fig 3 show the interactive procedure to perform an automated selection of the extreme pixels we used the algorithm calibration using inverse modeling at extreme conditions cimec allen et al 2013 this approach is used often due to the demonstrated excellence of its results olmedo et al 2016 jaafar and ahmad 2020 laipelt et al 2020 annual 2015 and 2016 land use and land cover maps from the projeto mapbiomas 2020 were also used to delineate the target areas of the cimec extreme pixel selection the mapbiomas project produces annual land cover and land use maps from the pixel by pixel classification of landsat satellite images the process uses extensive machine learning algorithms in the google earth engine platform for each biome and type of land cover land use pasture agriculture coastal zone and urban area for more details about the project and the theoretical basis of the algorithm employed please see mapbiomas project 2020 2 4 actual daily evapotranspiration after resolving the energy balance at the satellite overpass time we obtained actual daily evapotranspiration et24 based on the concept of the instantaneous evaporative fraction fei ratio between the latent energy and the energy available at the surface level rn g bastiaassen et al 1998 according to the sebal methodology it is reasonable to assume that fei is preserved throughout the day therefore fei fe24 which makes it possible to extrapolate the eta from an instant to a day 4 fe i fe 24 le rn g le 24 r n 24 this assumption may not be valid in some situations as demonstrated by van niel et al 2011 and van niel et al 2012 however it is important to mention that according to the literature review farah bastiaanssen and feddes 2004 hoedjes et al 2008 santos et al 2010 peng et al 2013 french hunsaker and thorp 2015 liu et al 2020 and nassar et al 2021 the use of instantaneous evaporative fraction in a time between 10 am and 2 pm is efficient to estimate et24 especially when considering clear sky days which is also a prerequisite for eta studies with polar orbit satellite images this time window includes landsat terra and aqua overpass times furthermore results from many studies in different conditions exhibited high r² and small mean errors when determining et24 based on this assumption see appendix table1a rn24 w m 2 in this equation is the daily net radiation obtained by the following equation 5 r n 24 r sw 24 1 α 110 τ sw 24 where rsw 24 α e τ sw 24 are respectively daily global solar radiation w m 2 obtained in the sonda station broadband surface albedo see appendix a and daily average atmospheric transmission which in turn was obtained by the ratio between rsw 24 w m 2 and daily solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere rsw toa w m 2 eq 5 is the slob s equation published by de bruin 1987 and mentioned by de bruin and stricker 2000 ferreira et al 2020 validated eq 5 application over different land uses for the same study area of this research laipelt et al 2020 also found good results applying this equation in a transitional area between tropical forest and savanna vegetation in brazil 2 5 starfm among the alternatives available to increase the frequency of images in an area the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm model gao et al 2006 2015 demonstrates effectiveness in the production of fused images from the landsat series sensors and the modis sensor this fusion combines the spatial resolution of the landsat series sensors with the temporal resolution of modis as long as there are a pair of images from both sensors before and or another after the date when a modis image is available in the study area each pixel of the merged image is generated in the center of a moving window according to the contribution weighted of three aspects observed in the neighboring pixels spectrally similar to the central one inside the window which are i spectral similarity between landsat sensors and modis pixels ii temporal difference between modis overpasses and iii spatial distance between the spectrally similar neighboring pixel and the central pixel of the moving window the starfm approach was originally developed to blend surface reflectance bands between high spatial resolution landsat sensors and high temporal resolution modis sensors but works well with multi scale eta imagery cammalleri et al 2014 this research proposes applying the algorithm to the variables albedo surface temperature and reflectance in the red band band 3 of etm 4 of oli and 1 of modis and near infrared band band 4 of etm 5 of oli and 2 of modis the estimates of these variables are used for the rn calculation fig 2 and consequently et24 see appendix a and b the estimates of these three key variables for the etm and oli tirs images were determined according to the set of equations presented in appendix a while for modis we used the modis products mentioned in subsection 2 2 therefore the estimation of the abovementioned variables at a landsat sensors resolution between landsat overpasses or close to a single landsat overpass is based on a weighting function applied within a specified search window 7 l x w 2 y w 2 t 0 i 1 w j 1 w k 1 n w ijk m x i y j t 0 l x i y j t k m x i y j t k in which w represents the size of the search window we set w 1470 m based on the homogeneity and the land cover changes of the study area according to gao et al 2006 the subscript x w 2 y w 2 represents the central pixel of the search window x i y j indicates the position of a given pixel in the moving window for both landsat l and modis m sensors t0 indicates the date of the pixel estimate at landsat sensor resolution and tk indicates the date of the landsat modis image pair k varies from 1 to n where n 2 when two landsat modis image pairs are available one before and one after date t0 the term w ijk represents the weight associated with the contribution of each moving window pixel in determining the central pixel pixels that are not spectrally similar to the central pixel have w ijk 0 this weight is supported in the three factor setup 1 spectral difference between modis and landsat s ijk 8 s ijk l x i y j t k m x i y j t k s ijk indicates the homogeneity of the modis pixel since it expresses the differences between a landsat pixel considered homogeneous and a modis pixel the result of contributions from a larger often heterogeneous surface area a low value of s ijk indicates that the high resolution landsat pixel has similar spectral characteristics to the surrounding pixels in the modis dimension so changes in the high resolution pixel will be comparable to changes in the low resolution pixel in this scenario the s ijk term will have a greater impact on the determination of w ijk and consequently on eq 7 a more general assumption is that if the modis and landsat information are equal at a given date tk they will be equal at t0 this can occur for a homogeneous pixel on the modis scale however there may be cases where there is equality between both sensors at time tk but there is a difference at time t0 as opposed to the previous assumption one measure to observe if this occurs is to calculate the differences that modis may show between tk and t0 dates as presented next 2 time difference between modis images t ijk 9 t ijk m x i y j t k m x i y j t 0 this factor accounts for the changes that occur between the date to be estimated t0 and the date tk if t ijk has a low value it means that the difference between the two dates is small and this pixel will have a greater impact on the determination of w ijk and consequently on eq 7 3 spatial distance between the central pixel of the search window x w 2 y w 2 and a spectrally similar pixel x i y j d ijk 10 d ijk x w 2 x i 2 y w 2 y j 2 this calculation measures the euclidean distance between the central pixel of the window and the spectrally similar pixel among the spectrally similar pixels those closest to the central pixel will represent a greater weight in the estimate the combination of these three factors was performed in order to make it less sensitive to spectral differences according to gao et al 2006 11 c ijk ln s ijk b 1 ln t ijk b 1 d ijk in which b is a scale factor equal to 10 000 and d ijk is the relative distance determined according to the expression 12 d ijk 1 d ijk a in which a is a constant that defines the relative importance of the spatial distance before temporal and spectral differences in eq 11 gao et al 2006 recommend the use of a 250 m for heterogeneous areas and this value was adopted in the present study finally the weighting function w ijk is determined using the following expression 13 w ijk 1 c ijk i 1 w j 1 w k 1 n 1 c ijk the criterion used for the selection of neighboring pixels spectrally similar to the central pixel of the moving window was the true observance of the following inequations i ii and iii i l x i y j t k l x w 2 y w 2 t k σ ii s ijk max l x w 2 y w 2 t k m x w 2 y w 2 t k σ lm iii t ijk max m x w 2 y w 2 t k m x w 2 y w 2 t 0 σ mm in which σ represents the standard deviation of the pixels inside the moving window σ lm and σ mm represent the uncertainty between the landsat modis estimates in the same date and modis modis between two dates respectively for the values σ lm and σ mm we adopted those proposed by gao et al 2006 for heterogeneous areas namely σ lm σ mm 0 01 for the red spectral band v and σ lm σ mm 0015 for the near infrared spectral band iv inequation i selects the pixels for starfm and is applied to the v and ir reflectances of landsat 8 bands 4 and 5 respectively in the available images i e when there are two pairs of landsat modis images inequation i is applied to the image preceding and succeeding the estimation date so the pixel is selected only when it meets the criteria on both dates the inequations ii and iii ensure that the selected pixels provide better spectral information than the central pixels of the moving window gao et al 2006 fig 4 describes the procedures followed for the execution of starfm the algorithm was executed using the python programming language version 3 7 in the google colab platform the script used is available freely on the github website https github com thomasmcz sebal starfm anyone with a google account can access execute this script and export the data to a folder on google drive to evaluate the starfm estimates the algorithm was applied to a larger area 2300 km² containing the study area using two pairs of landsat 8 modis images the first on october 27 and the second on december 14 2015 aiming to obtain an image on november 12 of the same year on this day a cloudless landsat 8 image is available which allowed us to ascertain the efficiency in the estimates of some biophysical variables such as ndvi ts albedo and rn at the satellite overpass rn over see appendix a which are key variables for obtaining eta from these variables the pixels classified as agriculture according to the mapbiomas land use and land cover classification mapbiomas 2020 were extracted to perform the starfm validation 2 6 time continuous daily and monthly evapotranspiration at the end of the execution of the starfm algorithm we obtained images with landsat spatial resolution and modis temporal resolution for clear sky days ready for applying the sebal algorithm to obtain et24 to obtain a time continuous database of et24 we used an interpolation of the ratio fpet et24 et0 24 produced between satellites overpasses days et0 24 was calculated using the penman monteith formulation following food and agricultural organization fao 56 standard in allen et al 1998 in other words et24 fpet et0 24 this approach is well known and widely used in applications with remote sensing based eta models allen et al 2007a anderson et al 2007 castelli et al 2018 shamloo et al 2021 yang et al 2012 we assessed the performance of both interpolations landsat only and landsat fusion to determine if there is an improvement in et24 estimates by adding fused images the monthly eta was calculated by adding the daily eta 2 7 irrigation management assessment a water balance approach fao 56 allen et al 2007b was used to assess the management of irrigation in the study area during the 2015 2016 growing season a daily water balance model eq 14 was used to track the daily fluxes of water entering and leaving the system by accounting for precipitation p net irrigation inet crop et et24 surface runoff ro and deep percolation of water below the rootzone dp solving for the current day soil water content swi 14 sw i sw i 1 p i net ro dp et 24 daily precipitation data used in the water balance model was collected from embapa weather station fig 1 daily net irrigation was determined based on the amount of water applied through the sub surface micro irrigation system while accounting for the 90 application efficiency the company that managed the agricultural crop irrigation in the experimental area supplied the total volume of water applied in a given day which was converted to mm day of irrigation by dividing the volume of water applied by the area irrigated surface runoff was calculated using daily precipitation and the usda natural resources conservation service runoff equation using a curve number of 0 78 based on the crop and the soil type araújo neto et al 2012 oliveira et al 2016 and usda nrcs 2012 deep percolation of water below the rootzone was calculated based on the excess water received beyond the soil water holding capacity or field capacity fc if water received at the soil either through precipitation or irrigation resulted in the current day soil water content exceeding fc the difference in water content between the current day soil water content and fc was allocated as deep percolation the volumetric soil fc and wilting point wp values were 0 38 and 0 16 celestino 2017 the difference between fc and wp represents the total available water taw to vegetation for growth within the rootzone zr eq 15 the amount of water available to vegetation before water stress occurs known as readily available water raw was based on a crop specific depletion fraction p 0 65 and the current day et24 where p was adjusted based on et24 demands eqs 16 and 17 allen at al 1998 a constant root depth of 1 2 m was used throughout the growing season as the sugarcane crop had been harvested once before and the roots had been established prior to the 2015 2016 growing season 15 taw 1000 fc wp z r 16 p adj p 0 04 5 et c 17 raw p adj taw et24 used to update the water balance model was measured using the bowen ratio tower et24 tower located within the research field site see fig 1 the water balance model required the start of season soil water content while this parameter was not measured irrigation was applied early season in order to refill the soil profile until soil water content reached fc using the applied irrigation and water balance model the initial soil water content was estimated through back calculations where an initial soil water content of 262 mm m on 14 june 2015 resulted in the soil water content reaching fc on 28 july 2015 two additional water balance models were completed using the same data as in the et24 tower water balance model except for the et24 tower used to update the models which was estimated with sebal informed with landsat images et24 landsat and the landsat and landsat modis fused images from the starfm model et24 landsat fused the two water balance models updated with estimated et24 were evaluated against the water balance model updated with et24 tower this comparison helped evaluate the differences in estimated rootzone soil water depletion when using estimated et24 from sebal informed with landsat and landsat modis fused images which is a critical aspect in accurately managing irrigation to avoid crop water stress 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of starfm performance in the spatial evaluation of starfm the similarity with respect to the maps derived from oli tirs is remarkable fig 5 the fusion produced maps that represent well the spatial variability found in the different types of land use and land cover and indicate that the use of the parameters for heterogeneous areas proposed by gao et al 2006 is quite adequate for the study area among the mean errors mae mre and rmse fig 6 a the metrics that have the same magnitude of the variable mae and rmse indicate greater values for rn over and lower values for ndvi and albedo this is due to the greater numerical scale presented by rn over compared to ndvi and albedo when analyzing the mre ndvi and albedo presented greater errors than ts and rn over indicating that starfm presents greater inconsistency in these variables which may be associated with the different crop types and phenological stages however these mismatches were not large enough to affect the estimates of rn over which showed an mre of approximately 2 and a coefficient of determination of 0 78 fig 6b yielding good results considering the sample size n 235 612 the limited errors presented in the estimates of ts are crucial for the high performance of the technique under rn over considering that ts is a crucial variable in the computation of the longwave radiation emitted by the surface in the longwave balance and consequently in rn over see appendix a 3 2 validation of the evapotranspiration estimate according to the et24 and fpet time series plots both landsat only and landsat fused images reproduced well the seasonal fluctuations represented by the bowen ratio method figs 7 a and 7 b the slight difference between these two modeled results occurred between landsat overpass days a consequence of the inclusion of the fused data in 2016 we observe less images compared to 2015 especially in january and between march day of the year doy 71 and april doy 117 which affects the fpet performance those gaps occurred due to a persistent presence of clouds in satellites overpass times which are climatologically expected in this region ferreira et al 2020 even under this circumstance both landsat only and landsat fused images captured well the behavior presented by et24 tower which is partly due to the interpolation of fpet but mostly because et0 24 captures the decline of rsw in response to cloudy days that highly impacts the rn and consequently et0 24 the estimated et24 results et24 landsat for landsat overpass days fig 8 a showed that r2 mbe pbias and rmse were 0 71 0 30 mm d 1 4 13 0 70 mm d 1 respectively indicating good accuracy and better results compared to results from fused images in modis overpass days fig 8 b which presented r2 mbe pbias and rmse equal to 0 60 0 40 mm d 1 6 23 0 84 mm d 1 respectively many studies evaluated the accuracy of sebal applied to landsat series over different crops climatic regions and ground based measurements see appendix table 1a on the other hand the results of the fusion point to a more scattered plot around the 1 1 line compared to landsat only et24 and on average fused only results indicated an overestimation these differences between landsat only and fusion only can be addressed to the influence of the temporal distance in the thermal images produced by the starfm with inaccuracies see figs 5 and 6 a negatively affecting the extreme pixels selection and subsequently sebal s iterative process see subsection 2 3 and appendix b those issues were minimized in the interpolation to obtain et24 for all days see subsection 2 6 using landsat and fused images fig 8 d which produced similar r2 0 62 and better mbe 0 15 mm d 1 pbias 2 75 and rmse 0 97 mm d 1 than using landsat only interpolation fig 8 c which had r2 mbe pbias and rmse equal to 0 65 0 31 mm d 1 5 25 0 97 mm d 1 respectively on a monthly basis we found r2 mbe pbias and rmse equal to 0 92 8 78 mm month 1 5 65 and 17 66 mm month 1 respectively for etm landsat fig 8 e and r2 mbe pbias and rmse equal to 0 91 4 28 mm month 1 2 75 16 66 mm month 1 for etm landsat fused fig 8 f although et landsat fused mean errors were lower in both scales daily continuous and monthly the improvement with using fused images can be perceived more clearly when considering a monthly basis rather than daily especially in terms of mbe a reduction of 4 5 mm month 1 or pbias from 5 65 to 2 75 cammalleri et al 2013 also detected that the use of fused images diminishes the underestimation observed by the landsat only approach noticing that changes in crop stress and soil evaporation are most likely to be detected by adding fused images especially considering the season cumulative eta please see the discussion on subsection 3 3 according to allen et al 2007a in general one satellite image per month is enough to build an accurate fpet curve for estimating seasonal eta but during periods of rapid vegetation change higher temporal resolution is more adequate gavilán and berengena 2007 evaluated the bowen ratio approach in an irrigated grass festuca arundinacea schreb comparing the eta estimation with measurements of a weighing lysimeter located at the center of the field the results showed an overestimation of 5 5 on average for daily eta and 5 7 on average when only daylight hours were considered in this study the tower of the experiment was 7 m in height and located relatively close to the border of the field downwind that had 15 ha please see fig 1 which means a fetch to height ratio higher than 20 1 recommended by heilman et al 1989 in this case the accuracy of the bowen ratio method consists in delimiting the limit of negative values of h le well in order to obtain consistent results with respect to the fei and with respect to et24 tanner 1960 heilman et al 1989 perez et al 1999 payero et al 2003 as mentioned in subsection 2 1 the method described by perez et al 1999 was used to discard periods in which h le is around 1 considering the conditions of the experiment and that other remote sensing studies showed similar statistical results compared to this study while evaluating the application of a fusion model to different eta models over different crops and different climatic regions table 1 and that in all cases the rmse presented here were lower than 1 mm d 1 it is reasonable to assume that the methodology proposed by this research is promising and can be used to determine et24 regarding the sebal estimates a consideration should be given to these good results when using the evaporative fraction ef instead of hourly reference eta fraction etrf a method that makes use of the alfalfa reference evapotranspiration for extrapolation of instantaneous eta to 24 h allen et al 2011 according to allen et al 2011 the etrf method compensates for regional advection effects the impacts of advection are represented well by the penman monteith equation however the bowen ratio method is less accurate when the experimental area presents considerable advection of sensible heat therefore there is an incompatibility between these methodologies which leads us to believe that a validation using bowen s ratio is more effective when we use the ef method it is worth mentioning that good estimates of daily net radiation r n 24 are essential to obtain good results of eta when using ef ferreira et al 2020 proved the efficiency of obtaining r n 24 by slob s equation eq 5 obtained from de bruin 1987 over the same sugarcane field of this study rmse 9 30 w m 2 laipelt et al 2020 also obtained good results using this expression in a transition area between amazon and cerrado biomes in brazil rmse 13 50 w m 2 3 3 water balance irrigation evaluation although 2015 and 2016 were drought years in the study area marengo et al 2020 a 290 mm rainfall depth was registered in january 2016 a volume more than sufficient to meet the water needs of the crops without taking this month into account water inputs were predominantly from irrigation management the irrigation was stopped 18 days before harvest which is a common approach in this region due to the clay soil which under irrigation makes it difficult to operate the harvesting machinery regarding the outputs cumulative et0 24 can be used as a metric to understand the atmospheric demand and in this sense we can compare its behavior with the cumulative et24 observed and modeled we observed that the et0 24 curve is systematically greater than et24 tower for both et24 landsat fig 9 a and et24 landsat fused fig 9 b and both modeled et24 curves follow the same behavior as et0 24 due to its dependence but the same does not necessarily happen at all points on the et24 tower curve in the dry period jun dez 2015 the frequency of cloud free images is much higher and the superposition of the cumulative curves of et24 landsat fused and et24 tower indicates that the use of fused images contributes to a better representativeness of et24 at the daily and continuous scale which is especially important for irrigation adjustment on dry days however the frequent cloud cover from the end of 2015 in some cases associated with rainy days limited the number of satellite images and resulted in a distancing of the abovementioned curves with the et24 landsat fused showing underestimation albeit the et24 landsat fused curve responded well to the seasonal variability indicating an underestimation in relation to the observed one since the start of the growing season this underestimation was intensified when interpolations between distant dates were required e g between dec 22 2015 and feb 8 2016 related to the irrigation seasonal water balance models were computed using daily measured et24 from the bowen ratio tower wbmeasured and estimated et24 from the sebal model informed with landsat images only wblandsat and landsat fused images wbfused the water balance models accounted for precipitation net irrigation runoff deep percolation and et24 and solved for the current day rootzone soil water content modeled rootzone depletion dr was calculated by subtracting the current soil water content from fc the wbmeasured model informed with measured et24 showed periods of water stress when dr raw mid and late season fig 10a during the 2015 2016 growing season the field managers determined irrigation demands by quantifying daily et24 using the crop coefficient method et24 kc et0 24 allen et al 1988 where et0 24 was calculated using the meteorological data collected at a private weather station after requesting access to the data it was observed that this station generated lower et0 24 in comparison to two additional weather stations located within 10 km of each other embrapa see fig 1 and labmet 2022 stations the 2015 2016 growing season cumulative et0 24 provided by the private embrapa and labmet stations were 1698 2064 and 1953 mm respectively fig 11 the low rsw 24 from the private station resulted in an underestimation of et24 and therefore less irrigation was applied than what was required to avoid crop water stress the wblandsat and wbfused models which were updated with et24 estimated using sebal informed with landsat images only and landsat fused images also showed periods of water stress figs 10b and 10c in comparing the three wb models the wbfused model resulted in better tracking of actual soil water content than the wblandsat model in comparison to the wbmeasured model which is due to more accurate estimations of et24 used in updating the wbfused model the wblandsat model would have scheduled less irrigation than the wbmeasured model as the estimated et24 used to update the wblandsat model was more than 100 mm less than measured et24 when considering cumulative growing season et24 water stress also occurred on significantly fewer days 51 in the wblandsat model in comparison to the wbmeasured 175 and wbfused 193 models table 2 cumulative et24 was greater than cumulative estimated et24 from the sebal model informed with landsat only and landsat fused images the estimated daily interpolated and cumulative et24 from sebal informed with landsat fused images compared better to measured et24 than estimated et24 from sebal informed with landsat images only figs 8c and 8 d table 2 irrigation is typically managed to avoid crop water stress where soil water content is maintained above a level so that the crop s transpiration rate is not restricted by water limitations a wb model can be used for determining depths and timing of irrigations as it can track the amount of water available to crops before water stress occurs when using a wb model for this purpose the predominant water flux of interest and hardest to accurately obtain is et24 as it is not easily measured and is dependent on various meteorological conditions and vegetative characteristics et24 is also typically the largest water flux in the context of agricultural crops which makes its quantification important for accurately scheduling irrigations 4 conclusions this study proposed a methodology to incorporate the data fusion model starfm into the energy balance model sebal in order to assess evapotranspiration and soil water balance in a sugarcane pilot area of the brazilian semiarid region satellite images and surface meteorological data were required to run the models the performance of estimating key variables used to obtain eta was evaluated as well as the performance of eta estimation itself two water balances were assessed one considering remote sensing images non fused as input for a soil water balance model and another considering both fused and non fused data image fusion produced maps that represented the key variables and the radiation balance well rn ts ndvi and albedo showed rmse of 17 00 w m 2 2 28 k 0 07 and 0 01 respectively which indicates that the starfm technique and the parameters used for heterogeneous areas are suitable for the study area and can be integrated with sebal to produce et24 maps the metrics used to evaluate the et24 and etm estimates indicated that the use of starfm with sebal in landsat and modis images present low average errors pbias 2 75 e rmse 0 97 mm d 1 e 16 66 mm month 1 and high coefficient of determination 0 87 for continuous et24 and 0 91 for etm in comparison with sebal using landsat only images pbias 5 25 rmse 0 97 mm d 1 e 17 66 mm month 1 r² 0 92 therefore studies using the presented methodology can benefit from a higher spatial temporal resolution while working with a renowned and well known energy balance model such as sebal the increased image frequency due to the addition of fused images resulted in a better fit of the estimated cumulative et24 curve relative to measured et24 this improvement was evident in the dry period where more cloud free images were available the water balance indicated that the cultivated sugarcane experienced water stress in the middle and late season a circumstance that was better represented using et24 derived from landsat fused images than the landsat images alone although this increase in temporal resolution of the estimated et24 indicated a greater water consumption it provided sufficient information for managing irrigation to better meet crop water demands the results of this study report a technique that can be used to assess water demanded by crops and irrigation practices with the potential to improve irrigation schedules funding this study was conducted in partial fulfillment of the doctoral

9014,assessment of irrigation in arid and semiarid regions is imperative to ensure the sustainable use of limited water resources and guarantee food production therefore this study aimed to assess actual evapotranspiration eta derived from the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal model with and without satellite image fusion as input of a soil water balance in a pilot area of sugarcane in the semiarid region of brazil a fusion of landsat sensors and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis images was completed through a spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm script developed using cloud computing and its performance in estimating key variables for the radiation balance was evaluated eta and irrigation were daily estimated between june 2015 and may 2016 by combining starfm with sebal and evaluated according to the bowen ratio technique and irrigation data in addition one minute surface meteorological elements at the satellite overpass times were used starfm performed well with rmse of 17 00 w m 2 2 28 k 0 07 and 0 01 for rn ts ndvi and albedo respectively the metrics employed to evaluate eta estimates indicated that the sebal starfm has low mean errors pbias 2 75 and rmse 0 97 mm d 1 and 16 66 mm month 1 and high coefficient of determination 0 87 for daily eta et24 and 0 91 for monthly eta in comparison with sebal using landsat only images pbias 5 25 rmse 0 97 mm d 1 and 17 66 mm month 1 r² 0 92 adding fused images resulted in a better fit of the estimated cumulative et24 curve to the measured et24 the water balance indicated that the cultivated cane suffered water stress which was better represented by estimates using the et24 curve with the addition of fused images than landsat images alone although this increase in temporal resolution of the estimated et24 data indicated a greater water consumption it informs a quantity that would be sufficient to meet the water demand of the crops keywords remote sensing google earth engine evapotranspiration water right data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction when considering water consumption by the agricultural sector one must quantify the water demand of crops and the efficiency of the irrigation system used from the environmental economic and sustainability points of view associated with the environmental issues of weather and climate one must assess the actual evapotranspiration eta produced by vegetated surfaces a variable that has gained prominence in studies using orbital remotely sensed images due to the monetary cost benefit free availability of multispectral images of the earth s surface and spatial cost benefit scanning hundreds of km in one scene several models that use satellite image inputs are available to compute eta such as two source energy balance norman et al 1995 surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution and with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007a atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi anderson et al 2007 and the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop senay et al 2013 these models have been used by various agencies for assessing water consumption by irrigated crops and for managing water resources such as the idaho department of water resources idwr daugherty water for food global institute dwfi united states geological survey usgs and recently the national water agency ana among these techniques the most renowned validated and widely used continue to be the sebal model and its primary variant metric jaafar and ahmad 2020 due to their extensive use it is possible to evaluate eta accuracy in various climatic zones crop types or validation methodologies bastiaanssen et al 2005 stated that the overall accuracy of eta from sebal for single day events and for scales on the order of 100 ha is 15 the authors also claim that space and temporal integration increases accuracy resulting in smaller seasonal differences 1 5 however daily sebal eta estimates may contain uncertainties observed in different studies grosso et al 2018 obtained poorer results in a rainfed maize under non optimal field conditions saline soils song et al 2015 and peddinti e kisekka 2022 also pointed out that one source eta models which do not consider transpiration and evaporation as separate processes such as sebal and metric might contain uncertainties due to different temperatures and resistances to energy exchange in heterogeneous vegetated surfaces which depends on the micrometeorological interactions between the soil and the canopy mhawej et al 2020 observed that some sebal validations studies have several limitations 1 high biases in some studies 2 low spatial resolution validations and 3 low temporal resolution validations despite the poor performance observed by some authors many well conducted studies please see table 1a in appendix indicate that on average eta estimated by sebal exhibit a daily mean absolute error mae mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 equal to 0 41 mm 10 25 0 62 mm and 0 83 respectively on a monthly basis mae mre rmse and r² are 23 15 mm 8 61 28 07 mm 0 94 non military satellites that have a fine spatial resolution especially in the thermal bands are generally associated with low temporal resolution due to the nature of their orbits and instrumental limitations gao et al 2015 on the other hand satellites operating in higher temporal resolution present coarser spatial resolution gebremichael et al 2010 long et al 2011 ramírez cuesta et al 2019 and li et al 2021 found significant uncertainties in using coarser resolution sensors with better temporal resolution e g moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis to determine eta by models such as sebal and metric these models depend on extreme pixel selection to determine energy balance components which in turn rely on fine spatial resolution this situation makes it difficult to reliably estimate water consumption in irrigated agriculture that is crucial to improve irrigation management and diminish the possible conflict by the use of water given this adversity the algorithm spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm gao et al 2006 2015 was developed with the proposal to increase the frequency of images available in a given area combining the spatial resolution of the landsat series sensors with the temporal resolution of the modis sensors on board the terra and aqua platforms the technique is based on a deterministic weight function of the spectral similarity temporal difference and spatial distance between pixels imaged by pairs of landsat modis images knipper et al 2020 despite the increasing use of this model in two source energy balance models cammalleri et al 2013 2014 yang et al 2017 2018 knipper et al 2020 it has not yet been used with sebal remote sensing based studies are powerful tools to evaluate water used for irrigation in arid and semiarid environments and are essentials in regions with intense agricultural activity and a lack of measured surface data undoubtedly these areas require more attention in the consumptive use of water for irrigation since conflicts in the various sectors of society manifest themselves mainly in regions with low availability of water resources this scenario describes the semiarid petrolina juazeiro irrigation area in brazil this agricultural hotspot represents a place in which drought events marengo et al 2020 allied with climate change silva et al 2021 can intensify the consumptive water use and consequently apply pressure on ensuring food water energy and economic security in this region a significant challenge today which is likely to further intensify in the future even after numerous validation studies the lack of reliable and practical applications of sebal in a soil water balance model is due to a lack of surface visible and thermal radiative information at an adequate resolution both spatial and temporal considering this the objective of this research was to assess evapotranspiration and soil water balance results from sebal model with and without a satellite image fusion approach using satellite images and surface meteorological data in a sugarcane pilot area of the brazilian semiarid region to this end the performance of estimating key variables used to obtain eta was evaluated as well as the use of sebal with starfm in estimating eta as input for a soil water balance model the code used to access process and export the data in cloud computing was published this is the first study that proposed a methodology to integrate a satellite data fusion model with sebal 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the pilot area is an irrigated sugarcane saccharum officinarum spp field of 15 ha fig 1 var vat 90 212 second ratoon in vertisol with double rows at a spacing of 1 3 1 0 m under subsurface drip irrigation this field belongs to the petrolina juazeiro agriculture area the largest irrigated agriculture area in the semiarid region of brazil agência nacional de águas brazil 2017a it is located in the sub middle são francisco watershed a water resource essential for other consumptive uses like hydroelectric energy municipal and animal husbandry agência nacional de águas brazil 2017b according to inmet 2020 the average annual rainfall is 482 mm in recent decades the native vegetation of this region caatinga has been replaced by rainfed and irrigated agriculture mainly due to the creation of the public irrigation projects implemented in the early 1970 s these perimeters irrigated areas currently cover approximately 70 000 ha ferreira et al 2020 and are developed by government authorities to include parcel field units area for agricultural activity social and instrumental infrastructure water capture conveyance storage distribution or drainage equipment and irrigation services administrative and maintenance agência nacional de águas brazil 2017a the local economy is highly dependent on this agricultural productive apparatus which plays an important socioeconomic role it is important to mention that between the years 2015 and early 2016 the useful volume of the sobradinho hydroelectric plant reservoir reached percentages below 5 which were the lowest storage levels ever recorded ana 2020b and ana 2020c a consequence of the prolonged drought that began in 2012 marengo et al 2020 according to silva et al 2021 the effects of climate change and the increase in consumptive demand for water in this region may significantly reduce water availability reducing the energy production of the region by approximately 30 50 in the coming decades this irrigated area accounts for 77 of water demands in the são francisco river agência nacional de águas brazil 2017b the main river in the region fourteen thousand hectares of the irrigated area in juazeiro is covered by sugarcane and part of it is irrigated through subsurface drip systems the cultivation of this crop is directly linked to the production of ethanol and sugar and is justified by the plant s adaptability to the tropical climate under the high availability of water solar radiation and nutrients silva et al 2011 according to vieira 2012 the average productivity of the subsurface drip irrigated areas was 115 t ha 1 in 2011 which is much higher than the national 72 44 t ha 1 according to conab 2014 and the international 70 t ha 1 based on the countries with the highest productivity according to matos et al 2020 averages for sugarcane in the study area the irrigation is applied through subsurface drip systems which according to personal communication with growers presents an application efficiency equal to or greater than 90 an experiment was carried out in this field to measure daily eta et24 data using the bowen ratio method and the criteria adopted by perez et al 1999 et24 tower the measurements were collected between june 24 2015 and may 30 2016 by a 7 m high micrometeorological bowen ratio tower installed in a sugarcane field fig 1 for more details about the experiment see carvalho et al 2018 these data were used to validate the satellite based eta estimates made in this research to pursue the validation eta estimated using satellite images were averaged over an upwind source area considering 4 pixels for the tower similar to li et al 2017 and yang et al 2017 the locations of the meteorological and agrometeorological stations are shown in fig 1 the weather station of the national environmental data organization system sonda was the source of meteorological data at the time of the satellite s overpass the data have a temporal resolution of one minute employed in the sebal algorithm the national institute of meteorology inmet inmet 2020 station was the source of climate data the agrometeorological station of the brazilian agricultural research corporation embrapa semiarido was the source of reference evapotranspiration data for grass et0 24 see subsection 2 6 2 2 satellite images and weather data we used seven cloud free operational land imager oli landsat 8 images path 217 and rows 66 and 67 acquired from the surface reflectance product collection 1 tier 1

cloud shadow water and snow mask as well as a per pixel saturation mask usgs 2020 we also used oli thermal infrared sensor tirs landsat 8 images bands 4 and 5 solar spectrum and 10 10 60 11 19 µm at the same date path and rows mentioned above acquired from the landsat 8 collection 1 tier 1 raw scenes that represented scaled calibrated at sensor radiance nine enhanced thematic mapper etm landsat 7 images were also used under the same conditions period area and collections the etm images after may 2003 present scanning flaws non imaged lines however the study area is located in the central part of path 217 where the imaging does not present problems the processed images were acquired from the google earth engine dataset https earthengine google com by using python language in google colab platform https colab research google com we used three products from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sensor onboard the terra and aqua orbital platforms which are surface reflectance mod myd09ga vermote and wolfe 2015a 2015b surface albedo mcd43a3 schaaf and wang 2015 and surface temperature mod myd11a1 wan et al 2015a b with the following position in the modis grid vertical 09 and horizontal 13 and 14 from 2015 to 2016 the data comprised thirty six dates accessed from the google earth engine dataset we used one minute meteorological data at the satellite overpass times to calculate variables required for the energy balance see appendix a and b these data were obtained from the sonda station fig 1 located in the petrolina municipality part of the baseline surface radiation network bsrn the following data were acquired air temperature ta c relative humidity rh atmospheric pressure pa kpa wind speed m s 1 downwelling shortwave radiation rsw obs w m 2 and downwelling longwave radiation rlw obs w m 2 for details of sensors and data quality control see driemel et al 2018 to extrapolate et24 from the day of the satellite overpass to the monthly scale we used et0 24 and precipitation data see subsections 2 4 and 2 6 therefore et0 24 was data produced according to the fao 56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 and the precipitation data were collected from an agrometeorological station located 10 km from the study area at embrapa semiarid field station in mandacaru juazeiro fig 1 2 3 sebal algorithm sebal provides the estimation of eta based on the latent heat flux obtained as a residual from the energy balance equation the algorithm combines multispectral data usually from satellite sensors that capture the surface radiance in the solar and thermal portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and complementary data obtained through a meteorological station located in the study area in this study the sebal algorithm s execution was performed on the google colab platform using the python programming language version 3 7 and is freely available on the github website https github com thomasmcz sebal starfm the energy balance variables namely latent heat flux le w m 2 net radiation rn w m 2 soil heat flux g w m 2 and the sensible heat flux h w m 2 are related as follows 1 le r n g h the rn for the satellite overpass rn over was computed through the balance of short and long wave radiation which is a function of spectral radiance reflectivity and surface and atmospheric emissivity this set of equations appendix a was validated over different land uses by ferreira et al 2020 including the sugarcane in the same study area and period of this research the following equation represents the balance between the short and longwave radiation 2 r n over 1 α r sw r emi ɛ 0 r lw where α is the surface albedo rsw w m 2 is the downwelling shortwave radiation r emi w m 2 is the longwave radiation emitted by the surface ɛ0 is the pixel surface emissivity and ratm w m 2 is the downwelling longwave radiation emitted by the atmosphere fig 2 illustrates the step by step approach adopted to obtain the radiation balance for the landsat sensors either etm or oli tirs fig 2a and for the images produced after the starfm application fig 2b fig 2 highlights the moments in which image metadata and weather data are essential the soil heat flux g w m 2 can be obtained according to the empirical equation developed by bastiaanssen 2000 which represents values close to noon 3 g t s 0 0038 0 0074 α 1 0 98 ndvi 4 r n where ts is the surface temperature c α is the surface albedo and ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index see appendix a the sensible heat flux h w m 2 was determined by the classical aerodynamic equation solved through an internal calibration technique that had its genesis in the work of bastiaanssen 1995 in the creation of sebal the technique computes h by specifying its values at two extreme conditions in the satellite image based on knowledge of available energy and surface conditions bastiaanssen et al 1998 stated in sebal that a general assumption of an evaporative fraction le rn g of 100 at wet surfaces is a safe approximation and therefore the le can be determined in a so called wet pixel or cold pixel chosen in a local water body or in a well vegetated field on the other hand a dry pixel or hot pixel is chosen in a bare soil area where it is assumed that available energy is used only to h le 0 after assuming these approximations we interpolated the surface energy balance of all other pixels between these two extremes considering a linear relationship between the surface temperature and the air temperature dt then an iterative calibration process is completed to correct the stability of the atmosphere at the end of the calibration the biases related to estimations of rn g and other intermediate components are in turn removed when eta is computed for all pixels of the image appendix b and fig 3 show the interactive procedure to perform an automated selection of the extreme pixels we used the algorithm calibration using inverse modeling at extreme conditions cimec allen et al 2013 this approach is used often due to the demonstrated excellence of its results olmedo et al 2016 jaafar and ahmad 2020 laipelt et al 2020 annual 2015 and 2016 land use and land cover maps from the projeto mapbiomas 2020 were also used to delineate the target areas of the cimec extreme pixel selection the mapbiomas project produces annual land cover and land use maps from the pixel by pixel classification of landsat satellite images the process uses extensive machine learning algorithms in the google earth engine platform for each biome and type of land cover land use pasture agriculture coastal zone and urban area for more details about the project and the theoretical basis of the algorithm employed please see mapbiomas project 2020 2 4 actual daily evapotranspiration after resolving the energy balance at the satellite overpass time we obtained actual daily evapotranspiration et24 based on the concept of the instantaneous evaporative fraction fei ratio between the latent energy and the energy available at the surface level rn g bastiaassen et al 1998 according to the sebal methodology it is reasonable to assume that fei is preserved throughout the day therefore fei fe24 which makes it possible to extrapolate the eta from an instant to a day 4 fe i fe 24 le rn g le 24 r n 24 this assumption may not be valid in some situations as demonstrated by van niel et al 2011 and van niel et al 2012 however it is important to mention that according to the literature review farah bastiaanssen and feddes 2004 hoedjes et al 2008 santos et al 2010 peng et al 2013 french hunsaker and thorp 2015 liu et al 2020 and nassar et al 2021 the use of instantaneous evaporative fraction in a time between 10 am and 2 pm is efficient to estimate et24 especially when considering clear sky days which is also a prerequisite for eta studies with polar orbit satellite images this time window includes landsat terra and aqua overpass times furthermore results from many studies in different conditions exhibited high r² and small mean errors when determining et24 based on this assumption see appendix table1a rn24 w m 2 in this equation is the daily net radiation obtained by the following equation 5 r n 24 r sw 24 1 α 110 τ sw 24 where rsw 24 α e τ sw 24 are respectively daily global solar radiation w m 2 obtained in the sonda station broadband surface albedo see appendix a and daily average atmospheric transmission which in turn was obtained by the ratio between rsw 24 w m 2 and daily solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere rsw toa w m 2 eq 5 is the slob s equation published by de bruin 1987 and mentioned by de bruin and stricker 2000 ferreira et al 2020 validated eq 5 application over different land uses for the same study area of this research laipelt et al 2020 also found good results applying this equation in a transitional area between tropical forest and savanna vegetation in brazil 2 5 starfm among the alternatives available to increase the frequency of images in an area the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm model gao et al 2006 2015 demonstrates effectiveness in the production of fused images from the landsat series sensors and the modis sensor this fusion combines the spatial resolution of the landsat series sensors with the temporal resolution of modis as long as there are a pair of images from both sensors before and or another after the date when a modis image is available in the study area each pixel of the merged image is generated in the center of a moving window according to the contribution weighted of three aspects observed in the neighboring pixels spectrally similar to the central one inside the window which are i spectral similarity between landsat sensors and modis pixels ii temporal difference between modis overpasses and iii spatial distance between the spectrally similar neighboring pixel and the central pixel of the moving window the starfm approach was originally developed to blend surface reflectance bands between high spatial resolution landsat sensors and high temporal resolution modis sensors but works well with multi scale eta imagery cammalleri et al 2014 this research proposes applying the algorithm to the variables albedo surface temperature and reflectance in the red band band 3 of etm 4 of oli and 1 of modis and near infrared band band 4 of etm 5 of oli and 2 of modis the estimates of these variables are used for the rn calculation fig 2 and consequently et24 see appendix a and b the estimates of these three key variables for the etm and oli tirs images were determined according to the set of equations presented in appendix a while for modis we used the modis products mentioned in subsection 2 2 therefore the estimation of the abovementioned variables at a landsat sensors resolution between landsat overpasses or close to a single landsat overpass is based on a weighting function applied within a specified search window 7 l x w 2 y w 2 t 0 i 1 w j 1 w k 1 n w ijk m x i y j t 0 l x i y j t k m x i y j t k in which w represents the size of the search window we set w 1470 m based on the homogeneity and the land cover changes of the study area according to gao et al 2006 the subscript x w 2 y w 2 represents the central pixel of the search window x i y j indicates the position of a given pixel in the moving window for both landsat l and modis m sensors t0 indicates the date of the pixel estimate at landsat sensor resolution and tk indicates the date of the landsat modis image pair k varies from 1 to n where n 2 when two landsat modis image pairs are available one before and one after date t0 the term w ijk represents the weight associated with the contribution of each moving window pixel in determining the central pixel pixels that are not spectrally similar to the central pixel have w ijk 0 this weight is supported in the three factor setup 1 spectral difference between modis and landsat s ijk 8 s ijk l x i y j t k m x i y j t k s ijk indicates the homogeneity of the modis pixel since it expresses the differences between a landsat pixel considered homogeneous and a modis pixel the result of contributions from a larger often heterogeneous surface area a low value of s ijk indicates that the high resolution landsat pixel has similar spectral characteristics to the surrounding pixels in the modis dimension so changes in the high resolution pixel will be comparable to changes in the low resolution pixel in this scenario the s ijk term will have a greater impact on the determination of w ijk and consequently on eq 7 a more general assumption is that if the modis and landsat information are equal at a given date tk they will be equal at t0 this can occur for a homogeneous pixel on the modis scale however there may be cases where there is equality between both sensors at time tk but there is a difference at time t0 as opposed to the previous assumption one measure to observe if this occurs is to calculate the differences that modis may show between tk and t0 dates as presented next 2 time difference between modis images t ijk 9 t ijk m x i y j t k m x i y j t 0 this factor accounts for the changes that occur between the date to be estimated t0 and the date tk if t ijk has a low value it means that the difference between the two dates is small and this pixel will have a greater impact on the determination of w ijk and consequently on eq 7 3 spatial distance between the central pixel of the search window x w 2 y w 2 and a spectrally similar pixel x i y j d ijk 10 d ijk x w 2 x i 2 y w 2 y j 2 this calculation measures the euclidean distance between the central pixel of the window and the spectrally similar pixel among the spectrally similar pixels those closest to the central pixel will represent a greater weight in the estimate the combination of these three factors was performed in order to make it less sensitive to spectral differences according to gao et al 2006 11 c ijk ln s ijk b 1 ln t ijk b 1 d ijk in which b is a scale factor equal to 10 000 and d ijk is the relative distance determined according to the expression 12 d ijk 1 d ijk a in which a is a constant that defines the relative importance of the spatial distance before temporal and spectral differences in eq 11 gao et al 2006 recommend the use of a 250 m for heterogeneous areas and this value was adopted in the present study finally the weighting function w ijk is determined using the following expression 13 w ijk 1 c ijk i 1 w j 1 w k 1 n 1 c ijk the criterion used for the selection of neighboring pixels spectrally similar to the central pixel of the moving window was the true observance of the following inequations i ii and iii i l x i y j t k l x w 2 y w 2 t k σ ii s ijk max l x w 2 y w 2 t k m x w 2 y w 2 t k σ lm iii t ijk max m x w 2 y w 2 t k m x w 2 y w 2 t 0 σ mm in which σ represents the standard deviation of the pixels inside the moving window σ lm and σ mm represent the uncertainty between the landsat modis estimates in the same date and modis modis between two dates respectively for the values σ lm and σ mm we adopted those proposed by gao et al 2006 for heterogeneous areas namely σ lm σ mm 0 01 for the red spectral band v and σ lm σ mm 0015 for the near infrared spectral band iv inequation i selects the pixels for starfm and is applied to the v and ir reflectances of landsat 8 bands 4 and 5 respectively in the available images i e when there are two pairs of landsat modis images inequation i is applied to the image preceding and succeeding the estimation date so the pixel is selected only when it meets the criteria on both dates the inequations ii and iii ensure that the selected pixels provide better spectral information than the central pixels of the moving window gao et al 2006 fig 4 describes the procedures followed for the execution of starfm the algorithm was executed using the python programming language version 3 7 in the google colab platform the script used is available freely on the github website https github com thomasmcz sebal starfm anyone with a google account can access execute this script and export the data to a folder on google drive to evaluate the starfm estimates the algorithm was applied to a larger area 2300 km² containing the study area using two pairs of landsat 8 modis images the first on october 27 and the second on december 14 2015 aiming to obtain an image on november 12 of the same year on this day a cloudless landsat 8 image is available which allowed us to ascertain the efficiency in the estimates of some biophysical variables such as ndvi ts albedo and rn at the satellite overpass rn over see appendix a which are key variables for obtaining eta from these variables the pixels classified as agriculture according to the mapbiomas land use and land cover classification mapbiomas 2020 were extracted to perform the starfm validation 2 6 time continuous daily and monthly evapotranspiration at the end of the execution of the starfm algorithm we obtained images with landsat spatial resolution and modis temporal resolution for clear sky days ready for applying the sebal algorithm to obtain et24 to obtain a time continuous database of et24 we used an interpolation of the ratio fpet et24 et0 24 produced between satellites overpasses days et0 24 was calculated using the penman monteith formulation following food and agricultural organization fao 56 standard in allen et al 1998 in other words et24 fpet et0 24 this approach is well known and widely used in applications with remote sensing based eta models allen et al 2007a anderson et al 2007 castelli et al 2018 shamloo et al 2021 yang et al 2012 we assessed the performance of both interpolations landsat only and landsat fusion to determine if there is an improvement in et24 estimates by adding fused images the monthly eta was calculated by adding the daily eta 2 7 irrigation management assessment a water balance approach fao 56 allen et al 2007b was used to assess the management of irrigation in the study area during the 2015 2016 growing season a daily water balance model eq 14 was used to track the daily fluxes of water entering and leaving the system by accounting for precipitation p net irrigation inet crop et et24 surface runoff ro and deep percolation of water below the rootzone dp solving for the current day soil water content swi 14 sw i sw i 1 p i net ro dp et 24 daily precipitation data used in the water balance model was collected from embapa weather station fig 1 daily net irrigation was determined based on the amount of water applied through the sub surface micro irrigation system while accounting for the 90 application efficiency the company that managed the agricultural crop irrigation in the experimental area supplied the total volume of water applied in a given day which was converted to mm day of irrigation by dividing the volume of water applied by the area irrigated surface runoff was calculated using daily precipitation and the usda natural resources conservation service runoff equation using a curve number of 0 78 based on the crop and the soil type araújo neto et al 2012 oliveira et al 2016 and usda nrcs 2012 deep percolation of water below the rootzone was calculated based on the excess water received beyond the soil water holding capacity or field capacity fc if water received at the soil either through precipitation or irrigation resulted in the current day soil water content exceeding fc the difference in water content between the current day soil water content and fc was allocated as deep percolation the volumetric soil fc and wilting point wp values were 0 38 and 0 16 celestino 2017 the difference between fc and wp represents the total available water taw to vegetation for growth within the rootzone zr eq 15 the amount of water available to vegetation before water stress occurs known as readily available water raw was based on a crop specific depletion fraction p 0 65 and the current day et24 where p was adjusted based on et24 demands eqs 16 and 17 allen at al 1998 a constant root depth of 1 2 m was used throughout the growing season as the sugarcane crop had been harvested once before and the roots had been established prior to the 2015 2016 growing season 15 taw 1000 fc wp z r 16 p adj p 0 04 5 et c 17 raw p adj taw et24 used to update the water balance model was measured using the bowen ratio tower et24 tower located within the research field site see fig 1 the water balance model required the start of season soil water content while this parameter was not measured irrigation was applied early season in order to refill the soil profile until soil water content reached fc using the applied irrigation and water balance model the initial soil water content was estimated through back calculations where an initial soil water content of 262 mm m on 14 june 2015 resulted in the soil water content reaching fc on 28 july 2015 two additional water balance models were completed using the same data as in the et24 tower water balance model except for the et24 tower used to update the models which was estimated with sebal informed with landsat images et24 landsat and the landsat and landsat modis fused images from the starfm model et24 landsat fused the two water balance models updated with estimated et24 were evaluated against the water balance model updated with et24 tower this comparison helped evaluate the differences in estimated rootzone soil water depletion when using estimated et24 from sebal informed with landsat and landsat modis fused images which is a critical aspect in accurately managing irrigation to avoid crop water stress 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of starfm performance in the spatial evaluation of starfm the similarity with respect to the maps derived from oli tirs is remarkable fig 5 the fusion produced maps that represent well the spatial variability found in the different types of land use and land cover and indicate that the use of the parameters for heterogeneous areas proposed by gao et al 2006 is quite adequate for the study area among the mean errors mae mre and rmse fig 6 a the metrics that have the same magnitude of the variable mae and rmse indicate greater values for rn over and lower values for ndvi and albedo this is due to the greater numerical scale presented by rn over compared to ndvi and albedo when analyzing the mre ndvi and albedo presented greater errors than ts and rn over indicating that starfm presents greater inconsistency in these variables which may be associated with the different crop types and phenological stages however these mismatches were not large enough to affect the estimates of rn over which showed an mre of approximately 2 and a coefficient of determination of 0 78 fig 6b yielding good results considering the sample size n 235 612 the limited errors presented in the estimates of ts are crucial for the high performance of the technique under rn over considering that ts is a crucial variable in the computation of the longwave radiation emitted by the surface in the longwave balance and consequently in rn over see appendix a 3 2 validation of the evapotranspiration estimate according to the et24 and fpet time series plots both landsat only and landsat fused images reproduced well the seasonal fluctuations represented by the bowen ratio method figs 7 a and 7 b the slight difference between these two modeled results occurred between landsat overpass days a consequence of the inclusion of the fused data in 2016 we observe less images compared to 2015 especially in january and between march day of the year doy 71 and april doy 117 which affects the fpet performance those gaps occurred due to a persistent presence of clouds in satellites overpass times which are climatologically expected in this region ferreira et al 2020 even under this circumstance both landsat only and landsat fused images captured well the behavior presented by et24 tower which is partly due to the interpolation of fpet but mostly because et0 24 captures the decline of rsw in response to cloudy days that highly impacts the rn and consequently et0 24 the estimated et24 results et24 landsat for landsat overpass days fig 8 a showed that r2 mbe pbias and rmse were 0 71 0 30 mm d 1 4 13 0 70 mm d 1 respectively indicating good accuracy and better results compared to results from fused images in modis overpass days fig 8 b which presented r2 mbe pbias and rmse equal to 0 60 0 40 mm d 1 6 23 0 84 mm d 1 respectively many studies evaluated the accuracy of sebal applied to landsat series over different crops climatic regions and ground based measurements see appendix table 1a on the other hand the results of the fusion point to a more scattered plot around the 1 1 line compared to landsat only et24 and on average fused only results indicated an overestimation these differences between landsat only and fusion only can be addressed to the influence of the temporal distance in the thermal images produced by the starfm with inaccuracies see figs 5 and 6 a negatively affecting the extreme pixels selection and subsequently sebal s iterative process see subsection 2 3 and appendix b those issues were minimized in the interpolation to obtain et24 for all days see subsection 2 6 using landsat and fused images fig 8 d which produced similar r2 0 62 and better mbe 0 15 mm d 1 pbias 2 75 and rmse 0 97 mm d 1 than using landsat only interpolation fig 8 c which had r2 mbe pbias and rmse equal to 0 65 0 31 mm d 1 5 25 0 97 mm d 1 respectively on a monthly basis we found r2 mbe pbias and rmse equal to 0 92 8 78 mm month 1 5 65 and 17 66 mm month 1 respectively for etm landsat fig 8 e and r2 mbe pbias and rmse equal to 0 91 4 28 mm month 1 2 75 16 66 mm month 1 for etm landsat fused fig 8 f although et landsat fused mean errors were lower in both scales daily continuous and monthly the improvement with using fused images can be perceived more clearly when considering a monthly basis rather than daily especially in terms of mbe a reduction of 4 5 mm month 1 or pbias from 5 65 to 2 75 cammalleri et al 2013 also detected that the use of fused images diminishes the underestimation observed by the landsat only approach noticing that changes in crop stress and soil evaporation are most likely to be detected by adding fused images especially considering the season cumulative eta please see the discussion on subsection 3 3 according to allen et al 2007a in general one satellite image per month is enough to build an accurate fpet curve for estimating seasonal eta but during periods of rapid vegetation change higher temporal resolution is more adequate gavilán and berengena 2007 evaluated the bowen ratio approach in an irrigated grass festuca arundinacea schreb comparing the eta estimation with measurements of a weighing lysimeter located at the center of the field the results showed an overestimation of 5 5 on average for daily eta and 5 7 on average when only daylight hours were considered in this study the tower of the experiment was 7 m in height and located relatively close to the border of the field downwind that had 15 ha please see fig 1 which means a fetch to height ratio higher than 20 1 recommended by heilman et al 1989 in this case the accuracy of the bowen ratio method consists in delimiting the limit of negative values of h le well in order to obtain consistent results with respect to the fei and with respect to et24 tanner 1960 heilman et al 1989 perez et al 1999 payero et al 2003 as mentioned in subsection 2 1 the method described by perez et al 1999 was used to discard periods in which h le is around 1 considering the conditions of the experiment and that other remote sensing studies showed similar statistical results compared to this study while evaluating the application of a fusion model to different eta models over different crops and different climatic regions table 1 and that in all cases the rmse presented here were lower than 1 mm d 1 it is reasonable to assume that the methodology proposed by this research is promising and can be used to determine et24 regarding the sebal estimates a consideration should be given to these good results when using the evaporative fraction ef instead of hourly reference eta fraction etrf a method that makes use of the alfalfa reference evapotranspiration for extrapolation of instantaneous eta to 24 h allen et al 2011 according to allen et al 2011 the etrf method compensates for regional advection effects the impacts of advection are represented well by the penman monteith equation however the bowen ratio method is less accurate when the experimental area presents considerable advection of sensible heat therefore there is an incompatibility between these methodologies which leads us to believe that a validation using bowen s ratio is more effective when we use the ef method it is worth mentioning that good estimates of daily net radiation r n 24 are essential to obtain good results of eta when using ef ferreira et al 2020 proved the efficiency of obtaining r n 24 by slob s equation eq 5 obtained from de bruin 1987 over the same sugarcane field of this study rmse 9 30 w m 2 laipelt et al 2020 also obtained good results using this expression in a transition area between amazon and cerrado biomes in brazil rmse 13 50 w m 2 3 3 water balance irrigation evaluation although 2015 and 2016 were drought years in the study area marengo et al 2020 a 290 mm rainfall depth was registered in january 2016 a volume more than sufficient to meet the water needs of the crops without taking this month into account water inputs were predominantly from irrigation management the irrigation was stopped 18 days before harvest which is a common approach in this region due to the clay soil which under irrigation makes it difficult to operate the harvesting machinery regarding the outputs cumulative et0 24 can be used as a metric to understand the atmospheric demand and in this sense we can compare its behavior with the cumulative et24 observed and modeled we observed that the et0 24 curve is systematically greater than et24 tower for both et24 landsat fig 9 a and et24 landsat fused fig 9 b and both modeled et24 curves follow the same behavior as et0 24 due to its dependence but the same does not necessarily happen at all points on the et24 tower curve in the dry period jun dez 2015 the frequency of cloud free images is much higher and the superposition of the cumulative curves of et24 landsat fused and et24 tower indicates that the use of fused images contributes to a better representativeness of et24 at the daily and continuous scale which is especially important for irrigation adjustment on dry days however the frequent cloud cover from the end of 2015 in some cases associated with rainy days limited the number of satellite images and resulted in a distancing of the abovementioned curves with the et24 landsat fused showing underestimation albeit the et24 landsat fused curve responded well to the seasonal variability indicating an underestimation in relation to the observed one since the start of the growing season this underestimation was intensified when interpolations between distant dates were required e g between dec 22 2015 and feb 8 2016 related to the irrigation seasonal water balance models were computed using daily measured et24 from the bowen ratio tower wbmeasured and estimated et24 from the sebal model informed with landsat images only wblandsat and landsat fused images wbfused the water balance models accounted for precipitation net irrigation runoff deep percolation and et24 and solved for the current day rootzone soil water content modeled rootzone depletion dr was calculated by subtracting the current soil water content from fc the wbmeasured model informed with measured et24 showed periods of water stress when dr raw mid and late season fig 10a during the 2015 2016 growing season the field managers determined irrigation demands by quantifying daily et24 using the crop coefficient method et24 kc et0 24 allen et al 1988 where et0 24 was calculated using the meteorological data collected at a private weather station after requesting access to the data it was observed that this station generated lower et0 24 in comparison to two additional weather stations located within 10 km of each other embrapa see fig 1 and labmet 2022 stations the 2015 2016 growing season cumulative et0 24 provided by the private embrapa and labmet stations were 1698 2064 and 1953 mm respectively fig 11 the low rsw 24 from the private station resulted in an underestimation of et24 and therefore less irrigation was applied than what was required to avoid crop water stress the wblandsat and wbfused models which were updated with et24 estimated using sebal informed with landsat images only and landsat fused images also showed periods of water stress figs 10b and 10c in comparing the three wb models the wbfused model resulted in better tracking of actual soil water content than the wblandsat model in comparison to the wbmeasured model which is due to more accurate estimations of et24 used in updating the wbfused model the wblandsat model would have scheduled less irrigation than the wbmeasured model as the estimated et24 used to update the wblandsat model was more than 100 mm less than measured et24 when considering cumulative growing season et24 water stress also occurred on significantly fewer days 51 in the wblandsat model in comparison to the wbmeasured 175 and wbfused 193 models table 2 cumulative et24 was greater than cumulative estimated et24 from the sebal model informed with landsat only and landsat fused images the estimated daily interpolated and cumulative et24 from sebal informed with landsat fused images compared better to measured et24 than estimated et24 from sebal informed with landsat images only figs 8c and 8 d table 2 irrigation is typically managed to avoid crop water stress where soil water content is maintained above a level so that the crop s transpiration rate is not restricted by water limitations a wb model can be used for determining depths and timing of irrigations as it can track the amount of water available to crops before water stress occurs when using a wb model for this purpose the predominant water flux of interest and hardest to accurately obtain is et24 as it is not easily measured and is dependent on various meteorological conditions and vegetative characteristics et24 is also typically the largest water flux in the context of agricultural crops which makes its quantification important for accurately scheduling irrigations 4 conclusions this study proposed a methodology to incorporate the data fusion model starfm into the energy balance model sebal in order to assess evapotranspiration and soil water balance in a sugarcane pilot area of the brazilian semiarid region satellite images and surface meteorological data were required to run the models the performance of estimating key variables used to obtain eta was evaluated as well as the performance of eta estimation itself two water balances were assessed one considering remote sensing images non fused as input for a soil water balance model and another considering both fused and non fused data image fusion produced maps that represented the key variables and the radiation balance well rn ts ndvi and albedo showed rmse of 17 00 w m 2 2 28 k 0 07 and 0 01 respectively which indicates that the starfm technique and the parameters used for heterogeneous areas are suitable for the study area and can be integrated with sebal to produce et24 maps the metrics used to evaluate the et24 and etm estimates indicated that the use of starfm with sebal in landsat and modis images present low average errors pbias 2 75 e rmse 0 97 mm d 1 e 16 66 mm month 1 and high coefficient of determination 0 87 for continuous et24 and 0 91 for etm in comparison with sebal using landsat only images pbias 5 25 rmse 0 97 mm d 1 e 17 66 mm month 1 r² 0 92 therefore studies using the presented methodology can benefit from a higher spatial temporal resolution while working with a renowned and well known energy balance model such as sebal the increased image frequency due to the addition of fused images resulted in a better fit of the estimated cumulative et24 curve relative to measured et24 this improvement was evident in the dry period where more cloud free images were available the water balance indicated that the cultivated sugarcane experienced water stress in the middle and late season a circumstance that was better represented using et24 derived from landsat fused images than the landsat images alone although this increase in temporal resolution of the estimated et24 indicated a greater water consumption it provided sufficient information for managing irrigation to better meet crop water demands the results of this study report a technique that can be used to assess water demanded by crops and irrigation practices with the potential to improve irrigation schedules funding this study was conducted in partial fulfillment of the doctoral
