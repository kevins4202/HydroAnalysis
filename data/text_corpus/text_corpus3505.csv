respirometric method oecd 2003 ndma fps were monitored before and after batch tests to evaluate the removal or deactivation in ndma precursors four types of as were collected from aeration basins to

for the sbrs are provided in table s3 and table s4 samples of as 1 as 2 and as 3 mixed liquor were transported to the lab within 1 h of collection and then aerated for no more than 12 h at 23 2 c for preconditioning prior to the batch tests as liquor was centrifuged 2000 g 5 min the supernatant was decanted and the solids were resuspended in a mineral solution table s5 ph 7 4 buffered with 4 mm phosphate oecd 2003 to a concentration of 6000 mg l the same procedure was repeated three times to remove background ndma precursors from the as liquor the washed as biomass was then resuspended in the mineral solution to a concentration of 3000 mg l as liquor 500 ml washed and resuspended was transferred to a 1 l incubation bottle dosed with a predetermined amount of precursor solution i e with a target ndma fp of 1000 ng l for each compound under well mixing conditions and then aerated for 6 or 24 h at 25 2 c the air flow rate i e 150 l m3 min was set as close as possible to the rates used in practice i e 20 90 l m3 min in aeration basins at wwtps gray 2004 at the end of incubation i e after 6 or 24 h 125 ml samples were harvested and filtered 0 45 μm the filtrate was then used in the ndma fp test to monitor the reduction in ndma fp via biosorption alone sodium azide nan3 5 g g mixed liquor suspended solids mlss was added to the washed and resuspended as liquor under gentle mixing conditions after 24 h contact time nan3 was removed by washing the as biomass four times in the mineral solution i e 6000 mg l the washed as biomass was then resuspended in the mineral solution with the mlss adjusted to 3000 mg l to confirm the effectiveness of nan3 deactivation oxygen o2 uptake was monitored using a respirometer oxymax er 10 columbus instruments us throughout the 6 h occasionally 10 h biosorption test a negligible o2 uptake was presumed to be an adequate metric for a lack of microbial activity fig s1 reduction in ndma fp via biodegradation alone was examined by employing a low concentration of mlss 200 mg l and pre biosorbed biomass i e 30 min pre contact of as biomass with ndma precursors more details shown in supplement information to minimize interferences from the biosorption process the incubation time for the biodegradation tests was extended up to 10 d to obtain measurable reduction in ndma fps reduction in ndma fp via volatilization was evaluated by dosing ndma precursors into the mineral solution and aerating for 6 h in the absence of any as biomass ndma fps were measured before and after 6 h incubation 2 4 ndma fp test for the ndma fp test samples were buffered with 20 mm phosphate ph 7 8 0 2 and then chloraminated by adding a pre determined volume of monochloramine stock solution 2000 mg cl2 l to achieve the target dosage i e 100 mg cl2 l the monochloramine stock solution was freshly prepared by adding a sodium hypochlorite solution naclo 4000 mg cl2 l to an ammonium chloride solution nh4cl 1000 mg n l drop by drop at ph 9 with a cl n mass ratio of 4 1 the chloraminated samples were then incubated in the dark at 23 2 c for 5 d the residual chloramines were then quenched by adding an excess amount of sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 the quenched samples were then extracted and analyzed for ndma according to us epa method 521 us epa 2004 details on the ndma extraction and analysis method are described elsewhere selbes et al 2013 beita sandi et al 2019 the minimum reporting level for ndma is 2 0 ng l 3 results and discussion 3 1 reduction in ndma fps of model precursors ndma fp of rntd was reduced by 34 87 after 24 h incubation with four different types of as fig 1 ndma fps of tma and mncl were reduced by 92 98 and 77 97 respectively while ndma fp of smtr decreased to a lesser extent i e 29 46 depending on the types of as these overall reductions were achieved via both biotic i e biodegradation and abiotic i e biosorption volatilization processes tma is known to be readily biodegradable with 71 removals previously reported during biological treatment mitch and sedlak 2004 wang et al 2014 mncl contains hydroxyl functional groups attached to ring structures which can enhance its biodegradability okey and stensel 1996 unlike tma or mncl rntd contains a nitryl no2 functional group and smtr contains a sulfonamide nh so2 functional group both of which may impede biodegradation okey and stensel 1996 in addition to the structures of ndma precursors the sources of as biomass also affected the overall removal of ndma fps as 1 was collected from a rural municipal wwtp with an extended aeration process i e 22 24 h hrt and a high level of nitrification i e undetectable ammonia in the secondary effluent with this source of as there was an 87 decrease in ndma fp of rntd after 24 h incubation as 2 was collected from an urban municipal wwtp with biological nutrient removal process 14 h hrt this source of as reduced the ndma fp of rntd by 59 further lower reduction in ndma fp of rntd was found after 24 h incubation with the textile i e 41 and lab grown as i e 34 both as 1 and as 2 exhibited relatively high reductions in ndma fps of the three amine based pharmaceuticals i e rntd mncl and smtr while the lab grown as i e as 4 showed the lowest reduction previous studies have shown that municipal as has diverse microbial communities due to the complexity of organic contaminants including ppcps present in municipal wastewater influents while as fed with simple nutrients such as as 4 fed with a synthetic wastewater and as 3 fed with textile wastewater likely has less diverse microbial communities zhao et al 2006 the diversity and richness of microbial species likely favors removal of xenobiotic compounds kraigher et al 2008 chonova et al 2016 kim et al 2017 among the four types of as tested as 3 collected from a textile wwtp exhibited the largest seasonal variations in the reduction of some ndma precursors e g rntd and smtr table s6 the decreases in ndma fps of rntd and smtr varied by 36 and 23 respectively after 24 h incubation with as 3 collected in three different seasons while reductions in ndma fps of tma and mncl varied by 9 12 in contrast 10 variations in ndma fp reduction were observed after 24 h incubation with municipal wwtp as i e as 1 or as 2 collected during three seasons in the textile wwtp seasonal changes in the manufacturing processes may result in fluctuations in the wastewater influent components and thus the as 3 properties i e color mlss settleability however the operating conditions for the two municipal wwtps i e wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 were consistent during our sampling campaigns occasionally wwtp 1 was influenced from rain events producing increased influent flow rates during one such event air supply to the aeration tank was shut off and the mlss in as 1 dropped to 1000 mg l as 1 collected during such rain events 1000 mg l mlss showed 12 34 lower levels of decreases in ndma fps for all tested model precursor compounds compared to those measured under routine operating conditions with 3000 mg l mlss fig s2 the effects of selected operational parameters i e hrt and srt on deactivations of model precursor compounds were also examined when the duration of the batch tests i e simulating hrt was increased from 6 to 24 h the reduction in ndma fp of rntd increased from 81 to 88 for as 1 from 34 to 54 for as 2 or from 32 to 62 for as 3 fig 2 these observations are consistent with previous studies showing a significant p 0 05 positive correlation between removal of rntd and the hrts of the as process at different wwtps fig s3 in contrast an increase in hrt did not affect the extent of ndma fp reduction for tma mncl or smtr the reduction in ndma fps for tma and mncl were nearly 100 after 6 h of incubation and further incubation thus has no impact increasing hrt did not impact the extent of ndma fp reduction for smtr which is relatively bio refractory on the other hand rntd is considered to be moderately biodegradable e g with average removal efficiencies between 40 and 70 after 24 h as treatment at wwtps gros et al 2010 consequently removal of its ndma fp was more affected by hrt the effect of srt was examined for rntd using lab grown as 4 for nominal srts of 4 8 and 12 d ndma fp reductions were 26 30 and 38 respectively increases in srt are expected to increase diversity in the as microbial community by retaining microorganisms with slower growth rates e g nitrifiers jelic et al 2011 this may enhance deactivation of compounds with a moderate level of biodegradability such as rntd jelic et al 2011 a longer srt may also favor biosorption of polar compounds onto as particles petrie et al 2014 such as rntd 3 2 biosorption of model ndma precursors the contribution of biodegradation to overall ndma fp reduction was defined as the difference between the overall reduction and the reduction via biosorption plus volatilization reductions due to biosorption based on inhibition of respiration with nan3 and volatilization in the absence of as were measured separately the reduction in ndma fp of rntd occurred mainly via biosorption while biodegradation contributed less than 25 to the overall reduction during 6 h as treatment fig 3 similarly biodegradation accounted for only 1 and 2 11 of ndma fp reduction for mncl and smtr respectively when treated with the three wwtp as i e as 1 as 2 and as 3 in contrast the ndma fp of tma was mainly decreased via biodegradation i e 74 98 during treatment with as 2 as 3 and as 4 although nearly 100 of its ndma fp decrease was observed via biosorption with as 1 the lower biosorption of tma as compared to the other model precursors is probably due to its relatively higher water solubility i e 410 g l compared to 0 025 52 g l of the other compounds for all tested precursor compounds volatilization during 6 h incubation in the absence of any as biomass had a negligible impact on ndma fps fig s4 these results indicate that biosorption was an important removal mechanism for the tested ndma precursors especially for the high molecular weight compounds while the effect of volatilization was negligible reduction in ndma fp via biosorption also depended on the sources of as as 1 exhibited higher uptakes for rntd and tma while as 4 exhibited the lowest level of biosorption of tma mncl and smtr the physiochemical properties of as such as its settleability e g sludge volume index the amounts and composition of extracellular polymeric substances eps and the presence of floc forming microbes may affect the surface charges of as sponza 2002 wilen et al 2003 2008 and thus the adsorption of polar compounds onto as particles steiner et al 1976 in this study the inconsistent biosorption efficiencies among the four as were likely because of their distinct properties or characteristics the influent compositions and operating conditions at wwtps or lab scale sbr for as 4 can both impact as properties sponza 2002 ahn et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 the solid water distribution coefficients kd of precursor compounds biosorbed onto different as samples were calculated based on ndma fps measured in both aqueous and solid phases table s7 the log kd values of the tested model precursors biosorbed onto different sources of as were at least twofold higher than log kow this may suggest that adsorption of precursor compounds onto as particles was governed by factors other than hydrophobic interactions such as electrostatic interactions golet et al 2003 under the near neutral ph condition of the biosorption experiments ph 7 4 0 2 dma functional groups i e n ch3 2 of precursor compounds are positively charged and tend to bind to negatively charged carboxyl and or hydroxyl groups on as surfaces steiner et al 1976 shen and andrews 2013b biosorption of xenobiotic compounds is typically considered to be a rapid process e g completed within hours or even minutes savci 2013 vasiliadou et al 2013 martinez hernandez et al 2016 to examine the biosorption kinetics ndma fps of model precursor compounds were monitored up to 10 h during the biosorption tests with nan3 deactivated as liquor 3000 mg l mlss the two municipal as as 1 and as 2 and a new sample of as 3 designated as 3 in fig 4 were employed for biosorption kinetics tests as 3 was collected from the textile wwtp after a new manufacturing process was launched which resulted in substantially altered as properties e g lighter color increased mlss and enhanced settleability as 3 exhibited 2 56 more reduction of ndma fp via biosorption than as 3 after 6 h incubation fig s5 in general increasing the contact time from 2 to 10 h during the biosorption tests had small impacts on the ndma fp removals i e 18 differences for rntd mncl and smtr despite the different types of as i e as 1 as 2 and as 3 the only exception was tma for which ndma fp reductions were 33 41 higher after 6 or 10 h incubation compared to 2 h incubation with as 2 and as 3 the increased reduction of ndma fp may have been due to a recovery in biodegradation activity rather than biosorption as the incubation duration increased from 2 to 10 h the oxygen uptake rates by nan3 deactivated as slightly increased fig s1 suggesting the gradually recovering microbial activities during the biosorption tests overall these results indicate that reductions in ndma fp for the model precursors via biosorption were completed in less time i e 2 h than the lower end of hrts at most wwtps gray 2004 3 3 biodegradation of model ndma precursors decreases in ndma fp via biodegradation were investigated for rntd 100 nm and smtr 200 nm using as 1 collected during the spring and summer and as 4 at 8 and 24 d srts with a mlss concentration of 150 200 mg l after 10 d of incubation the decrease in ndma fp for rntd was highest for as 1 collected in summer followed by as 1 collected in spring as 4 at an 8 d srt and as 4 at a 24 d srt fig 5 these results suggest that ndma fp reduction for rntd via biodegradation depended on seasonal variations in as and srt as 1 had higher removals of organic carbon and ammonia in summer than in spring table s8 on the other hand the mlss in as 4 with a shorter srt may have had more active biomass than that with a longer srt and thus exhibited a better reduction in ndma fp for rntd via biodegradation as srt decreases as biomass may contain more abundant eps which has been shown to favor the initial uptake and subsequent biodegradation of compounds al halbouni et al 2008 xu et al 2013 extending the incubation time of the assay to 10 d enhanced ndma fp reduction for rntd to 52 71 and 34 44 with as 1 and as 4 respectively while only to 7 29 for smtr the decrease in ndma fp of rntd via biodegradation followed pseudo first order kinetics r2 0 86 fig s6 during the 10 d incubation with as 4 8 and 24 d srt and as 1 collected in spring with the ratios of mlss to rntd concentration i e mlss rntd increasing from 0 5 to 1 5 3 0 and 6 0 mg µg the pseudo first order biodegradation rate constants increased from 0 067 to 0 146 0 301 and 0 398 d 1 respectively during incubation with as 4 at an 8 d srt for as 4 at a 24 d srt the rate constants increased from 0 043 to 0 059 0 230 and 0 355 d 1 respectively fig s6 the slower biodegradation rate for a lower mlss rntd was likely because of the toxicity of rntd to microorganisms in as a high concentration of rntd e g 2 5 mg l has been found to inhibit microbial activities of as and thus reduce its biodegradation rates carucci et al 2006 3 4 deactivation of ndma precursors from sewage components among the tested sewage components urine blackwaters exhibited the highest ndma fp i e 11338 1958 ng l in urine prior to ingestion of rntd u 7077 1414 ng l in urine following ingestion of rntd ur this result occurred despite a 250 fold dilution of the urine in dechlorinated tap water to mimic toilet flushing and maintain the ndma fp in a proper range i e not exceeding tens of thousands ng l for gc ms ms analysis table s2 kitchen greywater containing food ingredients kf also exhibited relatively high ndma fp i e 11001 3696 ng l despite a 100 fold dilution in dechlorinated tap water ndma fp in other sewage components were generally less than 3000 ng l although rntd is considered to be a high yielding ndma precursor ndma fps in urine or feces after ingestion of rntd were comparable or even lower than those in pre rntd urine or feces this suggests that rntd and its metabolites may not be significant sources of ndma precursors from human urine or feces the main contributors to ndma fp from urine are still unknown ndma fps of known precursors that are found in urine such as dma tma trimethylamine n oxide are relatively low mitch and sedlak 2004 ndma fp in laundry greywater containing detergent only ld 470 97 ng l ndma fp was similar to that containing both detergent and fabric softener lf 501 96 ng l ndma fp suggesting that fabric softener may not be an important source of ndma precursors shower greywater with the use of shampoo only ss 449 0 ng l ndma fp exhibited slightly higher ndma fp than that not containing any personal care products s 378 8 ng l ndma fp or that with the use of body wash only sb 353 5 ng l ndma fp while shampoo might be a source of ndma precursors e g surfactant ingredients zeng and mitch 2015 the majority of ndma precursors present in shower greywaters may originate from sources other than personal care products such as trimethylamine n oxide choline and betaine excreted in human sweat ayesh et al 1993 craig et al 2010 subramaniam and fletcher 2018 which have been shown to yield ndma fp mitch and sedlak 2004 kemper et al 2010 the doc normalized ndma fp i e ndma fp doc was calculated to evaluate the reactivities of sewage components in forming ndma fp urine showed the highest doc normalized ndma fp 2344 7314 ng mg followed by feces 133 505 ng mg and kitchen greywaters 168 487 ng mg while the doc normalized ndma fps in the other sewage components were 35 ng mg this suggests that ndma precursors from the collected biological samples i e human urine and feces food ingredients may have higher reactivities in forming ndma fp than anthropogenic constituents e g laundry detergent personal care products such as shampoo and body wash treating sewage components with wwtp as i e as 1 3 generally decreased ndma fps fig 6 and fig s7 ndma fps in ld ss and kd greywaters which contain detergents or shampoo increased after 6 h incubation with as 1 and then decreased after 24 h incubation biodegradation of surfactants foam stabilizers emulsifiers and some dyes used for manufacturing detergents or shampoos may increase ndma fp due to formation of intermediates containing dma groups fig s8 a longer hrt i e 24 h favored the removal of such intermediates after 24 h incubation with the three wwtp as most sewage components showed relatively low ndma fps i e 370 ng l except for the urine blackwater pre and post rntd which still exhibited relatively high ndma fps i e 1157 6621 ng l the relative importance of each sewage component contributing to the overall ndma fp in domestic sewage and secondary effluent was evaluated using the following equation 2 r i c i v i c i v i where ri is the relative importance of an individual sewage component contributing to ndma fp ci is ndma fp measured for an individual sewage component ng l and vi is the volume fraction of each individual component in domestic sewage or secondary effluent table s9 according to the calculated contributions to ndma fp urine contributed 92 of the overall ndma fp in domestic sewage followed by kitchen greywater 7 and feces 1 after 6 or 24 h incubation with different sources of as urine was still the dominant contributor 90 98 to ndma fp followed by kitchen greywater 5 and laundry greywater 4 known ingredients in secondary effluents such as dma tma amino acids peptides and amino sugars have been found not to be the major sources of ndma precursors mitch and sedlak 2004 wang et al 2014 additional studies are needed to investigate the constituents in human urine responsible for its dominant contribution to ndma fps in wastewater influents and effluents the mechanisms responsible for reducing ndma fps from urine and feces were evaluated using nan3 treated as 2 i e via biosorption and fresh as 1 collected in spring i e via biodegradation nearly 100 of ndma fp in urine pre and post rntd was reduced via biosorption while 64 of ndma fp from feces pre and post rntd was reduced via biodegradation for the 2 d 7 d and 10 d biodegradation tests with fresh as 1 reductions in ndma fp for urine were 24 38 and 49 respectively which were comparable to those for rntd i e 24 46 and 52 respectively these results suggest that ndma precursors in urine may have a moderate biodegradability like rntd because removal of ndma precursors with moderate biodegradability is dependent on treatment conditions i e hrt srt mlss and as activity reductions in ndma fps from wastewaters are thus varying among wwtps 4 conclusions in this study decreases in

from urine although the necessary increase in aeration basin capacity make this a costly solution biosorption was the most important mechanism responsible for ndma fp reduction especially for high molecular weight compounds e g amine based pharmaceuticals removal of ndma precursors via biosorption may depend on as properties which vary with influent compositions and operating conditions at

to enhance inactivation of precursors targeted addition of mlss with microbes that biodegrade ndma precursors is one such approach urine blackwater among the tested blackwaters and greywaters was the most important contributor to ndma precursors in domestic sewage and as treated secondary effluents separating human urine from domestic sewage may thus significantly reduce ndma precursors present in

for the sbrs are provided in table s3 and table s4 samples of as 1 as 2 and as 3 mixed liquor were transported to the lab within 1 h of collection and then aerated for no more than 12 h at 23 2 c for preconditioning prior to the batch tests as liquor was centrifuged 2000 g 5 min the supernatant was decanted and the solids were resuspended in a mineral solution table s5 ph 7 4 buffered with 4 mm phosphate oecd 2003 to a concentration of 6000 mg l the same procedure was repeated three times to remove background ndma precursors from the as liquor the washed as biomass was then resuspended in the mineral solution to a concentration of 3000 mg l as liquor 500 ml washed and resuspended was transferred to a 1 l incubation bottle dosed with a predetermined amount of precursor solution i e with a target ndma fp of 1000 ng l for each compound under well mixing conditions and then aerated for 6 or 24 h at 25 2 c the air flow rate i e 150 l m3 min was set as close as possible to the rates used

ndma fp test to monitor the reduction in ndma fp via biosorption alone sodium azide nan3 5 g g mixed liquor suspended solids mlss was added to the washed and resuspended as liquor under gentle mixing conditions after 24 h contact time nan3 was removed by washing the as biomass four times in the mineral solution i e 6000 mg l the washed as biomass was then resuspended in the mineral solution with the mlss adjusted to 3000 mg l to confirm the effectiveness of nan3 deactivation oxygen o2 uptake was monitored using a respirometer oxymax er 10 columbus instruments us throughout the 6 h occasionally 10 h biosorption test a negligible o2 uptake was presumed to be an adequate metric for a lack of microbial activity fig s1 reduction in ndma fp via biodegradation alone was examined by employing a low concentration of mlss 200 mg l and pre biosorbed biomass i e 30 min pre contact of as biomass with ndma precursors more details shown in supplement information to minimize interferences from the biosorption process the incubation time for the biodegradation tests was extended up to 10 d to obtain measurable reduction in ndma fps reduction in ndma fp via volatilization was evaluated by dosing ndma precursors into the mineral solution and aerating for 6 h in the absence of any as biomass ndma fps were measured before and after 6 h incubation 2 4 ndma fp test for the ndma fp test samples were buffered with 20 mm phosphate ph 7 8 0 2 and then chloraminated by adding a pre determined volume of monochloramine stock solution 2000 mg cl2 l to achieve the target dosage i e 100 mg cl2 l the monochloramine stock solution was freshly prepared by adding a sodium hypochlorite solution naclo 4000 mg cl2 l to an ammonium chloride solution nh4cl 1000 mg n l drop by drop at ph 9 with a cl n mass ratio of 4 1 the chloraminated samples were then incubated in the dark at 23 2 c for 5 d the residual chloramines were then quenched by adding an excess amount of sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 the quenched samples were then extracted and analyzed for ndma according to us epa method 521 us epa 2004 details on the ndma extraction and analysis method are described elsewhere selbes et al 2013 beita sandi et al 2019 the minimum reporting level for ndma is 2 0 ng l 3 results and discussion 3 1 reduction in ndma fps of model precursors ndma fp of rntd was reduced by 34 87 after 24 h incubation with four different types of as fig 1 ndma fps of tma and mncl were reduced by 92 98 and 77 97 respectively while ndma fp of smtr decreased to a lesser extent i e 29 46 depending on the types of as these overall reductions were achieved via both biotic i e biodegradation and abiotic i e biosorption volatilization processes tma is known to be readily biodegradable with 71 removals previously reported during biological treatment mitch and sedlak 2004 wang et al 2014 mncl contains hydroxyl functional groups attached to ring structures which can enhance its biodegradability okey and stensel 1996 unlike tma or mncl rntd contains a nitryl no2 functional group and smtr contains a sulfonamide nh so2 functional group both of which may impede biodegradation okey and stensel 1996 in addition to the structures of ndma precursors the sources of as biomass also affected the overall removal of ndma fps as 1 was collected from a rural municipal wwtp with an extended aeration process i e 22 24 h hrt and a high level of nitrification i e undetectable ammonia in the secondary effluent with this source of as there was an 87 decrease in ndma fp of rntd after 24 h incubation as 2 was collected from an urban municipal wwtp with biological nutrient removal process 14 h hrt this source of as reduced the ndma fp of rntd by 59 further lower reduction in ndma fp of rntd was found after 24 h incubation with the textile i e 41 and lab grown as i e 34 both as 1 and as 2 exhibited relatively high reductions in ndma fps of the three amine based pharmaceuticals i e rntd mncl and smtr while the lab grown as i e as 4 showed the lowest reduction previous studies have shown that municipal as has diverse microbial communities due to the complexity of organic contaminants including ppcps present in municipal wastewater influents while as fed with simple nutrients such as as 4 fed with a synthetic wastewater and as 3 fed with textile wastewater likely has less diverse microbial communities zhao et al 2006 the diversity and richness of microbial species likely favors removal of xenobiotic compounds kraigher et al 2008 chonova et al 2016 kim et al 2017 among the four types of as tested as 3 collected from a textile wwtp exhibited the largest seasonal variations in the reduction of some ndma precursors e g rntd and smtr table s6 the decreases in ndma fps of rntd and smtr varied by 36 and 23 respectively after 24 h incubation with as 3 collected in three different seasons while reductions in ndma fps of tma and mncl varied by 9 12 in contrast 10 variations in ndma fp reduction were observed after 24 h incubation with municipal wwtp as i e as 1 or as 2 collected during three seasons in the textile wwtp seasonal changes in the manufacturing processes may result in fluctuations in the wastewater influent components and thus the as 3 properties i e color mlss settleability however the operating conditions for the two municipal wwtps i e wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 were consistent during our sampling campaigns occasionally wwtp 1 was influenced from rain events producing increased influent flow rates during one such event air supply to the aeration tank was shut off and the mlss in as 1 dropped to 1000 mg l as 1 collected during such rain events 1000 mg l mlss showed 12 34 lower levels of decreases in ndma fps for all tested model precursor compounds compared to those measured under routine operating conditions with 3000 mg l mlss fig s2 the effects of selected operational parameters i e hrt and srt on deactivations of model precursor compounds were also examined when the duration of the batch tests i e simulating hrt was increased from 6 to 24 h the reduction in ndma fp of rntd increased from 81 to 88 for as 1 from 34 to 54 for as 2 or from 32 to 62 for as 3 fig 2 these observations are consistent with previous studies showing a significant p 0 05 positive correlation between removal of rntd and the hrts of the as process at different wwtps fig s3 in contrast an increase in hrt did not affect the extent of ndma fp reduction for tma mncl or smtr the reduction in ndma fps for tma and mncl were nearly 100 after 6 h of incubation and further incubation thus has no impact increasing hrt did not impact the extent of ndma fp reduction for smtr which is relatively bio refractory on the other hand rntd is considered to be moderately biodegradable e g with average removal efficiencies between 40 and 70 after 24 h as treatment at wwtps gros et al 2010 consequently removal of its ndma fp was more affected by hrt the effect of srt was examined for rntd using lab grown as 4 for nominal srts of 4 8 and 12 d ndma fp reductions were 26 30 and 38 respectively increases in srt are expected to increase diversity in the as microbial community by retaining microorganisms with slower growth rates e g nitrifiers jelic et al 2011 this may enhance deactivation of compounds with a moderate level of biodegradability such as rntd jelic et al 2011 a longer srt may also favor biosorption of polar compounds onto as particles petrie et al 2014 such as rntd 3 2 biosorption of model ndma precursors the contribution of biodegradation to overall ndma fp reduction was defined as the difference between the overall reduction and the reduction via biosorption plus volatilization reductions due to biosorption based on inhibition of respiration with nan3 and volatilization in the absence of as were measured separately the reduction in ndma fp of rntd occurred mainly via biosorption while biodegradation contributed less than 25 to the overall reduction during 6 h as treatment fig 3 similarly biodegradation accounted for only 1 and 2 11 of ndma fp reduction for mncl and smtr respectively when treated with the three wwtp as i e as 1 as 2 and as 3 in contrast the ndma fp of tma was mainly decreased via biodegradation i e 74 98 during treatment with as 2 as 3 and as 4 although nearly 100 of its ndma fp decrease was observed via biosorption with as 1 the lower biosorption of tma as compared to the other model precursors is probably due to its relatively higher water solubility i e 410 g l compared to 0 025 52 g l of the other compounds for all tested precursor compounds volatilization during 6 h incubation in the absence of any as biomass had a negligible impact on ndma fps fig s4 these results indicate that biosorption was an important removal mechanism for the tested ndma precursors especially for the high molecular weight compounds while the effect of volatilization was negligible reduction in ndma fp via biosorption also depended on the sources of as as 1 exhibited higher uptakes for rntd and tma while as 4 exhibited the lowest level of biosorption of tma mncl and smtr the physiochemical properties of as such as its settleability e g sludge volume index the amounts and composition of extracellular polymeric substances eps and the presence of floc forming microbes may affect the surface charges of as sponza 2002 wilen et al 2003 2008 and thus the adsorption of polar compounds onto as particles steiner et al 1976 in this study the inconsistent biosorption efficiencies among the four as were likely because of their distinct properties or characteristics the influent compositions and operating conditions at wwtps or lab scale sbr for as 4 can both impact as properties sponza 2002 ahn et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 the solid water distribution coefficients kd of precursor compounds biosorbed onto different as samples were calculated based on ndma fps measured in both aqueous and solid phases table s7 the log kd values of the tested model precursors biosorbed onto different sources of as were at least twofold higher than log kow this may suggest that adsorption of precursor compounds onto as particles was governed by factors other than hydrophobic interactions such as electrostatic interactions golet et al 2003 under the near neutral ph condition of the biosorption experiments ph 7 4 0 2 dma functional groups i e n ch3 2 of precursor compounds are positively charged and tend to bind to negatively charged carboxyl and or hydroxyl groups on as surfaces steiner et al 1976 shen and andrews 2013b biosorption of xenobiotic compounds is typically considered to be a rapid process e g completed within hours or even minutes savci 2013 vasiliadou et al 2013 martinez hernandez et al 2016 to examine the biosorption kinetics ndma fps of model precursor compounds were monitored up to 10 h during the biosorption tests with nan3 deactivated as liquor 3000 mg l mlss the two municipal as as 1 and as 2 and a new sample of as 3 designated as 3 in fig 4 were employed for biosorption kinetics tests as 3 was collected from the textile wwtp after a new manufacturing process was launched which resulted in substantially altered as properties e g lighter color increased mlss and enhanced settleability as 3 exhibited 2 56 more reduction of ndma fp via biosorption than as 3 after 6 h incubation fig s5 in general increasing the contact time from 2 to 10 h during the biosorption tests had small impacts on the ndma fp removals i e 18 differences for rntd mncl and smtr despite the different types of as i e as 1 as 2 and as 3 the only exception was tma for which ndma fp reductions were 33 41 higher after 6 or 10 h incubation compared to 2 h incubation with as 2 and as 3 the increased reduction of ndma fp may have been due to a recovery in biodegradation activity rather than biosorption as the incubation duration increased from 2 to 10 h the oxygen uptake rates by nan3 deactivated as slightly increased fig s1 suggesting the gradually recovering microbial activities during the biosorption tests overall these results indicate that reductions in ndma fp for the model precursors via biosorption were completed in less time i e 2 h than the lower end of hrts at most wwtps gray 2004 3 3 biodegradation of model ndma precursors decreases in ndma fp via biodegradation were investigated for rntd 100 nm and smtr 200 nm using as 1 collected during the spring and summer and as 4 at 8 and 24 d srts with a mlss concentration of 150 200 mg l after 10 d of incubation the decrease in ndma fp for rntd was highest for as 1 collected in summer followed by as 1 collected in spring as 4 at an 8 d srt and as 4 at a 24 d srt fig 5 these results suggest that ndma fp reduction for rntd via biodegradation depended on seasonal variations in as and srt as 1 had higher removals of organic carbon and ammonia in summer than in spring table s8 on the other hand the mlss in as 4 with a shorter srt may have had more active biomass than that with a longer srt and thus exhibited a better reduction in ndma fp for rntd via biodegradation as srt decreases as biomass may contain more abundant eps which has been shown to favor the initial uptake and subsequent biodegradation of compounds al halbouni et al 2008 xu et al 2013 extending the incubation time of the assay to 10 d enhanced ndma fp reduction for rntd to 52 71 and 34 44 with as 1 and as 4 respectively while only to 7 29 for smtr the decrease in ndma fp of rntd via biodegradation followed pseudo first order kinetics r2 0 86 fig s6 during the 10 d incubation with as 4 8 and 24 d srt and as 1 collected in spring with the ratios of mlss to rntd concentration i e mlss rntd increasing from 0 5 to 1 5 3 0 and 6 0 mg µg the pseudo first order biodegradation rate constants increased from 0 067 to 0 146 0 301 and 0 398 d 1 respectively during incubation with as 4 at an 8 d srt for as 4 at a 24 d srt the rate constants increased from 0 043 to 0 059 0 230 and 0 355 d 1 respectively fig s6 the slower biodegradation rate for a lower mlss rntd was likely because of the toxicity of rntd to microorganisms in as a high concentration of rntd e g 2 5 mg l has been found to inhibit microbial activities of as and thus reduce its biodegradation rates carucci et al 2006 3 4 deactivation of ndma precursors from sewage components among the tested sewage components urine blackwaters exhibited the highest ndma fp i e 11338 1958 ng l in urine prior to ingestion of rntd u 7077 1414 ng l in urine following ingestion of rntd ur this result occurred despite a 250 fold dilution of the urine in dechlorinated tap water to mimic toilet flushing and maintain the ndma fp in a proper range i e not exceeding tens of thousands ng l for gc ms ms analysis table s2 kitchen greywater containing food ingredients kf also exhibited relatively high ndma fp i e 11001 3696 ng l despite a 100 fold dilution in dechlorinated tap water ndma fp in other sewage components were generally less than 3000 ng l although rntd is considered to be a high yielding ndma precursor ndma fps in urine or feces after ingestion of rntd were comparable or even lower than those in pre rntd urine or feces this suggests that rntd and its metabolites may not be significant sources of ndma precursors from human urine or feces the main contributors to ndma fp from urine are still unknown ndma fps of known precursors that are found in urine such as dma tma trimethylamine n oxide are relatively low mitch and sedlak 2004 ndma fp in laundry greywater containing detergent only ld 470 97 ng l ndma fp was similar to that containing both detergent and fabric softener lf 501 96

than that not containing any personal care products s 378 8 ng l ndma fp or that with the use of body wash only sb 353 5 ng l ndma fp while shampoo might be a source of ndma precursors e g surfactant ingredients zeng and mitch 2015 the majority of ndma precursors present in shower greywaters may originate from sources other than personal care products such as trimethylamine n oxide choline and betaine excreted in human sweat ayesh et al 1993 craig et al 2010 subramaniam and fletcher 2018 which have been shown to yield ndma fp mitch and sedlak 2004 kemper et al 2010 the doc normalized ndma

and kitchen greywaters 168 487 ng mg while the doc normalized ndma fps in the other sewage components were 35 ng mg this suggests that ndma precursors from the collected biological samples i e human

to enhance inactivation of precursors targeted addition of mlss with microbes that biodegrade ndma precursors is one such approach urine blackwater among the tested blackwaters and greywaters was the most important contributor to ndma precursors in domestic sewage and as treated secondary effluents separating human urine from domestic sewage may thus significantly reduce ndma precursors present in

17526,reservoirs are an important source of atmospheric methane ch4 a potent greenhouse gas the mekong one of the largest asian rivers has been heavily dammed and can be a potential hotspot for ch4 emissions while low diffusive ch4 flux was previously reported from cascading reservoirs in the upper mekong the contribution of ebullition bubbling remained unexplored to better constrain the magnitude and drivers of ebullition from these reservoirs automated bubble traps were deployed in four reservoirs allowing for continuous measurement of the ebullitive flux with high temporal resolution for a period of six months to characterize the spatial variability of ch4 fluxes mediated by ebullition and diffusion whole reservoir surveys were conducted using a scientific echo sounder for bubble observations together with a gas equilibrator for mapping dissolved ch4 concentration in surface water from which diffusive fluxes were estimated potential production and anaerobic oxidation rates of ch4 were estimated in laboratory incubations of sediment cores collected near the bubble trap deployment sites the ch4 production potential in sediments increased strongly along the reservoir cascade with mostly minor reduction by anaerobic oxidation surface ch4 fluxes in contrast showed high spatial variability in both ebullitive and diffusive pathways ranging 0 05 44 and 1 8 6 4 mg m 2 d 1 respectively among all reservoirs ebullitive fluxes were about one order of magnitude higher than diffusive fluxes and remained significant at sites as deep as 30 45 m the repeated spatial pattern of ebullition higher fluxes at the dam area than in upstream sections suggests the possible control of emission rates by sediment transport and deposition graphical abstract image

amounts of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 to the atmosphere cole et al 2007 bastviken et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 emissions of ch4 are of particular importance due to its 28 34 times higher global warming potential in comparison to co2 stocker et al 2013 although ch4 is an important greenhouse gas responsible for 20 of the global warming since pre industrial times the distribution and dynamics of its sources and sinks are still poorly understood kirschke et al 2013 the poorly constrained emissions rates from inland waters are a major source of uncertainty in the global methane budget saunois et al 2016 inland waters are globally affected by eutrophication and river damming syvitski et al 2005 vörösmarty et al 2010 zarfl et al 2015 reservoir surfaces have been observed to be among the hotspots of ch4 emission from inland waters at regional as well as at global scales barros et al 2011 fearnside and pueyo 2012 deemer et al 2016 the continuous supply and trapping of fresh sediments has been identified as a major cause of ch4 emissions from runoff reservoirs delsontro et al 2010 maeck et al 2013 maeck et al 2013 for example observed an 80 fold increase of ch4 emissions in impoundments compared with free flowing sections of a temperate river age and geographic location of the reservoirs were initially suggested to be a strong predictor for ch4 emissions from reservoirs with highest emissions from young reservoirs in the tropical zone barros et al 2011 more recent reviews deemer et al 2016 delsontro et al 2018 however suggested that trophic state is a more important driver of ch4 emissions from reservoirs nevertheless a large geographical gap remains in these previous studies barros et al 2011 deemer et al 2016 this is particularly true for southwest china which is among the hot spots of ongoing and planned hydropower development zarfl et al 2015 mekong one of the largest rivers in asia has been heavily modified by hydropower dams and many more are under construction or planned fan et al 2015 wang et al 2017 forming one of the largest cascading reservoir systems in the world high sediment trapping efficiencies in cascading reservoirs of the upper mekong river also known as lancang river in china fu and he 2007 suggest that these impoundments can be a potential hotspot for ch4 emissions shi et al 2017 räsänen et al 2018 lin et al 2019 while a relatively low diffusive methane flux was reported from these reservoirs shi et al 2017 the contribution of ebullition bubbling has not been assessed to better constrain the magnitude and drivers as well as the spatial and temporal variability of ch4 fluxes from these cascading reservoirs we conducted intensive measurements in four hydropower reservoirs at the mekong river we mapped the spatial distribution of dissolved ch4 concentrations from which diffusive fluxes were calculated and ebullitive fluxes during a spatial survey obtained time series of ebullition rates from moored bubble traps and measured the net ch4 production potential as well as anaerobic ch4 oxidation of sediment samples via laboratory incubations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sampling overview the mekong river originates from the tibetan plateau and flows through six countries before discharging into the south sea in vietnam the river discharge is subject to a tropical monsoon climate with a wet season may to october and a dry season november to april as part of an international research initiative three universities from germany and china respectively we studied four reservoirs located at the upstream end of cascading hydropower stations until 2018 fig 1 these hydropower reservoirs span 440 km in length n 24 01 48 n 26 32 34 which is 10 of the total length of the mekong river the main characteristics of the four reservoirs are summarized in table 1 two sampling campaigns were conducted at miaowei miw gongguoqiao ggq manwan maw and dachaoshan dcs reservoir respectively fig 1 during the first sampling campaign in march 2018 i e dry season we installed four automated bubble traps one at each reservoir water temperature and water level loggers dissolved ch4 concentrations in the water column and ch4 content in rising gas bubbles were sampled at selected sites within each reservoir sediment cores were collected near the bubble traps and incubated in the laboratory for measuring net potential ch4 production and anaerobic ch4 oxidation during the second campaign in september 2018 i e wet season we performed high resolution mapping of dissolved ch4 concentration at the surface water and of rising gas bubbles in the water column using boat based in situ sampling techniques we measured vertical profiles of physico chemical properties of the water column just upstream of the dam during both campaigns wet and dry season and additionally in mid and end of the year 2 2 sediment potential ch4 production oxidation rates sediment cores one core per reservoir 6 cm diameter 22 70 cm length were collected in the vicinity of the four bubble traps using a gravity corer in march 2018 the cores were sliced in the field into 2 8 cm thick layers and homogenized sediment samples were stored in gastight vials for later analysis the sediment samples were incubated at 20 c under anoxic conditions for determining net ch4 production rates at university of koblenz landau germany see s1 for method details corrections for in situ temperature were performed based on the well established correlation between ch4 production rate and sediment temperature in freshwater system duc et al 2010 yvon durocher et al 2014 a temperature coefficient of 1 12 was used aben et al 2017 an equivalent ch4 flux was estimated for the depth integrated net production rate of a 1 m thick sediment column by multiplying area weighed depth average production rates mpave m p i h i h i mpave is area weighed depth average production rate mpi is ch4 production rate at each depth layer of thickness hi and i is the sub sediment layer number that increases over depth by sediment depth after correcting for in situ temperature organic matter content in each sediment sub sample was estimated as loss on ignition at 550 c anaerobic ch4 oxidation rates in sediment samples at 20 c from 1 3 5 and 7 cm sediment depth were measured with a radiotracer 14ch4 technique iversen and jorgensen 1985 at the university of basel switzerland see s1 for method details gross ch4 production was calculated by adding anaerobic ch4 oxidation rates to net ch4 production rates 2 3 bubble observations using echo sounder and automated bubble traps a split beam scientific echo sounder simrad ey60 norway 120 khz transducer beam angle 7 7 was used to observe the number and size of rising gas bubbles in the water column during the cruising surveys in september 2018 except for dcs where the instrument failed the measurements were performed by mounting the transducer to a boat downward looking and driving at a constant speed of 5 km h 1 along zigzag trajectories the pulse width was set to 0 256 ms with a sampling rate of 10 pings s 1 5 pings s 1 where water depth 60 m the narrow beam angle of the transducer 7 resulted in beam footprint diameters of 2 7 8 2 m area 5 7 53 2 m2 corresponding to 22 67 m average water depth in the three surveyed reservoirs table 1 the total length of the echo sounding trajectories were 18 3 24 8 and 46 1 km for miw ggq and maw respectively which corresponds to a total coverage of 17 6 103 67 2 103 and 87 3 103 m2 a lower coverage at miw was due to limited access to the reservoir the surveyed distance to dam was 1 1 11 9 1 15 5 and 0 5 26 5 km with a maximal coverage of water depth of 95 39 and 46 m in each of the three reservoirs respectively the analysis of acoustic data followed the procedures described in ostrovsky et al 2008 and delsontro et al 2015 in short gas bubbles were identified as individual acoustic targets with target strengths between 65 and 40 db which were observed in at least 5 pings bubbles were separated from non bubble targets e g fish based on rise velocity lower threshold 25 cm s 1 the acoustic data were processed with sonar5 pro lindem data acquisition oslo norway and was restricted to a maximum 10 m thick layer of near bottom water where the quality of the echograms was highest bubble volume was estimated from acoustic target strength using the empirical relationship provided in ostrovsky et al 2008 and by correcting bubble volume for in situ hydrostatic pressure finally the near bottom bubble flux was quantified as the product of volumetric bubble density and bubble rise velocity each transect was divided into segments at 50 m distance interval and the final flux was reported as a segment average one automated bubble trap was deployed in each of the four reservoirs 2 5 km upstream of the dam subject to the difficulties in finding access to the reservoirs and large water level fluctuations bubble trap deployments were limited to nearshore zones at water depths of 12 28 40 and 32 m for miw ggq maw and dcs respectively the traps consisted of inverted funnels 0 8 m diameter connected to an optical bubble size sensor with data logger delwiche and hemond 2017 the traps were deployed from floating buoys 1 5 m below the water surface depending on battery life time and clogging of the sensors by sediment ebullition time series of 140 116 114 and 161 days in total were obtained for reservoir miw ggq maw and dcs respectively although most data are available for march to june 2018 bubble gas was collected manually at 2 3 sites below the water surface by capturing gas bubbles with an inverted funnel 0 2 m opening diameter that was mounted to a 20 ml water filled glass vial this was done by disturbing sediment with an anchor weight to trigger the release of bubbles and which were captured right below the water surface gas samples were measured for ch4 content in gas bubbles using an ultraportable greenhouse gas analyzer ugga los gatos research usa with the closed loop method wilkinson et al 2018 2019b all ebullitive ch4 fluxes are reported as surface flux at atmospheric pressure and in situ temperature for data obtained from bubble traps the ch4 flux was calculated by correcting the volumetric flux with the estimated ch4 bubble content based on manual bubble samples for near bottom bubble flux data collected using the echo sounder the surface ch4 flux was estimated by accounting for bubble dissolution in the water column during bubble rise mcginnis et al 2006 this was done by correcting for in situ hydrostatic pressure the average ch4 content in bubble gas and the depth profile of dissolved ch4 in the water column using the bubble dissolution software developed by greinert and mcginnis 2009 2 4 dissolved ch4 concentration measurements and diffusive flux calculation dissolved ch4 concentration in near surface water was mapped in situ using a fast response gas equilibrator xiao et al 2020 that was coupled with a portable gas analyzer gas scouter g4301 picarro usa the mapping was partly conducted in combination with echo sounder measurements and followed a zigzag course covering shallow near bank regions and tributary bays as well as the main river channel diffusive ch4 flux was calculated from dissolved ch4 concentration in surface water according to the thin boundary layer model liss 1974 the gas transfer coefficient was calculated using the equation proposed by liss and merlivat 1986 using a wind speed of 2 m s 1 which corresponds to the mean value of wind speeds reported by shi et al 2017 for the studied reservoirs 2 5 measurements of environmental data water level and temperature loggers hobo u20l 02 usa tdr rbr canada were deployed at miw ggq and maw next to the automated bubble traps 1 m above sediment water interface 10 min data logging time interval but logger and data loss resulted in time series of variable length depth profiles of water temperature dissolved oxygen concentration and chlorophyll a fluorescence were measured near the bubble trap deployment sites during all sampling campaigns march july september 2018 and january 2019 using a multi parameter probe exo2 ysi usa 2 6 statistical analyses linear regressions were performed to examine correlations between net sediment ch4 production rate and organic matter content as well as ebullitive ch4 flux vs hydrostatic pressure drops and ebullitive ch4 flux vs water depth the reported r 2 values are adjusted for the number of data points the significance of the regression slope was tested by analysis of variance anova at a significance level p of 0 05 3 results 3 1 potential sediment ch4 production and anaerobic oxidation the net potential ch4 production rates observed in sediment cores increased monotonically from upstream to downstream along the reservoir cascade table 2 mean volumetric production rates ranged from 1 4 1 3 mg l 1 d 1 mean standard deviation in the sediments of the uppermost reservoir miw to 9 5 4 6 mg l 1 d 1 in sediments from the most downstream reservoir dcs organic matter content was highest in dcs 7 3 0 8 and similar in the three upstream reservoirs mean 3 5 4 2 table 2 fig 2 c and was significantly positively p 0 001 related to net potential ch4 production rates fig s1 the production rates within individual cores showed no consistent vertical variations although thin layers 2 and 4 cm respectively of high production near the sediment surface were observed in maw and dcs fig 2b the potential anaerobic ch4 oxidation rates were in general low 0 001 0 062 mg l 1 d 1 compared to production rates fig 2a and b the fraction of ch4 lost due to anaerobic oxidation relative to gross production was found to play a minor role in the upper 8 cm sediment except at the most upstream reservoir miw 7 9 table 2 this fraction dropped sharply along the reservoir cascade to 1 8 at ggq and became negligible at maw and dcs 0 1 and 0 0 respectively 3 2 ebullitive ch4 fluxes 3 2 1 temporal dynamics of ebullition in all reservoirs except for dcs due to the near bank mooring location the continuous observations at the bubble trap deployment sites revealed high temporal variability of ebullitive fluxes at different time scales fig 3 a and b ebullitive ch4 flux varied from 0 to 1 5 33 103 mg m 2 d 1 at the minute time scale fig 3a while the temporal variability decreased by two orders of magnitude from 0 to 5 238 mg m 2 d 1 at the daily time scale fig 3b suggesting the necessity of continuous measurement of ebullition flux in such a dynamic system a selection of ebullition time series at the hourly time scale in ggq reservoir where most complete water level data was collected fig 3c suggests a strong influence of hydrostatic pressure change due to reservoir operation pronounced peaks of the ebullitive flux corresponded well to rapid water level reductions 0 2 1 3 m on a daily basis with water level rises as a counter factor that suppressed ebullition a significant positive nonlinear relationship p 0 002 was found between the magnitude of gas ebullition accumulated ebullitive ch4 flux over the time period of pressure drop by accounting for potential time lags between pressure drop and bubble release and water level reduction fig 3d 3 2 2 spatial variability of ebullition the ebullitive ch4 flux showed strong intra and inter reservoir spatial variability fig 4 the echo sounding surveys observed a consistent longitudinal increase in ebullitive flux in all the three surveyed reservoirs from upstream to the dam area fig 4a c the slightly higher flux in the dam area of miw and maw is in contrast to the hot spot dam area in ggq where ebullitive flux was more than three times higher than in the upstream section fig 4d bubbling was the least active in the most upstream located reservoir miw mean 2 1 mg m 2 d 1 increased sharply in ggq mean 82 mg m 2 d 1 and finally declined in the downstream reservoir maw to a mean value of 40 7 mg m 2 d 1 the ch4 content of bubbles collected near the water surface was similar in all reservoirs mean ch4 volume concentrations between 42 57 no consistent controls of ebullition rates by water depth could be observed in the three surveyed reservoirs fig 5 ebullitive ch4 fluxes decreased with water depth in both miw and maw while only the relationship in miw was significant p 0 01 fig 5a and c in contrast in ggq ebullition tended to be more active at greater water depth fig 5b 3 3 dissolved ch4 concentration and diffusive emissions the high resolution spatial mapping of dissolved ch4 concentration in the surface water revealed large spatial variations figs 6 and 7 a three spatial patterns were observed i high concentrations were observed at intermediate reservoir sections in miw and maw ii relatively low concentrations were measured at intermediate reservoir sections in dcs and iii upstream sections were hot spots for dissolved ch4 in ggq the mean concentrations and standard deviations ranged between 0 4 0 3 µm at dcs to 1 4 1 0 µm at maw maximal concentrations were up to 30 µm the resulting diffusive fluxes were smallest 1 8 mg ch4 m 2 d 1 at dcs and highest 6 4 mg ch4 m 2 d 1 averaged from two consecutive measurements at maw fig 7b table 2 the diffusive emissions from the four reservoirs did not show a clear longitudinal pattern fig 7b the upstream three reservoirs were not apparently different from each other except for ggq fig 7b in which a high variability in diffusive emissions was observed from 0 5 to 130 mg ch4 m 2 d 1 due to the extremely high dissolved ch4 concentrations at the upstream area 4 discussion 4 1 the contribution of ebullitive ch4 flux no consistent difference in ebullitive flux was observed between the data collected using the two different methods automated bubble traps and echo sounder table 2 in ggq echo sounder measured nearly four times higher ebullitive flux compared to bubble traps while the opposite was found in miw and maw where lower fluxes were observed with the echo sounder than the bubble traps the existence of bubble plumes as hotspots of ch4 emissions at ggq see fig s2 for an exemplary echogram of bubble plumes may explain the discrepancy between flux estimates from the automated bubble traps and spatial surveys at this reservoir table 2 localized bubble plume hotspots may contribute disproportionately to ebullitive flux yet given their small spatial footprint they are less likely to be intercepted by bubble traps the discrepancy between bubble trap and echo sounder based flux estimates was similarly seen in wilkinson et al 2019a which was also attributed to the presence of bubble plumes diffusive and ebullitive ch4 fluxes to the atmosphere did not follow the same increase along the reservoir cascade as the production rates in the sediment but showed strong spatial and temporal variability the estimated diffusive ch4 flux 1 8 1 5 6 4 4 2 mg m 2 d 1 is lower than the mean diffusive flux 10 2 33 4 mg m 2 d 1 for chinese reservoirs li et al 2018 our results are likely an underestimation with rather high uncertainties due to the lack of precise gas exchange coefficients or wind speed the sum of diffusive fluxes and ebullition rates varied between 6 8 85 9 mg m 2 d 1 which falls in the low to mid range of estimated global mean fluxes for hydroelectric reservoirs 32 149 mg m 2 d 1 see deemer et al 2016 while previous studies have suggested that younger reservoirs emit more ch4 barros et al 2011 this relationship is not found in the four cascading reservoirs studied here where the oldest reservoir maw 25 year old showed the second highest emission rates 47 1 mg m 2 d 1 sum of diffusive and ebullitive flux our measurements provided a first estimate on ebullitive ch4 flux from mekong reservoirs the consideration of bubble mediated transport is the main reason for the more than 10 fold higher fluxes observed in the present study compared to ch4 fluxes reported by shi et al 2017 for the same reservoirs where ebullition was not measured the lack of field ebullition data is also a major source of uncertainty and likely underestimation of emissions from chinese reservoirs li et al 2018 more studies are urgently needed to further constrain uncertainties of ch4 emissions in these systems an important limitation of the present study is that we only investigated four relatively shallow reservoirs and some large reservoirs were not included e g xiaowan and nuozhadu fig 1 that both have larger water depths maximal depth 200 m liang et al 2019 wang et al 2019 the contribution of ebullition to total ch4 emissions in these reservoirs might be smaller due to their large water depths in addition lower temperature at the reservoir bottom was observed due to the year round thermal stratification e g 14 c in hypoliminion of xiaowan see liang et al 2019 16 c in hypoliminion of nuozhadu see wang et al 2019 which can reduce ch4 production in the sediment in comparison to the investigated reservoirs furthermore aerobic ch4 oxidation at sediment water interface remains active because the hypolimnion is fully oxygenated in spite of the perennial thermal stratification guan et al 2020 they should be included in future research to have a more complete estimate for ch4 emissions from upper mekong reservoirs 4 2 spatio temporal variability of ebullitive flux and associated uncertainties our observations fig 4d are consistent with a previous study by maeck et al 2013 in which a repeated pattern for ch4 ebullition was observed along a smaller cascade of river impoundments at river saar germany in their study the authors demonstrated that the areas near dams were hot spots of ch4 ebullition with the fluxes being linked to sediment deposition rates this suggests a strong control of sediment deposition on ebullitive flux in the upper mekong reservoirs although relevant data about sedimentation rates are not available while the reservoirs share a common intra reservoir spatial pattern in terms of ebullition intensity there is a pronounced inter reservoir difference the uppermost reservoir miw showed the lowest bubbling activities among the three fig 4a and d and fig 5a which could be because of the large water depth maximal depth 108 m and average depth 67 m table 1 the higher ebullition flux in ggq may be due to 1 relatively shallower water depth maximal depth 76 m and average depth 43 m table 1 and 2 supply of organic rich sediment from tributaries a few kilometers before the dam where turbid water was observed entering the reservoir authors observation delsontro et al 2011 and beaulieu et al 2016 highlighted the disproportional contribution from riverine lacustrine transition and littoral zones where organic rich sediment can accumulate that fuels ch4 production in a large tropic reservoir kariba ebullitive ch4 flux was found to be at least one order of magnitude higher in river deltas than in non river bays delsontro et al 2011 a more spatially resolved study in a temperate reservoir by beaulieu et al 2016 suggested that although tributary associated areas occupy only 12 of the total reservoir surface they were the source of 41 of total ch4 emissions with a majority of contribution from ebullition 90 the uncertainty in temporal dynamics of ch4 fluxes observed by automated bubble traps was reduced by two orders of magnitude with the long period deployments the extremes changed from 1 5 33 103 mg m 2 d 1 at the minute time scale to 5 238 mg m 2 d 1 at daily time scales however these long term bubble trap measurements only provide a spatial snapshot similarly our one time echo sounding survey could only provide a temporal snapshot the fluxes reported here and in similar studies e g maeck et al 2013 and paranaíba et al 2018 are therefore associated with high levels of uncertainty both temporal and spatial variabilities are sources of uncertainties wik et al 2016 while in the present study larger standard deviations of bubble fluxes were observed in the acoustic measurements coefficient of variation standard deviation dived by mean value 109 1005 compared to bubble trap time series in two out of three reservoirs coefficient of variation 79 244 table 2 a solid conclusion about whether the spatial variability was a more important source of uncertainty could not be drawn this is because ebullition in nature occurs at hot spots and therefore acoustic surveys measure larger variations when observing bubbles nevertheless the spatial patterns of ebullition can be well characterized if adequate acoustic measurements were performed for a given water body greinert et al 2010 tuser et al 2017 therefore more spatial surveys with a sufficient degree of coverage are needed in the future to reduce uncertainties meanwhile a spatially balanced sampling approach beaulieu et al 2016 should be adopted when deploying multiple automated bubble traps within each individual reservoir i e the gradients in water depth and flow velocity should be better resolved further more complete coverage of the reservoir cascade by including the two large and deep reservoirs xiaowan and nuozhadu are also needed despite the challenge posed by their large geographical span 500 km when including nuozhadu regardless of these large uncertainties in quantifying ebullitive ch4 flux our first ebullition data at the mekong reservoirs highlighted the importance of this previously overlooked pathway our results also suggested a control of water level fluctuations on short term ebullition dynamics in these cascading reservoirs e g at ggq reservoir fig 3c and d which has been observed in many different systems chanton et al 1989 varadharajan and hemond 2012 maeck et al 2014 more investigations into the mechanisms of sediment bubble formation storage and release liu et al 2016 liu et al 2018 in combination with potential sediment ch4 production and sediment deposition patterns hilgert et al 2019 liu et al 2020 could improve predictions of ebullitive ch4 flux and thus help reduce measurement associated uncertainties while subjected to frequent water level fluctuations e g diurnal variations exceeding 1 m at ggq fig 3c and hot moments of ebullition can be triggered by water level reductions fig 3d harrison et al 2017 the overall long term ch4 flux might be reduced compared to the flux observed at a constant water level this is because during the period of high water level ebullition could be suppressed beaulieu et al 2018 and aerobic ch4 oxidation in the fully oxygenated hypolimnion guan et al 2020 potentially reduces diffusive sediment mediated ch4 flux water level management strategies can potentially be used to mitigate ch4 emissions from these hydropower reservoirs 4 3 factors affecting ch4 production and fluxes from upper mekong reservoirs we found a consistent increase of net ch4 production potential in reservoir sediments from upstream to downstream along cascading reservoirs in the upper mekong fig 2a the reasons for this flow wise increase of net ch4 production potential are multi fold first the higher sediment ch4 production potential at dcs compared to the upper three reservoirs miw ggq and maw corresponded well to the increase in sediment organic matter content fig 2b fig s1 and table 2 it has been shown that the enrichment of organic matter both terrestrial and phytoplankton derived can fuel ch4 ebullition in a reservoir grinham et al 2018 sediment organic matter quality i e source in addition to quantity regulates sediment ch4 production berberich et al 2019 and the organic matter in our system is primarily catchment derived the mean chlorophyll a concentrations in the studies reservoirs were 2 μg l 1 table 2 second decreasing sediment grain size along the upper mekong reservoirs guo et al 2020 could be a potential driver in small streams sediment ch4 production and oxidation potential was found to have a positive relationship with the fraction of fine grained sediment particles bodmer et al 2020 last temperature plays a significant role in controlling sediment ch4 production potential table 2 and fig s3 in september when the echo sounding survey was performed reservoir bottom water temperature showed a longitudinal increase from 17 5 and 17 6 c in the upper two reservoirs miw and ggq respectively to 21 2 and 21 8 c at maw and dcs fig s3 this increase in water temperature suggests an important influence by the large deep reservoir xiaowan located in between the upper two and the lower two reservoirs the four studied reservoirs were all well mixed over the full water depth over the year except the apparent thermal stratification was observed below 54 m at miw during early summer fig s4 in contrast strong stratification in xiaowan during throughout the year particularly in summer results in a warmer upper mixed layer liang et al 2019 from which the water was discharged to downstream reservoirs causing a strong increase in water temperature 3 6 c in the two downstream reservoirs maw and dcs as sediment ch4 production rate is highly temperature dependent around 21 and 20 reductions in net ch4 production potential 2222 1762 2316 1851 mg m 2 d 1 were expected due to colder bottom water temperature at the upper two reservoirs miw and ggq compared to the rates at 20 c laboratory incubation temperature in contrast 11 and 18 increase 3127 3479 8766 10391 mg m 2 d 1 was observed at maw and dcs respectively due to the warmer temperature the measured sediment ch4 production rates are comparable in magnitude to production rates measured in impoundments of the rhine river and its tributaries in germany wilkinson et al 2015 wilkinson et al 2019a previous studies maeck et al 2013 isidorova et al 2019 wilkinson et al 2019a have suggested that sediment ch4 production is positively correlated with sediment deposition with higher production rates in shallower newer sediments however the lack of consistent vertical gradients of potential ch4 production in the sediment fig 2a suggest a rather dynamic sedimentation and sediment transport regime in these reservoirs this makes extrapolation of the measured rates to deposition depth exceeding the length of the sampled cores and estimation of total i e depth integrated production rates rather difficult hence the numbers reported here are most likely an underestimate by only considering the surface 1 m sediment depth furthermore while shi et al 2017 suggested that sediment organic matter content is negatively correlated with reservoir age and ch4 emissions from the mekong were likely to reduce in the future the mekong reservoirs studied here showed no correlation between reservoir age and ch4 production therefore the future projection of reduced ch4 emissions from upper mekong reservoirs shi et al 2017 might be questionable because of the continuous and highly dynamic deposition of fresh sediment instead sediment management practices for example dredging and soil conservation in the mekong watershed might help mitigating ch4 emissions the emission rates were at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the estimated fluxes resulting from temperature corrected net sediment ch4 production table 2 indicating that only a small fraction of the produced ch4 reaches the atmosphere the majority of ch4 produced in sediment is most likely converted to co2 by aerobic ch4 oxidation since the water column is fully oxygenated most time of the year fig s5 future studies should take aerobic ch4 oxidation into account and focus on the environmental factors controlling the fraction of oxidized ch4 depending on the hydrologic regime sawakuchi et al 2016 estimated that ch4 oxidation reduced the diffusive flux from amazonian rivers by 28 96 in cascading reservoirs the hydrological regime is controlled by dam operation providing a potential opportunity for the reduction of reservoir ch4 emissions by reservoir management 5 conclusions this study provides a first estimate of potential ch4 production and ebullitive flux along cascading reservoirs at the upper mekong river consideration of the bubble mediated emission pathway resulted in more than 10 fold higher ch4 emission rates than previously reported repeating spatial distribution patterns of the ebullitive flux can be identified in the upper three studied reservoirs where higher ebullitive ch4 flux was observed in the area near the dam compared to upstream sections in addition both sediment ch4 production and emission were found to be unrelated to reservoir age our findings suggest that sediment organic matter content sediment transport and reservoir hydrodynamics are the major drivers of ch4 net production in the sediments of cascading reservoirs the poor predictability of net sediment ch4 production rates in explaining ch4 surface emissions from these reservoirs indicates aerobic oxidation as an important control on the emission of ch4 produced in the sediment author contributions l

17526,reservoirs are an important source of atmospheric methane ch4 a potent greenhouse gas the mekong one of the largest asian rivers has been heavily dammed and can be a potential hotspot for ch4 emissions while low diffusive ch4 flux was previously reported from cascading reservoirs in the upper mekong the contribution of ebullition bubbling remained unexplored to better constrain the magnitude and drivers of ebullition from these reservoirs automated bubble traps were deployed in four reservoirs allowing for continuous measurement of the ebullitive flux with high temporal resolution for a period of six months to characterize the spatial variability of ch4 fluxes mediated by ebullition and diffusion whole reservoir surveys were conducted using a scientific echo sounder for bubble observations together with a gas equilibrator for mapping dissolved ch4 concentration in surface water from which diffusive fluxes were estimated potential production and anaerobic oxidation rates of ch4 were estimated in laboratory incubations of sediment cores collected near the bubble trap deployment sites the ch4 production potential in sediments increased strongly along the reservoir cascade with mostly minor reduction by anaerobic oxidation surface ch4 fluxes in contrast showed high spatial variability in both ebullitive and diffusive pathways ranging 0 05 44 and 1 8 6 4 mg m 2 d 1 respectively among all reservoirs ebullitive fluxes were about one order of magnitude higher than diffusive fluxes and remained significant at sites as deep as 30 45 m the repeated spatial pattern of ebullition higher fluxes at the dam area than in upstream sections suggests the possible control of emission rates by sediment transport and deposition graphical abstract image

amounts of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 to the atmosphere cole et al 2007 bastviken et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 emissions of ch4 are of particular importance due to its 28 34 times higher global warming potential in comparison to co2 stocker et al 2013 although ch4 is an important greenhouse gas responsible for 20 of the global warming since pre industrial times the distribution and dynamics of its sources and sinks are still poorly understood kirschke et al 2013 the poorly constrained emissions rates from inland waters are a major source of uncertainty in the global methane budget saunois et al 2016 inland waters are globally affected by eutrophication and river damming syvitski et al 2005 vörösmarty et al 2010 zarfl et al 2015 reservoir surfaces have been observed to be among the hotspots of ch4 emission from inland waters at regional as well as at global scales barros et al 2011 fearnside and pueyo 2012 deemer et al 2016 the continuous supply and trapping of fresh sediments has been identified as a major cause of ch4 emissions from runoff reservoirs delsontro et al 2010 maeck et al 2013 maeck et al 2013 for example observed an 80 fold increase of ch4 emissions in impoundments compared with free flowing sections of a temperate river age and geographic location of the reservoirs were initially suggested to be a strong predictor for ch4 emissions from reservoirs with highest emissions from young reservoirs in the tropical zone barros et al 2011 more recent reviews deemer et al 2016 delsontro et al 2018 however suggested that trophic state is a more important driver of ch4 emissions from reservoirs nevertheless a large geographical gap remains in these previous studies barros et al 2011 deemer et al 2016 this is particularly true for southwest china which is among the hot spots of ongoing and planned hydropower development zarfl et al 2015 mekong one of the largest rivers in asia has been heavily modified by hydropower dams and many more are under construction or planned fan et al 2015 wang et al 2017 forming one of the largest cascading reservoir systems in the world high sediment trapping efficiencies in cascading reservoirs of the upper mekong river also known as lancang river in china fu and he 2007 suggest that these impoundments can be a potential hotspot for ch4 emissions shi et al 2017 räsänen et al 2018 lin et al 2019 while a relatively low diffusive methane flux was reported from these reservoirs shi et al 2017 the contribution of ebullition bubbling has not been assessed to better constrain the magnitude and drivers as well as the spatial and temporal variability of ch4 fluxes from these cascading reservoirs we conducted intensive measurements in four hydropower reservoirs at the mekong river we mapped the spatial distribution of dissolved ch4 concentrations from which diffusive fluxes were calculated and ebullitive fluxes during a spatial survey obtained time series of ebullition rates from moored bubble traps and measured the net ch4 production potential as well as anaerobic ch4 oxidation of sediment samples via laboratory incubations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sampling overview the mekong river originates from the tibetan plateau and flows through six countries before discharging into the south sea in vietnam the river discharge is subject to a tropical monsoon climate with a wet season may to october and a dry season november to april as part of an international research initiative three universities from germany and china respectively we studied four reservoirs located at the upstream end of cascading hydropower stations until 2018 fig 1 these hydropower reservoirs span 440 km in length n 24 01 48 n 26 32 34 which is 10 of the total length of the mekong river the main characteristics of the four reservoirs are summarized in table 1 two sampling campaigns were conducted at miaowei miw gongguoqiao ggq manwan maw and dachaoshan dcs reservoir respectively fig 1 during the first sampling campaign in march 2018 i e dry season we installed four automated bubble traps one at each reservoir water temperature and water level loggers dissolved ch4 concentrations in the water column and ch4 content in rising gas bubbles were sampled at selected sites within each reservoir sediment cores were collected near the bubble traps and incubated in the laboratory for measuring net potential ch4 production and anaerobic ch4 oxidation during the second campaign in september 2018 i e wet season we performed high resolution mapping of dissolved ch4 concentration at the surface water and of rising gas bubbles in the water column using boat based in situ sampling techniques we measured vertical profiles of physico chemical properties of the water column just upstream of the dam during both campaigns wet and dry season and additionally in mid and end of the year 2 2 sediment potential ch4 production oxidation rates sediment cores one core per reservoir 6 cm diameter 22 70 cm length were collected in the vicinity of the four bubble traps using a gravity corer in march 2018 the cores were sliced in the field into 2 8 cm thick layers and homogenized sediment samples were stored in gastight vials for later analysis the sediment samples were incubated at 20 c under anoxic conditions for determining net ch4 production rates at university of koblenz landau germany see s1 for method details corrections for in situ temperature were performed based on the well established correlation between ch4 production rate and sediment temperature in freshwater system duc et al 2010 yvon durocher et al 2014 a temperature coefficient of 1 12 was used aben et al 2017 an equivalent ch4 flux was estimated for the depth integrated net production rate of a 1 m thick sediment column by multiplying area weighed depth average production rates mpave m p i h i h i mpave is area weighed depth average production rate mpi is ch4 production rate at each depth layer of thickness hi and i is the sub sediment layer number that increases over depth by sediment depth after correcting for in situ temperature organic matter content in each sediment sub sample was estimated as loss on ignition at 550 c anaerobic ch4 oxidation rates in sediment samples at 20 c from 1 3 5 and 7 cm sediment depth were measured with a radiotracer 14ch4 technique iversen and jorgensen 1985 at the university of basel switzerland see s1 for method details gross ch4 production was calculated by adding anaerobic ch4 oxidation rates to net ch4 production rates 2 3 bubble observations using echo sounder and automated bubble traps a split beam scientific echo sounder simrad ey60 norway 120 khz transducer beam angle 7 7 was used to observe the number and size of rising gas bubbles in the water column during the cruising surveys in september 2018 except for dcs where the instrument failed the measurements were performed by mounting the transducer to a boat downward looking and driving at a constant speed of 5 km h 1 along zigzag trajectories the pulse width was set to 0 256 ms with a sampling rate of 10 pings s 1 5 pings s 1 where water depth 60 m the narrow beam angle of the transducer 7 resulted in beam footprint diameters of 2 7 8 2 m area 5 7 53 2 m2 corresponding to 22 67 m average water depth in the three surveyed reservoirs table 1 the total length of the echo sounding trajectories were 18 3 24 8 and 46 1 km for miw ggq and maw respectively which corresponds to a total coverage of 17 6 103 67 2 103 and 87 3 103 m2 a lower coverage at miw was due to limited access to the reservoir the surveyed distance to dam was 1 1 11 9 1 15 5 and 0 5 26 5 km with a maximal coverage of water depth of 95 39 and 46 m in each of the three reservoirs respectively the analysis of acoustic data followed the procedures described in ostrovsky et al 2008 and delsontro et al 2015 in short gas bubbles were identified as individual acoustic targets with target strengths between 65 and 40 db which were observed in at least 5 pings bubbles were separated from non bubble targets e g fish based on rise velocity lower threshold 25 cm s 1 the acoustic data were processed with sonar5 pro lindem data acquisition oslo norway and was restricted to a maximum 10 m thick layer of near bottom water where the quality of the echograms was highest bubble volume was estimated from acoustic target strength using the empirical relationship provided in ostrovsky et al 2008 and by correcting bubble volume for in situ hydrostatic pressure finally the near bottom bubble flux was quantified as the product of volumetric bubble density and bubble rise velocity each transect was divided into segments at 50 m distance interval and the final flux was reported as a segment average one automated bubble trap was deployed in each of the four reservoirs 2 5 km upstream of the dam subject to the difficulties in finding access to the reservoirs and large water level fluctuations bubble trap deployments were limited to nearshore zones at water depths of 12 28 40 and 32 m for miw ggq maw and dcs respectively the traps consisted of inverted funnels 0 8 m diameter connected to an optical bubble size sensor with data logger delwiche and hemond 2017 the traps were deployed from floating buoys 1 5 m below the water surface depending on battery life time and clogging of the sensors by sediment ebullition time series of 140 116 114 and 161 days in total were obtained for reservoir miw ggq maw and dcs respectively although most data are available for march to june 2018 bubble gas was collected manually at 2 3 sites below the water surface by capturing gas bubbles with an inverted funnel 0 2 m opening diameter that was mounted to a 20 ml water filled glass vial this was done by disturbing sediment with an anchor weight to trigger the release of bubbles and which were captured right below the water surface gas samples were measured for ch4 content in gas bubbles using an ultraportable greenhouse gas analyzer ugga los gatos research usa with the closed loop method wilkinson et al 2018 2019b all ebullitive ch4 fluxes are reported as surface flux at atmospheric pressure and in situ temperature for data obtained from bubble traps the ch4 flux was calculated by correcting the volumetric flux with the estimated ch4 bubble content based on manual bubble samples for near bottom bubble flux data collected using the echo sounder the surface ch4 flux was estimated by accounting for bubble dissolution in the water column during bubble rise mcginnis et al 2006 this was done by correcting for in situ hydrostatic pressure the average ch4 content in bubble gas and the depth profile of dissolved ch4 in the water column using the bubble dissolution software developed by greinert and mcginnis 2009 2 4 dissolved ch4 concentration measurements and diffusive flux calculation dissolved ch4 concentration in near surface water was mapped in situ using a fast response gas equilibrator xiao et al 2020 that was coupled with a portable gas analyzer gas scouter g4301 picarro usa the mapping was partly conducted in combination with echo sounder measurements and followed a zigzag course covering shallow near bank regions and tributary bays as well as the main river channel diffusive ch4 flux was calculated from dissolved ch4 concentration in surface water according to the thin boundary layer model liss 1974 the gas transfer coefficient was calculated using the equation proposed by liss and merlivat 1986 using a wind speed of 2 m s 1 which corresponds to the mean value of wind speeds reported by shi et al 2017 for the studied reservoirs 2 5 measurements of environmental data water level and temperature loggers hobo u20l 02 usa tdr rbr canada were deployed at miw ggq and maw next to the automated bubble traps 1 m above sediment water interface 10 min data logging time interval but logger and data loss resulted in time series of variable length depth profiles of water temperature dissolved oxygen concentration and chlorophyll a fluorescence were measured near the bubble trap deployment sites during all sampling campaigns march july september 2018 and january 2019 using a multi parameter probe exo2 ysi usa 2 6 statistical analyses linear regressions were performed to examine correlations between net sediment ch4 production rate and organic matter content as well as ebullitive ch4 flux vs hydrostatic pressure drops and ebullitive ch4 flux vs water depth the reported r 2 values are adjusted for the number of data points the significance of the regression slope was tested by analysis of variance anova at a significance level p of 0 05 3 results 3 1 potential sediment ch4 production and anaerobic oxidation the net potential ch4 production rates observed in sediment cores increased monotonically from upstream to downstream along the reservoir cascade table 2 mean volumetric production rates ranged from 1 4 1 3 mg l 1 d 1 mean standard deviation in the sediments of the uppermost reservoir miw to 9 5 4 6 mg l 1 d 1 in sediments from the most downstream reservoir dcs organic matter content was highest in dcs 7 3 0 8 and similar in the three upstream reservoirs mean 3 5 4 2 table 2 fig 2 c and was significantly positively p 0 001 related to net potential ch4 production rates fig s1 the production rates within individual cores showed no consistent vertical variations although thin layers 2 and 4 cm respectively of high production near the sediment surface were observed in maw and dcs fig 2b the potential anaerobic ch4 oxidation rates were in general low 0 001 0 062 mg l 1 d 1 compared to production rates fig 2a and b the fraction of ch4 lost due to anaerobic oxidation relative to gross production was found to play a minor role in the upper 8 cm sediment except at the most upstream reservoir miw 7 9 table 2 this fraction dropped sharply along the reservoir cascade to 1 8 at ggq and became negligible at maw and dcs 0 1 and 0 0 respectively 3 2 ebullitive ch4 fluxes 3 2 1 temporal dynamics of ebullition in all reservoirs except for dcs due to the near bank mooring location the continuous observations at the bubble trap deployment sites revealed high temporal variability of ebullitive fluxes at different time scales fig 3 a and b ebullitive ch4 flux varied from 0 to 1 5 33 103 mg m 2 d 1 at the minute time scale fig 3a while the temporal variability decreased by two orders of magnitude from 0 to 5 238 mg m 2 d 1 at the daily time scale fig 3b suggesting the necessity of continuous measurement of ebullition flux in such a dynamic system a selection of ebullition time series at the hourly time scale in ggq reservoir where most complete water level data was collected fig 3c suggests a strong influence of hydrostatic pressure change due to reservoir operation pronounced peaks of the ebullitive flux corresponded well to rapid water level reductions 0 2 1 3 m on a daily basis with water level rises as a counter factor that suppressed ebullition a significant positive nonlinear relationship p 0 002 was found between the magnitude of gas ebullition accumulated ebullitive ch4 flux over the time period of pressure drop by accounting for potential time lags between pressure drop and bubble release and water level reduction fig 3d 3 2 2 spatial variability of ebullition the ebullitive ch4 flux showed strong intra and inter reservoir spatial variability fig 4 the echo sounding surveys observed a consistent longitudinal increase in ebullitive flux in all the three surveyed reservoirs from upstream to the dam area fig 4a c the slightly higher flux in the dam area of miw and maw is in contrast to the hot spot dam area in ggq where ebullitive flux was more than three times higher than in the upstream section fig 4d bubbling was the least active in the most upstream located reservoir miw mean 2 1 mg m 2 d 1 increased sharply in ggq mean 82 mg m 2 d 1 and finally declined in the downstream reservoir maw to a mean value of 40 7 mg m 2 d 1 the ch4 content of bubbles collected near the water surface was similar in all reservoirs mean ch4 volume concentrations between 42 57 no consistent controls of ebullition rates by water depth could be observed in the three surveyed reservoirs fig 5 ebullitive ch4 fluxes decreased with water depth in both miw and maw while only the relationship in miw was significant p 0 01 fig 5a and c in contrast in ggq ebullition tended to be more active at greater water depth fig 5b 3 3 dissolved ch4 concentration and diffusive emissions the high resolution spatial mapping of dissolved ch4 concentration in the surface water revealed large spatial variations figs 6 and 7 a three spatial patterns were observed i high concentrations were observed at intermediate reservoir sections in miw and maw ii relatively low concentrations were measured at intermediate reservoir sections in dcs and iii upstream sections were hot spots for dissolved ch4 in ggq the mean concentrations and standard deviations ranged between 0 4 0 3 µm at dcs to 1 4 1 0 µm at maw maximal concentrations were up to 30 µm the resulting diffusive fluxes were smallest 1 8 mg ch4 m 2 d 1 at dcs and highest 6 4 mg ch4 m 2 d 1 averaged from two consecutive measurements at maw fig 7b table 2 the diffusive emissions from the four reservoirs did not show a clear longitudinal pattern fig 7b the upstream three reservoirs were not apparently different from each other except for ggq fig 7b in which a high variability in diffusive emissions was observed from 0 5 to 130 mg ch4 m 2 d 1 due to the extremely high dissolved ch4 concentrations at the upstream area 4 discussion 4 1 the contribution of ebullitive ch4 flux no consistent difference in ebullitive flux was observed between the data collected using the two different methods automated bubble traps and echo sounder table 2 in ggq echo sounder measured nearly four times higher ebullitive flux compared to bubble traps while the opposite was found in miw and maw where lower fluxes were observed with the echo sounder than the bubble traps the existence of bubble plumes as hotspots of ch4 emissions at ggq see fig s2 for an exemplary echogram of bubble plumes may explain the discrepancy between flux estimates from the automated bubble traps and spatial surveys at this reservoir table 2 localized bubble plume hotspots may contribute disproportionately to ebullitive flux yet given their small spatial footprint they are less likely to be intercepted by bubble traps the discrepancy between bubble trap and echo sounder based flux estimates was similarly seen in wilkinson et al 2019a which was also attributed to the presence of bubble plumes diffusive and ebullitive ch4 fluxes to the atmosphere did not follow the same increase along the reservoir cascade as the production rates in the sediment but showed strong spatial and temporal variability the estimated diffusive ch4 flux 1 8 1 5 6 4 4 2 mg m 2 d 1 is lower than the mean diffusive flux 10 2 33 4 mg m 2 d 1 for chinese reservoirs li et al 2018 our results are likely an underestimation with rather high uncertainties due to the lack of precise gas exchange coefficients or wind speed the sum of diffusive fluxes and ebullition rates varied between 6 8 85 9 mg m 2 d 1 which falls in the low to mid range of estimated global mean fluxes for hydroelectric reservoirs 32 149 mg m 2 d 1 see deemer et al 2016 while previous studies have suggested that younger reservoirs emit more ch4 barros et al 2011 this relationship is not found in the four cascading reservoirs studied here where the oldest reservoir maw 25 year old showed the second highest emission rates 47 1 mg m 2 d 1 sum of diffusive and ebullitive flux our measurements provided a first estimate on ebullitive ch4 flux from mekong reservoirs the consideration of bubble mediated transport is the main reason for the more than 10 fold higher fluxes observed in the present study compared to ch4 fluxes reported by shi et al 2017 for the same reservoirs where ebullition was not measured the lack of field ebullition data is also a major source of uncertainty and likely underestimation of emissions from chinese reservoirs li et al 2018 more studies are urgently needed to further constrain uncertainties of ch4 emissions in these systems an important limitation of the present study is that we only investigated four relatively shallow reservoirs and some large reservoirs were not included e g xiaowan and nuozhadu fig 1 that both have larger water depths maximal depth 200 m liang et al 2019 wang et al 2019 the contribution of ebullition to total ch4 emissions in these reservoirs might be smaller due to their large water depths in addition lower temperature at the reservoir bottom was observed due to the year round thermal stratification e g 14 c in hypoliminion of xiaowan see liang et al 2019 16 c in hypoliminion of nuozhadu see wang et al 2019 which can reduce ch4 production in the sediment in comparison to the investigated reservoirs furthermore aerobic ch4 oxidation at sediment water interface remains active because the hypolimnion is fully oxygenated in spite of the perennial thermal stratification guan et al 2020 they should be included in future research to have a more complete estimate for ch4 emissions from upper mekong reservoirs 4 2 spatio temporal variability of ebullitive flux and associated uncertainties our observations fig 4d are consistent with a previous study by maeck et al 2013 in which a repeated pattern for ch4 ebullition was observed along a smaller cascade of river impoundments at river saar germany in their study the authors demonstrated that the areas near dams were hot spots of ch4 ebullition with the fluxes being linked to sediment deposition rates this suggests a strong control of sediment deposition on ebullitive flux in the upper mekong reservoirs although relevant data about sedimentation rates are not available while the reservoirs share a common intra reservoir spatial pattern in terms of ebullition intensity there is a pronounced inter reservoir difference the uppermost reservoir miw showed the lowest bubbling activities among the three fig 4a and d and fig 5a which could be because of the large water depth maximal depth 108 m and average depth 67 m table 1 the higher ebullition flux in ggq may be due to 1 relatively shallower water depth maximal depth 76 m and average depth 43 m table 1 and 2 supply of organic rich sediment from tributaries a few kilometers before the dam where turbid water was observed entering the reservoir authors observation delsontro et al 2011 and beaulieu et al 2016 highlighted the disproportional contribution from riverine lacustrine transition and littoral zones where organic rich sediment can accumulate that fuels ch4 production in a large tropic reservoir kariba ebullitive ch4 flux was found to be at least one order of magnitude higher in river deltas than in non river bays delsontro et al 2011 a more spatially resolved study in a temperate reservoir by beaulieu et al 2016 suggested that although tributary associated areas occupy only 12 of the total reservoir surface they were the source of 41 of total ch4 emissions with a majority of contribution from ebullition 90 the uncertainty in temporal dynamics of ch4 fluxes observed by automated bubble traps was reduced by two orders of magnitude with the long period deployments the extremes changed from 1 5 33 103 mg m 2 d 1 at the minute time scale to 5 238 mg m 2 d 1 at daily time scales however these long term bubble trap measurements only provide a spatial snapshot similarly our one time echo sounding survey could only provide a temporal snapshot the fluxes reported here and in similar studies e g maeck et al 2013 and paranaíba et al 2018 are therefore associated with high levels of uncertainty both temporal and spatial variabilities are sources of uncertainties wik et al 2016 while in the present study larger standard deviations of bubble fluxes were observed in the acoustic measurements coefficient of variation standard deviation dived by mean value 109 1005 compared to bubble trap time series in two out of three reservoirs coefficient of variation 79 244 table 2 a solid conclusion about whether the spatial variability was a more important source of uncertainty could not be drawn this is because ebullition in nature occurs at hot spots and therefore acoustic surveys measure larger variations when observing bubbles nevertheless the spatial patterns of ebullition can be well characterized if adequate acoustic measurements were performed for a given water body greinert et al 2010 tuser et al 2017 therefore more spatial surveys with a sufficient degree of coverage are needed in the future to reduce uncertainties meanwhile a spatially balanced sampling approach beaulieu et al 2016 should be adopted when deploying multiple automated bubble traps within each individual reservoir i e the gradients in water depth and flow velocity should be better resolved further more complete coverage of the reservoir cascade by including the two large and deep reservoirs xiaowan and nuozhadu are also needed despite the challenge posed by their large geographical span 500 km when including nuozhadu regardless of these large uncertainties in quantifying ebullitive ch4 flux our first ebullition data at the mekong reservoirs highlighted the importance of this previously overlooked pathway our results also suggested a control of water level fluctuations on short term ebullition dynamics in these cascading reservoirs e g at ggq reservoir fig 3c and d which has been observed in many different systems chanton et al 1989 varadharajan and hemond 2012 maeck et al 2014 more investigations into the mechanisms of sediment bubble formation storage and release liu et al 2016 liu et al 2018 in combination with potential sediment ch4 production and sediment deposition patterns hilgert et al 2019 liu et al 2020 could improve predictions of ebullitive ch4 flux and thus help reduce measurement associated uncertainties while subjected to frequent water level fluctuations e g diurnal variations exceeding 1 m at ggq fig 3c and hot moments of ebullition can be triggered by water level reductions fig 3d harrison et al 2017 the overall long term ch4 flux might be reduced compared to the flux observed at a constant water level this is because during the period of high water level ebullition could be suppressed beaulieu et al 2018 and aerobic ch4 oxidation in the fully oxygenated hypolimnion guan et al 2020 potentially reduces diffusive sediment mediated ch4 flux water level management strategies can potentially be used to mitigate ch4 emissions from these hydropower reservoirs 4 3 factors affecting ch4 production and fluxes from upper mekong reservoirs we found a consistent increase of net ch4 production potential in reservoir sediments from upstream to downstream along cascading reservoirs in the upper mekong fig 2a the reasons for this flow wise increase of net ch4 production potential are multi fold first the higher sediment ch4 production potential at dcs compared to the upper three reservoirs miw ggq and maw corresponded well to the increase in sediment organic matter content fig 2b fig s1 and table 2 it has been shown that the enrichment of organic matter both terrestrial and phytoplankton derived can fuel ch4 ebullition in a reservoir grinham et al 2018 sediment organic matter quality i e source in addition to quantity regulates sediment ch4 production berberich et al 2019 and the organic matter in our system is primarily catchment derived the mean chlorophyll a concentrations in the studies reservoirs were 2 μg l 1 table 2 second decreasing sediment grain size along the upper mekong reservoirs guo et al 2020 could be a potential driver in small streams sediment ch4 production and oxidation potential was found to have a positive relationship with the fraction of fine grained sediment particles bodmer et al 2020 last temperature plays a significant role in controlling sediment ch4 production potential table 2 and fig s3 in september when the echo sounding survey was performed reservoir bottom water temperature showed a longitudinal increase from 17 5 and 17 6 c in the upper two reservoirs miw and ggq respectively to 21 2 and 21 8 c at maw and dcs fig s3 this increase in water temperature suggests an important influence by the large deep reservoir xiaowan located in between the upper two and the lower two reservoirs the four studied reservoirs were all well mixed over the full water depth over the year except the apparent thermal stratification was observed below 54 m at miw during early summer fig s4 in contrast strong stratification in xiaowan during throughout the year particularly in summer results in a warmer upper mixed layer liang et al 2019 from which the water was discharged to downstream reservoirs causing a strong increase in water temperature 3 6 c in the two downstream reservoirs maw and dcs as sediment ch4 production rate is highly temperature dependent around 21 and 20 reductions in net ch4 production potential 2222 1762 2316 1851 mg m 2 d 1 were expected due to colder bottom water temperature at the upper two reservoirs miw and ggq compared to the rates at 20 c laboratory incubation temperature in contrast 11 and 18 increase 3127 3479 8766 10391 mg m 2 d 1 was observed at maw and dcs respectively due to the warmer temperature the measured sediment ch4 production rates are comparable in magnitude to production rates measured in impoundments of the rhine river and its tributaries in germany wilkinson et al 2015 wilkinson et al 2019a previous studies maeck et al 2013 isidorova et al 2019 wilkinson et al 2019a have suggested that sediment ch4 production is positively correlated with sediment deposition with higher production rates in shallower newer sediments however the lack of consistent vertical gradients of potential ch4 production in the sediment fig 2a suggest a rather dynamic sedimentation and sediment transport regime in these reservoirs this makes extrapolation of the measured rates to deposition depth exceeding the length of the sampled cores and estimation of total i e depth integrated production rates rather difficult hence the numbers reported here are most likely an underestimate by only considering the surface 1 m sediment depth furthermore while shi et al 2017 suggested that sediment organic matter content is negatively correlated with reservoir age and ch4 emissions from the mekong were likely to reduce in the future the mekong reservoirs studied here showed no correlation between reservoir age and ch4 production therefore the future projection of reduced ch4 emissions from upper mekong reservoirs shi et al 2017 might be questionable because of the continuous and highly dynamic deposition of fresh sediment instead sediment management practices for example dredging and soil conservation in the mekong watershed might help mitigating ch4 emissions the emission rates were at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the estimated fluxes resulting from temperature corrected net sediment ch4 production table 2 indicating that only a small fraction of the produced ch4 reaches the atmosphere the majority of ch4 produced in sediment is most likely converted to co2 by aerobic ch4 oxidation since the water column is fully oxygenated most time of the year fig s5 future studies should take aerobic ch4 oxidation into account and focus on the environmental factors controlling the fraction of oxidized ch4 depending on the hydrologic regime sawakuchi et al 2016 estimated that ch4 oxidation reduced the diffusive flux from amazonian rivers by 28 96 in cascading reservoirs the hydrological regime is controlled by dam operation providing a potential opportunity for the reduction of reservoir ch4 emissions by reservoir management 5 conclusions this study provides a first estimate of potential ch4 production and ebullitive flux along cascading reservoirs at the upper mekong river consideration of the bubble mediated emission pathway resulted in more than 10 fold higher ch4 emission rates than previously reported repeating spatial distribution patterns of the ebullitive flux can be identified in the upper three studied reservoirs where higher ebullitive ch4 flux was observed in the area near the dam compared to upstream sections in addition both sediment ch4 production and emission were found to be unrelated to reservoir age our findings suggest that sediment organic matter content sediment transport and reservoir hydrodynamics are the major drivers of ch4 net production in the sediments of cascading reservoirs the poor predictability of net sediment ch4 production rates in explaining ch4 surface emissions from these reservoirs indicates aerobic oxidation as an important control on the emission of ch4 produced in the sediment author contributions l

17527,this research work investigates the zn2 cu2 and mg2 inhibiting effects on caco3 precipitation the results demonstrate a synergetic effect of the cu2 zn2 mg2 mixture by a long infinite induction time the individual inhibition action of cu2 zn2 and mg2 is well established but it is much lower than the effect of the mixture a dual mechanism is suggested where the inhibition effect is attributed to the cation interaction with hydroxide anions oh to form the corresponding cuoh znoh and mgoh hydrocomplexes this in return prevents and delays the caco3 precipitation the ph range plays a crucial role in the effect where cu2 prevents the precipitation below a ph of 7 5 zn2 reacts in the ph range of 7 5 8 8 while mg2 completes the synergy by inhibiting the precipitation at high ph values the results indicate that the inhibition efficiency by mg2 is improved in the presence of both cu2 and zn2 ions these predictions were verified by theoretical calculations of thermodynamic equilibria

precipitation of caco3 by cathodic polarization and showed that the mg2 ions in the bulk solution react directly with oh ions produced in the vicinity of the cathode to form mgoh and delay the calcium carbonate precipitation in the meantime many other studies dealing with the inhibition properties of zn2 and cu2 ions on the scaling phenomenon showed that these metal ions are very efficient inhibitors at low concentration benslimane et al 2016 ghizellaoui et al 2007 gritli et al 2019 liu et al 2011 macadam and parsons 2009 parsiegla and katz 2000 wada et al 1995 wen jun et al 2008 zeppenfeld 2010 these zn2 and cu2 anti scale effects were explained by various mechanisms such as pre precipitation co precipitation and post precipitation mechanisms nevertheless many research studies based on the measurement of the induction time ph decrease and ca2 consumption have confirmed a pre precipitation effect of zn2 and cu2 coetzee et al 1996 coetzee et al 1998 macadam and parsons 2004a usmany et al 2016 recently sabzi and arefinia 2019 have studied the effect of zn2 on the corrosion and caco3 scale inhibition in synthetic seawater using electrochemical methods they established a co precipitation mechanism associated with two main effects on the crystallization phenomenon a reduction in the nuclei sites and an interference in the growth stage moreover a study by parsiegla and katz 2000 confirmed the formation of three different copper complexes in calco carbonic solutions cuco3 cu co3 2 2 and cu4 co3 3 oh 3 which inhibit caco3 growth rate in a previous study benslimane et al 2016 proposed a new thermodynamic mechanism based on zn2 speciation in the carbonated media the inhibition phenomena was explained by the formation of zn2 complexes znoh zn oh 2 aq znco3 aq and zn co3 2 2 which delays the precipitation of caco3 and thus inhibiting caco3 formation by consumption of co3 2 carbonate anions the aim of this work is to investigate the interactions between zn2 cu2 mg2 oh co3 2 influences as well as their combination on the delay of caco3 precipitation the metallic bivalent cations and hco3 competes to react with oh during co2 evolution and ph increase based upon this knowledge the main arising question is does oh react firstly and successively with cu2 zn2 and mg2 to form the corresponding hydrocomplexe species cuoh at ph 7 5 znoh at 7 5 ph 8 8 and mgoh at ph 8 8 respectively and delay the calcium carbonate precipitation in a synergistic effect or with hco3 to form co3 2 and promotes the caco3 precipitation 2 theory the composition and distribution of ionic species in natural water largely depends on acid base interactions the concentration of h ions will depends on the buffering power of the water the three phases carbonate equilibria air water and solid in rocks determines the composition of carbonate species in natural water additionally natural water contains relatively high amounts of alkaline elements e g mg2 and ca2 together with low amounts of some trace metals e g cu2 zn2 thermodynamically speaking the precipitation of caco3 is possible when the activity of ca2 and co3 2 ions in a solution is above their saturation limit al roomi and hussain 2016 thermodynamic equilibrium data from literature presented in table 1 confirm the formation possibility of cuoh znoh and mgoh hydrocomplexes in the caco3 precipitation range ph 6 9 5 the hydra medusa program puigdomenech and medusa 2001 has been used to draw the logarithmic and speciation diagrams based on thermodynamic equilibrium data the obtained diagrams are shown in fig 1 the diagrams confirm important concentrations of cuoh 10 6 7 mol l at 6 4 ph 7 znoh 10 5 3 mol l at 7 5 ph 8 8 and mgoh 10 4 5 mol l at 8 8 ph 9 5 hydrocomplex species based on logarithmic curves by the hydra medusa program fig 1 and theoretical data showing the successive formation of hydrocomplexes of cu2 zn2 mg2 in the ph range corresponding to the precipitation of caco3 the hypothesis of inhibition by a synergetic effect of the cu2 zn2 mg2 mixture have been verified experimentally through a set of ph oversaturation values at the precipitation point βp and ca2 concentration measurements over time for individual metallic cations as well as their mixtures 3 experimental methods 3 1 solution preparation the experimental method for solution preparation has been described in our previous study benslimane et al 2016 typically the calco carbonically pure ccp solution is obtained by dissolving 400 mg l 40 f of caco3 fluka purity 99 in bi distilled water the concentration of calcium species in the system is presented in french degrees f where 1 f 0 2 meq l for a complete dissolution of caco3 according to reaction 1 the ccp was maintained under co2 bubbling for 20 hours with moderate magnetic stirring 400 rpm suitable amounts of analytical grade stock solutions of zn no3 2 4h2o cu no3 2 and mgso4 7h2o were prepared for inhibition tests 1 cac o 3 s h 2 o c o 2 c a 2 2 hco 3 3 2 principle of the lcge chemical scaling method this method was named after the lcge laboratory laboratoire de chimie et de génie de l environnement that has first developed the method and the experimental setup roques and girou 1974 then it was a subject of modifications in the early 90 s by combination of recent analytical techniques dedieu l et al 1994 hort et al 1995a this method has the advantage of getting as close as possible to the phenomenon of natural water scaling the ccp solution is filled into a 500 ml cell immersed in a thermostatic bath at 30 c a controlled airflow bubbling system atmospheric air is placed at the cell bottom to degas progressively and uniformly the co2 saturated solution fig 2 all experiments are performed at a constant temperature of 30 c controlled by a temperature sensor at the same time calcium concentration conventional ca2 titration by edta and ph measurements with a ph meter radiometer phm240 are performed the maximum ph value of the ph time plots php corresponds to the beginning of the calcium carbonate precipitation which is associated to the induction time t p benslimane et al 2016 in addition the oversaturation values at the precipitation point βp characterizing the deviation of the system from its equilibrium state gritli et al 2019 are calculated as follows 2 β p c a 2 co 3 2 ks 1 0 p h p p k 2 c a 2 hco 3 γ c a 2 γ hco 3 ks where ca2 ca2 γca 2 γca 2 and γhco3 are the ionic activity coefficients of ca2 and hco3 respectively ks is the caco3 solubility product pk2 is the dissociation constant of the hco3 co3 2 acid base pair 4 results and discussions 4 1 typical precipitation curves fig 3 presents the two main curves obtained by the lcge method the calcium carbonate precipitation is due to the displacement of the calco carbonic equilibrium following the degassing of dissolved co2 according to henry s law in this case caco3 precipitates according to reaction 3 curve 1 in fig 3 shows the evolution of ph as a function of time where three main regions can be distinguished benslimane et al 2016 hort et al 1995b a rapid ph increase associated with co2 evolution followed by a slower ph increase where the ph reaches a maximum called the precipitation ph php these ph variations can be explained by the acid base equilibrium between carbonate species in the solution at the end the ph decrease is associated with the precipitation onset of caco3 curve 2 confirms the absence of caco3 precipitation before the induction time t p where no increase of ca2 concentration is perceptible before the induction time t p 3 c a 2 2 hco 3 cac o 3 s c o 2 g h 2 o 4 2 zn2 and cu2 effect on caco3 precipitation fig 4 shows that the addition of zn2 or cu2 does not modify the general shape of the ph time curve but increases the php and t p to higher values the induction time t p can be measured from the decrease in ph or ca2 concentration respectively it increases with the increasing concentration of zn2 and cu2 which confirms the inhibitory effect of micro amounts below 3 ppm of zn2 and cu2 on the precipitation of caco3 these results show that php t p and the oversaturation values βp increase with the increasing inhibitor concentrations similar behaviours were reported in previous studies benslimane et al 2016 gritli et al 2019 according to table 2 the induction time t p increases from 16 to 36 min and the php increases from 8 46 to 8 74 for a variation of zn2 concentration between 0 and 2 ppm beyond this value the precipitation time t p and php become stagnant confirming zn2 inefficiency at higher concentrations these results are in agreement with the work of lisitsin et al lisitsin et al 2005 on the other hand an increase of cu2 concentration from 0 to 0 9 ppm increases the t p from 16 to 34 and the php from 8 46 to 8 64 table 2 many studies in literature showed the existence of two types of caco3 inhibition by zn2 and cu2 in the first type after caco3 nucleation the presence of zn2 and cu2 decreases the caco3 crystal growth rate which affects calcium carbonate nucleation by changing the morphology of caco3 crystals ghizellaoui et al 2007 gritli et al 2019 macadam and parsons 2004b wada et al 1995 zeppenfeld 2010 other studies on this type ghizellaoui et al 2004 lédion et al 2002 liu et al 2011 reported that the inhibition effect of cu2 and zn2 is associated with the formation of calcium and copper mixed carbonates ca1 xcuxco3 and ca1 xznxco3 in this case the inhibition is attributed to the fact that the activation energy for dehydration of cu2 and zn2 ions is much higher than for ca2 ions making the growth of the nuclei more difficult the second type is proposed by benslimane et al 2016 where the zn2 reacts with oh and co3 2 to form znoh and znco3 respectively before the formation of caco3 4 3 mg2 effect on caco3 precipitation the inhibition effects of mg2 on calcium carbonate precipitation are investigated by the lcge method the ph time and ca2 time curves in the presence of mg2 at different concentrations are presented in fig 5 these curves are similar to previous reports benslimane et al 2016 hort et al 1995b the results show that the induction time t p increases from 16 to 56 min for a variation of mg2 concentration from 0 ppm to 300 ppm high values of mg2 inhibition concentrations can be noticed compared to those of zn2 and cu2 this significant increase of mg2 concentrations can be discussed specifically from a thermodynamic benslimane et al 2016 and a kinetic approach moreover waly et al waly et al 2012 studied the inhibition effect of inorganic ions in seawater they reported that two mechanisms might occur simultaneously in the presence of mg 2 or so4 2 the first is a thermodynamic complexation of ca2 and co3 2 while the second is crystallographic inhibition by blocking the growth sites fig 5c shows the t p mg2 concentration curve revealing a linear proportionality of the induction time as mg2 concentration increases which is a direct confirmation of our hypothesis benslimane et al 2016 stating that caco3 precipitation occurs just after a complete consumption of zn2 here with mg2 4 4 cu2 and zn2 mixture effect on caco3 precipitation the mixture of zn2 and cu2 ions is introduced in the form of soluble salts with increasing concentrations 0 1 0 5 0 75 and 1 ppm of each ion the ph time and ca2 time curves are presented in fig 6 typical ph time and ca2 time curves are obtained in the presence of a mixture of cu2 and zn2 inhibitors according to figs 6 and 7 the comparison of the precipitation ph php induction time t p and the oversaturation values at the precipitation point βp allows the determination of the cu2 zn2 inhibiting effects on the calcium carbonate precipitation these results show that the precipitation ph induction time and oversaturation βp increases with cu2 zn2 concentrations for instance the values of t p php and βp are 144 min 8 99 and 293 respectively for 1 ppm cu2 1 ppm zn2 mixture whereas they are only 26 min 8 7 and 150 respectively for 0 1 ppm cu2 0 1 ppm zn2 mixture as shown in figs 4 and 6 for the ph time and ca2 time curves the inhibition efficiency of cu 2 and zn2 when they are used individually can be noticed but it is much lower than that of the mixture for 0 5 ppm cu2 0 5 ppm zn2 mixture the induction time is 52 min whereas it is only 32 min for 0 8 ppm zn2 and 34 min for 0 9 ppm cu2 moreover in the presence of cu2 zn2 mixture the precipitation ph drastically increases compared to the increase in the individual presence of cu2 or zn2 4 5 cu2 zn2 and mg2 mixture effect on caco3 precipitation a series of tests have been carried out where the mg2 ions are introduced in the form of the soluble mgso4 7h2o salt in a ccp solution of 40f with a mixture of 0 5 ppm zn2 0 5 ppm cu2 the evolution over time of ph and ca2 concentration are shown in fig 8 the variation of precipitation ph induction time and oversaturation as a function of mg2 concentration in the solution mixture of 40 f ccp with 0 5 ppm cu2 0 5 ppm zn2 are summarized in fig 9 it is clear that the mg2 effect in the presence of the cu2 zn2 mixture is very effective for 0 5 ppm cu2 0 5 ppm zn2 100 ppm mg2 the induction time is 160 min fig 9 whereas it is only 30 min and 56 min for individual presence of mg2 ions at 100 ppm and 300 ppm respectively table 3 for 100 ppm mg2 in the presence of the cu2 zn2 mixture the precipitation ph is 8 99 this value is significantly higher than those observed with 100 ppm and 300 ppm of individual mg2 corresponding to precipitation ph values of 8 54 and 8 58 respectively the mixture of 0 5 ppm cu2 0 5 ppm zn2 in the presence of mg2 induce an important delay of the caco3 precipitation by a synergistic effect the oversaturation βp increases with increasing the mg2 concentration despite the increase of ionic strength fig 8a and b show a total inhibition of caco3 precipitation at 150 ppm mg2 with the 0 5 ppm cu2 0 5 ppm zn2 mixture where the precipitation of caco3 did not occur no ph decrease and constant ca2 concentration values can be observed for more than 280 min 5 scale inhibition mechanism generally antiscalants do not eliminate the components of scaling but they delay the precipitation onset and or delay the crystal growth of mineral salts these antiscalants can also increase the solubility of scale salts al roomi and hussain 2016 antony et al 2011 drak et al 2000 eriksson et al 2007 explained this effect by the complexation of these cations e g ca2 which delayed their precipitation moreover antony et al 2011 suggested that substoichiometric amounts of antiscalants prevent the precipitation of salts once the salt has exceeded its solubility product in literature two different inhibiting effects are widely accepted the first effects before the caco3 precipitation pre precipitation confirmed by the induction time and ph decrease measurements benslimane et al 2016 coetzee et al 1998 ghizellaoui et al 2004 lisitsin et al 2005 liu et al 2011 macadam and parsons 2004a the second effect is after crystal formation post precipitation due to modified crystallization and crystal growth kinetics barchiche et al 2003 boyd et al 2014 chen et al 2005 2006 devos et al 2009 ketrane et al 2010 meyer 1984 wada et al 1995 zeppenfeld 2010 based upon this knowledge we propose a dual mechanism within the first inhibition category before the caco3 precipitation which is characterized by the induction time and ca2 consumption the first mechanism is based on the bivalent interaction cation oh which lead to the formation of the hydrocomplexes cuoh znoh and mgoh thus preventing and delaying the caco3 precipitation the second mechanism is the ph range complementary effect where cu2 prevents the precipitation before ph 7 5 zn2 reacts in the ph range of 7 5 8 8 and mg2 completes the synergy by covering high ph range at higher ph the free cu2 zn2 and mg2 concentrations decrease and the hydrocomplex species cuoh znoh and mgoh concentrations increase respectively fig 1a c which promotes the oh encapsulating effect the encapsulation and consumption of oh will prevent them to react with hco3 to form co3 2 thus delaying the caco3 precipitation the cuoh znoh and mgoh hydrocomplexes and cuco3 znco3 and mgco3 complex formation table 1 constitutes the key explanation of the inhibition mechanism in the absence of sufficient quantities of oh hco3 cannot transform to co3 2 the solubility product condition ks is not yet verified which inhibits the caco3 precipitation the competition between cu2 zn2 mg2 and hco3 to react with oh is explained by the δpk values equilibrium constants in table 1 oh will react firstly with cu2 ph 7 5 and zn2 ph 7 5 8 8 to form more stable hydrocomplexes cuoh and znoh log k 7 5 for mg2 less stable mgoh hydrocmplexe log k 11 44 at relatively low concentrations around 1 ppm hco3 is able to compete with mg2 for oh to form co3 2 at higher mg2 concentrations mg2 is able to delay co3 2 formation log k 10 33 due to its close equilibrium constant to that of mgoh in addition mg2 is able to form mgco3 aq which contributes to the delay of caco3 formation the formation of metallic hydrocomplexes delays the reaction of oh with hco3 at higher ph values thus delaying the calcium carbonate precipitation the conventional thermodynamic and analytical chemistry data stumm and morgan 1996 confirm explicitly the existence of the complex species cuoh znoh mgoh cuco3 aq znco3 aq and mgco3 aq with their precise stability constants pkc table 1 the synergy in scale inhibition by cu2 zn2 and mg2 cations can be explained by the formation of their hydrocomplexes at a wide complementary ph range where each metallic cation reacts at a specific ph range covering a range of 6 9 5 the possibility of inhibition by affecting caco3 crystal nucleation and or growth processes cannot be excluded after the formation of caco3 however in our proposed mechanism the chemical effect of caco3 inhibition is effective before caco3 formation by consumption of oh and or co3 2 6 conclusion the inhibition of calcium carbonate precipitation using zn2 cu2 and mg2 individually and with their mixtures zn2 cu2 and cu2 zn2 mg2 was investigated the cu2 zn2 and mg2 individual inhibiting effect is well known and well established however their mixtures were not reported previously besides its novelty the use of cu2 zn2 mg2 mixture shows an enhanced efficiency illustrated by long induction time and high precipitation ph this has demonstrated a strong synergetic effect which cannot be explained by conventional kinetic and crystallographic interpretations of caco3 inhibition the second result is the confirmation of the thermodynamic mechanism of bivalent m2 cation effect and their complementary lewis acid properties formation of moh in addition to their ability to form carbonate complexes mco3 these complexation reactions thermodynamically compete with caco3 precipitation explaining the mechanism of inhibition further research work on this approach might include the investigation of other heavy metal mixtures and their synergetic effect on the inhibition of caco3 precipitation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

saturation limit al roomi and hussain 2016 thermodynamic equilibrium data from literature presented in table 1 confirm the formation possibility of cuoh znoh and mgoh hydrocomplexes in the caco3 precipitation range ph 6 9 5 the hydra medusa program puigdomenech and medusa 2001 has been used to draw the logarithmic and speciation diagrams based on thermodynamic equilibrium data the obtained diagrams are shown in fig 1 the diagrams confirm important concentrations of cuoh 10 6 7 mol l at 6 4 ph 7 znoh 10 5 3 mol l at 7 5 ph 8 8 and mgoh 10 4 5 mol l at 8 8 ph 9 5 hydrocomplex species based on logarithmic curves by the hydra medusa program fig 1 and theoretical data showing the successive formation of hydrocomplexes of cu2 zn2 mg2 in the ph range corresponding to the precipitation of caco3 the hypothesis of inhibition by a synergetic effect of the cu2 zn2 mg2 mixture have been verified experimentally through a set of ph oversaturation values at the precipitation point βp and ca2 concentration measurements over time for individual metallic cations as well as their mixtures 3 experimental methods 3 1 solution preparation the experimental method for solution preparation has been described in our previous study benslimane et al 2016 typically the calco carbonically pure ccp solution is obtained by dissolving 400 mg l 40 f of caco3 fluka purity 99 in bi distilled water the concentration of calcium species in the system is presented in french degrees f where 1 f 0 2 meq l for a complete dissolution of caco3 according to reaction 1 the ccp was maintained under co2 bubbling for 20 hours with moderate magnetic stirring 400 rpm suitable amounts of analytical grade stock solutions of zn no3 2 4h2o cu no3 2 and mgso4 7h2o were prepared for inhibition tests 1 cac o 3 s h 2 o c o 2 c a 2 2 hco 3 3 2 principle of the lcge chemical scaling method this method was named after the lcge laboratory laboratoire de chimie et de génie de l environnement that has first developed the method and the experimental setup roques and girou 1974 then it was a subject of modifications in the early 90 s by combination of recent analytical techniques dedieu l et al 1994 hort et al 1995a this method has the advantage of getting as close as possible to the phenomenon of natural water scaling the ccp solution is filled into a 500 ml cell immersed in a thermostatic bath at 30 c a controlled airflow bubbling system atmospheric air is placed at the cell bottom to degas progressively and uniformly the co2 saturated solution fig 2 all experiments are performed at a constant temperature of 30 c controlled by a temperature sensor at the same time calcium concentration conventional ca2 titration by edta and ph measurements with a ph meter radiometer phm240 are performed the maximum ph value of the ph time plots php corresponds to the beginning of the calcium carbonate precipitation which is associated to the induction time t p benslimane et al 2016 in addition the oversaturation values at the precipitation point βp characterizing the deviation of the system from its equilibrium state gritli et al 2019 are calculated as follows 2 β p c a 2 co 3 2 ks 1 0 p h p p k 2 c a 2 hco 3 γ c a 2 γ hco 3 ks where ca2 ca2 γca 2 γca 2 and γhco3 are the ionic activity coefficients of ca2 and hco3 respectively ks is the caco3 solubility product pk2 is the dissociation constant of the hco3 co3 2 acid base pair 4 results and discussions 4 1 typical precipitation curves fig 3 presents the two main curves obtained by the lcge method the calcium carbonate precipitation is due to the displacement of the calco carbonic equilibrium following the degassing of dissolved co2 according to henry s law in this case caco3 precipitates according to reaction 3 curve 1 in fig 3 shows the evolution of ph as a function of time where three main regions can be distinguished benslimane et al 2016 hort et al 1995b a rapid ph increase associated with co2 evolution followed by a slower ph increase where the ph reaches a maximum called the precipitation ph php these ph variations can be explained by the acid base equilibrium between carbonate species in the solution at the end the ph decrease is associated with the precipitation onset of caco3 curve 2 confirms the absence of caco3 precipitation before the induction time t p where no increase of ca2 concentration is perceptible before the induction time t p 3 c a 2 2 hco 3 cac o 3 s c o 2 g h 2 o 4 2 zn2 and cu2 effect on caco3 precipitation fig 4 shows that the addition of zn2 or cu2 does not modify the general shape of the ph time curve but increases the php and t p to higher values the induction time t p can be measured from the decrease in ph or ca2 concentration respectively it increases with the increasing concentration of zn2 and cu2 which confirms the inhibitory effect of micro amounts below 3 ppm of zn2 and cu2 on the precipitation of caco3 these results show that php t p and the oversaturation values βp increase with the increasing inhibitor concentrations similar behaviours were reported in previous studies benslimane et al 2016 gritli et al 2019 according to table 2 the induction time t p increases from 16 to 36 min and the php increases from 8 46 to 8 74 for a variation of zn2 concentration between 0 and 2 ppm beyond this value the precipitation time t p and php become stagnant confirming zn2 inefficiency at higher concentrations these results are in agreement with the work of lisitsin et al lisitsin et al 2005 on the other hand an increase of cu2 concentration from 0 to 0 9 ppm increases the t p from 16 to 34 and the php from 8 46 to 8 64 table 2 many studies in literature showed the existence of two types of caco3 inhibition by zn2 and cu2 in the first type after caco3 nucleation the presence of zn2 and cu2 decreases the caco3 crystal growth rate which affects calcium carbonate nucleation by changing the morphology of caco3 crystals ghizellaoui et al 2007 gritli et al 2019 macadam and parsons 2004b wada et al 1995 zeppenfeld 2010 other studies on this type ghizellaoui et al 2004 lédion et al 2002 liu et al 2011 reported that the inhibition effect of cu2 and zn2 is associated with the formation of calcium and copper mixed carbonates ca1 xcuxco3 and ca1 xznxco3 in this case the inhibition is attributed to the fact that the activation energy for dehydration of cu2 and zn2 ions is much higher than for ca2 ions making the growth of the nuclei more difficult the second type is proposed by benslimane et al 2016 where the zn2 reacts with oh and co3 2 to form znoh and znco3 respectively before the formation of caco3 4 3 mg2 effect on caco3 precipitation the inhibition effects of mg2 on calcium carbonate precipitation are investigated by the lcge method the ph time and ca2 time curves in the presence of mg2 at different concentrations are presented in fig 5 these curves are similar to previous reports benslimane et al 2016 hort et al 1995b the results show that the induction time t p increases from 16 to 56 min for a variation of mg2 concentration from 0 ppm to 300 ppm high values of mg2 inhibition concentrations can be noticed compared to those of zn2 and cu2 this significant increase of mg2 concentrations can be discussed specifically from a thermodynamic benslimane et al 2016 and a kinetic approach moreover waly et al waly et al 2012 studied the inhibition effect of inorganic ions in seawater they reported that two mechanisms might occur simultaneously in the presence of mg 2 or so4 2 the first is a thermodynamic complexation of ca2 and co3 2 while the second is crystallographic inhibition by blocking the growth sites fig 5c shows the t p mg2 concentration curve revealing a linear proportionality of the induction time as mg2 concentration increases which is a direct confirmation of our hypothesis benslimane et al 2016 stating that caco3 precipitation occurs just after a complete consumption of zn2 here with mg2 4 4 cu2 and zn2 mixture effect on caco3 precipitation the mixture of zn2 and cu2 ions is introduced in the form of soluble salts with increasing concentrations 0 1 0 5 0 75 and 1 ppm of each ion the ph time and ca2 time curves are presented in fig 6 typical ph time and ca2 time curves are obtained in the presence of a mixture of cu2 and zn2 inhibitors according to figs 6 and 7 the comparison of the precipitation ph php induction time t p and the oversaturation values at the precipitation point βp allows the determination of the cu2 zn2 inhibiting effects on the calcium carbonate precipitation these results show that the precipitation ph induction time and oversaturation βp increases with cu2 zn2 concentrations for instance the values of t p php and βp are 144 min 8 99 and 293 respectively for 1 ppm cu2 1 ppm zn2 mixture whereas they are only 26 min 8 7 and 150 respectively for 0 1 ppm cu2 0 1 ppm zn2 mixture as shown in figs 4 and 6 for the ph time and ca2 time curves the inhibition efficiency of cu 2 and zn2 when they are used individually can be noticed but it is much lower than that of the mixture for 0 5 ppm cu2 0 5 ppm zn2 mixture the induction time is 52 min whereas it is only 32 min for 0 8 ppm zn2 and 34 min for 0 9 ppm cu2 moreover in the presence of cu2 zn2 mixture the precipitation ph drastically increases compared to the increase in the individual presence of cu2 or zn2 4 5 cu2 zn2 and mg2 mixture effect on caco3 precipitation a series of tests have been carried out where the mg2 ions are introduced in the form of the soluble mgso4 7h2o salt in a ccp solution of 40f with a mixture of 0 5 ppm zn2 0 5 ppm cu2 the evolution over time of ph and ca2 concentration are shown in fig 8 the variation of precipitation ph induction time and oversaturation as a function of mg2 concentration in the solution mixture of 40 f ccp with 0 5 ppm cu2 0 5 ppm zn2 are summarized in fig 9 it is clear that the mg2 effect in the presence of the cu2 zn2 mixture is very effective for 0 5 ppm cu2 0 5 ppm zn2 100 ppm mg2 the induction time is 160 min fig 9 whereas it is only 30 min and 56 min for individual presence of mg2 ions at 100 ppm and 300 ppm respectively table 3 for 100 ppm mg2 in the presence of the cu2 zn2 mixture the precipitation ph is 8 99 this value is significantly higher than those observed with 100 ppm and 300 ppm of individual mg2 corresponding to precipitation ph values of 8 54 and 8 58 respectively the mixture of 0 5 ppm cu2 0 5 ppm zn2 in the presence of mg2 induce an important delay of the caco3 precipitation by a synergistic effect the oversaturation βp increases with increasing the mg2 concentration despite the increase of ionic strength fig 8a and b show a total inhibition of caco3 precipitation at 150 ppm mg2 with the 0 5 ppm cu2 0 5 ppm zn2 mixture where the precipitation of caco3 did not occur no ph decrease and constant ca2 concentration values can be observed for more than 280 min 5 scale inhibition mechanism generally antiscalants do not eliminate the components of scaling but they delay the precipitation onset and or delay the crystal growth of mineral salts these antiscalants can also increase the solubility of scale salts al roomi and hussain 2016 antony et al 2011 drak et al 2000 eriksson et al 2007 explained this effect by the complexation of these cations e g ca2 which delayed their precipitation moreover antony et al 2011 suggested that substoichiometric amounts of antiscalants prevent the precipitation of salts once the salt has exceeded its solubility product in literature two different inhibiting effects are widely accepted the first effects before the caco3 precipitation pre precipitation confirmed by the induction time and ph decrease measurements benslimane et al 2016 coetzee et al 1998 ghizellaoui et al 2004 lisitsin et al 2005 liu et al 2011 macadam and parsons 2004a the second effect is after crystal formation post precipitation due to modified crystallization and crystal growth kinetics barchiche et al 2003 boyd et al 2014 chen et al 2005 2006 devos et al 2009 ketrane et al 2010 meyer 1984 wada et al 1995 zeppenfeld 2010 based upon this knowledge we propose a dual mechanism within the first inhibition category before the caco3 precipitation which is characterized by the induction time and ca2 consumption the first mechanism is based on the bivalent interaction cation oh which lead to the formation of the hydrocomplexes cuoh znoh and mgoh thus preventing and delaying the caco3 precipitation the second mechanism is the ph range complementary effect where cu2 prevents the precipitation before ph 7 5 zn2 reacts in the ph range of 7 5 8 8 and mg2 completes the synergy by covering high ph range at higher ph the free cu2 zn2 and mg2 concentrations decrease and the hydrocomplex species cuoh znoh and mgoh concentrations increase respectively fig 1a c which promotes the oh encapsulating effect the encapsulation and consumption of oh will prevent them to react with hco3 to form co3 2 thus delaying the caco3 precipitation the cuoh znoh and mgoh hydrocomplexes and cuco3 znco3 and mgco3 complex formation table 1 constitutes the key explanation of the inhibition mechanism in the absence of sufficient quantities of oh hco3 cannot transform to co3 2 the solubility product condition ks is not yet verified which inhibits the caco3 precipitation the competition between cu2 zn2 mg2 and hco3 to react with oh is explained by the δpk values equilibrium constants in table 1 oh will react firstly with cu2 ph 7 5 and zn2 ph 7 5 8 8 to form more stable hydrocomplexes cuoh and znoh log k 7 5 for mg2 less stable mgoh hydrocmplexe log k 11 44 at relatively low concentrations around 1 ppm hco3 is able to compete with mg2 for oh to form co3 2 at higher mg2 concentrations mg2 is able to delay co3 2 formation log k 10 33 due to its close equilibrium constant to that of mgoh in addition mg2 is able to form mgco3 aq which contributes to the delay of caco3 formation the formation of metallic hydrocomplexes delays the reaction of oh with hco3 at higher ph values thus delaying the calcium carbonate precipitation the conventional thermodynamic and analytical chemistry data stumm and morgan 1996 confirm explicitly the existence of the complex species cuoh znoh mgoh cuco3 aq znco3 aq and mgco3 aq with their precise stability constants pkc table 1 the synergy in scale inhibition by cu2 zn2 and mg2 cations can be explained by the formation of their hydrocomplexes at a wide complementary ph range where each metallic cation reacts at a specific ph range covering a range of 6 9 5 the possibility of inhibition by affecting caco3 crystal nucleation and or growth processes cannot be excluded after the formation of caco3 however in our proposed mechanism the chemical effect of caco3 inhibition is effective before caco3 formation by consumption of oh and or co3 2 6 conclusion the inhibition of calcium carbonate precipitation using zn2 cu2 and mg2 individually and with their mixtures zn2 cu2 and cu2 zn2 mg2 was investigated the cu2 zn2 and mg2 individual inhibiting effect is well known and well established however their mixtures were not reported previously besides its novelty the use of cu2 zn2 mg2 mixture shows an enhanced efficiency illustrated by long induction time and high precipitation ph this has demonstrated a strong synergetic effect which cannot be explained by conventional kinetic and crystallographic interpretations of caco3 inhibition the second result is the confirmation of the thermodynamic mechanism of bivalent m2 cation effect and their complementary lewis acid properties formation of moh in addition to their ability to form carbonate complexes mco3 these complexation reactions thermodynamically compete with caco3 precipitation explaining the mechanism of inhibition further research work on this approach might include the investigation of other heavy metal mixtures and their synergetic effect on the inhibition of caco3 precipitation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

17528,copper ion cu ii in water or wastewater has been reported to trigger peroxymonosulfate pms oxidation of organic contaminants ocs however this process can only work in alkaline condition which limits its potential application in this study we found that the introduction of natural polyphenols in the cu ii pms process can significantly promote the degradation of tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa one of the most widely used brominated flame retardants in the ph range of 4 3 9 0 with gallic acid ga as a representative natural polyphenol the degradation of tbbpa by ga cu ii pms process reached 84 6 in 10 min at initial ph of 4 3 without ph adjustment which was 2 2 times higher than that by cu ii pms process multiple reactive oxidants including cu iii hydroxyl radical ho and singlet oxygen were generated in this process among which cu iii and ho contributed to tbbpa degradation with cu iii playing the dominant role ga accelerated the reduction of cu ii to cu i due to the strong chelation and electron donating capacity of ortho hydroxyl groups in ga and then cu i was quickly oxidized by pms to cu iii which can be further acid catalyzed to produce ho tbbpa transformation mainly proceeded through electron abstraction oxidative debromination and ring opening reaction pathways the feasibility of in situ utilizing natural organic matter nom enriched with polyphenol moieties to accelerate the degradation of tbbpa by cu ii pms process in surface water and wastewater was confirmed the findings of this study indicate that the coupling of nom and cu ii which are present in contaminated water or wastewater can potentially improve pms oxidation of ocs in a wide range of ph graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa peroxymonosulfate pms copper ion gallic acid natural organic matter nom water treatment 1 introduction tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa is one of the most widely used brominated flame retardants bfr substitute for hexabromocyclododecanes hbcd and poly brominated diphenyl ethers pbdes de wit 2002 its demand in the global market is over 170 000 tonnes which accounts for about 60 of the total bfr market share malkoske et al 2016a due to the improper disposal of tbbpa containing products such as plastics textiles and electronics schreder and la guardia 2014 tbbpa ultimately ends up in wastewaters however the conventional wastewater treatment processes such as screening grit removal sedimentation activated sludge and disinfection were initially designed to remove suspended solids bod5 and cod and they were not very effective in removing tbbpa ratola et al 2012 consequently tbbpa concentrations in wastewaters ranged from 28 3 to 174 3 ng l malkoske et al 2016b yang et al 2012 also found that the concentration of tbbpa in chao lake china was up to 4 87 μg l although no legislation is established to restrict the use of tbbpa it has been linked to toxic effects such as endocrine disruption neurotoxicity nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity yu et al 2019 given the massive use and toxicity of tbbpa it is urgently needed to develop effective techniques to eliminate tbbpa from contaminated water the activation of persulfate e g peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds to generate sulfate radical so4 or high valent metals has been found to effectively degrade refractory organic contaminants including tbbpa dong et al 2020 guo et al 2014 wang et al 2020c however most of the reported activation approaches are based on external addition of catalysts such as transition metals and carbonaceous materials wang et al 2020b yu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 which is costly and may cause secondary pollution note that some metal ions such as fe iii and cu ii are ubiquitous in surface water or wastewater for example the concentrations of cu ii in surface waters and wastewaters are in the ranges of 0 08 0 16 liaohe river and 0 5 1 2 µm respectively karvelas et al 2003 wang et al 2017b if the water matrix can be in situ utilized to trigger persulfate oxidation it will be more practical for future applications compared with fe iii cu ii has the advantages of higher reactivity and border ph working range and it has been widely used to activate h2o2 for sterilization kim et al 2015 nguyen et al 2013 recent studies also found that cu ii could be further activated by persulfate for contaminant abatement under certain conditions for example cu ii cefalexin cfx complex could be effectively activated by pds to induce rapid degradation of cfx mainly via cu iii reaction pathway chen et al 2019 the formation of cu iii was enhanced due to the increased electron density on cu ii after complexation with cfx which thus favored pds reduction to generate cu iii and radicals chen et al 2019 cu ii could also trigger pms oxidation of 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp and 1 4 dioxane 1 4 d but only in alkaline solutions wang et al 2020a it relied on the redox cycling of cu ii cu i to generate cu iii eqs 1 2 which was more selective than so4 wang et al 2020a the biggest drawback of cu ii pms process is the slow transformation of cu ii to cu i especially under acidic or neutral conditions wang et al 2020a which would greatly retard the degradation of target compound 1 cu ii hso 5 cu ii hso 5 cu i so 5 h 2 cu i hso 5 cu iii so 4 2 o h plant derived polyphenols typically those containing catechol or gallol moiety are one of the most important components of natural organic matter nom and are ubiquitous in natural water or wastewater box 1983 perron and brumaghim 2009 due to the strong electron donating capacity of oh on benzene ring these compounds are known as antioxidants e g radical scavenging in organisms lambert and elias 2010 perron and brumaghim 2009 in the co presence of copper and oxygen polyphenols would mediate the redox cycling of cu ii cu i and initiate some prooxidative reactions such as dna cleavage lipid peroxidation and escherichia coli inactivation hayakawa et al 1999 hoshino et al 1999 sahu and gray 1993 in this process cu ii was initially coordinated to the two ortho hydroxyl groups of polyphenol and then reduced to cu i which further reduced o2 to superoxide o2 and h2o2 through two electron transfer steps schweigert et al 2001 eqs 3 5 afterwards o2 and or cu i would react with h2o2 via the fenton like reactions to generate a variety of reactive oxygen species ros schweigert et al 2001 eqs 6 7 similar to the prooxidative reactions taking place in organisms we suspect that if polyphenol is added into cu ii pms process it would promote the redox cycling of cu ii cu i and accelerate pms activation furthermore polyphenols are important moieties in nom prevalent in water if polyphenols can accelerate cu ii pms process we may take the advantage of nom as polyphenol sources without additional dosing nevertheless the performance of polyphenol cu ii pms process in pollutant degradation hasn t been

primarily focus on i the evolution of ros ii the effects of crucial factors e g the concentrations of ga and cu ii ph and o2 iii the products and transformation pathways of tbbpa and iv the catalytic mechanism finally the performance of pms based advanced oxidation process aop was tested by in situ utilizing the cu ii and nom as polyphenol precursors in simulated water and real water samples it should be noted that relatively high doses of cu ii polyphenol and tbbpa were used in the kinetic and mechanism studies in order to track the reaction process environmental relevant levels were used

are presented in table s1 2 3 experimental procedures batch experiments were conducted in 15 ml brown vials containing 3 ml of the reaction solutions in dark briefly solutions of ga and cu ii were pre mixed and added to solutions containing tbbpa and pms to make a mixture containing 3 68 μm tbbpa 50 μm ga 50 μm cu ii and 2 mm pms the vials were sealed with teflon mininerts and placed on a reciprocating shaker 150 rpm at 25 1 c periodically an aliquot of the sample was taken out and immediately quenched with 0 1 ml 1 25 m na2s2o3 to avoid the adsorption of tbbpa on glassware 1 ml methanol meoh was added to the samples before hplc analysis note that the initial ph value was 4 3 0 2 due to the acidity of pms and slightly decreased to 3 85 0 02 during the reaction to identify the organic brominated products of tbbpa experiments were conducted as described above unless the solutions after reaction were analyzed by lc ms ms using a precursor ion scan pis approach gao et al 2016a all the experiments were conducted at least in triplicate to investigate the effects of cu ii and ga doses on tbbpa degradation different volumes of cu ii and ga stock solutions were mixed and then added to the bulk solution containing tbbpa and pms the ph values of pms tbbpa containing solutions were adjusted with 0 1 m naoh or h2so4 to 3 0 9 0 before ga cu ii mixture addition to evaluate the ph effect in some tests the reaction solutions were purged with n2 for 30 min to minimize the dissolved o2 to identify the reactive species 0 05 and 20 mm of meoh or tert butanol tba were used as scavengers to differentiate the role of radicals and nonradical oxidants further nitrobenzene nb and benzoic acid ba were used as probe compounds to evaluate the contributions of ho and cu iii on tbbpa degradation tests were also conducted using simulated water and real water samples the experimental procedures were the same as those of ga tests but with lower doses to reflect the environmental related conditions pms was dosed at 0 4 mm and tbbpa was spiked to the samples at 0 12 μm in some samples 1 μm cu ii and or 0 9 2 7 mgc l nom 1r108n purchased from ihss was spiked 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of tbbpa ga nb and ba were determined by hplc ultimatetm 3000 thermo fisher scientific inc usa equipped with a syncronis c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 µm thermo fisher

spectrophotometer shimadzu japan by the periodate colorimetric method λmax 415 nm which was shown in previous study wang et al 2020a multiple examinations were conducted to investigate the byproducts

was employed to detect ho so4 and 1o2 by using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp as spin trapping agents respectively briefly 0 45 ml of reaction

pms alone could barely degrade tbbpa in 10 min 4 5 at ph 4 3 being consistent with the previous results wu et al 2020 no tbbpa removal was observed in ga pms process cu ii could trigger pms oxidation and about 37 9 of tbbpa was degraded in 10 min reaction time the addition of ga to cu ii pms system however remarkably accelerated tbbpa degradation after 10 min reaction 84 6 of tbbpa was degraded in ga cu ii pms process which was 2 2 times higher than that in cu ii pms process as cu i regeneration is the rate limiting step in cu ii pms process such dramatic tbbpa degradation enhancement might be attributed to the efficient cu ii cu i cycle by ga note that similar tbbpa degradation trend was observed when ga and cu ii were separately added fig s1 which further suggests the reaction between ga and cu ii was extremely fast to check the role of ga in cu ii cu i cycle the degradation of tbbpa by cu i pms process with and without ga was also investigated as shown in fig s2 with the same concentration of copper 50 µm tbbpa was remarkably degraded to 25 by cu i pms process within 3 min and then the reaction almost terminated due to the rapid exhaustion of cu i and the slow transformation of cu ii to cu i in the presence of ga only 26 of tbbpa was degraded in 1 min and afterwards the tbbpa concentration did not significantly change this was because that ga was substantially destroyed by the massive ros produced and thus cut off the cu i recycle pathway comparatively although only 44 of tbbpa was degraded in the first minute of ga cu ii pms process due to lower cu i generated see section 3 5 the reaction proceeded steadily afterwards suggesting that the residual ga could sustainably promote cu ii cu i cycle 3 2 the role of reactive oxidant species to

lee et al 2014 xiang et al 2019 adducts respectively as shown in fig s3 a characteristic signal of tempn adduct was observed in all pms oxidation processes and its intensity in ga cu ii pms system was much higher than that in cu ii pms process the results confirm that 1o2 existed in cu ii pms based aop on the other hand no signals of dmpo so4 adduct were observed in any of the reaction processes suggesting so4 may not be formed during cu ii mediated pms oxidation fig 2a comparatively a dmpooh adduct signal was detected in both cu ii pms and ga cu ii pms processes indicating the existence of ho and or cu iii note that the signal intensity of dmpooh in ga cu ii pms was much higher than that in cu ii pms since dmpooh adduct could be formed from both ho and cu iii xiang et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 the reactive species were further identified by additional tests ho was reported to react with dmso ethanol and formic acid to generate secondary ch3 ch ch3 oh and coo radicals which can be trapped by dmpo to produce the corresponding epr signals of dmpoch3 ah 23 4 g an 16 4 g dmpoch ch3 oh ah 22 8 g an 15 8 g and dmpoooc ah 19 3 g an 15 9 g respectively lee et al 2014 zhu and shan 2009 zhu et al 2002 therefore the epr secondary radical spin trapping method was conducted by using superfluous dmso ethanol and formic acid 5 v v as ho quenchers as shown in fig 2b these quenchers significantly inhibited the evolution of dmpooh but no distinct epr signals of dmpoch3 dmpoch ch3 oh and dmpoooc were observed the results suggest that the formation of dmpooh adduct was mainly caused by cu iii oxidation the discrepancy among three quenchers on dmpooh inhibition might be attributed to the difference in their reactivity with cu iii for instance the reaction between cu iii and formic acid is relatively low at 1 0 0 1 107 m 1 s 1 xing et al 2018 although the rate constants for cu iii with dmso and ethanol have never been reported dmso usually reacts with strong oxidants through one electron transfer at 108 m 1 s 1 level kishore and asmus 1989 while the second order rate constant of cu iii with methanol is 2 8 0 5 107 m 1 s 1 meyerstein 1971 which may be referenced for ethanol the generated cu iii was further validated using periodate colorimetric method since it can react with periodate to form a stable cu iii periodate complex that has a characteristic absorbance at 415 nm wang et al 2020a as shown in fig 2c pms and cu ii alone had no absorbance at this wavelength a notable peak at 415 nm was observed in ga cu ii pms process while only a small bump was found in cu ii pms clearly ga significantly promoted the generation of cu iii in cu ii pms process to identify if ho was present in ga cu ii pms process nb was used as a probe compound as it can readily react with ho k 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 but barely react with cu iii feng et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 as shown in fig s4 the degradation efficiencies of nb in cu ii pms and ga cu ii pms processes were 4 and 36 respectively the above results indicate that 1o2 cu iii and ho were formed in cu ii pms and ga cu ii pms processes and ga significantly promoted their generation scavenging experiments using meoh and tba further verified the role of cu iii and ho in tbbpa degradation meoh and tba have distinct second order rate constants with so4 kso4 meoh 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 k so4 tba 4 9 5 105 m 1 s 1 but have comparable reaction rate constants with ho kho meoh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 kho tba 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 and cu iii kcu iii meoh 4 9 1 107 m 1 s 1 kcu iii tba 1 0 4 107 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 meyerstein 1971 neta et al 1988 as shown in fig 2d 0 05 mm of meoh and tba had similar inhibition effects on tbbpa degradation 40 removal the results again suggest the negligible role of so4 being consistent with the epr results further increasing the concentrations of meoh and tba to 20 mm totally terminated tbbpa degradation presumably due to the complete scavenging of ho and cu iii to probe the contribution of ho 0 2 μm of nb was added with tbbpa and results show that 80 was degraded in ga cu ii pms process in 10 min while only 5 and 20 were oxidized in pms and cu ii pms processes respectively fig s5 based on the reaction rate constant between ho and tbbpa 1 16 109 m 1 s 1 he et al 2016b and the calculated steady state concentration of ho 5 82 10 13 m the proportion of tbbpa degradation by ho could roughly be 20 details provided in text s3 additionally given that the addition of 20 mm meoh and tba completely terminated tbbpa degradation which was contrary to the fact that 1o2 has low reactivity with meoh 3 0 103 m 1 s 1 and tba 1 8 103 m 1 s 1 yang et al 2018 the role of 1o2 in tbbpa degradation was excluded thus cu iii was the dominant oxidant contributing to tbbpa degradation accounting for 80 in ga cu ii pms process furthermore we found that the degradation of tbbpa was inhibited with the increase of nb concentration fig s6 the addition of 500 μm nb almost completely inhibited tbbpa degradation though nb did not react with cu iii xiang et al 2019 noting that the reaction between cu ii and pms could not form ho as negligible nb was degraded fig s4 the marked ho production in ga cu ii pms process should be ascribed to cu iii hydrolysis eq 8 feng et al 2019 pham et al 2013 excessive nb quickly consumed ho which may facilitate forward reaction and thereby completely inhibit tbbpa degradation at high nb concentrations 8 cu iii cu ii h o h to conclude cu iii and ho were the reactive oxidant species leading to tbbpa degradation in ga cu ii pms process cu iii was the dominant oxidant and ho was mainly from cu iii hydrolysis 3 3 factors affecting tbbpa degradation in ga cu ii pms process fig 3 shows that the performance of ga cu ii pms process was highly affected by the concentrations of cu ii and ga when ga concentration was fixed at 50 μm the degradation of tbbpa was dramatically promoted as cu ii increased from 0 to 50 μm however further increasing cu ii concentration to 100 μm significantly retarded the oxidation process resulting in 48 1 of tbbpa removal in 10 min similarly after fixing cu ii concentration at 50 μm the rate of tbbpa degradation increased with increasing ga from 0 to 50 μm after which tbbpa degradation significantly decreased the results indicate that the optimal tbbpa degradation was obtained at ga to cu ii molar ratio of 1 1 this was consistent with the findings of oess et al 1999 who reported that cu ii mainly coordinated to ga to form a mono bidentate complex at ph 6 0 note that the complexation of cu ii with ga is a prerequisite for the subsequent one electron transfer from ga to cu ii schweigert et al 2001 the effect of solution ph on tbbpa degradation is presented in fig 3c only 20 of tbbpa was removed at ph 3 0 after 10 min the amount removed dramatically increased reaching 84 6 in 10 min at ph 4 3 and then slightly decreased to 70 at ph 5 0 thereafter the tbbpa degradation further increased with the increase of ph resulting in 100 removal in 10 min at ph 9 0 the effect of ph on tbbpa degradation could be interpreted by the speciation of ga cu iii and tbbpa at different phs ga has pka values of 4 26 5 87 8 93 and 11 48 in the presence of cu ii oess et al 1999 at ph 3 0 ga is present in its protonated form rendering it unfavorable to chelating with cu ii to generate cu i which is a prerequisite for pms reduction and cu iii formation with ph increasing to 4 3 ga began to dissociate and thus promoted cu i generation the reactivity of cu iii highly depends on ph with ph increasing cu iii would change from cu3 to cu oh 2 pka 3 7 cu oh 2 pka 4 8 cu oh 3 and or cu oh 4 pka 5 feng et al 2019 johnson et al 1985 the more hydroxyl bound in cu iii was generally related to weaker reactivity lee et al 2016 therefore tbbpa degradation rate was significantly decreased when ph increased from 4 3 to 5 0 further increasing the solution ph tbbpa began to dissociate pka 7 5 8 5 into tbbpa and tbbpa2 t malkoske et al 2016 which were more susceptible to be oxidized by various oxidants such as pms wu et al 2020 hocl gao et al 2016a ho wang et al 2017a and probably cu iii the results show good tbbpa degradation 70 in 10 min could be achieved in ga cu ii pms process in the ph range of 4 3 to 9 0 which was obviously wider than that obtained in pms 6 0 8 0 or cu ii pms 7 0 processes after reaction for 10 min the ph values gradually decreased from 3 0 4 3 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 to 2 91 3 85 3 57 4 96 and 7 66 respectively table s2 overall ga introduction not only improved the oxidation performance of cu ii pms process but extended its working ph range making it more suitable for in situ chemical oxidation isco oxygen had a positive effect on tbbpa degradation in the ga cu ii pms process fig 3d compared to the removal efficiency obtained in air saturated solution 84 6 only 47 4 of tbbpa was eliminated in the deoxygenated solution in 10 min the results suggest that dissolved oxygen was involved in ros evolution and promoted the generation of ho and or cu iii this might be due to the buildup of additional cu iii and ho production pathway kim et al 2015 reported that the combination of cu ii with hydroxylamine ha in situ generated h2o2 by reducing dissolved oxygen subsequently producing cu iii and ho through the reaction of cu i with h2o2 similar to ha ga also could accelerate the in situ generation of h2o2 by promoting the redox cycling of cu ii cu i eqs 4 7 and 9 nkhili et al 2014 additionally the reaction of ga with dissolved oxygen was reported to serve as a source of h2o2 for fenton like reaction and the presence of cu ii could accelerate h2o2 generation hayakawa et al 2004 nkhili et al 2014 overall although o2 would compete with pms for cu i it could build up an additional and possibly more efficient pathway kcu i h2o2 4 105 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 8 lee et al 2016 to produce cu iii and ho simultaneously promoting the turnover frequency of cu ii cu i 9 g a c u i i g a c u i i q u i n o n e c u i 3 4 oxidation products and pathways the mass balance of br was recorded by summating the concentrations of br bro3 and total organic bromine tobr as shown in fig s7 br was released with reaction proceeding which gradually reached 2 4 μm in 10 min accounting for 16 of total br this indicates that oxidative debromination occurred in ga cu ii pms process note that a small quantity of br generated was further oxidized to bro3 presumably due to the powerful oxidative activity of cu iii or ho about 75 of bromine still existed in organic form the transformation products of tbbpa were further identified by lc ms ms using the bromine precursor ion scan set at m z 79 and 81 the peak of tbbpa rt 19 36 min decreased with the formation of new peaks as time prolonged fig s8 a total of 8 intermediates were identified and their mass spectra data were shown in table s3 and fig s9 products 1 3 were the debrominated and hydroxylated products of tbbpa product 1 was eluted at 15 84 min with molecular ions of m z 462 464 466 468 and was assigned to tri bromobisphenol a it would be further hydroxylated to product 2 3 bromo 5 1 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxy phenyl 1 methyl ethyl benzene 1 2 diol product 3 was eluted at 12 14 min with molecular ions of m z 400 402 404 and br isotopic abundance ratio of 1 2 1 indicating the formation of a dibromo compound which was proposed to be 4 1 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxy phenyl 1 methyl ethyl benzene 1 2 diol products 4 5 were isomers as they had similar molecular ions and br isotopic patterns but different retention times these compounds were deduced as the ring opened products of tbbpa products 6 8 were formed from cleavage between the isopropyl group and the benzene ring and identified as 2 6 dibromo 4 isopropyl phenol 2 6 dibromo 4 2 2 hydroxy 4 hydroxymethyl phenoxy propan 2 yl phenol and 2 6 dibromo benzene 1 4 diol respectively among them products 6 and 8 were commonly detected in ho mediated oxidation process he et al 2016 wang et al 2017a zhong et al 2012 based on the detected products the transformation pathways of tbbpa were proposed as shown in fig s10 tbbpa transformation by ga cu ii pms process mainly proceeded through two routes one electron abstraction of the phenolic group route 1 and sequential debromination hydroxylation followed by ring opening route 2 the first route was initiated by one electron transfer from one of the hydroxyl groups to ho or cu iii forming a phenoxy radical r1 which was stabilized by resonance to form r2 feng et al 2013a pang et al 2014 r2 was quickly split to yield p6 and r3 through β scission the bond cleavage between the benzene group and the isopropyl group p7 could be formed from the coupling of p6 and its substituted intermediate r3 may undergo hydroxylation to produce p8 additionally tbbpa would be subjected to a series of debromination and hydroxylation reactions to produce p1 p2 and p3 subsequently these products were further oxidized to form ring opened products p4 and p5 the electron abstraction and debromination reactions have been commonly observed in the degradation of tbbpa by ho he et al 2016 zhong et al 2012 while ring opening pathways were rarely reported and might be ascribed to cu iii oxidation 3 5 reaction mechanisms it was reported that cu iii production in cu ii h2o2 and cu ii pms processes was mediated by the redox cycling of cu ii cu i couple lee et al 2016 wang et al 2020a specifically cu ii was firstly reduced by hso5 to cu i which then rapidly reduced another hso5 to produce cu iii eqs 1 2 wang et al 2020a to verify whether ga addition altered the reaction pathway of cu ii pms oxidation bc serving as a chelating agent for cu i log β2 18 8 zhang et al 2010 was added to ga cu ii pms process as fig s11 shows the degradation of tbbpa was completely inhibited by bc even when extending the reaction time to 60 min which implies the same reaction pathway involving cu i oxidation to cu iii thus the initial transformation of cu ii to cu i was vitally important cu ii was reported to coordinate with the ortho hydroxyl group of ga to form an inner sphere complex subsequently cu ii was reduced to cu i and the ga ligand was oxidized into quinone nkhili et al 2014 oess et al 1999 schweigert et al 2001 eq 9 thus cu i evolution and ga decay in different reaction processes were determined fig s12 no obvious cu i was detected in cu ii pms process due to the weak copper reduction capacity of hso5 eq 1 when cu ii was mixed with ga 17 μm of cu ii was reduced to cu i and 15 of ga 7 5 μm was simultaneously oxidized fig s12 after pms addition the generated cu i was quickly oxidized by pms leading to no cu i detection throughout the reaction period such phenomenon was also observed in wang et al 2020a presumably due to the higher oxidation rate of cu i by pms than its generation rate meanwhile the oxidation proportion of ga further increased to 50 in 1 min and gradually increased to 95 in 10 min to investigate the role of quinone one of the oxidation products of ga eq 9 1 4 benzoquinone 1 4 bq was added to cu ii pms process and its effect on tbbpa degradation was investigated results show that only 20 of tbbpa was degraded in 1 4 bq cu ii pms process in 10 min fig s13 suggesting that the oxidized quinone could not mediate cu ii reduction but compete with tbbpa for the generated ros on the other hand ga would be partially oxidized by cu iii and or ho since it is easily electrophilically attacked caregnato et al 2008 fontecha cámara et al 2016 even so the residual ga could still promote tbbpa degradation through assisting in cu ii cu i cycle to further explore the reactions taking place in ga cu ii pms process spectrographic experiments were conducted as shown in fig s14 ga displayed two adsorption peaks at 213 and 263 nm pan et al 2020 after reaction with cu ii the adsorption peak at 213 nm slightly decreased indicating ga was partially oxidized by cu ii with pms present the peak at 263 nm bathochromic shifted to 268 nm which might be due to the formation of a temporary ga cu hso5 complex similar phenomenon was observed in the reaction between h2o2 and catechin cu ii complex hayakawa et al 2004 nkhili et al 2014 note that both the two characteristic peaks gradually decreased with reaction time prolonging indicating that ga was oxidized with the concomitant formation of cu iii as ca ii and mg ii ubiquitously exist in natural waters and can also form complex with polyphenols their effects on ga cu ii pms oxidation were evaluated results show that tbbpa degradation was inhibited by 30 in the presence of 0 5 mm ca ii or mg ii fig s15 which further confirms that complexation between cu ii and ga was of great importance for the subsequent cu ii reduction on the basis of the above results and published literatures a possible mechanism for tbbpa degradation by ga cu ii pms process was proposed scheme 1 as shown cu ii might be reduced by hso5 eq 1 but this reaction proceeded very slowly because the redox potential of hso5 so5 is much higher than that of cu ii cu i 1 1 v vs 0 17 v wang et al 2020a upon ga addition cu ii quickly coordinated with the two hydroxyl groups of the catechol then the ga cu ii complex underwent a ligand to metal electron transfer to produce cu i and ga type quinone ga q eq 9 nkhili et al 2014 schweigert et al 2001 once cu i was formed it was rapidly oxidized by pms to cu iii eq 2 under aerobic condition the generated cu i could also trigger oxygenation via a series of single electron transfer reactions to produce cu iii and ho eqs 4 7 feng et al 2017 kim et al 2015 meanwhile a small amount of cu iii would be acid catalyzed to produce the secondary ho eq 8 pham et al 2013 it should be noted that the resulting ga q could also activate pms to promote the generation of 1o2 zhou et al 2015 though it could not effectively degrade tbbpa over the time scale of this study due to the weak oxidation capacity of 1o2 consequently both cu iii and ho contributed to tbbpa degradation and cu iii played the dominant role ho could oxidize tbbpa via electron abstraction and debromination reactions while cu iii oxidized tbbpa via ring opening pathways moreover cu ii generated from cu iii oxidation of tbbpa would be further reduced by another ga thus sustaining the cu ii cu i cycling and improving tbbpa degradation overall cu i generation was the key step to manipulate the ga cu ii pms process in which ga served as electron donor and cu ii keep shuttling the electron to pms or o2 3 6 pms induced tbbpa degradation using cu ii and nom present in water to degrade tbbpa it is technically infeasible to add polyphenols to water instead nom in water can serve as the natural source of polyphenols and cu ii is often present at trace levels in water to evaluate if pms can induce tbbpa degradation in environmental related conditions the tests were conducted in simulated water and real water samples with results presented in fig 4 nom alone could not activate pms for tbbpa oxidation the degradation of tbbpa by cu ii catalyzed pms proceeded slowly 37 in 30 min interestingly the degradation rates of tbbpa increased by 25 and 45 in the presence of 0 9 mgc l and 1 8 mgc l of nom respectively but excessive dosage of nom e g 2 7 mgc l would compete for cu iii and ho and thereby retarded tbbpa degradation fig 4a in the surface water sample of bj1 1 74 mgc l the degradation of tbbpa was negligible with the addition of 0 4 mm pms owing to the low concentration of cu ii in this water sample 2 24 0 04 μg l table s1 after additional dose of 1 μm cu ii 63 5 μg l more than 80 of tbbpa was degraded in 30 min in the bj2 sample with low concentration of nom 0 37 mgc l 31 of tbbpa was degraded after dosing 0 4 mm pms and 1 μm cu ii tbbpa degradation reached 80 after adding 1 8 mgc l nom to bj2 for wastewater sample ws1 the addition of pms led to negligible tbbpa degradation despite the higher cu ii concentration 13 78 μg l and doc 3 36 mg l than bj1 fig 4c but tbbpa dramatically decreased by 98 1 in 60 min with additional 1 μm cu ii added fig 4c in ws2 bearing low doc 0 69 mg l cu ii inherent in the wastewater can still trigger pms decomposition to degrade 30 of tbbpa after dosing 1 μm cu ii in ws2 100 of tbbpa removal was obtained in 60 min it should be noted that tbbpa can be substantially degraded even when high contents of ca ii and mg ii exists in real waters table s1 suggesting the catalytic mechanism of nom might be different from ga possibly due to the co existence of various redox active moieties such as thiols and nitrogen functional groups daugherty et al 2017 more importantly no carcinogenic bro3 were observed during the treatment of real water samples fig s16 which might be attributed to the scavenging of reactive bromine species e g br br2 and hobr obr by nom to produce organic brominated oxidation products since no br detected either similar inhibition of nom on bro3 formation has been observed in persulfate based aops guan et al 2020 nevertheless further studies with respect to the toxicity evaluation of finished water are needed overall the results clearly confirmed that nom in surface water or wastewater can effectively promote the degradation of tbbpa by cu ii mediated pms oxidation meanwhile the concentration of cu ii need to reach sufficient levels perhaps at sub micromolar levels to effectively trigger pms oxidation thus direct dosing of pms can abate the degradation of tbbpa and maybe other ocs by taking advantage of cu ii and nom present in water or wastewater but the treatment efficiency is highly dependent on the concentrations of cu ii and nom 4 conclusions the coupling of cu ii and gallic acid ga a representative of polyphenol could effectively trigger pms oxidation of tbbpa in a ph range of 4 3 9 0 in this ga cu ii pms system cu iii ho and 1o2 were generated and cu iii contributed dominantly to tbbpa degradation the oxidation performance of ga cu ii pms process depended on the rate of cu ii reduction to cu i and the catalysis of cu i ga accelerated the transformation of cu ii to cu i which quickly reduced pms to produce cu iii and ho with o2 present cu i could also mediate oxygenation to promote the generation of cu iii and ho tbbpa transformation mainly proceeded via one electron abstraction of the phenolic group and sequential debromination hydroxylation followed by ring opening nom exhibited the similar performance as ga could also promote tbbpa degradation by cu ii pms process the degradation of tbbpa in simulated and real water samples suggest the potential application of this process by making use of the cu ii and nom present in water but the concentrations of cu ii and nom will greatly impact the effectiveness of the process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

17528,copper ion cu ii in water or wastewater has been reported to trigger peroxymonosulfate pms oxidation of organic contaminants ocs however this process can only work in alkaline condition which limits its potential application in this study we found that the introduction of natural polyphenols in the cu ii pms process can significantly promote the degradation of tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa one of the most widely used brominated flame retardants in the ph range of 4 3 9 0 with gallic acid ga as a representative natural polyphenol the degradation of tbbpa by ga cu ii pms process reached 84 6 in 10 min at initial ph of 4 3 without ph adjustment which was 2 2 times higher than that by cu ii pms process multiple reactive oxidants including cu iii hydroxyl radical ho and singlet oxygen were generated in this process among which cu iii and ho contributed to tbbpa degradation with cu iii playing the dominant role ga accelerated the reduction of cu ii to cu i due to the strong chelation and electron donating capacity of ortho hydroxyl groups in ga and then cu i was quickly oxidized by pms to cu iii which can be further acid catalyzed to produce ho tbbpa transformation mainly proceeded through electron abstraction oxidative debromination and ring opening reaction pathways the feasibility of in situ utilizing natural organic matter nom enriched with polyphenol moieties to accelerate the degradation of tbbpa by cu ii pms process in surface water and wastewater was confirmed the findings of this study indicate that the coupling of nom and cu ii which are present in contaminated water or wastewater can potentially improve pms oxidation of ocs in a wide range of ph graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa peroxymonosulfate pms copper ion gallic acid natural organic matter nom water treatment 1 introduction tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa is one of the most widely used brominated flame retardants bfr substitute for hexabromocyclododecanes hbcd and poly brominated diphenyl ethers pbdes de wit 2002 its demand in the global market is over 170 000 tonnes which accounts for about 60 of the total bfr market share malkoske et al 2016a due to the improper disposal of tbbpa containing products such as plastics textiles and electronics schreder and la guardia 2014 tbbpa ultimately ends up in wastewaters however the conventional wastewater treatment processes such as screening grit removal sedimentation activated sludge and disinfection were initially designed to remove suspended solids bod5 and cod and they were not very effective in removing tbbpa ratola et al 2012 consequently tbbpa concentrations in wastewaters ranged from 28 3 to 174 3 ng l malkoske et al 2016b yang et al 2012 also found that the concentration of tbbpa in chao lake china was up to 4 87 μg l although no legislation is established to restrict the use of tbbpa it has been linked to toxic effects such as endocrine disruption neurotoxicity nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity yu et al 2019 given the massive use and toxicity of tbbpa it is urgently needed to develop effective techniques to eliminate tbbpa from contaminated water the activation of persulfate e g peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds to generate sulfate radical so4 or high valent metals has been found to effectively degrade refractory organic contaminants including tbbpa dong et al 2020 guo et al 2014 wang et al 2020c however most of the reported activation approaches are based on external addition of catalysts such as transition metals and carbonaceous materials wang et al 2020b yu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 which is costly and may cause secondary pollution note that some metal ions such as fe iii and cu ii are ubiquitous in surface water or wastewater for example the concentrations of cu ii in surface waters and wastewaters are in the ranges of 0 08 0 16 liaohe river and 0 5 1 2 µm respectively karvelas et al 2003 wang et al 2017b if the water matrix can be in situ utilized to trigger persulfate oxidation it will be more practical for future applications compared with fe iii cu ii has the advantages of higher reactivity and border ph working range and it has been widely used to activate h2o2 for sterilization kim et al 2015 nguyen et al 2013 recent studies also found that cu ii could be further activated by persulfate for contaminant abatement under certain conditions for example cu ii cefalexin cfx complex could be effectively activated by pds to induce rapid degradation of cfx mainly via cu iii reaction pathway chen et al 2019 the formation of cu iii was enhanced due to the increased electron density on cu ii after complexation with cfx which thus favored pds reduction to generate cu iii and radicals chen et al 2019 cu ii could also trigger pms oxidation of 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp and 1 4 dioxane 1 4 d but only in alkaline solutions wang et al 2020a it relied on the redox cycling of cu ii cu i to generate cu iii eqs 1 2 which was more selective than so4 wang et al 2020a the biggest drawback of cu ii pms process is the slow transformation of cu ii to cu i especially under acidic or neutral conditions wang et al 2020a which would greatly retard the degradation of target compound 1 cu ii hso 5 cu ii hso 5 cu i so 5 h 2 cu i hso 5 cu iii so 4 2 o h plant derived polyphenols typically those containing catechol or gallol moiety are one of the most important components of natural organic matter nom and are ubiquitous in natural water or wastewater box 1983 perron and brumaghim 2009 due to the strong electron donating capacity of oh on benzene ring these compounds are known as antioxidants e g radical scavenging in organisms lambert and elias 2010 perron and brumaghim 2009 in the co presence of copper and oxygen polyphenols would mediate the redox cycling of cu ii cu i and initiate some prooxidative reactions such as dna cleavage lipid peroxidation and escherichia coli inactivation hayakawa et al 1999 hoshino et al 1999 sahu and gray 1993 in this process cu ii was initially coordinated to the two ortho hydroxyl groups of polyphenol and then reduced to cu i which further reduced o2 to superoxide o2 and h2o2 through two electron transfer steps schweigert et al 2001 eqs 3 5 afterwards o2 and or cu i would react with h2o2 via the fenton like reactions to generate a variety of reactive oxygen species ros schweigert et al 2001 eqs 6 7 similar to the prooxidative reactions taking place in organisms we suspect that if polyphenol is added into cu ii pms process it would promote the redox cycling of cu ii cu i and accelerate pms activation furthermore polyphenols are important moieties in nom prevalent in water if polyphenols can accelerate cu ii pms process we may take the advantage of nom as polyphenol sources without additional dosing nevertheless the performance of polyphenol cu ii pms process in pollutant degradation hasn t been

should be noted that relatively high doses of cu ii polyphenol and tbbpa were used in the kinetic and mechanism studies in order to track the reaction process environmental relevant levels were used in simulated water and real water tests to evaluate the potential application 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals were of reagent grade or higher and used as received unless otherwise specified details were provided in text s1 2 2 synesthetic water and real water samples a simulated water sample sw was prepared in ultrapure water spiking with 1 mm nahco3 0 5 mm cacl2 15 mm naclo4 and nom and then adjusted to ph 7 0 a surface water bj1 and a wastewater sample ws1 were respectively collected from beijiang river guangdong china and the effluent of secondary sedimentation tank of a wastewater treatment plant in foshan city guangdong china which were then filtered through 0 45 μm glass fiber membranes jinteng china portions of the bj1 and ws1 samples were further treated by passing through coconut charcoal columns cnw technologies gmbh germany to remove nom and the resultant samples were referred to as bj2 and ws2 respectively the characteristics of these water samples are presented in table s1 2 3 experimental procedures batch experiments were conducted in 15 ml brown vials containing 3 ml of the reaction solutions in dark briefly solutions of ga and cu ii were pre mixed and added to solutions containing tbbpa and pms to make a mixture containing 3 68 μm tbbpa 50 μm ga 50 μm cu ii and 2 mm pms the vials were sealed with teflon mininerts and placed on a reciprocating shaker 150 rpm at 25 1 c periodically an aliquot of the sample was taken out and immediately quenched with 0 1 ml 1 25 m na2s2o3 to avoid the adsorption of tbbpa on glassware 1 ml methanol meoh was added to the samples before hplc analysis note that the initial ph value was 4 3 0 2 due to the acidity of pms and slightly decreased to 3 85 0 02 during the reaction to identify the organic brominated products of tbbpa experiments were conducted as described above unless the solutions after reaction were analyzed by lc ms ms using a precursor ion scan pis approach gao et al 2016a all the experiments were conducted at least in triplicate to investigate the effects of cu ii and ga doses on tbbpa degradation different volumes of cu ii and ga stock solutions were mixed and then added to the bulk solution containing tbbpa and pms the ph values of pms tbbpa containing solutions were adjusted with 0 1 m naoh or h2so4 to 3 0 9 0 before ga cu ii mixture addition to evaluate the ph effect in some tests the reaction solutions were purged with n2 for 30 min to minimize the dissolved o2 to identify the reactive species 0 05 and 20 mm of meoh or tert butanol tba were used as scavengers to differentiate the role of radicals and nonradical oxidants further nitrobenzene nb and benzoic acid ba were used as probe compounds to evaluate the contributions of ho and cu iii on tbbpa degradation tests were also conducted using simulated water and real water samples the experimental procedures were the same as those of ga tests but with lower doses to reflect the environmental related conditions pms was dosed at 0 4 mm and tbbpa was spiked to the samples at 0 12 μm in some samples 1 μm cu ii and or 0 9 2 7 mgc l nom 1r108n purchased from ihss was spiked 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of tbbpa ga nb and ba were determined by hplc ultimatetm 3000 thermo fisher scientific inc usa equipped with a syncronis c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 µm thermo fisher and a dad detector the mobile phases and the detection wavelengths were set as follows methanol and 0 1 acetic acid water 85 15 v v with λ 220 nm for tbbpa acetonitrile and 0 1 phosphoric acid water 8

ml min cu i concentrations were spectrophotometrically determined using a uv 1800 spectrophotometer shimadzu japan by a modified bathocuproine bc method moffett et al 1985 briefly 3 ml of reaction solution was mixed with an equal volume of bc solution containing 0 6 mm bc and 1 5 mm edta then the mixture absorbance was measured at 484 nm in 10 min cu iii was determined on a uv 1800 spectrophotometer shimadzu japan by the periodate colorimetric method λmax 415 nm which was shown in previous study wang et al 2020a multiple examinations were conducted to investigate the byproducts of tbbpa the concentrations of bromide and bromate ions were determined by a dionex ics 600 ion chromatograph equipped with an anionic column as19 dionex ionpac usa samples for total organic bromine tobr analysis were enriched on activated carbon columns mounted on an automatic preparation unit 2 txa 03 mitsubishi chemical analytech co ltd japan the accumulated tobr was then transformed to hbr through combustion at 1000 c and collected in ultrapure water for ic determination wu et al 2020 the other products were identified by an agilent liquid chromatograph 1290 infinity ii coupled with an ab sciex triple quadtm 5500 ms ms system ab sciex pte ltd usa the details of analytical methods were provided in text s2 an electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer bruker a300 10 12 germany was employed to detect ho so4 and 1o2 by using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp as spin trapping agents respectively briefly 0 45 ml of reaction solution was mixed with 50 µl of 880 mm dmpo or temp solution and suck up by a quartz capillary tube for epr measurement the epr spectra were recorded under the following conditions microwave power 5

pms alone could barely degrade tbbpa in 10 min 4 5 at ph 4 3 being consistent with the previous results wu et al 2020 no tbbpa removal was observed in ga pms process cu ii could trigger pms oxidation and about 37 9 of tbbpa was degraded in 10 min reaction time the addition of ga to cu ii pms system however remarkably accelerated tbbpa degradation after 10 min reaction 84 6 of tbbpa was degraded in ga cu ii pms process which was 2 2 times higher than that in cu ii pms process as cu i regeneration is the rate limiting step in cu ii pms process such dramatic tbbpa degradation enhancement might be attributed to the efficient cu ii cu i cycle by ga note that similar tbbpa degradation trend was observed when ga and cu ii were separately added fig s1 which further suggests the reaction between ga and cu ii was extremely fast to check the role of ga in cu ii cu i cycle the degradation of tbbpa by cu i pms process with and without ga was also investigated as shown in fig s2 with the same concentration of copper 50 µm tbbpa was remarkably degraded to 25 by cu i pms process within 3 min and then the reaction almost terminated due to the rapid exhaustion of cu i and the slow transformation of cu ii to cu i in the presence of ga only 26 of tbbpa was degraded in 1 min and afterwards the tbbpa concentration did not significantly change this was because that ga was substantially destroyed by the massive ros produced and thus cut off the cu i recycle pathway comparatively although only 44 of tbbpa was degraded in the first minute of ga cu ii pms process due to lower cu i generated see section 3 5 the reaction proceeded steadily afterwards suggesting that the residual ga could sustainably promote cu ii cu i cycle 3 2 the role of reactive oxidant species to identify the residual ros epr experiments with temp and dmpo as spin trapping agents were conducted temp readily reacts with 1o2 to form a typical three line 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol n oxyl tempn adduct an 16 9 g zhu et al 2019 while dmpo reacts with so4 and ho cu iii to produce the distinct dmpo so4 an 13 2 g ah β 9 6 g ah γ1 1 48 g ah γ2 0 78 g zhou et al 2018 and dmpooh an ah β 14 9 g lee et al 2014 xiang et al 2019 adducts respectively as shown in fig s3 a characteristic signal of tempn adduct was observed in all pms oxidation processes and its intensity in ga cu ii pms system was much higher than that in cu ii pms process the results confirm that 1o2 existed in cu ii pms based aop on the other hand no signals of dmpo so4 adduct were observed in any of the reaction processes suggesting so4 may not be formed during cu ii mediated pms oxidation fig 2a comparatively a dmpooh adduct signal was detected in both cu ii pms and ga cu ii pms processes indicating the existence of ho and or cu iii note that the signal intensity of dmpooh in ga cu ii pms was much higher than that in cu ii pms since dmpooh adduct could be formed from both ho and cu iii xiang et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 the reactive species were further identified by additional tests ho was reported to react with dmso ethanol and formic acid to generate secondary ch3 ch ch3 oh and coo radicals which can be trapped by dmpo to produce the corresponding epr signals of dmpoch3 ah 23 4 g an 16 4 g dmpoch ch3 oh ah 22 8 g an 15 8 g and dmpoooc ah 19 3 g an 15 9 g respectively lee et al 2014 zhu and shan 2009 zhu et al 2002 therefore the epr secondary radical spin trapping method was conducted by using superfluous dmso ethanol and formic acid 5 v v as ho quenchers as shown in fig 2b these quenchers significantly inhibited the evolution of dmpooh but no distinct epr signals of dmpoch3 dmpoch ch3 oh and dmpoooc were observed the results suggest that the formation of dmpooh adduct was mainly caused by cu iii oxidation the discrepancy among three quenchers on dmpooh inhibition might be attributed to the difference in their reactivity with cu iii for instance the reaction between cu iii and formic acid is relatively low at 1 0 0 1 107 m 1 s 1 xing et al 2018 although the rate constants for cu iii with dmso and ethanol have never been reported dmso usually reacts with strong oxidants through one electron transfer at 108 m 1 s 1 level kishore and asmus 1989 while the second order rate constant of cu iii with methanol is 2 8 0 5 107 m 1 s 1 meyerstein 1971 which may be referenced for ethanol the generated cu iii was further validated using periodate colorimetric method since it can react with periodate to form a stable cu iii periodate complex that has a characteristic absorbance at 415 nm wang et al 2020a as shown in fig 2c pms and cu ii alone had no absorbance at this wavelength a notable peak at 415 nm was observed in ga cu ii pms process while only a small bump was found in cu ii pms clearly ga significantly promoted the generation of cu iii in cu ii pms process to identify if ho was present in ga cu ii pms process nb was used as a probe compound as it can readily react with ho k 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 but barely react with cu iii feng et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 as shown in fig s4 the degradation efficiencies of nb in cu ii pms and ga cu ii pms processes were 4 and 36 respectively the above results indicate that 1o2 cu iii and ho were formed in cu ii pms and ga cu ii pms processes and ga significantly promoted their generation scavenging experiments using meoh and tba further verified the role of cu iii and ho in tbbpa degradation meoh and tba have distinct second order rate constants with so4 kso4 meoh 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 k so4 tba 4 9 5 105 m 1 s 1 but have comparable reaction rate constants with ho kho meoh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 kho tba 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 and cu iii kcu iii meoh 4 9 1 107 m 1 s 1 kcu iii tba 1 0 4 107 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 meyerstein 1971 neta et al 1988 as shown in fig 2d 0 05 mm of meoh and tba had similar inhibition effects on tbbpa degradation 40 removal the results again suggest the negligible role of so4 being consistent with the epr results further increasing the concentrations of meoh and tba to 20 mm totally terminated tbbpa degradation presumably due to the complete scavenging of ho and cu iii to probe the contribution of ho 0 2 μm of nb was added with tbbpa and results show that 80 was degraded in ga cu ii pms process in 10 min while only 5 and 20 were oxidized in pms and cu ii pms processes respectively fig s5 based on the reaction rate constant between ho and tbbpa 1 16 109 m 1 s 1 he et al 2016b and the calculated steady state concentration of ho 5 82 10 13 m the proportion of tbbpa degradation by ho could roughly be 20 details provided in text s3 additionally given that the addition of 20 mm meoh and tba completely terminated tbbpa degradation which was contrary to the fact that 1o2 has low reactivity with meoh 3 0 103 m 1 s 1 and tba 1 8 103 m 1 s 1 yang et al 2018 the role of 1o2 in tbbpa degradation was excluded thus cu iii was the dominant oxidant contributing to tbbpa degradation accounting for 80 in ga cu ii pms process furthermore we found that the degradation of tbbpa was inhibited with the increase of nb concentration fig s6 the addition of 500 μm nb almost completely inhibited tbbpa degradation though nb did not react with cu iii xiang et al 2019 noting that the reaction between cu ii and pms could not form ho as negligible nb was degraded fig s4 the marked ho production in ga cu ii pms process should be ascribed to cu iii hydrolysis eq 8 feng et al 2019 pham et al 2013 excessive nb quickly consumed ho which may facilitate forward reaction and thereby completely inhibit tbbpa degradation at high nb concentrations 8 cu iii cu ii h o h to conclude cu iii and ho were the reactive oxidant species leading to tbbpa degradation in ga cu ii pms process cu iii was the dominant oxidant and ho was mainly from cu iii hydrolysis 3 3 factors affecting tbbpa degradation in ga cu ii pms process fig 3 shows that the performance of ga cu ii pms process was highly affected by the concentrations of cu ii and ga when ga concentration was fixed at 50 μm the degradation of tbbpa was dramatically promoted as cu ii increased from 0 to 50 μm however further increasing cu ii concentration to 100 μm significantly retarded the oxidation process resulting in 48 1 of tbbpa removal in 10 min similarly after fixing cu ii concentration at 50 μm the rate of tbbpa degradation increased with increasing ga from 0 to 50 μm after which tbbpa degradation significantly decreased the results indicate that the optimal tbbpa degradation was obtained at ga to cu ii molar ratio of 1 1 this was consistent with the findings of oess et al 1999 who reported that cu ii mainly coordinated to ga to form a mono bidentate complex at ph 6 0 note that the complexation of cu ii with ga is a prerequisite for the subsequent one electron transfer from ga to cu ii schweigert et al 2001 the effect of solution ph on tbbpa degradation is presented in fig 3c only 20 of tbbpa was removed at ph 3 0 after 10 min the amount removed dramatically increased reaching 84 6 in 10 min at ph 4 3 and then slightly decreased to 70 at ph 5 0 thereafter the tbbpa degradation further increased with the increase of ph resulting in 100 removal in 10 min at ph 9 0 the effect of ph on tbbpa degradation could be interpreted by the speciation of ga cu iii and tbbpa at different phs ga has pka values of 4 26 5 87 8 93 and 11 48 in the presence of cu ii oess et al 1999 at ph 3 0 ga is present in its protonated form rendering it unfavorable to chelating with cu ii to generate cu i which is a prerequisite for pms reduction and cu iii formation with ph increasing to 4 3 ga began to dissociate and thus promoted cu i generation the reactivity of cu iii highly depends on ph with ph increasing cu iii would change from cu3 to cu oh 2 pka 3 7 cu oh 2 pka 4 8 cu oh 3 and or cu oh 4 pka 5 feng et al 2019 johnson et al 1985 the more hydroxyl bound in cu iii was generally related to weaker reactivity lee et al 2016 therefore tbbpa degradation rate was significantly decreased when ph increased from 4 3 to 5 0 further increasing the solution ph tbbpa began to dissociate pka 7 5 8 5 into tbbpa and tbbpa2 t malkoske et al 2016 which were more susceptible to be oxidized by various oxidants such as pms wu et al 2020 hocl gao et al 2016a ho wang et al 2017a and probably cu iii the results show good tbbpa degradation 70 in 10 min could be achieved in ga cu ii pms process in the ph range of 4 3 to 9 0 which was obviously wider than that obtained in pms 6 0 8 0 or cu ii pms 7 0 processes after reaction for 10 min the ph values gradually decreased from 3 0 4 3 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 to 2 91 3 85 3 57 4 96 and 7 66 respectively table s2 overall ga introduction not only improved the oxidation performance of cu ii pms process but extended its working ph range making it more suitable for in situ chemical oxidation isco oxygen had a positive effect on tbbpa degradation in the ga cu ii pms process fig 3d compared to the removal efficiency obtained in air saturated solution 84 6 only 47 4 of tbbpa was eliminated in the deoxygenated solution in 10 min the results suggest that dissolved oxygen was involved in ros evolution and promoted the generation of ho and or cu iii this might be due to the buildup of additional cu iii and ho production pathway kim et al 2015 reported that the combination of cu ii with hydroxylamine ha in situ generated h2o2 by reducing dissolved oxygen subsequently producing cu iii and ho through the reaction of cu i with h2o2 similar to ha ga also could accelerate the in situ generation of h2o2 by promoting the redox cycling of cu ii cu i eqs 4 7 and 9 nkhili et al 2014 additionally the reaction of ga with dissolved oxygen was reported to serve as a source of h2o2 for fenton like reaction and the presence of cu ii could accelerate h2o2 generation hayakawa et al 2004 nkhili et al 2014 overall although o2 would compete with pms for cu i it could build up an additional and possibly more efficient pathway kcu i h2o2 4 105 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 8 lee et al 2016 to produce cu iii and ho simultaneously promoting the turnover frequency of cu ii cu i 9 g a c u i i g a c u i i q u i n o n e c u i 3 4 oxidation products and pathways the mass balance of br was recorded by summating the concentrations of br bro3 and total organic bromine tobr as shown in fig s7 br was released with reaction proceeding which gradually reached 2 4 μm in 10 min accounting for 16 of total br this indicates that oxidative debromination occurred in ga cu ii pms process note that a small quantity of br generated was further oxidized to bro3 presumably due to the powerful oxidative activity of cu iii or ho about 75 of bromine still existed in organic form the transformation products of tbbpa were further identified by lc ms ms using the bromine precursor ion scan set at m z 79 and 81 the peak of tbbpa rt 19 36 min decreased with the formation of new peaks as time prolonged fig s8 a total of 8 intermediates were identified and their mass spectra data were shown in table s3 and fig s9 products 1 3 were the debrominated and hydroxylated products of tbbpa product 1 was eluted at 15 84 min with molecular ions of m z 462 464 466 468 and was assigned to tri bromobisphenol a it would be further hydroxylated to product 2 3 bromo 5 1 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxy phenyl 1 methyl ethyl benzene 1 2 diol product 3 was eluted at 12 14 min with molecular ions of m z 400 402 404 and br isotopic abundance ratio of 1 2 1 indicating the formation of a dibromo compound which was proposed to be 4 1 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxy phenyl 1 methyl ethyl benzene 1 2 diol products 4 5 were isomers as they had similar molecular ions and br isotopic patterns but different retention times these compounds were deduced as the ring opened products of tbbpa products 6 8 were formed from cleavage between the isopropyl group and the benzene ring and identified as 2 6 dibromo 4 isopropyl phenol 2 6 dibromo 4 2 2 hydroxy 4 hydroxymethyl phenoxy propan 2 yl phenol and 2 6 dibromo benzene 1 4 diol respectively among them products 6 and 8 were commonly detected in ho mediated oxidation process he et al 2016 wang et al 2017a zhong et al 2012 based on the detected products the transformation pathways of tbbpa were proposed as shown in fig s10 tbbpa transformation by ga cu ii pms process mainly proceeded through two routes one electron abstraction of the phenolic group route 1 and sequential debromination hydroxylation followed by ring opening route 2 the first route was initiated by one electron transfer from one of the hydroxyl groups to ho or cu iii forming a phenoxy radical r1 which was stabilized by resonance to form r2 feng et al 2013a pang et al 2014 r2 was quickly split to yield p6 and r3 through β scission the bond cleavage between the benzene group and the isopropyl group p7 could be formed from the coupling of p6 and its substituted intermediate r3 may undergo hydroxylation to produce p8 additionally tbbpa would be subjected to a series of debromination and hydroxylation reactions to produce p1 p2 and p3 subsequently these products were further oxidized to form ring opened products p4 and p5 the electron abstraction and debromination reactions have been commonly observed in the degradation of tbbpa by ho he et al 2016 zhong et al 2012 while ring opening pathways were rarely reported and might be ascribed to cu iii oxidation 3 5 reaction mechanisms it was reported that cu iii production in cu ii h2o2 and cu ii pms processes was mediated by the redox cycling of cu ii cu i couple lee et al 2016 wang et al 2020a specifically cu ii was firstly reduced by hso5 to cu i which then rapidly reduced another hso5 to produce cu iii eqs 1 2 wang et al 2020a to verify whether ga addition altered the reaction pathway of cu ii pms oxidation bc serving as a chelating agent for cu i log β2 18 8 zhang et al 2010 was added to ga cu ii pms process as fig s11 shows the degradation of tbbpa was completely inhibited by bc even when extending the reaction time to 60 min which implies the same reaction pathway involving cu i oxidation to cu iii thus the initial transformation of cu ii to cu i was vitally important cu ii was reported to coordinate with the ortho hydroxyl group of ga to form an inner sphere complex subsequently cu ii was reduced to cu i and the ga ligand was oxidized into quinone nkhili et al 2014 oess et al 1999 schweigert et al 2001 eq 9 thus cu i evolution and ga decay in different reaction processes were determined fig s12 no obvious cu i was detected in cu ii pms process due to the weak copper reduction capacity of hso5 eq 1 when cu ii was mixed with ga 17 μm of cu ii was reduced to cu i and 15 of ga 7 5 μm was simultaneously oxidized fig s12 after pms addition the generated cu i was quickly oxidized by pms leading to no cu i detection throughout the reaction period such phenomenon was also observed in wang et al 2020a presumably due to the higher oxidation rate of cu i by pms than its generation rate meanwhile the oxidation proportion of ga further increased to 50 in 1 min and gradually increased to 95 in 10 min to investigate the role of quinone one of the oxidation products of ga eq 9 1 4 benzoquinone 1 4 bq was added to cu ii pms process and its effect on tbbpa degradation was investigated results show that only 20 of tbbpa was degraded in 1 4 bq cu ii pms process in 10 min fig s13 suggesting that the oxidized quinone could not mediate cu ii reduction but compete with tbbpa for the generated ros on the other hand ga would be partially oxidized by cu iii and or ho since it is easily electrophilically attacked caregnato et al 2008 fontecha cámara et al 2016 even so the residual ga could still promote tbbpa degradation through assisting in cu ii cu i cycle to further explore the reactions taking place in ga cu ii pms process spectrographic experiments were conducted as shown in fig s14 ga displayed two adsorption peaks at 213 and 263 nm pan et al 2020 after reaction with cu ii the adsorption peak at 213 nm slightly decreased indicating ga was partially oxidized by cu ii with pms present the peak at 263 nm bathochromic shifted to 268 nm which might be due to the formation of a temporary ga cu hso5 complex similar phenomenon was observed in the reaction between h2o2 and catechin cu ii complex hayakawa et al 2004 nkhili et al 2014 note that both the two characteristic peaks gradually decreased with reaction time prolonging indicating that ga was oxidized with the concomitant formation of cu iii as ca ii and mg ii ubiquitously exist in natural waters and can also form complex with polyphenols their effects on ga cu ii pms oxidation were evaluated results show that tbbpa degradation was inhibited by 30 in the presence of 0 5 mm ca ii or mg ii fig s15 which further confirms that complexation between cu ii and ga was of great importance for the subsequent cu ii reduction on the basis of the above results and published literatures a possible mechanism for tbbpa degradation by ga cu ii pms process was proposed scheme 1 as shown cu ii might be reduced by hso5 eq 1 but this reaction proceeded very slowly because the redox potential of hso5 so5 is much higher than that of cu ii cu i 1 1 v vs 0 17 v wang et al 2020a upon ga addition cu ii quickly coordinated with the two hydroxyl groups of the catechol then the ga cu ii complex underwent a ligand to metal electron transfer to produce cu i and ga type quinone ga q eq 9 nkhili et al 2014 schweigert et al 2001 once cu i was formed it was rapidly oxidized by pms to cu iii eq 2 under aerobic condition the generated cu i could also trigger oxygenation via a series of single electron transfer reactions to produce cu iii and ho eqs 4 7 feng et al 2017 kim et al 2015 meanwhile a small amount of cu iii would be acid catalyzed to produce the secondary ho eq 8 pham et al 2013 it should be noted that the resulting ga q could also activate pms to promote the generation of 1o2 zhou et al 2015 though it could not effectively degrade tbbpa over the time scale of this study due to the weak oxidation capacity of 1o2 consequently both cu iii and ho contributed to tbbpa degradation and cu iii played the dominant role ho could oxidize tbbpa via electron abstraction and debromination reactions while cu iii oxidized tbbpa via ring opening pathways moreover cu ii generated from cu iii oxidation of tbbpa would be further reduced by another ga thus sustaining the cu ii cu i cycling and improving tbbpa degradation overall cu i generation was the key step to manipulate the ga cu ii pms process in which ga served as electron donor and cu ii keep shuttling the electron to pms or o2 3 6 pms induced tbbpa degradation using cu ii and nom present in water to degrade tbbpa it is technically infeasible to add polyphenols to water instead nom in water can serve as the natural source of polyphenols and cu ii is often present at trace levels in water to evaluate if pms can induce tbbpa degradation in environmental related conditions the tests were conducted in simulated water and real water samples with results presented in fig 4 nom alone could not activate pms for tbbpa oxidation the degradation of tbbpa by cu ii catalyzed pms proceeded slowly 37 in 30 min interestingly the degradation rates of tbbpa increased by 25 and 45 in the presence of 0 9 mgc l and 1 8 mgc l of nom respectively but excessive dosage of nom e g 2 7 mgc l would compete for cu iii and ho and thereby retarded tbbpa degradation fig 4a in the surface water sample of bj1 1 74 mgc l the degradation of tbbpa was negligible with the addition of 0 4 mm pms owing to the low concentration of cu ii in this water sample 2 24 0 04 μg l table s1 after additional dose of 1 μm cu ii 63 5 μg l more than 80 of tbbpa was degraded in 30 min in the bj2 sample with low concentration of nom 0 37 mgc l 31 of tbbpa was degraded after dosing 0 4 mm pms and 1 μm cu ii tbbpa degradation reached 80 after adding 1 8 mgc l nom to bj2 for wastewater sample ws1 the addition of pms led to negligible tbbpa degradation despite the higher cu ii concentration 13 78 μg l and doc 3 36 mg l than bj1 fig 4c but tbbpa dramatically decreased by 98 1 in 60 min with additional 1 μm cu ii added fig 4c in ws2 bearing low doc 0 69 mg l cu ii inherent in the wastewater can still trigger pms decomposition to degrade 30 of tbbpa after dosing 1 μm cu ii in ws2 100 of tbbpa removal was obtained in 60 min it should be noted that tbbpa can be substantially degraded even when high contents of ca ii and mg ii exists in real waters table s1 suggesting the catalytic mechanism of nom might be different from ga possibly due to the co existence of various redox active moieties such as thiols and nitrogen functional groups daugherty et al 2017 more importantly no carcinogenic bro3 were observed during the treatment of real water samples fig s16 which might be attributed to the scavenging of reactive bromine species e g br br2 and hobr obr by nom to produce organic brominated oxidation products since no br detected either similar inhibition of nom on bro3 formation has been observed in persulfate based aops guan et al 2020 nevertheless further studies with respect to the toxicity evaluation of finished water are needed overall the results clearly confirmed that nom in surface water or wastewater can effectively promote the degradation of tbbpa by cu ii mediated pms oxidation meanwhile the concentration of cu ii need to reach sufficient levels perhaps at sub micromolar levels to effectively trigger pms oxidation thus direct dosing of pms can abate the degradation of tbbpa and maybe other ocs by taking advantage of cu ii and nom present in water or wastewater but the treatment efficiency is highly dependent on the concentrations of cu ii and nom 4 conclusions the coupling of cu ii and gallic acid ga a representative of polyphenol could effectively trigger pms oxidation of tbbpa in a ph range of 4 3 9 0 in this ga cu ii pms system cu iii ho and 1o2 were generated and cu iii contributed dominantly to tbbpa degradation the oxidation performance of ga cu ii pms process depended on the rate of cu ii reduction to cu i and the catalysis of cu i ga accelerated the transformation of cu ii to cu i which quickly reduced pms to produce cu iii and ho with o2 present cu i could also mediate oxygenation to promote the generation of cu iii and ho tbbpa transformation mainly proceeded via one electron abstraction of the phenolic group and sequential debromination hydroxylation followed by ring opening nom exhibited the similar performance as ga could also promote tbbpa degradation by cu ii pms process the degradation of tbbpa in simulated and real water samples suggest the potential application of this process by making use of the cu ii and nom present in water but the concentrations of cu

17529,the effects of phosphonates the heavily used antiscalants in reverse osmosis systems on microalgae are controversial although they are harmless to most aquatic organisms herein we assessed the inhibitory effects of etidronic acid hedp and diethylenetriamine penta methylene phosphonic acid dtpmp on algal growth and revealed the mechanisms involved in both intrinsic toxicity and complexation the phosphonates showed weak influences on scenedesmus sp lx1 in the first 4 d of cultivation in contrast a significant growth inhibition was observed subsequently with half maximal effective concentrations of 57 6 and 35 7 mg l for hedp and dtpmp respectively at 10 d the phosphonates had little effect on cellular energy transfer and oxidative stress quantified by adenosine triphosphate level and superoxide dismutase activity respectively demonstrating weak intrinsic toxicities to algal cells phosphonates blocked the algal assimilation of iron ions through complexation severe iron deficiency limited photosynthetic activity and caused chlorophyll decline resulting in a functional loss of the photosystem followed by complete algal growth inhibition at the late cultivation stage

worldwide because of its excellent and reliable performance in the rejection of salts organics and microorganisms pérez gonzález et al 2012 werber et al 2016 phosphonates such as etidronic acid hedp and diethylenetriamine penta methylene phosphonic acid dtpmp are commonly used as antiscalants in ro systems for membrane scaling control owing to their ability for versatile metal complex formation gledhill and feijtel 1992 large amounts of the phosphonates are dosed in ro systems antiscalants are continuously added to the ro influent with typical concentrations ranging from 1 to 15 mg l greenlee et al 2014 the dosage should increase by five times if a ro recovery of over 80 is to be achieved wang et al 2019 furthermore about one fourth of the ro influent remains as ro concentrate with nearly all the constituents from the feed retained dialynas et al 2008 xu et al 2019 resulting in a maximum antiscalant concentration of over 100 mg l in the concentrate considering the difficulties in the treatment and disposal of ro concentrates umar et al 2015 wang et al 2016 and the low biodegradability of the antiscalants rott et al 2018 phosphonate containing wastewaters are very likely to be discharged into the natural environment the presence of phosphonates in surface water bodies has been proven schmidt et al 2014 less attention has been paid to the potential aquatic risk of phosphonate exposure as phosphonates are considered to be harmless to most aquatic organisms with no observed effect concentrations noec of over 100 mg l rott et al 2018 studies note that phosphonates may contribute to eutrophication owing to their phosphorus containing structure huang et al 2019 xu et al 2019 unfortunately the interaction between phosphonates and microalgae the culprit inducing harmful algal blooms is poorly understood literature offers contradictory findings on phosphonate toxicity towards microalgae gledhill and feijtel 1992 reported that 100 mg l hedp completely inhibited the growth of chlorella sp whereas a noec higher than 100 mg l was found in the study of jaworska et al 2002 using chlorella vulgaris as the test strain the growth inhibition results of 10 mg l dtpmp showed significant differences when raphidocelis subcapitata was cultivated in media with different ion concentrations hanstveit and oldersma 1996 the possible cause of these contradicting results is the application of the standard algal growth inhibition test which is not well suited for assessing toxicity of strong complexing agents such as phosphonates jaworska et al 2002 this is because i both intrinsic toxicity and complexation affect algal growth making it hard to distinguish and ii the effect of complexation on algal growth is closely linked to the essential metal content of the test medium during short term cultivation 96 h considering the widespread global increase in harmful algal blooms ho et al 2019 sinha et al 2017 and the huge dosage of the antiscalants rott et al 2017 it is imperative to develop an effective method to evaluate the potential impacts of phosphonates on microalgae in this study we assessed the effects of two phosphonate antiscalants hedp and dtpmp on algal growth and elucidated the underlying mechanisms involved in both intrinsic toxicity and complexation scenedesmus sp lx1 a typical freshwater algal species was used for the primary experiments and two other algal strains were selected for comparison growth inhibition assessment was performed during a long term cultivation of 14 d and algal growth dynamics were analyzed we further evaluated the influence of the phosphonates on algal photosynthesis intracellular energy transfer and oxidative stress we highlight that the complexation of iron ions the predominant ion forming complex with phosphonates in nature rott et al 2018 plays a critical role in inhibiting algal photosynthesis natural degradation of phosphonates could release not only phosphate but also free iron ions that stimulate algal regrowth thereby raising the risk of harmful algal blooms 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgal strains and chemicals scenedesmus sp lx1 collection no cgmcc 3036 in the china general microbiological culture collection center was selected to assess the growth inhibition effect of the phosphonates in this study two other strains scenedesmus sp zty1 and chlorella sp hq were selected for comparison for detailed information see text s1 these three strains were stored separately in smbg11 media with nitrogen and phosphorus contents of 45 and 4 5 mg l respectively wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 the algae were cultivated until the exponential phase approximately 2 weeks in an artificial climate chamber yiheng tech shanghai china and then used as inoculum hedp 60 aqueous solution and dtpmp 50 solution with 15 hydrochloric acid and 35 water were purchased from j k scientific shanghai china and sigma aldrich st louis mo usa respectively both types of phosphonates were prepared separately as 1 g l stock solutions in deionized water and were adjusted to neutral ph using sodium hydroxide the stock solutions were then filter sterilized through 0 2 μm membrane filters before use 2 2 experimental design this study was designed as two series of experiments the first series was performed to assess the algal growth inhibition by hedp and dtpmp flasks with 25 ml of smbg11 media were autoclaved at 121 c for 20 min before use on a clean bench the hedp and dtpmp stock solutions were added to the sterilized media at initial concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 mg l for hedp and 10 to 80 mg l for dtpmp scenedesmus sp lx1 scenedesmus sp zty1 and chlorella sp hq were inoculated separately at a ratio of 1 v v resulting in initial densities of 2 105 3 105 and 6 105 cells ml respectively cultivation was performed in the same artificial climate chamber as described for 14 d under the conditions of light intensity 55 60 μmol photons m2 s light dark ratio 14 10 and temperature 25 1 c the second series of experiments was conducted to investigate the effect of iron ions on growth inhibition in scenedesmus sp lx1 by hedp and dtpmp ammonium iron citrate fe nh4 3 c6h5o7 2 the only iron source in smbg11 was added to the culture media at different concentrations of 0 6 6 1 the normal concentration 30 7 and 153 5 μm the ammonium iron citrate was replaced with iron sulfate fe2 so4 3 concentrations of 0 3 3 1 15 4 and 76 8 μm and citric acid c6h5o7 concentrations of 1 2 12 3 61 5 and 307 3 μm to determine the effects of iron ions and citrate respectively the ammonium iron citrate iron sulfate and citric acid stock solutions were adjusted to neutral ph and filter sterilized through 0 2 μm membrane filters before use the initial concentrations of hedp and dtpmp used in this series of experiments were 75 and 60 mg l respectively cultivation was performed for 10 d under the same conditions as in the first series 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 algal density algal density was determined using optical density calibration curves at 650 nm with a spectrophotometer uv 2700 shimadzu kyoto japan a linear relationship for scenedesmus sp lx1 was determined to calculate the algal density from the optical density of cell suspension using the following equation 1 n s lx 1 8 86 1 0 6 o d 650 where ns lx1 is the density of scenedesmus sp lx1 and od650 is the optical density at 650 nm as the ammonium iron citrate and iron sulfate solutions have absorptions at 650 nm samples filtered with 0 45 μm membrane filters served as the blanks 2 3 2 phosphonate concentration direct measurement of phosphonates is particularly difficult due to their low reactivity and lack of chromophores that absorb ultraviolet and infrared light knepper 2003 therefore this study determined hedp and dtpmp concentrations indirectly by measuring the concentrations of organic phosphorus op the algal suspensions were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters prior to measurement samples with and without digestion were used to determine the concentrations of total dissolved phosphorus and inorganic phosphorus ip respectively using the standard ascorbic acid colorimetric method murphy and riley 1962 in brief the filtered samples were mixed with sulfuric acid and ammonium persulfate and heated for 30 min in an autoclave at 121 c for the digestion ammonium molybdate antimony potassium tartrate solution was added subsequently in to samples followed by the addition of ascorbic acid solution to form an intensely blue complex the mixtures were stabilized for 5 min and phosphorus concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 660 nm with the spectrophotometer op concentration was equal to the difference between the total dissolved phosphorus concentration and the ip concentration 2 3 3 photosynthetic activity the net photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate of algal cells was determined by changing the light intensity from 0 to 800 μmol photons m2 s using a liquid phase oxygen measurement system chlorolab 2 hansatech norfolk uk the specific photosynthetic rate p m was nonlinearly fitted by a p i curve photosynthetic oxygen evolution light intensity eq 2 henley 1993 using origin 2020 originlab northampton ma usa 2 p p m tanh a p i p m 60 r d where i is the light

centrifuged 10 000 rpm 10 min and the pelleted algal cells were resuspended in 80 v v acetone at 4 c the suspensions were then disrupted using a high pressure cell disrupter jn mini jnbio guangzhou china and centrifuged 10 000 rpm 10 min the absorbance at 645 and 663 nm were determined using the spectrophotometer chlorophyll a content was calculated using eq 3 arnon 1949 3 chl a 12 7 a 663 2 69 a 645 where chl a is the chlorophyll a content μg ml and a645 and a663 are the absorbance values at 645 and 663 nm respectively 2 3 6 adenosine triphosphate atp an algal suspension allowed to settle for 10 h in the dark followed by homogenization using the high pressure cell disrupter atp content was determined using a common bactiter glo microbial cell viability assay kit g8231 promega madison wi usa li et al 2017 and the luminescence was measured using a microplate reader md spectramax molecular devices san jose ca usa 2 3 7 superoxide dismutase sod sod was estimated using the nitroblue tetrazolium method beauchamp and fridovich 1971 with a total superoxide dismutase assay kit s0109 beyotime shanghai china the superoxide anion radical generated by the catalytic reaction between xanthine and xanthine oxidase reduces nitroblue tetrazolium to blue formazan which exhibits a strong absorption peak at 560 nm sod can scavenge the superoxide anion radical and therefore inhibit the formation of formazan hence sod activity can be determined by detecting the formazan concentration one unit of sod activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that inhibits 50 of the formazan formation 2 4 model fitting 2 4 1 inhibition ratio the inhibitory effects of hedp and dtpmp on algal growth were evaluated by the following equation oecd 2006 4 i d n 0 n n 0 100 where i d is the inhibition ratio and n 0 and n are the algal densities cells ml of the control and the experimental groups respectively 2 4 2 dose response curve the algal growth inhibition effects of the phosphonates were assessed by a dose response curve nyholm et al 1992 5 i d i dm 1 c 0 e c 50 h where i dm is the maximal inhibition ratio c 0 is the initial hedp or dtpmp concentration mg l ec50 is the half maximal effective concentration mg l and h is the hill coefficient which is the maximum absolute value of the curve slope nonlinear curve fitting of the data was performed using origin 2020

experiments in this study were conducted in triplicate data are expressed as means standard deviation one way analysis of variance anova with the tukey s post hoc test was performed for the analysis of significant differences using origin 2020 statistical significance was accepted at a probability of p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of phosphonates on algal growth the growth of scenedesmus sp lx1 exhibited significant differences under different cultivation stages in phosphonate containing cultures as shown in fig 1 a and 1b the algae grew normally at the initial stage of cultivation 0 4 d whereas severe growth inhibition was observed subsequently with complete inhibition after 10 d when hedp and dtpmp concentrations were equal to or higher than 75 and 60 mg l respectively fig 1c and 1d present the comparison between the growth inhibition ratios i d after 4 and 10 d under different phosphonate concentrations all i d values were lower than 20 after 4 d however significant elevation of the ratios was observed at 10 d p 0 05 especially under high phosphonate concentrations with maximum values around 60 these results suggest that short term cultivation of less than 96 h the commonly used assessment period jaworska et al 2002 oecd 2006 may not accurately reflect phosphonate toxicity to the algae we applied a dose response curve eq 5 to assess the inhibitory effects of the phosphonates on algal growth at 10 d in addition to scenedesmus sp lx1 scenedesmus sp zty1 and chlorella sp hq were used for comparison as shown in table 1 scenedesmus sp lx1 exhibited a stronger resistance than the other two strains with 10 d ec50 values of 57 6 and 35 7 mg l for hedp and dtpmp respectively scenedesmus sp zty1 and chlorella sp hq were very sensitive to the phosphonates and the noec values of both were lower than 9 mg l these results indicate that the phosphonates exhibited strong growth inhibition effects on different algal species at the late stage of cultivation we further calculated the theoretical maximum algal density k and maximum algal growth rate r max of scenedesmus sp lx1 under different phosphonate concentrations fig 2 using a classic logistic model eq 6 k decreased slightly with the increase in phosphonate concentrations when hedp and dtpmp were lower than 50 and 40 mg l respectively however the k values dropped suddenly to approximately 10 of the initial value when the phosphonate concentrations were raised further in addition the changes in r max showed similar trends as that of k when the phosphonate concentrations increased thus the subsequent algal growth could be completely inhibited if the phosphonates breached the threshold concentrations i e 75 mg l hedp and 60 mg l dtpmp changes in op concentrations were negligible when cultivating scenedesmus sp lx1 in hedp containing cultures fig s1a indicating that the algal degradation of hedp is weak a decrease in the op concentration was observed when dtpmp 60 mg l severely inhibited algal growth fig s1b this was caused by the hydrolysis and photolysis of dtpmp under neutral ph fig s2 the unchanged op concentration under alkaline conditions implied that scenedesmus sp lx1 did not contribute to dtpmp degradation considering the ph elevation during algal growth 3 2 effects of phosphonates on algal metabolism the phosphonates showed weak influences on the growth of scenedesmus sp lx1 at the initial cultivation stage whereas their inhibition on the subsequent algal growth was significant to reveal the main causes of this inhibition we further investigated the effects of hedp and dtpmp on algal photosynthesis intracellular energy transfer and oxidative stress 3 2 1 photosynthesis both hedp and dtpmp affected the photosynthetic rate of scenedesmus sp lx1 as depicted in fig 3 a and 3b p m of the algae decreased with increase in phosphonate concentrations at 4 d this observation suggests that photosynthetic oxygen evolution of the algae is affected by the phosphonates although the algal growth is not inhibited significantly at the initial stage much lower p m was observed after 10 d of cultivation p 0 05 indicating severe inhibition in algal photosynthetic activity at the late stage notably oxygen evolution was still detectable when the algal growth was completely inhibited demonstrating that algal photosynthesis was not shut down even under extremely high phosphonate concentrations ph change is an indicator of algal capability to assimilate carbon dioxide via photosynthesis wang et al 2018 ph of the low phosphonate dosage groups i e 30 mg l hedp and 20 mg l dtpmp increased to over 10 1 after 10 d of cultivation although the values were still slightly lower than those of the controls whereas the ph values remained below 8 7 during the entire cultivation period when the algal growth was seriously inhibited fig s3 these results further evidenced the inhibition of algal photosynthetic activity caused by the phosphonates in contrast to the trends of p m the chlorophyll a content of scenedesmus sp lx1 increased slightly with the phosphonate concentrations at 4 d fig 3c and 3d this was speculated as being a compensatory response to photosynthesis regulation against inhibition perreault et al 2012 wang et al 2018 the chlorophyll a content was still higher than that of the controls at 10 d p 0 05 when the algal growth was not severely inhibited i e hedp and dtpmp concentrations lower than 50 and 40 mg l respectively however sudden drops in chlorophyll a content were observed with further increase in the phosphonate concentrations we further investigated the changes in chlorophyll a content with cultivation time under high phosphonate concentrations fig s4 the chlorophyll a content of the algae increased by 1 5 times in the first 4 d and then decreased remarkably to only around 50 of their initial levels at the end of the 10 d of cultivation such a severe chlorophyll loss demonstrates a functional loss of the photosystem resulting in complete algal growth inhibition fig 1a and 1b 3 2 2 energy transfer and oxidative stress we investigated the changes in the levels of atp the molecular unit of currency of intracellular energy transfer knowles 1980 to reflect the inhibitory effects of the phosphonates on algal respiratory metabolism the algal samples were allowed to settle in the dark prior to measurement to eliminate the influence of photosynthesis as depicted in fig 4 a and 4b atp contents of the groups with the addition of 30 mg l hedp or 20 mg l dtpmp was similar to that of the controls p 0 05 higher phosphonate concentrations exhibited some effects on the atp content however the changes were mostly no more than 25 in addition the consumption of oxygen could be detected normally in all groups by the liquid phase oxygen measurement system these results demonstrate weak effects of the phosphonates on the algal energy transfer even if the growth of scenedesmus sp lx1 was seriously inhibited at 10 d sod activity is closely linked to the generation of reactive oxygen species in cells thereby reflecting the extent of algal oxidative stress the sod activities in all groups were lower than 7 9 u 107 cells during the entire cultivation time without significant increase fig 4c and 4d the trends in the controls and the groups with the addition of 30 mg l hedp or 20 mg l dtpmp were stationary sod activities in the groups with high phosphonate addition i e 75 mg l hedp and 60 mg l dtpmp decreased gradually with time due to the inhibition of algal growth in addition no structural damage of the algal cells was found through microscopy investigation therefore it could be inferred that the algae did not suffer from oxidative stress cellular damage is generally accompanied by the prominent changes in energy transfer and the increase in oxidative stress considering the close links with cell detoxification reparation and apoptosis wang et al 2018 xiong et al 2017 hedp and dtpmp had limited effect on cellular atp content and sod activity demonstrating weak intrinsic toxicities of the phosphonates to damage the algal cells 3 3 effect of iron complexation on algal growth inhibition the existence of hedp and dtpmp showed negative effects on algal photosynthesis leading to significant growth inhibition however their direct damage to the algal cells was negligible we speculated that the inhibition of algal photosynthesis might be attributed to the complexation of the phosphonates with metal ions iron plays a crucial role in photosynthesis one of the most noticeable effects of iron deficiency is the decrease in cellular content of chlorophyll a van oijen et al 2004 we investigated the influence of iron ions on algal growth after 10 d of cultivation with dosage of 75 mg l hedp or 60 mg l dtpmp the algal growth inhibition ratios exhibited significant difference under different concentrations of ammonium iron citrate p 0 05 the only iron source in the cultural media as depicted in fig 5 a and 5b for algal densities in the control groups see fig s5 under the standard iron concentration i e 6 1 μm i d of the algae were in a range of 60 70 similar to the results shown in fig 1 lower iron concentrations resulted in higher i d values when the concentration of iron ions increased to 30 7 μm the inhibition ratios decreased significantly to around 20 scenedesmus sp lx1 was completely released from the effect of growth inhibition when the iron concentration was 25 times that of the standard similar results were obtained when using iron sulfate as the sole iron source fig 5c and 5d the increase in the iron sulfate concentration effectively promoted algal growth eliminating the inhibitory effects of the phosphonates at an iron concentration of 153 6 μm we also found that addition of citric acid had negligible effects on mitigating the growth inhibition as i d values were similar under different citric acid concentrations fig 5e and 5f considering the very strong iron binding ability of the phosphonates nowack 2003 we concluded that the algal growth inhibition at the late stage of the cultivation was attributed to the deficiency of free iron ions that were complexed by the phosphonates iron is one of the essential structural elements that are closely linked to electron transfer reactions in the photosystem van oijen et al 2004 the functioning of the photosynthetic electron transport chain is hindered by iron starvation owing to the decrease in iron sulfur complexes such as ferredoxin geider and la roche 1994 mckay et al 1999 the deficiency of iron also leads to a decline in the content of cellular pigments involved in light harvesting e g chlorophyll a stefels and van leeuwe 1998 van oijen et al 2004 these negative effects lower the effective quantum yield of photosystem ii thereby reducing the photosynthetic efficiency in iron limited cells zhao et al 2018 3 4 mechanisms for the inhibitory effects of phosphonates on algal growth the proposed mechanisms for the inhibitory effects of hedp and dtpmp on algal growth are illustrated in fig 6 as the algal density is relatively low at the initial stage of cultivation the free iron ions in the cultural medium can support a normal algal growth even though most iron ions are complexed by the phosphonates fig 6a the demand for the iron ions rises exponentially with the increase in algal density whereas the free iron ions are consumed concurrently during cultivation the strong binding ability of the phosphonates blocks the assimilation of the complexed iron by the algae fig 6b the deficiency in iron ions limits algal growth leading to decreases in the algal growth rate and the maximum density microalgae stop growing when all the free iron ions are assimilated the different demands for the iron ions between strains result in distinct effective concentrations of the phosphonates on algal growth inhibition table 1 in addition assessment of inhibition of the phosphonates on algal growth is also affected by the iron concentration of the test medium this might be the main cause for the contradictory results in literature gledhill and feijtel 1992 hanstveit and oldersma 1996 jaworska et al 2002 the inhibition of photosynthesis caused by cellular iron deficiency hinders algal growth fig 6c however the intrinsic toxicity of the phosphonates is negligible the decline in the electron transport efficiency in the photosystem limits the photosynthetic activity including carbon dioxide assimilation and oxygen evolution subsequently the serious decline in cellular pigments such as chlorophyll a results in a functional loss of the photosystem for harvesting light energy therefore leading to a complete growth inhibition under high phosphonate concentration at the late stage of cultivation 3 5 environmental implications elucidating the underlying mechanisms of phosphonates on algal growth inhibition is of great significance to evaluate the potential aquatic risk of these antiscalants phosphonates are considered harmless to most aquatic organisms because of their low intrinsic toxicity and weak influences on cellular respiration for energy conversion and catabolism rott et al 2018 however their complexation on metal ions especially on iron ions can significantly inhibit the photosynthesis of autotrophic microalgae the irreplaceable primary producers of aquatic ecosystems therefore discharge of wastewater containing a high concentration of phosphonates may cause serious ecological impacts on the receiving water more importantly natural degradation of the phosphonates may induce harmful algal blooms because the release of both iron ions and phosphate can stimulate algal regrowth iron complexes are the predominant form of phosphonates in surface waters rott et al 2018 phosphonates can not only complex free iron ions but also dissolve the iron from sediments through weakening the iron oxygen bonds of the ligands nowack 2003 photolysis is the primary mechanism for the natural degradation of phosphonates rott et al 2018 and the complexation of iron ions accelerates this light mediated degradation process nowack 2003 the release of phosphate is also of vital concern considering the extremely low threshold concentration of 0 1 mg p l for inducing the harmful algal blooms schindler et al 2016 therefore microalgae are very likely to regrow after decomposition of phosphonate because i the phosphonates have weak intrinsic toxicity to damage the algal cells and ii the decomposition process provides free iron ions and phosphate the nutrients necessary for algal growth in addition phosphonates tend to adsorb onto sediments fischer 1992 steber and wierich 1986 their resuspension from the sediments in shallow lakes also increases the risk of harmful algal blooms even though the nutrients in the water body are controlled qin et al 2020 high concentrations of phosphonates are dosed continuously in ro systems to prevent membrane scaling tang et al 2014 wang et al 2019 in addition phosphonates are also used widely for producing textile and paper conditioning of cooling water and electroplating rott et al 2018 despite the high potential aquatic risk low biodegradability of phosphonate containing wastewaters such as ro concentrate limits their treatment and disposal using traditional methods chen et al 2020 umar et al 2015 therefore we recommend prior removal of the phosphonates and their derived nutrients from the wastewaters using advanced treatment methods such as advanced oxidation processes huang et al 2019 rott et al 2017 followed by microalgal cultivation wang et al 2020 before their discharge into water bodies to minimize the potential environmental impacts 4 conclusions in this study we assessed the inhibitory effects of two typical phosphonates hedp and dtpmp on microalgae growth and revealed the mechanisms involved in both intrinsic toxicity and complexation the influence of the phosphonates on scenedesmus sp lx1 was negligible at the initial cultivation stage 0 to 4 d in contrast the inhibitory effects on subsequent algal growth was significant with 10 d ec50 of 57 6 and 35 7 mg l for hedp and dtpmp respectively k and r max of the algae decreased suddenly when the phosphonates breached the threshold concentrations indicating complete growth inhibition furthermore the other two algal strains were more sensitive to the phosphonates than scenedesmus sp lx1 for which the noec was lower than 9 mg l hedp and dtpmp inhibited the growth of scenedesmus sp lx1 through complexing with the iron ions to block their utilization by the algae serious iron deficiency hindered algal photosynthesis the limitation of photosynthetic activity including carbon dioxide assimilation and oxygen evolution followed by the decrease in chlorophyll a content resulted in a functional loss of the algal photosystem for harvesting light energy at the late stage of cultivation in addition hedp and dtpmp had little effect on the cellular atp content and sod activity demonstrating weak intrinsic toxicities of the phosphonates to damage the algal cells our findings point to a potential ecological impact of phosphonates to induce harmful algal blooms by releasing not only phosphates but also free iron ions that stimulate algal regrowth when the phosphonates decompose naturally declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no known competing financial interests or

worldwide because of its excellent and reliable performance in the rejection of salts organics and microorganisms pérez gonzález et al 2012 werber et al 2016 phosphonates such as etidronic acid hedp and diethylenetriamine penta methylene phosphonic acid dtpmp are commonly used as antiscalants in ro systems for membrane scaling control owing to their ability for versatile metal complex formation gledhill and feijtel 1992 large amounts of the phosphonates are dosed in ro systems antiscalants are continuously added to the ro influent with typical concentrations ranging from 1 to 15 mg l greenlee et al 2014 the dosage should increase by five times if a ro recovery of over 80 is to be achieved wang et al 2019 furthermore about one fourth of the ro influent remains as ro concentrate with nearly all the constituents from the feed retained dialynas et al 2008 xu et al 2019 resulting in a maximum antiscalant concentration of over 100 mg l in the concentrate considering the difficulties in the treatment and disposal of ro concentrates umar et al 2015 wang et al 2016 and the low biodegradability of the antiscalants rott et al 2018 phosphonate containing wastewaters are very likely to be discharged into the natural environment the presence of phosphonates in surface water bodies has been proven schmidt et al 2014 less attention has been paid to the potential aquatic risk of phosphonate exposure as phosphonates are considered to be harmless to most aquatic organisms with no observed effect concentrations noec of over 100 mg l rott et al 2018 studies note that phosphonates may contribute to eutrophication owing to their phosphorus containing structure huang et al 2019 xu et al 2019 unfortunately the interaction between phosphonates and microalgae the culprit inducing harmful algal blooms is poorly understood literature offers contradictory findings on phosphonate toxicity towards microalgae gledhill and feijtel 1992 reported that 100 mg l hedp completely inhibited the growth of chlorella sp whereas a noec higher than 100 mg l was found in the study of jaworska et al 2002 using chlorella vulgaris as the test strain the growth inhibition results of 10 mg l dtpmp showed significant differences when raphidocelis subcapitata was cultivated in media with different ion concentrations hanstveit and oldersma 1996 the possible cause of these contradicting results is the application of the standard algal growth inhibition test which is not well suited for assessing toxicity of strong complexing agents such as phosphonates jaworska et al 2002 this is because i both intrinsic toxicity and complexation affect algal growth making it hard to distinguish and ii the effect of complexation on algal growth is closely linked to the essential metal content of the test medium during short term cultivation 96 h considering the widespread global increase in harmful algal blooms ho et al 2019 sinha et al 2017 and the huge dosage of the antiscalants rott et al 2017 it is imperative to develop an effective method to evaluate the potential impacts of phosphonates on microalgae in this study we assessed the effects of two phosphonate antiscalants hedp and dtpmp on algal growth and elucidated the underlying mechanisms involved in both intrinsic toxicity and complexation scenedesmus sp lx1 a typical freshwater algal species was used for the primary experiments and two other algal strains were selected for comparison growth inhibition assessment was performed during a long term cultivation of 14 d and algal growth dynamics were analyzed we further evaluated the influence of the phosphonates on algal photosynthesis intracellular energy transfer and oxidative stress we highlight that the complexation of iron ions the predominant ion forming complex with phosphonates in nature rott et al 2018 plays a critical role in inhibiting algal photosynthesis natural degradation of phosphonates could release not only phosphate but also free iron ions that stimulate algal regrowth thereby raising the risk of harmful algal blooms 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgal strains and chemicals scenedesmus sp lx1 collection no cgmcc 3036 in the china general microbiological culture collection center was selected to assess the growth inhibition effect of the phosphonates in this study two other strains scenedesmus sp zty1 and chlorella sp hq were selected for comparison for detailed information see text s1 these three strains were stored separately in smbg11 media with nitrogen and phosphorus contents of 45 and 4 5 mg l respectively wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 the algae were cultivated until the exponential phase approximately 2 weeks in an artificial climate chamber yiheng tech shanghai china and then used as inoculum hedp 60 aqueous solution and dtpmp 50 solution with 15 hydrochloric acid and 35 water were purchased from j k scientific shanghai china and sigma aldrich st louis mo usa respectively both types of phosphonates were prepared separately as 1 g l stock solutions in deionized water and were adjusted to neutral ph using sodium hydroxide the stock solutions were then filter sterilized through 0 2 μm membrane filters before use 2 2 experimental design this study was designed as two series of experiments the first series was performed to assess the algal growth inhibition by hedp and dtpmp flasks with 25 ml of smbg11 media were autoclaved at 121 c for 20 min before use on a clean bench the hedp and dtpmp stock solutions were added to the sterilized media at initial concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 mg l for hedp and 10 to 80 mg l for dtpmp scenedesmus sp lx1 scenedesmus sp zty1 and chlorella sp hq were inoculated separately at a ratio of 1 v v resulting in initial densities of 2 105 3 105 and 6 105 cells ml respectively cultivation was performed in the same artificial climate chamber as described for 14 d under the conditions of light intensity 55 60 μmol photons m2 s light dark ratio 14 10 and temperature 25 1 c the second series of experiments was conducted to investigate the effect of iron ions on growth inhibition in scenedesmus sp lx1 by hedp and dtpmp ammonium iron citrate fe nh4 3 c6h5o7 2 the only iron source in smbg11 was added to the culture media at different concentrations of 0 6 6 1 the normal concentration 30 7 and 153 5 μm the ammonium iron citrate was replaced with iron sulfate fe2 so4 3 concentrations of 0 3 3 1 15 4 and 76 8 μm and citric acid c6h5o7 concentrations of 1 2 12 3 61 5 and 307 3 μm to determine the effects of iron ions and citrate respectively the ammonium iron citrate iron sulfate and citric acid stock solutions were adjusted to neutral ph and filter sterilized through 0 2 μm membrane filters before use the initial concentrations of hedp and dtpmp used in this series of experiments were 75 and 60 mg l respectively cultivation was performed for 10 d under the same conditions as in the first series 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 algal density algal density was determined using optical density calibration curves at 650 nm with a spectrophotometer uv 2700 shimadzu kyoto japan a linear relationship for scenedesmus sp lx1 was determined to calculate the algal density from the optical density of cell suspension using the following equation 1 n s lx 1 8 86 1 0 6 o d 650 where ns lx1 is the density of scenedesmus sp lx1 and od650 is the optical density at 650 nm as the ammonium iron citrate and iron sulfate solutions have absorptions at 650 nm samples filtered with 0 45 μm membrane filters served as the blanks 2 3 2 phosphonate concentration direct measurement of phosphonates is particularly difficult due to their low reactivity and lack of chromophores that absorb ultraviolet and infrared light knepper 2003 therefore this study determined hedp and dtpmp concentrations indirectly by measuring the concentrations of organic phosphorus op the algal suspensions were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters prior to measurement samples with and without digestion were used to determine the concentrations of total dissolved phosphorus and inorganic phosphorus ip respectively using the standard ascorbic acid colorimetric method murphy and riley 1962 in brief the filtered samples were mixed with sulfuric acid and ammonium persulfate and heated for 30 min in an autoclave at 121 c for the digestion ammonium molybdate antimony potassium tartrate solution was added subsequently in to samples followed by the addition of ascorbic acid solution to form an intensely blue complex the mixtures were stabilized for 5 min and phosphorus concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 660 nm with the spectrophotometer op concentration was equal to the difference between the total dissolved phosphorus concentration and the ip concentration 2 3 3 photosynthetic activity the net photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate of algal cells was determined by changing the light intensity from 0 to 800 μmol photons m2 s using a liquid phase oxygen measurement system chlorolab 2 hansatech norfolk uk the specific photosynthetic rate p m was nonlinearly fitted by a p i curve photosynthetic oxygen evolution light intensity eq 2 henley 1993 using origin 2020 originlab northampton ma usa 2 p p m tanh a p i p m 60 r d where i is the light

centrifuged 10 000 rpm 10 min and the pelleted algal cells were resuspended in 80 v v acetone at 4 c the suspensions were then disrupted using a high pressure cell disrupter jn mini jnbio guangzhou china and centrifuged 10 000 rpm 10 min the absorbance at 645 and 663 nm were determined using the spectrophotometer chlorophyll a content was calculated using eq 3 arnon 1949 3 chl a 12 7 a 663 2 69 a 645 where chl a is the chlorophyll a content μg ml and a645 and a663 are the absorbance values at 645 and 663 nm respectively 2 3 6 adenosine triphosphate atp an algal suspension allowed to settle for 10 h in the dark followed by homogenization using the high pressure cell disrupter atp content was determined using a common bactiter glo microbial cell viability assay kit g8231 promega madison wi usa li et al 2017 and the luminescence was measured using a microplate reader md spectramax molecular devices san jose ca usa 2 3 7 superoxide dismutase sod sod was estimated using the nitroblue tetrazolium method beauchamp and fridovich 1971 with a total superoxide dismutase assay kit s0109 beyotime shanghai china the superoxide anion radical generated by the catalytic reaction between xanthine and xanthine oxidase reduces nitroblue tetrazolium to blue formazan which exhibits a strong absorption peak at 560 nm sod can scavenge the superoxide anion radical and therefore inhibit the formation of formazan hence sod activity can be determined by detecting the formazan concentration one unit of sod activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that inhibits 50 of the formazan formation 2 4 model fitting 2 4 1 inhibition ratio the inhibitory effects of hedp and dtpmp on algal growth were evaluated by the following equation oecd 2006 4 i d n 0 n n 0 100 where i d is the inhibition ratio and n 0 and n are the algal densities cells ml of the control and the experimental groups respectively 2 4 2 dose response curve the algal growth inhibition effects of the phosphonates were assessed by a dose response curve nyholm et al 1992 5 i d i dm 1 c 0 e c 50 h where i dm is the maximal inhibition ratio c 0 is the initial hedp or dtpmp concentration mg l ec50 is

of significant differences using origin 2020 statistical significance was accepted at a probability of p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of phosphonates on algal growth the growth of scenedesmus sp lx1 exhibited significant differences under different cultivation stages in phosphonate containing cultures as shown in fig 1 a and 1b the algae grew normally at the initial stage of cultivation 0 4 d whereas severe growth inhibition was observed subsequently with complete inhibition after 10 d when hedp and dtpmp concentrations were equal to or higher than 75 and 60 mg l respectively fig 1c and 1d present the comparison between the growth inhibition ratios i d after 4 and 10 d under different phosphonate concentrations all i d values were lower than 20 after 4 d however significant elevation of the ratios was observed at 10 d p 0 05 especially under high phosphonate concentrations with maximum values around 60 these results suggest that short term cultivation of less than 96 h the commonly used assessment period jaworska et al 2002 oecd 2006 may not accurately reflect phosphonate toxicity to the algae we applied a dose response curve eq 5 to assess the inhibitory effects of the phosphonates on algal growth at 10 d in addition to scenedesmus sp lx1 scenedesmus sp zty1 and chlorella sp hq were used for comparison as shown in table 1 scenedesmus sp lx1 exhibited a stronger resistance than the other two strains with 10 d ec50 values of 57 6 and 35 7 mg l for hedp and dtpmp respectively scenedesmus sp zty1 and chlorella sp hq were very sensitive to the phosphonates and the noec values of both were lower than 9 mg l these results indicate that the phosphonates exhibited strong growth inhibition effects on different algal species at the late stage of cultivation we further calculated the theoretical maximum algal density k and maximum algal growth rate r max of scenedesmus sp lx1 under different phosphonate concentrations fig 2 using a classic logistic model eq 6 k decreased slightly with the increase in phosphonate concentrations when hedp and dtpmp were lower than 50 and 40 mg l respectively however the k values dropped suddenly to approximately 10 of the initial value when the phosphonate concentrations were raised further in addition the changes in r max showed similar trends as that of k when the phosphonate concentrations increased thus the subsequent algal growth could be completely inhibited if the phosphonates breached the threshold concentrations i e 75 mg l hedp and 60 mg l dtpmp changes in op concentrations were negligible when cultivating scenedesmus sp lx1 in hedp containing cultures fig s1a indicating that the algal degradation of hedp is weak a decrease in the op concentration was observed when dtpmp 60 mg l severely inhibited algal growth fig s1b this was caused by the hydrolysis and photolysis of dtpmp under neutral ph fig s2 the unchanged op concentration under alkaline conditions implied that scenedesmus sp lx1 did not contribute to dtpmp degradation considering the ph elevation during algal growth 3 2 effects of phosphonates on algal metabolism the phosphonates showed weak influences on the growth of scenedesmus sp lx1 at the initial cultivation stage whereas their inhibition on the subsequent algal growth was significant to reveal the main causes of this inhibition we further investigated the effects of hedp and dtpmp on algal photosynthesis intracellular energy transfer and oxidative stress 3 2 1 photosynthesis both hedp and dtpmp affected the photosynthetic rate of scenedesmus sp lx1 as depicted in fig 3 a and 3b p m of the algae decreased with increase in phosphonate concentrations at 4 d this observation suggests that photosynthetic oxygen evolution of the algae is affected by the phosphonates although the algal growth is not inhibited significantly at the initial stage much lower p m was observed after 10 d of cultivation p 0 05 indicating severe inhibition in algal photosynthetic activity at the late stage notably oxygen evolution was still detectable when the algal growth was completely inhibited demonstrating that algal photosynthesis was not shut down even under extremely high phosphonate concentrations ph change is an indicator of algal capability to assimilate carbon dioxide via photosynthesis wang et al 2018 ph of the low phosphonate dosage groups i e 30 mg l hedp and 20 mg l dtpmp increased to over 10 1 after 10 d of cultivation although the values were still slightly lower than those of the controls whereas the ph values remained below 8 7 during the entire cultivation period when the algal growth was seriously inhibited fig s3 these results further evidenced the inhibition of algal photosynthetic activity caused by the phosphonates in contrast to the trends of p m the chlorophyll a content of scenedesmus sp lx1 increased slightly with the phosphonate concentrations at 4 d fig 3c and 3d this was speculated as being a compensatory response to photosynthesis regulation against inhibition perreault et al 2012 wang et al 2018 the chlorophyll a content was still higher than that of the controls at 10 d p 0 05 when the algal growth was not severely inhibited i e hedp and dtpmp concentrations lower than 50 and 40 mg l respectively however sudden drops in chlorophyll a content were observed with further increase in the phosphonate concentrations we further investigated the changes in chlorophyll a content with cultivation time under high phosphonate concentrations fig s4 the chlorophyll a content of the algae increased by 1 5 times in the first 4 d and then decreased remarkably to only around 50 of their initial levels at the end of the 10 d of cultivation such a severe chlorophyll loss demonstrates a functional loss of the photosystem resulting in complete algal growth inhibition fig 1a and 1b 3 2 2 energy transfer and oxidative stress we investigated the changes in the levels of atp the molecular unit of currency of intracellular energy transfer knowles 1980 to reflect the inhibitory effects of the phosphonates on algal respiratory metabolism the algal samples were allowed to settle in the dark prior to measurement to eliminate the influence of photosynthesis as depicted in fig 4 a and 4b atp contents of the groups with the addition of 30 mg l hedp or 20 mg l dtpmp was similar to that of the controls p 0 05 higher phosphonate concentrations exhibited some effects on the atp content however the changes were mostly no more than 25 in addition the consumption of oxygen could be detected normally in all groups by the liquid phase oxygen measurement system these results demonstrate weak effects of the phosphonates on the algal energy transfer even if the growth of scenedesmus sp lx1 was seriously inhibited at 10 d sod activity is closely linked to the generation of reactive oxygen species in cells thereby reflecting the extent of algal oxidative stress the sod activities in all groups were lower than 7 9 u 107 cells during the entire cultivation time without significant increase fig 4c and 4d the trends in the controls and the groups with the addition of 30 mg l hedp or 20 mg l dtpmp were stationary sod activities in the groups with high phosphonate addition i e 75 mg l hedp and 60 mg l dtpmp decreased gradually with time due to the inhibition of algal growth in addition no structural damage of the algal cells was found through microscopy investigation therefore it could be inferred that the algae did not suffer from oxidative stress cellular damage is generally accompanied by the prominent changes in energy transfer and the increase in oxidative stress considering the close links with cell detoxification reparation and apoptosis wang et al 2018 xiong et al 2017 hedp and dtpmp had limited effect on cellular atp content and sod activity demonstrating weak intrinsic toxicities of the phosphonates to damage the algal cells 3 3 effect of iron complexation on algal growth inhibition the existence of hedp and dtpmp showed negative effects on algal photosynthesis leading to significant growth inhibition however their direct damage to the algal cells was negligible we speculated that the inhibition of algal photosynthesis might be attributed to the complexation of the phosphonates with metal ions iron plays a crucial role in photosynthesis one of the most noticeable effects of iron deficiency is the decrease in cellular content of chlorophyll a van oijen et al 2004 we investigated the influence of iron ions on algal growth after 10 d of cultivation with dosage of 75 mg l hedp or 60 mg l dtpmp the algal growth inhibition ratios exhibited significant difference under different concentrations of ammonium iron citrate p 0 05 the only iron source in the cultural media as depicted in fig 5 a and 5b for algal densities in the control groups see fig s5 under the standard iron concentration i e 6 1 μm i d of the algae were in a range of 60 70 similar to the results shown in fig 1 lower iron concentrations resulted in higher i d values when the concentration of iron ions increased to 30 7 μm the inhibition ratios decreased significantly to around 20 scenedesmus sp lx1 was completely released from the effect of growth inhibition when the iron concentration was 25 times that of the standard similar results were obtained when using iron sulfate as the sole iron source fig 5c and 5d the increase in the iron sulfate concentration effectively promoted algal growth eliminating the inhibitory effects of the phosphonates at an iron concentration of 153 6 μm we also found that addition of citric acid had negligible effects on mitigating the growth inhibition as i d values were similar under different citric acid concentrations fig 5e and 5f considering the very strong iron binding ability of the phosphonates nowack 2003 we concluded that the algal growth inhibition at the late stage of the cultivation was attributed to the deficiency of free iron ions that were complexed by the phosphonates iron is one of the essential structural elements that are closely linked to electron transfer reactions in the photosystem van oijen et al 2004 the functioning of the photosynthetic electron transport chain is hindered by iron starvation owing to the decrease in iron sulfur complexes such as ferredoxin geider and la roche 1994 mckay et al 1999 the deficiency of iron also leads to a decline in the content of cellular pigments involved in light harvesting e g chlorophyll a stefels and van leeuwe 1998 van oijen et al 2004 these negative effects lower the effective quantum yield of photosystem ii thereby reducing the photosynthetic efficiency in iron limited cells zhao et al 2018 3 4 mechanisms for the inhibitory effects of phosphonates on algal growth the proposed mechanisms for the inhibitory effects of hedp and dtpmp on algal growth are illustrated in fig 6 as the algal density is relatively low at the initial stage of cultivation the free iron ions in the cultural medium can support a normal algal growth even though most iron ions are complexed by the phosphonates fig 6a the demand for the iron ions rises exponentially with the increase in algal density whereas the free iron ions are consumed concurrently during cultivation the strong binding ability of the phosphonates blocks the assimilation of the complexed iron by the algae fig 6b the deficiency in iron ions limits algal growth leading to decreases in the algal growth rate and the maximum density microalgae stop growing when all the free iron ions are assimilated the different demands for the iron ions between strains result in distinct effective concentrations of the phosphonates on algal growth inhibition table 1 in addition assessment of inhibition of the phosphonates on algal growth is also affected by the iron concentration of the test medium this might be the main cause for the contradictory results in literature gledhill and feijtel 1992 hanstveit and oldersma 1996 jaworska et al 2002 the inhibition of photosynthesis caused by cellular iron deficiency hinders algal growth fig 6c however the intrinsic toxicity of the phosphonates is negligible the decline in the electron transport efficiency in the photosystem limits the photosynthetic activity including carbon dioxide assimilation and oxygen evolution subsequently the serious decline in cellular pigments such as chlorophyll a results in a functional loss of the photosystem for harvesting light energy therefore leading to a complete growth inhibition under high phosphonate concentration at the late stage of cultivation 3 5 environmental implications elucidating the underlying mechanisms of phosphonates on algal growth inhibition is of great significance to evaluate the potential aquatic risk of these antiscalants phosphonates are considered harmless to most aquatic organisms because of their low intrinsic toxicity and weak influences on cellular respiration for energy conversion and catabolism rott et al 2018 however their complexation on metal ions especially on iron ions can significantly inhibit the photosynthesis of autotrophic microalgae the irreplaceable primary producers of aquatic ecosystems therefore discharge of wastewater containing a high concentration of phosphonates may cause serious ecological impacts on the receiving water more importantly natural degradation of the phosphonates may induce harmful algal blooms because the release of both iron ions and phosphate can stimulate algal regrowth iron complexes are the predominant form of phosphonates in surface waters rott et al 2018 phosphonates can not only complex free iron ions but also dissolve the iron from sediments through weakening the iron oxygen bonds of the ligands nowack 2003 photolysis is the primary mechanism for the natural degradation of phosphonates rott et al 2018 and the complexation of iron ions accelerates this light mediated degradation process nowack 2003 the release of phosphate is also of vital concern considering the extremely low threshold concentration of 0 1 mg p l for inducing the harmful algal blooms schindler et al 2016 therefore microalgae are very likely to regrow after decomposition of phosphonate because i the phosphonates have weak intrinsic toxicity to damage the algal cells and ii the decomposition process provides free iron ions and phosphate the nutrients necessary for algal growth in addition phosphonates tend to adsorb onto sediments fischer 1992 steber and wierich 1986 their resuspension from the sediments in shallow lakes also increases the risk of harmful algal blooms even though the nutrients in the water body are controlled qin et al 2020 high concentrations of phosphonates are dosed continuously in ro systems to prevent membrane scaling tang et al 2014 wang et al 2019 in addition phosphonates are also used widely for producing textile and paper conditioning of cooling water and electroplating rott et al 2018 despite the high potential aquatic risk low biodegradability of phosphonate containing wastewaters such as ro concentrate limits their treatment and disposal using traditional methods chen et al 2020 umar et al 2015 therefore we recommend prior removal of the phosphonates and their derived nutrients from the wastewaters using advanced treatment methods such as advanced oxidation processes huang et al 2019 rott et al 2017 followed by microalgal cultivation wang et al 2020 before their discharge into water bodies to minimize the potential environmental impacts 4 conclusions in this study we assessed the inhibitory effects of two typical phosphonates hedp and dtpmp on microalgae growth and revealed the mechanisms involved in both intrinsic toxicity and complexation the influence of the phosphonates on scenedesmus sp lx1 was negligible at the initial cultivation stage 0 to 4 d in contrast the inhibitory effects on subsequent algal growth was significant with 10 d ec50 of 57 6 and 35 7 mg l for hedp and dtpmp respectively k and r max of the algae decreased suddenly when the phosphonates breached the threshold concentrations indicating complete growth inhibition furthermore the other two algal strains were more sensitive to the phosphonates than scenedesmus sp lx1 for which the noec was lower than 9 mg l hedp and dtpmp inhibited the growth of scenedesmus sp lx1 through complexing with the iron ions to block their utilization by the algae serious iron deficiency hindered algal photosynthesis the limitation of photosynthetic activity including carbon dioxide assimilation and oxygen evolution followed by the decrease in chlorophyll a content resulted in a functional loss of the algal photosystem for harvesting light energy at the late stage of cultivation in addition hedp and dtpmp had little effect on the cellular atp content and sod activity demonstrating weak intrinsic toxicities of the phosphonates to damage the algal cells our findings point to a potential ecological impact of phosphonates to induce harmful algal blooms by releasing not only phosphates but also free iron ions that stimulate algal regrowth when the phosphonates decompose naturally declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the submitted work titled assessment and mechanisms of microalgae growth inhibition by phosphonates effects of intrinsic toxicity and
