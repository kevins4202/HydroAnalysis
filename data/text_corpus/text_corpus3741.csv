18705,vacuum ultraviolet ultraviolet chlorine vuv uv chlorine is considered a novel advanced oxidation process aop but little is known about its kinetics for pollutant degradation in water treatment this study investigated the degradation of six typical pesticides namely dimethoate dmt atrazine atz prometon pmt propoxur ppx bromacil brm and propachlor ppc by vuv uv chlorine the results show that all pesticides were rapidly degraded by vuv uv chlorine with a high removal efficiency of over 95 after 60 s the pesticide degradation fitted well with pseudo first order reaction kinetics and a significant synergistic effect was observed during the vuv uv chlorine process the synergistic factor f v u cl for dmt atz pmt ppx brm and ppc were determined to be 1 75 1 70 2 06 1 57 2 84 and 1 61 respectively indicating a synergistic improvement of 57 184 for all pesticides as hydroxyl radical ho transformed into reactive chlorine species rcss the contribution ratio of rcss for the pesticide degradation was much higher than that of ho in the vuv uv chlorine process thus causing the synergistic effect solution ph ranging from 5 0 to 10 0 had various influence on the pesticide degradation by vuv uv chlorine as initial concentration of free chlorine increased from 0 to 0 25 mm the apparent rate constants of the pesticides kept on increasing while the f v u cl first increased and reached the highest value and decreased afterwards the formation of nitrite was significantly inhibited during the degradation of all pesticides by vuv uv chlorine it suggests that vuv uv chlorine is a promising aop for the pesticide degradation in water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords pesticide degradation vuv uv chlorine synergistic effect water treatment 1 introduction organic synthetic pesticides have been widely used for the control of pests and weeds since the discovery of insecticidal qualities of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt by swiss chemist paul h muller in 1939 since then the global annual pesticide consumption has generally kept on increasing zhang et al 2011 the large amounts of pesticides applied in agriculture has caused serious environmental problems all around the world many pesticides have been detected at worryingly high levels for example lisker et al 2011 monitored california s surface waters from 1991 to 2010 and found that five of twelve targeted organophosphorus pesticides including dimthoate dmt had been detected above the maximum concentration limits in the pacific salmonid habitats triazine pesticides e g atrazine atz and prometon pmt which usually have a long environmental persistence time of more than four years had been detected in many countries at levels ranging from 0 01 to 10 μg l 1 moreira et al 2016 liu et al 2018 chen et al 2018 other pesticides such as propoxur ppx bromacil brm and propachlor ppc have also been frequently detected at various concentrations in the aqueous environment guelfi et al 2017 hu et al 2019 gencten and ozcan 2015 although the pesticides detected in the aqueous environment usually have low concentrations they could pose great threats to human health for accumulative effect much work has been done on the pollutant degradation in water by advanced oxidation processes aops yola et al 2014 tian et al 2010 qiang et al 2010 among which ultraviolet uv and vacuum ultraviolet vuv based aops show many merits in small scale water treatment zoschke et al 2014 li et al 2017 2018 for example dong et al 2017 reported that the pseudo first order rate constant for the degradation of chloramphenicol by uv chlorine reached 0 016 s 1 which was 10 0 and 2 0 times of that of the sole uv and chlorination processes respectively the results of the study by fang et al 2014 indicate that hydroxyl radical ho and chlorine radical cl generated in situ strongly promoted the degradation of benzoic acid by uv chlorine uv is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength from 10 to 400 nm zoschke et al 2014 as a specific kind of uv vuv has an energetic short wavelength from 100 to 200 nm so it can be absorbed not only by the organic pollutants in aqueous solution but also directly by water when the h o bond of water is broken under vuv irradiation hydrogen atom h ho and hydrated electron e aq are formed eqs 1 and 2 gonzalez et al 2004 ho is a powerful oxidant with a high redox potential of 2 59 v koppenol and liebman 1984 and can effectively oxidize most of the organic pollutants besides vuv based process has merits of simple equipment and easy maintenance and therefore is considered a convenient aop for water treatment zoschke et al 2014 li et al 2016 1 h 2 o v u v h o h φ 185 n m 0 33 2 h 2 o v u v h o h e a q φ 185 n m 0 045 generally there are two kinds of vuv radiant sources that are related to the aop research and development one is the xenon excimer lamp emitting vuv at 172 nm as water has an extraordinarily high extinction coefficient of 550 cm 1 for 172 nm vuv the 172 nm vuv can be completely absorbed by water within 0 036 mm heit et al 1998 which strongly limits its practical application the other is the low pressure mercury lamp emiting 185 nm vuv which has a relatively low extinction coefficient of 1 8 cm 1 weeks et al 1963 and it is suitable for small scale drinking water treatment actually the low pressure mercury lamp emits both uv at 254 nm 90 intensity and vuv at 185 nm 10 intensity zoschke et al 2014 consequently we use the term vuv185 uv254 vuv uv for simplicity for the vuv based aops that use a low pressure mercury lamp as the radiant source as was done in this study li et al 2016 2017 yao et al 2017 wen et al 2018 since uv makes up most of the radiation that is emitted by the low pressure mercury lamp most of the input power would be wasted if the targeted pollutants have little or no uv absorbance therefore chemical oxidants such as h2o2 o3 and naclo are added to the solution to utilize the uv thus forming the corresponding uv oxidant process such as uv h2o2 uv o3 and uv chlorine respectively on one hand free radicals such as ho clo and o are formed when these oxidants are irradiated by uv causing the effective degradation of the pollutants that have little or no uv absorbance on the other hand synergistic effect between vuv uv and uv oxidants processes can be gained which significantly improves the degradation efficiency li et al 2016 therefore vuv uv chlorine process becomes attractive for pollutant degradation in drinking water however little work on the degradation kinetics and toxic byproduct formation during the vuv uv chlorine process has been done so far this study focus on the degradation kinetics of six selected pesticides by vuv uv chlorine synergistic effect during the vuv uv chlorine process was examined influencing factors including solution ph and initial concentration of free chlorine fc and formation of toxic byproduct nitrite were also evaluated 2 materials and

dr ehrenstorfer and propachlor ppc 99 8 sigma which have different chemical groups and properties table 1 were selected as the targeted pollutants in this study other chemicals were of at least analytical grade and were used without further purification all solutions were prepared with deionized di water throughout the experiments 2 2 experimental setup and reaction conditions a conventional annular photoreactor with a reaction volume of 400 ml was used as the experimental setup the inner diameter of the photoreactor was 6 0 cm and the effective height was 25 5 cm the whole photoreactor was seated on an electromagnetic stirrer to keep the aqueous solution well mixed low pressure mercury lamps geili co jiangsu province china were used as the vuv uv and uv radiant sources i e the vuv uv and uv lamps respectively the detailed relative emission intensity of the major wavelengths emitted by the vuv uv and uv lamps are shown in table s1 the vuv uv or uv lamp had an outer diameter of 4 0 cm so the thickness of irradiated layer was 1 0 cm which guaranteed the complete absorption of vuv the vuv uv or uv lamp was fixed at the center of the photoreactor and they had the same physical sizes and input power 12 w the only difference between the two lamps was the lamp wall the vuv uv lamp wall was made of high pure synthetic quartz which allowed the vuv to penetrate to reach the solution while the uv lamp wall was made of common silica which blocked the vuv the uv fluence rates of the two lamps were 84 mw cm 2 the vuv fluence rate of the vuv uv lamp was determined to be 5 8 mw cm 2 by using a previous method yang et al 2018a the experiments were conducted at a room temperature of 18 2 c as the reaction time was very short 60 s the temperature of the reaction solution only increased slightly approx 1 c during the degradation process each pesticide underwent degradation separately and the initial concentration was 10 μm the solution was stabilized at ph 7 0 by using a phosphate buffer fc with concentrations ranging from 0 to 0 25 mm was added to the solution just before the reaction started an aliquot sample was taken at an interval reaction time of 10 s and was then quenched with sodium hydrogen sulfite for analysis 2 3 analytical methods the pesticides were analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc ultimate 3000 dionex with a uv vis detector the mobile phase was a mixture of methanol 60 and water 40 other detection parameters are listed as follows injection volume 100 μl column temperature 40 c detection wavelength 210 nm the retention times for all the pesticides were within 15 min the concentration of nitrite was determined by a spectrophotometric method 5 ml sample was placed in a 10 ml volumetric flask then 2 ml p aminobenzene sulfonic acid solution 4 g l 1 was added the solution was mixed and kept standing for 5 min before 1 ml naphthalene ethylenediamine hydrochloride solution 2 g l 1 was added di water was added to the scale mark and the solution was kept standing for 15 min at last the absorbance of the solution was measured with a spectrophotometer 722 model sunny hengping scientific instrument co ltd shanghai china at 538 nm the concentration of fc was determined by the standard n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method apha 1998 3 results and discussion 3 1 pesticide degradation by uv chlorine uv and chlorination are two commonly used disinfection processes in drinking water treatment the two processes can also degrade many organic pollutants to some extent although at a relatively low rate dong et al 2017 cai et al 2019 when the two process are combined to form the uv chlorine process the degradation efficiency was significantly improved fig 1 the results indicate that pesticide degradation by uv chlorination and uv chlorine all followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics 3 ln c c 0 k a p p t where c and c 0 are the real time and initial concentrations of each pesticide respectively and k app s 1 is the apparent pseudo first order rate constant obviously the k app for the pesticide degradation by uv chlorine was much higher than that by uv or by chlorination for example the k app of atz by uv chlorine was 9 6 10 3 s 1 which was actually larger than the sum of that by uv 2 4 10 3 s 1 and by chlorination 3 3 10 3 s 1 to quantitatively demonstrate this synergistic effect a synergistic factor f for the uv chlorine process i e f u cl with the subscript representing the corresponding process was introduced li et al 2016 4 f u c l k u c l k u k c l where k u cl k u and k cl are the k app of the pesticide degradation by uv chlorine uv and chlorination processes respectively the f u cl values for the degradation of dmt atz pmt ppx brm and ppc were determined to be 2 03 1 70 2 37 1 46 1 44 and 1 36 respectively which means a synergistic improvement of 36 137 for all the pesticides 3 2 pesticide degradation by vuv uv chlorine when fc was introduced into the vuv uv process two aops namely vuv uv and uv chlorine were combined to form the vuv uv chlorine process fig 2 indicates that degradation of all pesticides by uv chlorine vuv uv and vuv uv chlorine also followed pseudo first order kinetics eq 3 the k app of dmt atz pmt ppx brm and ppc by vuv uv chlorine reached 0 114 0 064 0 049 0 092 0 054 and 0 073 s 1 respectively which were higher than the sum of those by vuv uv and by uv chlorine therefore the synergistic effect also existed in vuv uv chlorine process and could be described by eq 5 5 f v u c l k v u c l k v u k u c l k u where f v u cl is the synergistic factor for the pesticide degradation by vuv uv chlorine k v u cl and k v u are the k app of pesticide degradation by vuv uv chlorine and by vuv uv respectively the f v u cl of dmt atz pmt ppx brm and ppc were determined to be 1 75 1 70 2 06 1 57 2 84 and 1 61 respectively indicating a synergistic improvement of 57 184 for all pesticides actually the degradation efficiencies of all pesticides reached over 95 0 after the vuv uv chlorine treatment for 60 s 3 3 contribution of radicals like other aops the synergistic effect formed during the uv chlorine or vuv uv chlorine process was attributed to the free radicals generated in situ therefore the contribution of each kind of radical is of interest because water strongly absorbs 185 nm vuv with a high extinction coefficient and its concentration 55 6 m was extremely higher than that of the pesticides 10 μm little vuv was directly absorbed by the pesticides the main difference between the uv chlorine and vuv uv chlorine processes was that there were two additional ways to produce ho in the vuv uv chlorine process eqs 1 and 2 as the solution was buffered at ph 7 0 both hclo and clo existed in the solution according to eq 6 when hclo and clo absorbed uv powerful radicals such as ho and cl were formed eqs 7 10 fang et al 2014 6 h c l o η c l o p k a 7 5 7 h c l o u v η ο c l 8 c l o u v ο c l 9 o h 2 o η o η o k 9 1 8 10 6 m 1 s 1 10 c l h o η c l o k 10 1 8 10 10 m 1 s 1 concerning on contribution to degradation of pollutants these radicals can be classified into two major categories one is ho and the other is reactive chlorine species rcss dong et al 2017 therefore eq 3 is transformed into eq 11 11 ln c c 0 k a p p t k u k h o k r c s s t where k ho and k rcss are the apparent pseudo first order rate constants of the pesticide degradation by ho and rcss respectively k u k ho and k rcss represent the contributions of pesticide degradation by direct uv ho and rcss respectively k u can be determined with eq 12 12 ln c d c 0 d k u t where c d and c 0 d are the real time and initial concentrations of each pesticide in the uv process respectively k ho can be determined with eq 13 13 k ho k ho pes ho ss where ho ss is the steady state concentration of ho k ho pes is the second order rate constant between ho and each pesticide to determine the k ho pes value of each pesticide a competitive reaction was applied and para chlorobenzoic acid pcba was used as a model compound pcba has a known second order rate constant with ho 5 109 m 1 s 1 and its direct uv degradation was negligible kutschera et al 2009 besides the initial concentration of pcba was only 10 μm which was six orders of magnitude lower than that of water 55 6 m and water has a relatively high vuv extinction coefficient 1 8 cm 1 at 185 nm consequently the degradation of pcba by direct vuv photolysis can also be neglected when pcba was added to the pesticide solution during the vuv uv process where the influence of rcss was avoided its degradation also followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics 14 ln c p c b a c 0 p c b a k p c b a t k h o p c b a h o s s t where c p cba and c 0 pcba are the real time and initial concentrations of pcba respectively k p cba is apparent pseudo first order rate constant of pcba and k ho p cbais the second order rate constant between ho and pcba because there were no rcss in the vuv uv process eq 11 can be transformed into eq 15 15 ln c c 0 k v u t k u k h o t k u k h o p e s h o s s t combining eqs 12 14 and 15 one obtained eq 16 yang et al 2018b 16 ln c 0 c c d c 0 d k ho pes k ho p cba ln c 0 p cba c p cba fig 3 shows that ln c 0 c c d c 0 d had a good correlation with ln c 0 p cba c p cba according to the slope of the regression line the k ho pes values of dmt atz pmt ppx brm and ppc were determined to be 8 71 109 2 31 109 9 12 108 8 21 109 5 31 108 and 4 1 109 m 1 s 1 respectively as the second order rate constants between ho and pollutants usually ranges from 108 to 1010 m 1 s 1 esplugas et al 2002 the k ho pes values obtained in this study agreed well with the literature previously reported for example marin et al 2011 determined the k ho pes value of dmt to be 8 5 109 m 1 s 1 by using naphthalene as a competitive probe de laat et al 1994 and balci et al 2009 reported the k ho pes value of atz to be 2 4 109 and 2 54 0 22 109 m 1 s 1 respectively the high second order rate constants confirm that ho with a high oxidation potential is unselective in degrading a vast range of pollutants rcss however is much more selective in reacting with pollutants e g acetic acids and phenolic compounds dong et al 2017 because nitrobenzene nb has a high known second order rate constants with ho 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 but hardly reacts with rcss watts and linden 2007 it was chosen as a ho probe in both uv chlorine and vuv uv chlorine processes since the initial concentration of nb was also relatively low 10 μm its degradation by direct vuv was also negligible when nb was added to the reaction system its degradation can be described with eq 17 17 ln c n b c 0 n b k n b t k h o n b h o s s t where c nb and c 0 nb are the real time and initial concentrations of nb respectively k nb and k ho nb are the apparent pseudo first order and second order rate constants of nb now that k ho pes and k nb were determined k ho could be calculated by eliminating ho ss in eqs 13 and 17 fig 4 shows that k ho and k rcss were generally larger than k u in the uv chlorine process suggesting that the synergistic degradation of pesticides was mainly attributed to the generation of radicals k ho was higher than k rcss except in the case of ppx dong et al 2017 also reported that the contribution of ho was larger than that of rcss for the degradation of chloramphenicol by uv chlorine the results demonstrate the importance of ho for the degradation of pollutants in the uv chlorine process the production of ho was further enhanced via eqs 1 and 2 when vuv was introduced in the vuv uv chlorine process k ho and k rcss therefore increased dramatically fig 4 resulting in the synergistic degradation of pesticides by vuv uv chlorine to quantitatively study the individual contributions of uv ho and rcss contribution ratio r was defined as follows 18 r k i k a p p k i k u k h o k r c s s 100 where k i stands for k u k ho or k rcss to calculate the contributions of uv ho and rcss respectively the contribution ratios of uv for all pesticides decreased from 8 to 31 in uv chlorine process to 1 6 in vuv uv chlorine process table 2 this was because uv had a similar k u in both processes but the whole k app in vuv uv chlorine was much larger than that in uv chlorine although the k ho was remarkably higher by vuv uv chlorine than that by uv chlorine fig 4 the contribution ratio of ho was lower in the former process than that in the latter process actually the contribution ratio of ho was even lower than that of rcss in vuv uv chlorine process table 2 this can be explained by the reason that ho reacted with fc to produce rcss eqs 19 21 to confirm this 10 mm tert butanol tba which is a well known ho scavenger was added to the reaction solution fig 5 shows that the decay of fc during the pesticide degradation by uv chlorine and vuv uv chlorine in the present or absent of tba shows a similar tendency for all pesticides the pseudo first order rate constant for the decay of fc by vuv uv was almost equal to that by uv at the present of tba which suggests that the direct photolysis of fc by vuv was negligible however when no tba was added the pseudo first order rate constant for the decay of fc by vuv uv was significantly higher than that by uv it proves that reacting with ho was an important reason for the decay of fc during the vuv uv chlorine process consequently larger amounts of rcss were generated via eqs 19 21 causing the higher contribution of rcss 19 η ο c l o c l ο h o k 19 8 2 10 9 m 1 s 1 20 η ο h c l o c l ο h 2 o k 20 3 0 10 9 m 1 s 1 21 η ο c l h c l ο k 21 4 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 22 η ο η h 2 ο k 22 1 5 10 10 m 1 s 1 since water has a high extinction coefficient of 1 8 cm 1 for 185 nm vuv 90 of it will be absorbed by water within an optical path of 0 55 cm i e the near field region moreover ho is very reactive and has a short lifetime so its reaction with the pesticides was limited in this region and most of the ho produced by vuv photolysis of water would recombine with h to form water eq 22 heit et al 1998 however when fc which had a much larger molar concentration than the pesticides was added to the reaction system it reacted with ho to produce the less reactive rcss that have longer lifetimes thereafter these rcss diffused across the near field region to react with the pesticides which otherwise would not get degraded by ho in the near field region heit et al 1998 this was tantamount to increasing the utilization ratio of ho and probably was the reason for the synergistic effect formed during the pesticide degradation by vuv uv chlorine li et al 2018 fig 4 also shows that all pesticides had different values of k u k ho and k rcss even under the same reaction conditions this can be explained by their unique chemical structures for instance although dmt had high k app values in both the two processes it had a relatively low k u value this was because dmt has no conjugated structure table 1 and therefore its absorbance of uv at 254 nm was insignificant fig s1 however the s p bond of dmt could be easily broken by radical attack yao et al 2011 tian et al 2014 causing its high k ho and k rcss values the reason for the relatively low k app values of atz and pmt both of which belong to triazine pesticides was that they have stable six membered heterocyclic structure the heterocyclic structure might react slowly with rcss so the rcss contribution for the degradation of atz and pmt were quit low compared with other pesticides table 2 although much ho would transform to rcss in the vuv uv chlorine process 3 4 effect of ph the solution ph strongly affected the formation of free radicals and the ionization of organic pollutants li et al 2016 and therefore it exerted great influence on the pesticide degradation by vuv uv chlorine fig 6 the k app of most of the selected pesticides namely dmt atz pmt and ppc decreased when solution ph increased from 5 0 to 10 0 according to the pk a values of these four pesticides table 1 they remained in neutral forms throughout this ph range so their uv absorbance did not change during the ph range studied fig s1 therefore the degreasing of k app was attributed to the reactivity of radicals on one hand ho has a higher redox potential in the acidic conditions than that in the alkaline conditions koppenol and liebman 1984 on the other hand ho produced by vuv photolysis of water had a higher quasi stationary state concentration in the acidic conditions yang et al 2018a as eq 6 has a pk a value of 7 5 acidity favored the formation of hclo hclo had a larger uv absorbance fig s1 and quantum yield for the generation of rcss than clo deborde and von gunten 2008 thus enhancing the pesticide degradation in the acidic ph range although the k app of other two pesticides namely brm and ppx also decreased when solution ph increased from 5 0 to 7 0 in the acidic ph range they behaved differently from other four pesticides in the alkaline ph range fig 6 shows that the k app of brm increased slightly from 0 052 to 0 056 s 1 and that of ppx increased significantly from 0 092 to 0 11 s 1 this was because the amine moiety of brm which has a pk a value of 8 3 would get deprotonated in the alkaline conditions and therefore favored the electrophilic attack of ho and rcss besides the higher uv absorbance of brm in the alkaline conditions fig s1 also promoted the direct uv photolysis of brm these factors offset the adverse impact of alkalinity on the reactivity of radicals as discussed above and consequently the k app of brm stopped decreasing in the alkaline conditions although ppx has a high pk a value of 11 9 and would remain neutral in ph range from 7 0 to 10 0 its carbamic group was easily hydrolyzed in the alkaline conditions which might be the reason for the increasing of its rate constant yang et al 2018b 3 5 effect of fc the initial concentration of fc was an important factor in vuv uv chlorine process fig 7 a shows that as the initial concentration of fc increased from 0 to 0 25 mm the k app of dmt atz pmt ppx brm and ppc increased remarkably from 0 047 0 03 0 016 0 059 0 014 and 0 038 s 1 to 0 13 0 07 0 054 0 098 0 06 and 0 077 s 1 respectively this was because fc was the main source for the production of radicals that accounted for the pesticide degradation and as a strong oxidant fc itself could degrade the pesticides to some extent hence high initial concentration of fc resulted in high k app value however the influence of initial concentration of fc on the f v u cl provides a new perspective compared with an increasing function of k app as the concentration of fc fig 7a the f v u cl was a concave function of the initial concentration of fc and it had a maximum value at an initial fc concentration of 0 15 or 0 20 mm fig 7b the reason was that when the fc concentration was in the low concentration range i e 0 0 15 mm in the cases of atz and ppx and 0 0 20 mm in the cases of dmt pmt brm and ppc increasing of fc concentration promoted the production of rcss by uv photolysis of fc eqs 7 9 the transformation of ho to rcss eqs 19 21 and the direct oxidation of pesticides by fc however when the initial fc concentration was higher than the optimal value i e 0 15 mm in the cases of atz and ppx and 0 20 mm in the cases of dmt pmt brm and ppc the transformation of ho to rcss was inhibited this was because the stationary state concentration of ho was limited and excessive fc could act as radical scavenger dong et al 2017 therefore a highest f v u cl value was obtained when initial fc concentration reached the optimal value although meanwhile the k app kept on increasing 3 6 formation of nitrite the formation of nitrite a well known carcinogen via oxidation of organic pollutants or reduction of nitrate during the vuv uv process is of much concern thomson et al 2004 buchanan et al 2008 however the addition of fc to the vuv uv process significantly abated the nitrite formation fig 8 shows that the highest concentration of nitrite formed during the degradation of dmt atz pmt ppx brm and ppc decreased from 5 2 24 5 18 3 4 2 7 6 and 1 4 μm in the vuv uv process to 1 5 3 9 4 3 0 95 1 5 and 0 32 μm in the vuv uv chlorine process respectively various concentrations of nitrite formed during the degradation of different pesticides were greatly related to their chemical structures for example the degradation of atz and pmt caused high nitrite concentration for the reason that they have the highest nitrogen content as the tertiary amine moiety of brm was difficult to decompose the least nitrite was formed among the selected pesticides although the k app of brm was not lowest fig 2 usually it has a highly oxidizing environment in the aop process so nitrate was expected to be formed ultimately during the degradation of nitrogen containing pesticides however nitrate can be easily reduced to nitrite under uv irradiation eqs 23 and 24 thomson et al 2004 which causes a problem for the practical application of vuv uv process when fc was introduced into the vuv uv process nitrite was oxidized to nitrate again by radicals e g ho and rcss and fc itself hence significantly abating the potential harm of nitrite 23 n o 3 h v n o 2 o 24 2 n o 2 h 2 o n o 2 n o 3 2 h 4 conclusion the degradation of six selected pesticides by vuv uv chlorine was examined the following conclusions can be drawn a significant synergistic effect was observed during the pesticide degradation by vuv uv chlorine the f v u cl values of all pesticides ranged from 1 57 to 2 84 indicating a synergistic improvement of 57 184 ho transformed into rcss in the vuv uv chlorine process which caused the higher contribution of rcss than that of ho and probably was the reason for the synergistic effect solution ph and initial fc concentration had various influence on the degradation of different pesticides by vuv uv chlorine formation of nitrite was significantly inhibited

prometon pmt which usually have a long environmental persistence time of more than four years had been detected in many countries at levels ranging from 0 01 to 10 μg l 1 moreira et al 2016 liu et al 2018 chen et al 2018 other pesticides such as propoxur ppx bromacil brm and propachlor ppc have also been frequently detected at various concentrations in the aqueous environment guelfi et al 2017 hu et al 2019 gencten and ozcan 2015 although the pesticides detected in the aqueous environment usually have low concentrations they could pose great threats to human health for accumulative effect much work has been done on the pollutant degradation in water by advanced oxidation processes aops yola et al 2014 tian et al 2010 qiang et al 2010 among which ultraviolet uv and vacuum ultraviolet vuv based aops show many merits in small scale water treatment zoschke et al 2014 li et al 2017 2018 for example dong et al 2017 reported that the pseudo first order rate constant for the degradation of chloramphenicol by uv chlorine reached 0 016 s 1 which was 10 0 and 2 0 times of that of the sole uv and chlorination processes respectively the results of the study by fang et al 2014 indicate that hydroxyl radical ho and chlorine radical cl generated in situ strongly promoted the degradation of benzoic acid by uv chlorine uv is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength from 10 to 400 nm zoschke et al 2014 as a specific kind of uv vuv has an energetic short wavelength from 100 to 200 nm so it can be absorbed not only by the organic pollutants in aqueous solution but also directly by water when the h o bond of water is broken under vuv irradiation hydrogen atom h ho and hydrated electron e aq are formed eqs 1 and 2 gonzalez et al 2004 ho is a powerful oxidant with a high redox potential of 2 59 v koppenol and liebman 1984 and can effectively oxidize most of the organic pollutants besides vuv based process has merits of simple equipment and easy maintenance and therefore is considered a convenient aop for water treatment zoschke et al 2014 li et al 2016 1 h 2 o v u v h o h φ 185 n m 0 33 2 h 2 o v u v h o h e a q φ 185 n m 0 045 generally there are two kinds of vuv radiant sources that are related to the aop research and development one is the xenon excimer lamp emitting vuv at 172 nm as water has an extraordinarily high extinction coefficient of 550 cm 1 for 172 nm vuv the 172 nm vuv can be completely absorbed by water within 0 036 mm heit et al 1998 which strongly limits its practical application the other is the low pressure mercury lamp emiting 185 nm vuv which has a relatively low extinction coefficient of 1 8 cm 1 weeks et al 1963 and it is suitable for small scale drinking water treatment actually the low pressure mercury lamp emits both uv at 254 nm 90 intensity and vuv at 185 nm 10 intensity zoschke et al 2014 consequently we use the term vuv185 uv254 vuv uv for simplicity for the vuv based aops that use a low pressure mercury lamp as the radiant source as was done in this study li et al 2016 2017 yao et al 2017 wen et al 2018 since uv makes up most of the radiation that is emitted by the low pressure mercury lamp most of the input power would be wasted if the targeted pollutants have little or no uv absorbance therefore chemical oxidants such as h2o2 o3 and naclo are added to the solution to utilize the uv thus forming the corresponding uv oxidant process such as uv h2o2 uv o3 and uv chlorine respectively on one hand free radicals such as ho clo and o are formed when these oxidants are irradiated by uv causing the effective degradation of the pollutants that have little or no uv absorbance on the other hand synergistic effect between vuv uv and uv oxidants processes can be gained which significantly improves the degradation efficiency li et al 2016 therefore vuv uv chlorine process becomes attractive for pollutant degradation in drinking water however little work on the degradation kinetics and toxic byproduct formation during the vuv uv chlorine process has been done so far this study focus on the degradation kinetics of six selected pesticides by vuv uv chlorine synergistic effect during the vuv uv chlorine process was examined influencing factors including solution ph and initial concentration of free chlorine fc and formation of toxic byproduct nitrite were also evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals six typical pesticides i e dimethoate dmt 99 2 sigma atrazine atz 99 6 toronto research chemicals inc prometon pmt 99 2 sigma propoxur ppx 99 4 dr ehrenstorfer bromacil brm 99 0 dr ehrenstorfer and propachlor ppc 99 8 sigma which have different chemical groups and properties table 1 were selected as the targeted pollutants in this study other chemicals were of at least analytical grade and were used without further purification all solutions were prepared with deionized di water throughout the experiments 2 2 experimental setup and reaction conditions a conventional annular photoreactor with a reaction volume of 400 ml was used as the experimental setup the inner diameter of the photoreactor was 6 0 cm and the effective height was 25 5 cm the whole photoreactor was seated on an electromagnetic stirrer to keep the aqueous solution well mixed low pressure mercury lamps geili co jiangsu province china were used as the vuv uv and uv radiant sources i e the vuv uv and uv lamps respectively the detailed relative emission intensity of the major wavelengths emitted by the vuv uv and uv lamps are shown in table s1 the vuv uv or uv lamp had an outer diameter of 4 0 cm so the thickness of irradiated layer was 1 0 cm which guaranteed the complete absorption of vuv the vuv uv or uv lamp was fixed at the center of the photoreactor and they had the same physical sizes and input power 12 w the only difference between the two lamps was the lamp wall the vuv uv lamp wall was made of high pure synthetic quartz which allowed the vuv to penetrate to reach the solution while the uv lamp wall was made of common silica which blocked the vuv the uv fluence rates of the two lamps were 84 mw cm 2 the vuv fluence rate of the vuv uv lamp was determined to be 5 8 mw cm 2 by using a previous method yang et al 2018a the experiments were conducted at a room temperature of 18 2 c as the reaction time was very short 60 s the temperature of the reaction solution only increased slightly approx 1 c during the degradation process each pesticide underwent degradation separately and the initial concentration was 10 μm the solution was stabilized at ph 7 0 by using a phosphate buffer fc with concentrations ranging from 0 to 0 25 mm was added to the solution just before the reaction started an aliquot sample was taken at an interval reaction time of 10 s and was then quenched with sodium hydrogen sulfite for analysis 2 3 analytical methods the pesticides were analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc ultimate 3000 dionex with a uv vis detector the mobile phase was a mixture of methanol 60 and water 40 other detection parameters are listed as follows injection volume 100 μl column temperature 40 c detection wavelength 210 nm the retention times for all the pesticides were within 15 min the concentration of nitrite was determined by a spectrophotometric method 5 ml sample was placed in a 10 ml volumetric flask then 2 ml p aminobenzene sulfonic acid solution 4 g l 1 was added the solution was mixed and kept standing for 5 min before 1 ml naphthalene ethylenediamine hydrochloride solution 2 g l 1 was added di water was added to the scale mark and the solution was kept standing for 15 min at last the absorbance of the solution was measured with a spectrophotometer 722 model sunny hengping scientific instrument co ltd shanghai china at 538 nm the concentration of fc was determined by the standard n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method apha 1998 3 results and discussion 3 1 pesticide degradation by uv chlorine uv and chlorination are two commonly used disinfection processes in drinking water treatment the two processes can also degrade many organic pollutants to some extent although at a relatively low rate dong et al 2017 cai et al 2019 when the two process are combined to form the uv chlorine process the degradation efficiency was significantly improved fig 1 the results indicate that pesticide degradation by uv chlorination and uv chlorine all followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics 3 ln c c 0 k a p p t where c and c 0 are the real time and initial concentrations of each pesticide respectively and k app s 1 is the apparent pseudo first order rate constant obviously the k app for the pesticide degradation by uv chlorine was much higher than that by uv or by chlorination for example the k app of atz by uv chlorine was 9 6 10 3 s 1 which was actually larger than the sum of that by uv 2 4 10 3 s 1 and by chlorination 3 3 10 3 s 1 to quantitatively demonstrate this synergistic effect a synergistic factor f for the uv chlorine process i e f u cl with the subscript representing the corresponding process was introduced li et al 2016 4 f u c l k u c l k u k c l where k u cl k u and k cl are the k app of the pesticide degradation by uv chlorine uv and chlorination processes respectively the f u cl values for the degradation of dmt atz pmt ppx brm and ppc were determined to be 2 03 1 70 2 37 1 46 1 44 and 1 36 respectively which means a synergistic improvement of 36 137 for all the pesticides 3 2 pesticide degradation by vuv uv chlorine when fc was introduced into the vuv uv process two aops namely vuv uv and uv chlorine were combined to form the vuv uv chlorine process fig 2 indicates that degradation of all pesticides by uv chlorine vuv uv and vuv uv chlorine also followed pseudo first order kinetics eq 3 the k app of dmt atz pmt ppx brm and ppc by vuv uv chlorine reached 0 114 0 064 0 049 0 092 0 054 and 0 073 s 1 respectively which were higher than the sum of those by vuv uv and by uv chlorine therefore the synergistic effect also existed in vuv uv chlorine process and could be described by eq 5 5 f v u c l k v u c l k v u k u c l k u where f v u cl is the synergistic factor for the pesticide degradation by vuv uv chlorine k v u cl and k v u are the k app of pesticide degradation by vuv uv chlorine and by vuv uv respectively the f v u cl of dmt atz pmt ppx brm and ppc were determined to be 1 75 1 70 2 06 1 57 2 84 and 1 61 respectively indicating a synergistic improvement of 57 184 for all pesticides actually the degradation efficiencies of all pesticides reached over 95 0 after the vuv uv chlorine treatment for 60 s 3 3 contribution of radicals like other aops the synergistic effect formed during the uv chlorine or vuv uv chlorine process was attributed to the free radicals generated in situ therefore the contribution of each kind of radical is of interest because water strongly absorbs 185 nm vuv with a high extinction coefficient and its concentration 55 6 m was extremely higher than that of the pesticides 10 μm little vuv was directly absorbed by the pesticides the main difference between the uv chlorine and vuv uv chlorine processes was that there were two additional ways to produce ho in the vuv uv chlorine process eqs 1 and 2 as the solution was buffered at ph 7 0 both hclo and clo existed in the solution according to eq 6 when hclo and clo absorbed uv powerful radicals such as ho and cl were formed eqs 7 10 fang et al 2014 6 h c l o η c l o p k a 7 5 7 h c l o u v η ο c l 8 c l o u v ο c l 9 o h 2 o η o η o k 9 1 8 10 6 m 1 s 1 10 c l h o η c l o k 10 1 8 10 10 m 1 s 1 concerning on contribution to degradation of pollutants these radicals can be classified into two major categories one is ho and the other is reactive chlorine species rcss dong et al 2017 therefore eq 3 is transformed into eq 11 11 ln c c 0 k a p p t k u k h o k r c s s t where k ho and k rcss are the apparent pseudo first order rate constants of the pesticide degradation by ho and rcss respectively k u k ho and k rcss represent the contributions of pesticide degradation by direct uv ho and rcss respectively k u can be determined with eq 12 12 ln c d c 0 d k u t where c d and c 0 d are the real time and initial concentrations of each pesticide in the uv process respectively k ho can be determined with eq 13 13 k ho k ho pes ho ss where ho ss is the steady state concentration of ho k ho pes is the second order rate constant between ho and each pesticide to determine the k ho pes value of each pesticide a competitive reaction was applied and para chlorobenzoic acid pcba was used as a model compound pcba has a known second order rate constant with ho 5 109 m 1 s 1 and its direct uv degradation was negligible kutschera et al 2009 besides the initial concentration of pcba was only 10 μm which was six orders of magnitude lower than that of water 55 6 m and water has a relatively high vuv extinction coefficient 1 8 cm 1 at 185 nm consequently the degradation of pcba by direct vuv photolysis can also be neglected when pcba was added to the pesticide solution during the vuv uv process where the influence of rcss was avoided its degradation also followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics 14 ln c p c b a c 0 p c b a k p c b a t k h o p c b a h o s s t where c p cba and c 0 pcba are the real time and initial concentrations of pcba respectively k p cba is apparent pseudo first order rate constant of pcba and k ho p cbais the second order rate constant between ho and pcba because there were no rcss in the vuv uv process eq 11 can be transformed into eq 15 15 ln c c 0 k v u t k u k h o t k u k h o p e s h o s s t combining eqs 12 14 and 15 one obtained eq 16 yang et al 2018b 16 ln c 0 c c d c 0 d k ho pes k ho p cba ln c 0 p cba c p cba fig 3 shows that ln c 0 c c d c 0 d had a good correlation with ln c 0 p cba c p cba according to the slope of the regression line the k ho pes values of dmt atz pmt ppx brm and ppc were determined to be 8 71 109 2 31 109 9 12 108 8 21 109 5 31 108 and 4 1 109 m 1 s 1 respectively as the second order rate constants between ho and pollutants usually ranges from 108 to 1010 m 1 s 1 esplugas et al 2002 the k ho pes values obtained in this study agreed well with the literature previously reported for example marin et al 2011 determined the k ho pes value of dmt to be 8 5 109 m 1 s 1 by using naphthalene as a competitive probe de laat et al 1994 and balci et al 2009 reported the k ho pes value of atz to be 2 4 109 and 2 54 0 22 109 m 1 s 1 respectively the high second order rate constants confirm that ho with a high oxidation potential is unselective in degrading a vast range of pollutants rcss however is much more selective in reacting with pollutants e g acetic acids and phenolic compounds dong et al 2017 because nitrobenzene nb has a high known second order rate constants with ho 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 but hardly reacts with rcss watts and linden 2007 it was chosen as a ho probe in both uv chlorine and vuv uv chlorine processes since the initial concentration of nb was also relatively low 10 μm its degradation by direct vuv was also negligible when nb was added to the reaction system its degradation can be described with eq 17 17 ln c n b c 0 n b k n b t k h o n b h o s s t where c nb and c 0 nb are the real time and initial concentrations of nb respectively k nb and k ho nb are the apparent pseudo first order and second order rate constants of nb now that k ho pes and k nb were determined k ho could be calculated by eliminating ho ss in eqs 13 and 17 fig 4 shows that k ho and k rcss were generally larger than k u in the uv chlorine process suggesting that the synergistic degradation of pesticides was mainly attributed to the generation of radicals k ho was higher than k rcss except in the case of ppx dong et al 2017 also reported that the contribution of ho was larger than that of rcss for the degradation of chloramphenicol by uv chlorine the results demonstrate the importance of ho for the degradation of pollutants in the uv chlorine process the production of ho was further enhanced via eqs 1 and 2 when vuv was introduced in the vuv uv chlorine process k ho and k rcss therefore increased dramatically fig 4 resulting in the synergistic degradation of pesticides by vuv uv chlorine to quantitatively study the individual contributions of uv ho and rcss contribution ratio r was defined as follows 18 r k i k a p p k i k u k h o k r c s s 100 where k i stands for k u k ho or k rcss to calculate the contributions of uv ho and rcss respectively the contribution ratios of uv for all pesticides decreased from 8 to 31 in uv chlorine process to 1 6 in vuv uv chlorine process table 2 this was because uv had a similar k u in both processes but the whole k app in vuv uv chlorine was much larger than that in uv chlorine although the k ho was remarkably higher by vuv uv chlorine than that by uv chlorine fig 4 the contribution ratio of ho was lower in the former process than that in the latter process actually the contribution ratio of ho was even lower than that of rcss in vuv uv chlorine process table 2 this can be explained by the reason that ho reacted with fc to produce rcss eqs 19 21 to confirm this 10 mm tert butanol tba which is a well known ho scavenger was added to the reaction solution fig 5 shows that the decay of fc during the pesticide degradation by uv chlorine and vuv uv chlorine in the present or absent of tba shows a similar tendency for all pesticides the pseudo first order rate constant for the decay of fc by vuv uv was almost equal to that by uv at the present of tba which suggests that the direct photolysis of fc by vuv was negligible however when no tba was added the pseudo first order rate constant for the decay of fc by vuv uv was significantly higher than that by uv it proves that reacting with ho was an important reason for the decay of fc during the vuv uv chlorine process consequently larger amounts of rcss were generated via eqs 19 21 causing the higher contribution of rcss 19 η ο c l o c l ο h o k 19 8 2 10 9 m 1 s 1 20 η ο h c l o c l ο h 2 o k 20 3

water within an optical path of 0 55 cm i e the near field region moreover ho is very reactive and has a short lifetime so its reaction with the pesticides was limited in this region and most of the ho produced by vuv photolysis of water would recombine with h to form water eq 22 heit et al 1998 however when fc which had a much larger molar concentration than the pesticides was added to the reaction system it reacted with ho to produce the less reactive rcss that have longer lifetimes thereafter these rcss diffused across the near field region to react with the pesticides which otherwise would not get degraded by ho in the near field region heit et al 1998 this was tantamount to increasing the utilization ratio of ho and probably was the reason for the synergistic effect formed during the pesticide degradation by vuv uv chlorine li et al 2018 fig 4 also shows that all pesticides had different values of k u k ho and k rcss even under the same reaction conditions this can be explained by their unique chemical structures for instance although dmt had high k app values in both the two processes it had a relatively low k u value this was because dmt has no conjugated structure table 1 and therefore its absorbance of uv at 254 nm was insignificant fig s1 however the s p bond of dmt could be easily broken by radical attack yao et al 2011 tian et al 2014 causing its high k ho and k rcss values the reason for the relatively low k app values of atz and pmt both of which belong to triazine pesticides was that they have stable six membered heterocyclic structure the heterocyclic structure might react slowly with rcss so the rcss contribution for the degradation of atz and pmt were quit low compared with other pesticides table 2 although much ho would transform to rcss in the vuv uv chlorine process 3 4 effect of ph the solution ph strongly affected the formation of free radicals and the ionization of organic pollutants li et al 2016 and therefore it exerted great influence on the pesticide degradation by vuv uv chlorine fig 6 the k app of most of the selected pesticides namely dmt atz pmt and ppc decreased when solution ph increased from 5 0 to 10 0 according to the pk a values of these four pesticides table 1 they remained in neutral forms throughout this ph range so their uv absorbance did not change during the ph range studied fig s1 therefore the degreasing of k app was attributed to the reactivity of radicals on one hand ho has a higher redox potential in the acidic conditions than that in the alkaline conditions koppenol and liebman 1984 on the other hand ho produced by vuv photolysis of water had a higher quasi stationary state concentration in the acidic conditions yang et al 2018a as eq 6 has a pk a value of 7 5 acidity favored the formation of hclo hclo had a larger uv absorbance fig s1 and quantum yield for the generation of rcss than clo deborde and von gunten 2008 thus enhancing the pesticide degradation in the acidic ph range although the k app of other two pesticides namely brm and ppx also decreased when solution ph increased from 5 0 to 7 0 in the acidic ph range they behaved differently from other four pesticides in the alkaline ph range fig 6 shows that the k app of brm increased slightly from 0 052 to 0 056 s 1 and that of ppx increased significantly from 0 092 to 0 11 s 1 this was because the amine moiety of brm which has a pk a value of 8 3 would get deprotonated in the alkaline conditions and therefore favored the electrophilic attack of ho and rcss besides the higher uv absorbance of brm in the alkaline conditions fig s1 also promoted the direct uv photolysis of brm these factors offset the adverse impact of alkalinity on the reactivity of radicals as discussed above and consequently the k app of brm stopped decreasing in the alkaline conditions although ppx has a high pk a value of 11 9 and would remain neutral in ph range from 7 0 to 10 0 its carbamic group was easily hydrolyzed in the alkaline conditions which might be the reason for the increasing of its rate constant yang et al 2018b 3 5 effect of fc the initial concentration of fc was an important factor in vuv uv chlorine process fig 7 a shows that as the initial concentration of fc increased from 0 to 0 25 mm the k app of dmt atz pmt ppx brm and ppc increased remarkably from 0 047 0 03 0 016 0 059 0 014 and 0 038 s 1 to 0 13 0 07 0 054 0 098 0 06 and 0 077 s 1 respectively this was because fc was the main source for the production of radicals that accounted for the pesticide degradation and as a strong oxidant fc itself could degrade the pesticides to some extent hence high initial concentration of fc resulted in high k app value however the influence of initial concentration of fc on the f v u cl provides a new perspective compared with an increasing function of k app as the concentration of fc fig 7a the f v u cl was a concave function of the initial concentration of fc and it had a maximum value at an initial fc concentration of 0 15 or 0 20 mm fig 7b the reason was that when the fc concentration was in the low concentration range i e 0 0 15 mm in the cases of atz and ppx and 0 0 20 mm in the cases of dmt pmt brm and ppc increasing of fc concentration promoted the production of rcss by uv photolysis of fc eqs 7 9 the transformation of ho to rcss eqs 19 21 and the direct oxidation of pesticides by fc however when the initial fc concentration was higher than the optimal value i e 0 15 mm in the cases of atz and ppx and 0 20 mm in the cases of dmt pmt brm and ppc the transformation of ho to rcss was inhibited this was because the stationary state concentration of ho was limited and excessive fc could act as radical scavenger dong et al 2017 therefore a highest f v u cl value was obtained when initial fc concentration reached the optimal value although meanwhile the k app kept on increasing 3 6 formation of nitrite the formation of nitrite a well known carcinogen via oxidation of organic pollutants or reduction of nitrate during the vuv uv process is of much concern thomson et al 2004 buchanan et al 2008 however the addition of fc to the vuv uv process significantly abated the nitrite formation fig 8 shows that the highest concentration of nitrite formed during the degradation of dmt atz pmt ppx brm and ppc decreased from 5 2 24 5 18 3 4 2 7 6 and 1 4 μm in the vuv uv process to 1 5 3 9 4 3 0 95 1 5 and 0 32 μm in the vuv uv chlorine process respectively various concentrations of nitrite formed during the degradation of different pesticides were greatly related to their chemical structures for example the degradation of atz and pmt caused high nitrite concentration for the reason that they have the highest nitrogen content as the tertiary amine moiety of brm was difficult to decompose the least nitrite was formed among the selected pesticides although the k app of brm was not lowest fig 2 usually it has a highly oxidizing environment in the aop process so nitrate was expected to be formed ultimately during the degradation of nitrogen containing pesticides however nitrate can be easily reduced to nitrite under uv irradiation eqs 23 and 24 thomson et al 2004 which causes a problem for the practical application of vuv uv process when fc was introduced into the vuv uv process nitrite was oxidized to nitrate again by radicals e g ho and rcss and fc itself hence significantly abating the potential harm of nitrite 23 n o 3 h v n o 2 o 24 2 n o 2 h 2 o n o 2 n o 3 2 h 4 conclusion the degradation of six selected pesticides by vuv uv chlorine was examined the following conclusions can be drawn a significant synergistic effect was observed during the pesticide degradation by vuv uv chlorine the f v u cl values of all pesticides ranged from 1 57 to 2 84 indicating a synergistic improvement of 57 184 ho transformed into rcss in the vuv uv chlorine process which caused the higher contribution of rcss than that of ho and probably was the reason for the synergistic effect solution ph and initial fc concentration had various influence on the degradation of different pesticides by vuv uv chlorine formation of nitrite was significantly inhibited during the vuv uv chlorine process vuv uv chlorine is a promising aop for the pesticide degradation in water treatment conflicts of interest we declare that we do not have any commercial or

18706,the photolysis of chlorine by uv light leads to the formation of the hydroxyl radicals oh as well as reactive chlorine species rcs that can be effective as advanced oxidation processes aops for water treatment much of the research to date has been done at laboratory or bench scale this study reports results from a model that demonstrates that the relative effectiveness of the uv cl2 aop compared to the more traditional uv h2o2 aop is a function of optical path length as such the relative effectiveness of the two treatment options evaluated at small scale may not reflect the relative performance at full scale making results previously obtained at small scale potentially less scalable this study therefore compares the performance of uv cl2 to uv h2o2 at a full scale water treatment plant using sucralose and caffeine as spiked surrogates for contaminants that are reactive solely to oh radicals and to both oh and rcs respectively ph was varied between 6 5 and 8 0 the results demonstrated that when using a medium pressure uv lamp uv cl2 might lead to approximately twice the production of oh radicals as uv h2o2 at ph 6 5 when using the same molar oxidant concentration but adding chlorine to the uv reactor at ph 8 0 had a negligible impact on oh radical concentration in comparison to uv alone the study also confirmed previous small scale results that rcs can be a major contributor to uv cl2 treatment for compounds such as caffeine that are susceptible to rcs with uv cl2 effective at both ph 6 5 and 8 0 for such compounds disinfection byproducts were monitored with adsorbable organohalide aox formation increasing by approximately 10 μg cl l due to chlorine photolysis but only at ph 6 5 and not at ph 8 0 this implies that uv cl2 might increase aox mostly due to reaction between oh and organic precursors to make them more reactive with chlorine and not due to rcs the formation of specific dbps of current or emerging regulatory interest was minimal under all conditions except for chlorate chlorate yields were in the order of 6 18 of the photolysed chlorine graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv advanced oxidation caffeine sucralose disinfection byproducts 1 introduction there is increasing interest in the uv cl2 advanced oxidation process aop for both drinking water treatment and water reuse applications due to a possible lower cost and operational advantages compared to the more traditional uv hydrogen peroxide aop recent research has demonstrated that uv cl2 can be very effective at the destruction of a wide range of contaminants that are difficult to control through more conventional means dong et al 2017 li et al 2017 pan et al 2017 shu et al 2014 wang et al 2015a wu et al 2017 xiang et al 2016 a comparison of the effectiveness of the uv h2o2 and the uv cl2 aops has been conducted theoretically using mathematical models fang 2016 wang et al 2012 2017 as well as experimentally at bench and pilot scale guo et al 2018 jin 2010 shu et al 2014 wang et al 2015a b in general uv cl2 was observed to outperform uv h2o2 at low ph e g below 6 where chlorine exists primarily as hocl unless the target contaminant is particularly susceptible to reactive chlorine species rcs that are formed during chlorine photolysis in which case uv cl2 can remain very effective at neutral or even basic ph kong et al 2018 miklos et al 2019 wu et al 2017 however there has been very little full scale comparison of uv cl2 to uv h2o2 to confirm the trends observed in the laboratory one full scale study using medium pressure polychromatic uv light wang et al 2015b suggested that uv cl2 might be competitive at higher than expected ph values with geosmin degradation by uv cl2 comparable to that by uv h2o2 at ph 7 5 and 8 a possible explanation for the difference in uv cl2 performance relative to uv h2o2 at large scale compared to lab scale is that for polychromatic uv reactors their performances may be affected differently by uv reactor size i e uv path length a mathematical model described in the supporting information implies that the performance of polychromatic uv cl2 aop may be different in full scale reactors compared to bench or pilot scale reactors for the same applied uv and cl2 dose the reason is that the ratio of the cl2 absorbed photons over those absorbed by the whole water column is strongly dependent on the light path length for example in lake ontario water when the path length increases from 1 cm to 10 cm the ratio of the photons absorbed by 10 mg l of cl2 over those absorbed by the whole water column will approximately double due to chlorine s high uv absorptivity fig s1 relative to the background water at the higher wavelengths 350 nm in contrast for uv h2o2 the same path length increase will decrease the ratio of the photons absorbed by 10 mg l of h2o2 over those absorbed by the whole water column by 4 due to the fact that both h2o2 and the background water absorb most strongly at low wavelengths 260 nm and therefore these wavelengths do not penetrate far collins and bolton 2016 therefore a comparison of polychromatic uv cl2 against uv h2o2 conducted at bench scale will probably underestimate uv cl2 performance relative to uv h2o2 at full scale unless the increase in absorbance weighted uv fluence is properly factored into the scale up note that this does not apply to monochromatic low pressure uv reactors as discussed in the si the magnitude of this error however is difficult to estimate without a complete uv reactor model this may explain why a recent study springer et al 2018 showed that polychromatic uv cl2 performed better than uv alone in geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib degradation in their pilot scale study but the opposite was observed in their bench scale study it is therefore useful to experimentally compare the relative performance of uv cl2 and uv h2o at full scale to confirm the trends observed in previous bench and pilot scale work another concern with uv cl2 aop is the potential formation of disinfection byproducts dbps strictly speaking dbp is not an accurate term here as these byproducts are generated in treatment aimed at oxidation and not disinfection but to be consistent with previous studies the term will continue to be used previous bench scale studies using natural organic matter nom as the precursor pisarenko et al 2013 zhao et al 2011 observed no significant difference in the total organic halogen formation in uv cl2 treatment from that in dark chlorination contrary to that observed in wang et al 2015a s full scale study one possible explanation might be that the uv intensity in such small scale tests e g a collimated beam assembly is typically much lower than in a full scale system so aop uv doses take much longer to achieve many minutes vs seconds and dbp formation may therefore be dominated by long chlorine exposure and may mask the effects of uv irradiation in a full scale uv cl2 system dbp formation occurs within a few seconds of very intense uv light and this unique condition is best represented by full scale trials a full scale test to compare the effectiveness of uv h2o2 and uv cl2 and dbp formation was conducted at the lorne park water treatment plant in mississauga canada sucralose and caffeine were selected as the micropollutant surrogates with the former representative of compounds that are mainly reactive towards oh radical fang 2016 keen and linden 2013 lester et al 2014 and the latter being representative of those that are reactive towards both oh radicals and chlorine radicals sun et al 2016 wu et al 2017 the potential formation of dbps under the different treatment scenarios was compared and contrasted with the dbps including both those that are currently regulated as well as several emerging classes of dbps 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the chemicals used in this study were either food grade or nsf 60 certified 35 food chemical codex fcc grade

conducted using sigmastat and the p values were reported in the text p 0 05 indicates a significant difference while p 0 05 indicates otherwise 3 results and discussion 3 1 general comparison of uv cl2 to uv h2o2 the performance of uv cl2 and uv h2o2 in degrading sucralose and caffeine is shown in fig 2 sucralose degradation was more effective with uv cl2 than uv h2o2 at ph 6 5 but was outperformed by uv h2o2 at ph 8 0 for example at an equal molar concentration of the chemicals 10 mg l cl2 vs 5 mg l h2o2 and with all lamps on uv cl2 and uv h2o2 removed sucralose by 0 60 log and 0 29 log p 0 05 respectively at ph 6 5 as sucralose can be considered an oh radical probe fang 2016 keen and linden 2013 lester et al 2014 this implies that uv cl2 is more efficient than uv h2o2 in generating oh radical at ph 6 5 the ratio of the sucralose log removal by uv cl2 over that by uv h2o2 was 2 1 at ph 6 5 when equal molar concentration of the oxidant was applied which is within the range of the 2 5 ratio reported by the royce et al 2015 full scale test of 1 4 dioxane removal at ph 5 5 and the 1 5 2 3 ratios reported by wang et al 2015b in full scale tests of geosmin and 2 mib degradation at ph 6 5 all of these full scale studies indicate that uv cl2 is about twice as efficient in oh radical formation as uv h2o2 at acidic conditions e g 5 5 6 5 under the conditions tested a comparison of this ratio with that achieved at bench scale would be interesting as it would reveal the path length effect discussed earlier future tests are needed to isolate and evaluate the path length effects on the relative performance of uv cl2 to uv h2o2 at ph 8 0 uv cl2 degraded sucralose less than when using uv h2o2 p 0 05 for paired t test considering all three bpls as shown in fig 2a uv cl2 achieved a maximum of 0 11 log removal of sucralose approximately the same to 0 10 log removal achieved by uv alone at ph 8 0 this concluded that adding chlorine to the uv reactor at ph 8 0 did not contribute measurably to the oh radical formation note that in this study the term uv alone is used to include not only direct uv photolysis but also the potential formation of radicals from the photolysis of nitrate measured in this study at 2 3 0 8 mg l as no3 mack and bolton 1999 sharpless et al 2003 and the natural organic matter ishimitsu et al 1985 li et al 2016 these two additional pathways may explain the observed slight sucralose decay under uv exposure alone fig 2 compared to previous studies which found sucralose to be resistant to direct photolysis in otherwise pure water keen and linden 2013 lester et al 2014 on the other hand uv h2o2 achieved an average of 0 06 log more removal than uv cl2 when equal molar concentration of the oxidant was applied at ph 8 0 for caffeine which is reactive towards both oh radical and rcs sun et al 2016 wu et al 2017 uv cl2 achieved higher removals than uv h2o2 at both ph 6 5 and ph 8 0 at an equal molar concentration of the oxidants 10 mg l cl2 vs 5 mg l h2o2 the highest removals of caffeine by uv cl2 were 1 9 logs at ph 6 5 and 0 77 log at ph 8 0 versus uv h2o2 s 0 74 log at ph 6 5 and 0 59 log at ph 8 0 all acquired with a 100 uv bpl the sucralose degradation implies that uv cl2 may not be a preferred option at ph 8 0 for compounds that are reactive primarily with oh radical such as geosmin and 2 mib at least under the conditions tested here fang et al 2018 in contrast the caffeine degradation at ph 8 0 shows that uv cl2 might be a more feasible option to destroy rcs reactive micro pollutants even at high ph such as certain antibiotics and drugs including nalidixic acid wu et al 2017 gemfibrozil and bezafibrate kong et al 2018 3 2 impact of oxidant dose and uv dose in a perfect uv reaction assuming that the overall quantum yield of radical formation and uv fluence is constant doubling the h2o2 dose will lead to a doubling of the radical formation if the radical oxidation is purely pseudo first order a doubling of the h2o2 dose therefore leads to a theoretical doubling of the log reduction of the target compounds i e ratio of the log c co 2 in reality when taking the oh radical scavenging effect and the light filtering effect by h2o2 into consideration the theoretical ratio is closer to 1 8 when the h2o2 concentration increases from 5 mg l to 10 mg l under the conditions similar to those tested in this study see the calculation in the si as indicated in fig 3 a for caffeine degradation this was achieved at low uv power 50 uv bpl for h2o2 ratio 1 8 but the ratio decreased to 1 3 at higher uv power this implies that an increase of the chemical dose is more effective at low uv dose than at high uv dose for uv h2o2 which might be due to factors such as the enhanced depletion of h2o2 and the increased radical radical recombination at the high uv dose on the other hand for uv cl2 the ratio of the log reduction stayed in a narrow range of 1 1 1 3 when the chlorine dose was doubled from 5 mg l to 10 mg l the low ratio is presumably due to the oh radical scavenging effect by chlorine and its uv filtering effect this result is supported by our calculation see the calculation in the modeling the activator dose effect section of the si using the mathematical model reported by fang 2016 which predicts a 30 increase in net oh radical production production minus oxidant scavenging at ph 6 5 but no increase at ph 8 0 when the chlorine dose increases from 5 mg l to 10 mg l under the conditions tested this implies that a low chlorine dose such as 5 mg l in this study is preferred as it does not compromise the performance significantly but also minimizes chlorine corrosion of the uv reactor components as well as dbp formation as shown in section 3 6 for sucralose degradation shown in fig 3b the same trend was observed uv h2o2 performance was more affected by chemical dose at low uv dose than at high uv dose and uv cl2 was relatively less responsive to chemical dose a general positive effect of uv dose on aop performance was observed fig 2 and its contribution was statistically significant at most of the test conditions tables s3 s6 in other words once confirmed to be effective at a low uv dose increasing the uv dose will be a feasible way to enhance aop performance under conditions similar to those evaluated here 3 3 impact of ph ph significantly affects uv cl2 performance through determining the relative speciation of free chlorine hocl ocl pka 7 5 at 25 c connick and chia 1959 as ocl is abundant at ph 8 0 and it quenches oh radical much faster than hocl k oh ocl 9 0 109 m 1s 1 buxton and subhani 1972 vs k oh hocl 1 4 108 m 1 s 1 zuo et al 1997 uv cl2 aop via the oh radical is much more efficient at ph 6 5 that at ph 8 0 this explains the different sucralose degradation at the two ph levels given that sucralose decay is governed by the oh radical reaction as shown in fig 2 the sucralose log reduction by uv cl2 decreased by 80 90 when the ph increased from 6 5 to 8 0 in contrast when monitoring caffeine destruction the impact of ph on uv cl2 performance was less significant tables s3 s4 the log reduction at ph 8 0 was only about 50 60 lower than at ph 6 5 this is presumably because the existence of the rcs pathway for caffeine destruction which is driven by the photolysis of ocl wu et al 2017 helps to offset the greater oh scavenging by ocl in comparison ph had only a minor impact on the degradation of both sucralose and caffeine when applying uv h2o2 with the log reductions decreasing by about 20 at ph 8 0 relative to ph 6 5 for both compounds statistically the ph effect was not significant for uv h2o2 tables s5 s6 there is expected to be little impact of ph on the speciation of h2o2 given its high pka of 11 7 holleman et al 2001 instead the relatively minor ph effect is likely due to an increase in the oh radical scavenging capacity with increasing ph because some deprotonated organics such as those with phenolate groups and inorganics such as carbonate species have higher reactivity towards oh radical than their protonated counterparts buxton et al 1988 previous studies showed that the ph at which the uv cl2 and the uv h2o2 aops were equally efficient in oh radical driven aop as measured by sucralose decay in this case and termed as phiso in the following discussion was usually low ph 5 but it increased with the total organic carbon toc in the water fang 2016 wang et al 2012 the toc in this study was 2 3 mg c l and phiso was 6 5 according to the observed sucralose degradation higher than that predicted using a mathematical model on tce decay 5 8 wang et al 2012 as mentioned earlier bench scale studies and mathematical models may not be able to accurately simulate full scale performance given site specific conditions similarly when considering the ph at which uv h2o2 and uv cl2 are equally efficient at caffeine degradation according to this study it either is higher than 8 0 or may not exist meaning that the uv cl2 is more efficient than uv h2o2 in caffeine degradation at all ph levels 3 4 rcs vs oh pathways previous research at bench scale has shown that both rcs and oh radicals can cause contaminant degradation but the relative importance of each pathway has not been demonstrated at full scale in this work the relative contribution of uv exposure alone and the different radical species to the total degradation of sucralose and caffeine was estimated in uv cl2 sucralose decay can be described by eq 1 by assuming that the overall reaction is first order the assumption implies a steady state concentration of the oh radicals which is not strictly true as the chlorine decays quickly and potentially leads to a dynamic variation of oh radical concentration with time and a spatial variation as the uv decays with distance from the source to be accurate the overall first order assumption can be considered as a data processing measure that converts a dynamic oh radical concentration profile into an equivalent steady state that achieves the same target compound degradation within the same time the first order rate constant of the sucralose decay by oh radical k s u c r a l o s e o h is described by 1 k s u c r a l o s e o h k s u c r a l o s e o h o h s s in which k s u c r a l o s e o h is the second order rate constant and o h s s is the equivalent oh radical steady state concentration the overall first order decay of sucralose consists of the contribution from uv exposure alone and oh radical oxidation as given by 2 l n s u c r a l o s e t s u c r a l o s e 0 k s u c r a l o s e t k s u c r a l o s e u v k s u c r a l o s e o h t in eq 2 sucralose t and sucralose 0 are concentrations of sucralose in the treated water at time t and in the influent respectively k s u c r a l o s e u v is the rate constant of the sucralose degradation caused by uv exposure alone and k s u c r a l o s e o h by oh radical oxidation t is the reaction time about 5 s in the uv reactor the reaction rate constants can therefore be calculated from the influent and effluent concentrations combining eq 1 and eq 2 yields 3 l n s u c r a l o s e t s u c r a l o s e 0 k s u c r a l o s e u v k s u c r a l o s e o h o h s s t rearranging eq 3 4 k s u c r a l o s e o h o h s s l n s u c r a l o s e t s u c r a l o s e 0 t k s u c r a l o s e u v using eq 4 k s u c r a l o s e o h o h s s can be calculated k s u c r a l o s e u v is available based on the degradation of sucralose at conditions with uv only and l n s u c r a l o s e t s u c r a l o s e 0 t is the log reduction of sucralose over time similarly the first order rate constant of the caffeine decay by oh radical k c a f f e i n e o h is described by 5 k c a f f e i n e o h k c a f f e i n e o h o h s s in which k c a f f e i n e o h is the second order rate constant as caffeine is reactive towards both oh radical and rcs sun et al 2016 wu et al 2017 the degradation of caffeine is due to three factors as described by eq 6 6 l n c a f f e i n e t c a f f e i n e 0 k c a f f e i n e t k c a f f e i n e u v k c a f f e i n e r c s k c a f f e i n e o h t in eq 6 caffeine t and caffeine 0 are concentrations of caffeine in the treated water at time t and in the influent respectively k c a f f e i n e u v is the first order rate constant of the caffeine decay due to uv exposure alone and k c a f f e i n e r c s by reaction with rcs combining eq 5 and eq 6 gives 7 l n c a f f e i n e t c a f f e i n e 0 k c a f f e i n e u v k c a f f e i

k s u c r a l o s e u v the contribution of the rcs to the caffeine decay can be estimated by eq 9 all of the terms on the right side of the equation are either known values or can be calculated based on the degradation data except for the ratio of the two rate constants k c a f f e i n e o h over k s u c r a l o s e o h the values of these two rate constants have been reported in the literature but only at room temperature 22 c buxton et al 1988 keen and linden 2013 kesavan and powers 1985 shi et al 1991 shu et al 2013 toth et al 2012 this full scale study however was conducted at 10 c temperature corrections of rate constants can be accomplished by using the arrhenius equation but unfortunately the activation energies for the reactions involved have not been reported to overcome this challenge an alternative method was used to estimate this ratio by using the data in the uv h2o2 aop in the uv h2o2 system the degradation of caffeine and sucralose is due only to uv exposure and oh radical since there is no rcs equation 5 therefore is simplified as 10 k c a f f e i n e o h o h s s l n c a f f e i n e t c a f f e i n e 0 t k c a f f e i n e u v dividing eq 10 by eq 4 yields 11

c r a l o s e 0 t k s u c r a l o s e u v eq 11 can be used to estimate the ratio of the rate constants at 10 c by applying eq 11 to the sucralose and caffeine degradation results acquired under uv h2o2 test conditions the ratio of k c a f f e i n e o h over k s u c r a l o s e o h was estimated to be close to 3 1 a detailed calculation is provided in table s7 for comparison at 22 c the average value of the reported rate constants for sucralose and caffeine are 1 5 109 m 1s 1 and 5 6 109 m 1s 1 see table s8 respectively resulting in a k c a f f e i n e o h k s u c r a l o s e o h ratio being 3 7 according to eq 12 lobachev et al 2009 which is derived from the arrhenius equation a decrease of the ratio from 3 7 at 22 c to 3 1 at 10 c indicates a difference in the activation energy ea between sucralose and caffeine degradation by oh radical of 10 6 kj mol this is reasonable considering that the reported range of the ea for reactions of oh radicals with different organic compounds in the aqueous phases is in the range of 5 36 kj mol ervens et al 2003 12 k c a f f e i n e o h k s u c r a l o s e o h 283 k k c a f f e i n e o h k s u c r a l o s e o h 298 k e δ e a 1 283 1 295 8 314 e 0 0000173 δ e a with the ratio of the two rate constants estimated i e 3 1 the contribution of the rcs to the caffeine decay can then be solved using eq 9 as shown in fig 4 at ph 8 0 the degradation of caffeine would be mainly due to rcs accounting for 60 72 of the overall first order rate constant values the contribution of the rcs decreased to 12 24 at ph 6 5 while the relative contribution of oh radical increased to 62 94 as implied in fig 4b by the higher k c a f f e i n e r c s at ph 8 0 than at ph 6 5 the amount of caffeine destroyed by rcs would be greater at ph 8 0 than at ph 6 5 even though the overall degradation was lower at ph 8 0 because all oh radical contribution virtually disappeared this can be explained by the promoted conversion of the oh radical into ocl radical at high ph which was recently identified as the major chlorine species that contributes to caffeine degradation via the oxidation of the imidazole moiety sun et al 2016 wu et al 2017 as ocl quenches oh radical much faster than hocl high ph increased the proportion of ocl and enhanced the degradation of caffeine via this pathway this full scale research therefore agrees with recent bench scale results that indicate that rcs reaction pathways can be a significant factor in the destruction of certain contaminants that are susceptible to rcs reaction guo et al 2018 kong et al 2018 3 5 chlorine and hydrogen peroxide decay the maximum h2o2 decay across the uv reactors was 10 achieved at the highest uv power level in contrast significantly more chlorine underwent photolysis fig 5 with the photolysis being ph dependent at ph 8 0 45 94 of the chlorine was consumed compared to only 27 60 at ph 6 5 this ph dependence is due to the higher uv absorption coefficient of ocl relative to hocl over the 254 350 nm range with similar quantum yields de laat and stefan 2018 furthermore faster chlorine decay in terms of the decay percentage within the fixed reaction time occurred at an initial chlorine concentration of 5 mg l than at 10 mg l at low uv dose similar to results obtained by wang et al 2015b and watts and linden 2007 however this difference was negligible at the high uv dose 3 6 dbp formation chlorine was applied in a weir box upstream of the uv reactor with an estimated chlorine contact time of approximately 5 min before entering the reactor the residence time in the uv reactor itself was about 5 s a set of dark control experiments was conducted whereby dbp formation was measured across the system with the uv lamps turned off to differentiate dbp formation due to the aop process from formation due to simple chlorine reaction a paired t test was conducted comparing dbp formation during dark chlorination with dbp formation at different applied uv power levels the results are summarized in table s9 the toc of lake ontario water was 2 3 mg c l suggesting a relatively low expected dbp formation potential 3 6 1 adsorbable organohalides aox lake ontario water contained a background aox concentration of approximately 20 μg cl l as shown in fig 6 dark chlorination with 5 10 mg l chlorine led to the formation of another 20 30 μg cl l of aox over the approximate 5 min of contact time with the higher formation associated with ph 6 5 compared to ph 8 0 this follows typical observations whereby aox tends to be higher at a lower ph fleischacker and randtke 1983 reckhow et al 1986 with uv turned on there was no statistically significant change in the aox at ph 8 0 across the aop system but at ph 6 5 the aop led to up to 10 μg cl l more formation this trend in increased aox formation at only the lower ph when using uv cl2 advanced oxidation is interesting because as observed by the caffeine removal oxidation at ph 6 5 tends to be dominated by oh radicals whereas oxidation at ph 8 is dominated by rcs this suggests that the rcs are not contributing meaningfully to aox formation instead it suggests that the impact of uv cl2 on aox formation is due to oh formation that presumably reacts with the natural organic matter to render it more susceptible to direct reaction with chlorine if true this is an important conclusion as much of the concern over the use of uv cl2 for drinking water treatment compared to uv h2o2 is due to suspicions about the potential role of rcs in generating organochlorine byproducts under the conditions evaluated here the evidence suggests that rcs are not significantly influencing the total amount of aox that is formed the full scale study by wang et al 2015a provided similar results with little increase in aox formation due to uv cl2 at ph 8 5 where rcs is presumed to predominate 3 6 2 thms haas hans hks and hnms there were no observed thms in the influent water to the aop system upon applying chlorine under dark chlorination conditions total thm formation was in the order of 4 6 μg l across the system fig 6 consisting mainly of tcm and bdcm fig s3 while applying uv appears to have caused the thms to increase by about 1 μg l when applying the highest uv dose at ph 6 5 this was not statistically significant at the 95 confidence level no thms were formed when applying uv h2o2 as would be expected haloacetic acids were observed to approximately double or triple when applying uv cl2 relative to dark chlorination with the largest difference observed at ph 6 5 this effect was statistically significant at the 95 confidence level although the magnitudes of the increase were small e g increasing from 3 to 9 μg l almost all of this increase was due to dcaa with tcaa contributing a very small amount to the increase fig s3 of the organic dbps monitored haloacetonitriles particularly bcan appeared to be the most affected by uv cl2 primarily at ph 6 5 figs 6 and s2 in the dark control samples the dcan concentration 1 5 4 0 μg l was more than three times as high as the bcan concentration 0 2 1 3 μg l however with full uv power applied bcan formation increased more rapidly than dcan and both species ended in the range of 3 5 6 μg l the enhanced incorporation of the bromide into the hans in uv cl2 deserves further attention as bromide containing dbps are reported to be more toxic yang et al 2014 of the remaining organic dbps monitored hks and hnms concentrations always remained below the detection limits which were generally in the order of 1 μg l 3 6 3 chlorate it is known that the photolysis of chlorine leads to chlorate through the dimerization of clo and the subsequent reactions of the products buxton and subhani 1972 as the dimerization reaction rate is proportional to the square of the radical concentrations any factor that affects the concentration of the clo will likely affect the formation of the chlorate enhanced chlorate concentration after uv cl2 at high ph high applied cl2 dose and high uv dose is therefore expected as the formation of clo and radical products is favored at these conditions the full scale results as shown in fig 6e largely supported this mechanism chlorate concentration as high as 1 1 mg l was observed when 10 mg l of cl2 was applied at ph 8 0 which would exceed the 1 0 mg l chlorate limit in ontario ontario standards 2018 the yield of chlorate from the photolysed free chlorine was in the range of 6 18 molar ratio of the chlorate over the consumed chlorine which increased with chlorine dose and water ph but decreased with the applied uv power levels fig s4 low chlorate yields at low chlorine dose implied that the most feasible way to control chlorate formation in the uv cl2 process would be by reducing the chlorine doses for example from 10 mg l to 5 mg l considering that this did not affect the degradation of the surrogate compounds significantly 3 6 4 nitrite formation during uv h2o2 treatment the influent water contained approximately 0 5 mg l no3 n medium pressure lamps can convert nitrate to nitrite due to photolysis at wavelengths in the low 200 nm range coddington et al 1999 hofman caris et al 2015 mack and bolton 1999 in this study up to 9 net conversion of the nitrate to nitrite was observed during uv h2o2 treatment resulting in a maximum nitrite concentration of 0 2 mg l no2 equal to 0 06 mg l no2 n fig 6 this compares to the world health organization guidelines value of 3 mg l no2 for drinking water world health organization 2017 generally the formation of nitrite was observed to increase with the uv power and the ph in comparison to the nitrite formation by uv alone the addition of h2o2 also increased the formation of the nitrite no nitrite was observed in the uv cl2 aop presumably because nitrite is oxidized to nitrate too quickly by free chlorine to leave a measurable nitrite residual cachaza et al 1976 lahoutifard et al 2002 3 7 nitrate impact the nitrate impact on the aop performance is summarized in table 2 when 1 1 mg l no3 n was added to the water chlorate formation decreased by one third in the uv cl2 aop this implies that the transient reductive nitrogen containing species that are formed by nitrate photolysis may quench the rcs that lead to the formation of chlorate on the other hand in the uv h2o2 aop at ph 6 5 the formation of nitrite was approximately doubled compared to that without nitrate addition no impact was observed on the formation of aox thms hans hks and hnms except for the decrease of the haa formation after the addition of the nitrate the reason for a mechanism behind this decrease remains to be investigated the additional 1 1 mg l no3 n spiked into the water did not show any detrimental effect on the degradation of caffeine and sucralose this is different from sörensen and frimmel 1997 s finding that nitrate behaved more like a uv light filter than an oh radical generator and compromised the performance of uv h2o2 4 conclusions much of the previous work that has compared uv cl2 to uv h2o2 has been performed at small scale these small scale studies suggest that uv cl2 might outcompete uv h2o2 in terms of oh radical formation only at low ph e g 6 given equivalent oxidant molar concentrations our model in the supplemental information suggests however that the relative performance of the two aops is a function of path length i e reactor size so there was a need to confirm such trends at full scale our results suggest that at ph 6 5 uv cl2 produces approximately twice the oh radicals as uv h2o2 under the conditions tested for a similar oxidant dose whereas at ph 8 0 oh formation as indicated by sucralose decay was negligible during uv cl2 treatment nevertheless our work confirmed earlier bench scale research that indicates that a significant amount of rcs may form at the higher ph making uv cl2 a potential treatment alternative even at ph 8 provided that the target contaminants are susceptible to rcs attack a concern associated with uv cl2 treatment is the potential formation of dbps while the water used for this study had an inherently low dbp formation potential toc 2 3 mg c l the results nevertheless indicated only a very small formation of organic dbps of current or emerging regulatory concern always 10 μg l importantly there was no evidence of increased aox formation due to rcs reaction chlorate formation remains a concern with yields up to 18 of photolysed chlorine observed there should be some caution in interpreting these results however since uv cl2 treatment might lead to the formation of dbps that were not monitored as part of this study future work could include toxicity screens to compare uv cl2 treated water to water treated more conventionally this remains an area in need of more research acknowledgments this work was funded by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada through the

18706,the photolysis of chlorine by uv light leads to the formation of the hydroxyl radicals oh as well as reactive chlorine species rcs that can be effective as advanced oxidation processes aops for water treatment much of the research to date has been done at laboratory or bench scale this study reports results from a model that demonstrates that the relative effectiveness of the uv cl2 aop compared to the more traditional uv h2o2 aop is a function of optical path length as such the relative effectiveness of the two treatment options evaluated at small scale may not reflect the relative performance at full scale making results previously obtained at small scale potentially less scalable this study therefore compares the performance of uv cl2 to uv h2o2 at a full scale water treatment plant using sucralose and caffeine as spiked surrogates for contaminants that are reactive solely to oh radicals and to both oh and rcs respectively ph was varied between 6 5 and 8 0 the results demonstrated that when using a medium pressure uv lamp uv cl2 might lead to approximately twice the production of oh radicals as uv h2o2 at ph 6 5 when using the same molar oxidant concentration but adding chlorine to the uv reactor at ph 8 0 had a negligible impact on oh radical concentration in comparison to uv alone the study also confirmed previous small scale results that rcs can be a major contributor to uv cl2 treatment for compounds such as caffeine that are susceptible to rcs with uv cl2 effective at both ph 6 5 and 8 0 for such compounds disinfection byproducts were monitored with adsorbable organohalide aox formation increasing by approximately 10 μg cl l due to chlorine photolysis but only at ph 6 5 and not at ph 8 0 this implies that uv cl2 might increase aox mostly due to reaction between oh and organic precursors to make them more reactive with chlorine and not due to rcs the formation of specific dbps of current or emerging regulatory interest was minimal under all conditions except for chlorate chlorate yields were in the order of 6 18 of the photolysed chlorine graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv advanced oxidation caffeine sucralose disinfection byproducts 1 introduction there is increasing interest in the uv cl2 advanced oxidation process aop for both drinking water treatment and water reuse applications due to a possible lower cost and operational advantages compared to the more traditional uv hydrogen peroxide aop recent research has demonstrated that uv cl2 can be very effective at the destruction of a wide range of contaminants that are difficult to control through more conventional means dong et al 2017 li et al 2017 pan et al 2017 shu et al 2014 wang et al 2015a wu et al 2017 xiang et al 2016 a comparison of the effectiveness of the uv h2o2 and the uv cl2 aops has been conducted theoretically using mathematical models fang 2016 wang et al 2012 2017 as well as experimentally at bench and pilot scale guo et al 2018 jin 2010 shu et al 2014 wang et al 2015a b in general uv cl2 was observed to outperform uv h2o2 at low ph e g below 6 where chlorine exists primarily as hocl unless the target contaminant is particularly susceptible to reactive chlorine species rcs that are formed during chlorine photolysis in which case uv cl2 can remain very effective at neutral or even basic ph kong et al 2018 miklos et al 2019 wu et al 2017 however there has been very little full scale comparison of uv cl2 to uv h2o2 to confirm the trends observed in the laboratory one full scale study using medium pressure polychromatic uv light wang et al 2015b suggested that uv cl2 might be competitive at higher than expected ph values with geosmin degradation by uv cl2 comparable to that by uv h2o2 at ph 7 5 and 8 a possible explanation for the difference in uv cl2 performance relative to uv h2o2 at large scale compared to lab scale is that for polychromatic uv reactors their performances may be affected differently by uv reactor size i e uv path length a mathematical model described in the supporting information implies that the performance of polychromatic uv cl2 aop may be different in full scale reactors compared to bench or pilot scale reactors for the same applied uv and cl2 dose the reason is that the ratio of the cl2 absorbed photons over those absorbed by the whole water column is strongly dependent on the light path length for example in lake ontario water when the path length increases from 1 cm to 10 cm the ratio of the photons absorbed by 10 mg l of cl2 over those absorbed by the whole water column will approximately double due to chlorine s high uv absorptivity fig s1 relative to the background water at the higher wavelengths 350 nm in contrast for uv h2o2 the same path length increase will decrease the ratio of the photons absorbed by 10 mg l of h2o2 over those absorbed by the whole water column by 4 due to the fact that both h2o2 and the background water absorb most strongly at low wavelengths 260 nm and therefore these wavelengths do not penetrate far collins and bolton 2016 therefore a comparison of polychromatic uv cl2 against uv h2o2 conducted at bench scale will probably underestimate uv cl2 performance relative to uv h2o2 at full scale unless the increase in absorbance weighted uv fluence is properly factored into the scale up note that this does not apply to monochromatic low pressure uv reactors as discussed in the si the magnitude of this error however is difficult to estimate without a complete uv reactor model this may explain why a recent study springer et al 2018 showed that polychromatic uv cl2 performed better than uv alone in geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib degradation in their pilot scale study but the opposite was observed in their bench scale study it is therefore useful to experimentally compare the relative performance of uv cl2 and uv h2o at full scale to confirm the trends observed in previous bench and pilot scale work another concern with uv cl2 aop is the potential formation of disinfection byproducts dbps strictly speaking dbp is not an accurate term here as these byproducts are generated in treatment aimed at oxidation and not disinfection but to be consistent with previous studies the term will continue to be used previous bench scale studies using natural organic matter nom as the precursor pisarenko et al 2013 zhao et al 2011 observed no significant difference in the total organic halogen formation in uv cl2 treatment from that in dark chlorination contrary to that observed in wang et al 2015a s full scale study one possible explanation might be that the uv intensity in such small scale tests e g a collimated beam assembly is typically much lower than in a full scale system so aop uv doses take much longer to achieve many minutes vs seconds and dbp formation may therefore be dominated by long chlorine exposure and may mask the effects of uv irradiation in a full scale uv cl2 system dbp formation occurs within a few seconds of very intense uv light and this unique condition is best represented by full scale trials a full scale test to compare the effectiveness of uv h2o2 and uv cl2 and dbp formation was conducted at the lorne park water treatment plant in mississauga canada sucralose and caffeine were selected as the micropollutant surrogates with the former representative of compounds that are mainly reactive towards oh radical fang 2016 keen and linden 2013 lester et al 2014 and the latter being representative of those that are reactive towards both oh radicals and chlorine radicals sun et al 2016 wu et al 2017 the potential formation of dbps under the different treatment scenarios was compared and contrasted with the dbps including both those that are currently regulated as well as several emerging classes of dbps 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the chemicals used in this study were either food grade or nsf 60 certified 35 food chemical codex fcc grade

cl2 to uv h2o2 the performance of uv cl2 and uv h2o2 in degrading sucralose and caffeine is shown in fig 2 sucralose degradation was more effective with uv cl2 than uv h2o2 at ph 6 5 but was outperformed by uv h2o2 at ph 8 0 for example at an equal molar concentration of the chemicals 10 mg l cl2 vs 5 mg l h2o2 and with all lamps on uv cl2 and uv h2o2 removed sucralose by 0 60 log and 0 29 log p 0 05 respectively at ph 6 5 as sucralose can be considered an oh radical probe fang 2016 keen and linden 2013 lester et al 2014 this implies that uv cl2 is more efficient than uv h2o2 in generating oh radical at ph 6 5 the ratio of the sucralose log removal by uv cl2 over that by uv h2o2 was 2 1 at ph 6 5 when equal molar concentration of the oxidant was applied which is within the range of the 2 5 ratio reported by the royce et al 2015 full scale test of 1 4 dioxane removal at ph 5 5 and the 1 5 2 3 ratios reported by wang et al 2015b in full scale tests of geosmin and 2 mib degradation at ph 6 5 all of these full scale studies indicate that uv cl2 is about twice as efficient in oh radical formation as uv h2o2 at acidic conditions e g 5 5 6 5 under the conditions tested a comparison of this ratio with that achieved at bench scale would be interesting as it would reveal the path length effect discussed earlier future tests are needed to isolate and evaluate the path length effects on the relative performance of uv cl2 to uv h2o2 at ph 8 0 uv cl2 degraded sucralose less than when using uv h2o2 p 0 05 for paired t test considering all three bpls as shown in fig 2a uv cl2 achieved a maximum of 0 11 log removal of sucralose approximately the same to 0 10 log removal achieved by uv alone at ph 8 0 this concluded that adding chlorine to the uv reactor at ph 8 0 did not contribute measurably to the oh radical formation note that in this study the term uv alone is used to include not only direct uv photolysis but also the potential formation of radicals from the photolysis of nitrate measured in this study at 2 3 0 8 mg l as no3 mack and bolton 1999 sharpless et al 2003 and the natural organic matter ishimitsu et al 1985 li et al 2016 these two additional pathways may explain the observed slight sucralose decay under uv exposure alone fig 2 compared to previous studies which found sucralose to be resistant to direct photolysis in otherwise pure water keen and linden 2013 lester et al 2014 on the other hand uv h2o2 achieved an average of 0 06 log more removal than uv cl2 when equal molar concentration of the oxidant was applied at ph 8 0 for caffeine which is reactive towards both oh radical and rcs sun et al 2016 wu et al 2017 uv cl2 achieved higher removals than uv h2o2 at both ph 6 5 and ph 8 0 at an equal molar concentration of the oxidants 10 mg l cl2 vs 5 mg l h2o2 the highest removals of caffeine by uv cl2 were 1 9 logs at ph 6 5 and 0 77 log at ph 8 0 versus uv h2o2 s 0 74 log at ph 6 5 and 0 59 log at ph 8 0 all acquired with a 100 uv bpl the sucralose degradation implies that uv cl2 may not be a preferred option at ph 8 0 for compounds that are reactive primarily with oh radical such as geosmin and 2 mib at least under the conditions tested here fang et al 2018 in contrast the caffeine degradation at ph 8 0 shows that uv cl2 might be a more feasible option to destroy rcs reactive micro pollutants even at high ph such as certain antibiotics and drugs including nalidixic acid wu et al 2017 gemfibrozil and bezafibrate kong et al 2018 3 2 impact of oxidant dose and uv dose in a perfect uv reaction assuming that the overall quantum yield of radical formation and uv fluence is constant doubling the h2o2 dose will lead to a doubling of the radical formation if the radical oxidation is purely pseudo first order a doubling of the h2o2 dose therefore leads to a theoretical doubling of the log reduction of the target compounds i e ratio of the log c co 2 in reality when taking the oh radical scavenging effect and the light filtering effect by h2o2 into consideration the theoretical ratio is closer to 1 8 when the h2o2 concentration increases from 5 mg l to 10 mg l under the conditions similar to those tested in this study see the calculation in the si as indicated in fig 3 a for caffeine degradation this was achieved at low uv power 50 uv bpl for h2o2 ratio 1 8 but the ratio decreased to 1 3 at higher uv power this implies that an increase of the chemical dose is more effective at low uv dose than at high uv dose for uv h2o2 which might be due to factors such as the enhanced depletion of h2o2 and the increased radical radical recombination at the high uv dose on the other hand for uv cl2 the ratio of the log reduction stayed in a narrow range of 1 1 1 3 when the chlorine dose was doubled from 5 mg l to 10 mg l the low ratio is presumably due to the oh radical scavenging effect by chlorine and its uv filtering effect this result is supported by our calculation see the calculation in the modeling the activator dose effect section of the si using the mathematical model reported by fang 2016 which predicts a 30 increase in net oh radical production production minus oxidant scavenging at ph 6 5 but no increase at ph 8 0 when the chlorine dose increases from 5 mg l to 10 mg l under the conditions tested this implies that a low chlorine dose such as 5 mg l in this study is preferred as it does not compromise the performance significantly but also minimizes chlorine corrosion of the uv reactor components as well as dbp formation as shown in section 3 6 for sucralose degradation shown in fig 3b the same trend was observed uv h2o2 performance was more affected by chemical dose at low uv dose than at high uv dose and uv cl2 was relatively less responsive to chemical dose a general positive effect of uv dose on aop performance was observed fig 2 and its contribution was statistically significant at most of the test conditions tables s3 s6 in other words once confirmed to be effective at a low uv dose increasing the uv dose will be a feasible way to enhance aop performance under conditions similar to those evaluated here 3 3 impact of ph ph significantly affects uv cl2 performance through determining the relative speciation of free chlorine hocl ocl pka 7 5 at 25 c connick and chia 1959 as ocl is abundant at ph 8 0 and it quenches oh radical much faster than hocl k oh ocl 9 0 109 m 1s 1 buxton and subhani 1972 vs k oh hocl 1 4 108 m 1 s 1 zuo et al 1997 uv cl2 aop via the oh radical is much more efficient at ph 6 5 that at ph 8 0 this explains the different sucralose degradation at the two ph levels given that sucralose decay is governed by the oh radical reaction as shown in fig 2 the sucralose log reduction by uv cl2 decreased by 80 90 when the ph increased from 6 5 to 8 0 in contrast when monitoring caffeine destruction the impact of ph on uv cl2 performance was less significant tables s3 s4 the log reduction at ph 8 0 was only about 50 60 lower than at ph 6 5 this is presumably because the existence of the rcs pathway for caffeine destruction which is driven by the photolysis of ocl wu et al 2017 helps to offset the greater oh scavenging by ocl in comparison ph had only a minor impact on the degradation of both sucralose and caffeine when applying uv h2o2 with the log reductions decreasing by about 20 at ph 8 0 relative to ph 6 5 for both compounds statistically the ph effect was not significant for uv h2o2 tables s5 s6 there is expected to be little impact of ph on the speciation of h2o2 given its high pka of 11 7 holleman et al 2001 instead the relatively minor ph effect is likely due to an increase in the oh radical scavenging capacity with increasing ph because some deprotonated organics such as those with phenolate groups and inorganics such as carbonate species have higher reactivity towards oh radical than their protonated counterparts buxton et al 1988 previous studies showed that the ph at which the uv cl2 and the uv h2o2 aops were equally efficient in oh radical driven aop as measured by sucralose decay in this case and termed as phiso in the following discussion was usually low ph 5 but it increased with the total organic carbon toc in the water fang 2016 wang et al 2012 the toc in this study was 2 3 mg c l and phiso was 6 5 according to the observed sucralose degradation higher than that predicted using a mathematical model on tce decay 5 8 wang et al 2012 as mentioned earlier bench scale studies and mathematical models may not be able to accurately simulate full scale performance given site specific conditions similarly when considering the ph at which uv h2o2 and uv cl2 are equally efficient at caffeine degradation according to this study it either is higher than 8 0 or may not exist meaning that the uv cl2 is more efficient than uv h2o2 in caffeine degradation at all ph levels 3 4 rcs vs oh pathways previous research at bench scale has shown that both rcs and oh radicals can cause contaminant degradation but the relative importance of each pathway has not been demonstrated at full scale in this work the relative contribution of uv exposure alone and the different radical species to the total degradation of sucralose and caffeine was estimated in uv cl2 sucralose decay can be described by eq 1 by assuming that the overall reaction is first order the assumption implies a steady state concentration of the oh radicals which is not strictly true as the chlorine decays quickly and potentially leads to a dynamic variation of oh radical concentration with time and a spatial variation as the uv decays with distance from the source to be accurate the overall first order assumption can be considered as a data processing measure that converts a dynamic oh radical concentration profile into an equivalent steady state that achieves the same target compound degradation within the same time the first order rate constant of the sucralose decay by oh radical k s u c r a l o s e o h is described by 1 k s u c r a l o s e o h k s u c r a l o s e o h o h s s in which k s u c r a l o s e o h is the second order rate constant and o h s s is the equivalent oh radical steady state concentration the overall first order decay of sucralose consists of the contribution from uv exposure alone and oh radical oxidation as given by 2 l n s u c r a l o s e t s u c r a l o s e 0 k s u c r a l o s e t k s u c r a l o s e u v k s u c r a l o s e o h t in eq 2 sucralose t and sucralose 0 are concentrations of sucralose in the treated water at time t and in the influent respectively k s u c r a l o s e u v is the rate constant of the sucralose degradation caused by uv exposure alone and k s u c r a l o s e o h by oh radical oxidation t is the reaction time about 5 s in the uv reactor the reaction rate constants can therefore be calculated from the influent and effluent concentrations combining eq 1 and eq 2 yields 3 l n s u c r a l o s e t s u c r a l o s e 0 k s u c r a l o s e u v k s u c r a l o s e o h o h s s t rearranging eq 3 4 k s u c r a l o s e o h o h s s l n s u c r a l o s e t s u c r a l o s e 0 t k s u c r a l o s e u v using eq 4 k s u c r a l o s e o h o h s s can be calculated k s u c r a l o s e u v is available based on the degradation of sucralose at conditions with uv only and l

k s u c r a l o s e u v the contribution of the rcs to the caffeine decay can be estimated by eq 9 all of the terms on the right side of the equation are either known values or can be calculated based on the degradation data except for the ratio of the two rate constants k c a f f e i n e o h over k s u c r a l o s e o h the values of these two rate constants have been reported in the literature but only at room temperature 22 c buxton et al 1988 keen and linden 2013 kesavan and powers 1985 shi et al 1991 shu et al 2013 toth et al 2012 this full scale study however was conducted at 10 c temperature corrections of rate constants can be accomplished by using the arrhenius equation but unfortunately the activation energies for the reactions involved have not been reported to overcome this challenge an alternative method was used to estimate this ratio by using the data in the uv h2o2 aop in the uv h2o2 system the degradation of caffeine and sucralose is due only to uv exposure and oh radical since there is no rcs equation 5 therefore is simplified as 10 k c a f f e i n e o h o h s s l n c a f f e i n e t c a f f e i n e 0 t k c a f f e i n e u v dividing eq 10 by eq 4 yields 11

h2o2 test conditions the ratio of k c a f f e i n e o h over k s u c r a l o s e o h was estimated to be close to 3 1 a detailed calculation is provided in table s7 for comparison at 22 c the average value of the reported rate constants for sucralose and caffeine are 1 5 109 m 1s 1 and 5 6 109 m 1s 1 see table s8 respectively resulting in a k c a f f e i n e o h k s u c r a l o s e o h ratio being 3 7 according to eq 12 lobachev et al 2009 which is derived from the arrhenius equation a decrease of the ratio from 3 7 at 22 c to 3 1 at 10 c indicates a difference in the activation energy ea between sucralose and caffeine degradation by oh radical of 10 6 kj mol this is reasonable considering that the reported range of the ea for reactions of oh radicals with different organic compounds in the aqueous phases is in the range of 5 36 kj mol ervens et al 2003 12 k c a f f e i n e o h k s u c r a l o s e o h 283 k k c a f f e i n e o h k s u c r a l o s e o h 298 k e δ e a 1 283 1 295 8 314 e 0 0000173 δ e a with the ratio of the two rate constants estimated i e 3 1 the contribution of the rcs to the caffeine decay can then be solved using eq 9 as shown in fig 4 at ph 8 0 the degradation of caffeine would be mainly due to rcs accounting for 60 72 of the overall first order rate constant values the contribution of the rcs decreased to 12 24 at ph 6 5 while the relative contribution of oh radical increased to 62 94 as implied in fig 4b by the higher k c a f f e i n e r c s at ph 8 0 than at ph 6 5 the amount of caffeine destroyed by rcs would be greater at ph 8 0 than at ph 6 5 even though the overall degradation was lower at ph 8 0 because all oh radical contribution virtually disappeared this can be explained by the promoted conversion of the oh radical into ocl radical at high ph which was recently identified as the major chlorine species that contributes to caffeine degradation via the oxidation of the imidazole moiety sun et al 2016 wu et al 2017 as ocl quenches oh radical much faster than hocl high ph increased the proportion of ocl and enhanced the degradation of caffeine via this pathway this full scale research therefore agrees with recent bench scale results that indicate that rcs reaction pathways can be a significant factor in the destruction of certain contaminants that are susceptible to rcs reaction guo et al 2018 kong et al 2018 3 5 chlorine and hydrogen peroxide decay the maximum h2o2 decay across the uv reactors was 10 achieved at the highest uv power level in contrast significantly more chlorine underwent photolysis fig 5 with the photolysis being ph dependent at ph 8 0 45 94 of the chlorine was consumed compared to only 27 60 at ph 6 5 this ph dependence is due to the higher uv absorption coefficient of ocl relative to hocl over the 254 350 nm range with similar quantum yields de laat and stefan 2018 furthermore faster chlorine decay in terms of the decay percentage within the fixed reaction time occurred at an initial chlorine concentration of 5 mg l than at 10 mg l at low uv dose similar to results obtained by wang et al 2015b and watts and linden 2007 however this difference was negligible at the high uv dose 3 6 dbp formation chlorine was applied in a weir box upstream of the uv reactor with an estimated chlorine contact time of approximately 5 min before entering the reactor the residence time in the uv reactor itself was about 5 s a set of dark control experiments was conducted whereby dbp formation was measured across the system with the uv lamps turned off to differentiate dbp formation due to the aop process from formation due to simple chlorine reaction a paired t test was conducted comparing dbp formation during dark chlorination with dbp formation at different applied uv power levels the results are summarized in table s9 the toc of lake ontario water was 2 3 mg c l suggesting a relatively low expected dbp formation potential 3 6 1 adsorbable organohalides aox lake ontario water contained a background aox concentration of approximately 20 μg cl l as shown in fig 6 dark chlorination with 5 10 mg l chlorine led to the formation of another 20 30 μg cl l of aox over the approximate 5 min of contact time with the higher formation associated with ph 6 5 compared to ph 8 0 this follows typical observations whereby aox tends to be higher at a lower ph fleischacker and randtke 1983 reckhow et al 1986 with uv turned on there was no statistically significant change in the aox at ph 8 0 across the aop system but at ph 6 5 the aop led to up to 10 μg cl l more formation this trend in increased aox formation at only the lower ph when using uv cl2 advanced oxidation is interesting because as observed by the caffeine removal oxidation at ph 6 5 tends to be dominated by oh radicals whereas oxidation at ph 8 is dominated by rcs this suggests that the rcs are not contributing meaningfully to aox formation instead it suggests that the impact of uv cl2 on aox formation is due to oh formation that presumably reacts with the natural organic matter to render it more susceptible to direct reaction with chlorine if true this is an important conclusion as much of the concern over the use of uv cl2 for drinking water treatment compared to uv h2o2 is due to suspicions about the potential role of rcs in generating organochlorine byproducts under the conditions evaluated here the evidence suggests that rcs are not significantly influencing the total amount of aox that is formed the full scale study by wang et al 2015a provided similar results with little increase in aox formation due to uv cl2 at ph 8 5 where rcs is presumed to predominate 3 6 2 thms haas hans hks and hnms there were no observed thms in the influent water to the aop system upon applying chlorine under dark chlorination conditions total thm formation was in the order of 4 6 μg l across the system fig 6 consisting mainly of tcm and bdcm fig s3 while applying uv appears to have caused the thms to increase by about 1 μg l when applying the highest uv dose at ph 6 5 this was not statistically significant at the 95 confidence level no thms were formed when applying uv h2o2 as would be expected haloacetic acids were observed to approximately double or triple when applying uv cl2 relative to dark chlorination with the largest difference observed at ph 6 5 this effect was statistically significant at the 95 confidence level although the magnitudes of the increase were small e g increasing from 3 to 9 μg l almost all of this increase was due to dcaa with tcaa contributing a very small amount to the increase fig s3 of the organic dbps monitored haloacetonitriles particularly bcan appeared to be the most affected by uv cl2 primarily at ph 6 5 figs 6 and s2 in the dark control samples the dcan concentration 1 5 4 0 μg l was more than three times as high as the bcan concentration 0 2 1 3 μg l however with full uv power applied bcan formation increased more rapidly than dcan and both species ended in the range of 3 5 6 μg l the enhanced incorporation of the bromide into the hans in uv cl2 deserves further attention as bromide containing dbps are reported to be more toxic yang et al 2014 of the remaining organic dbps monitored hks and hnms concentrations always remained below the detection limits which were generally in the order of 1 μg l 3 6 3 chlorate it is known that the photolysis of chlorine leads to chlorate through the dimerization of clo and the subsequent reactions of the products buxton and subhani 1972 as the dimerization reaction rate is proportional to the square of the radical concentrations any factor that affects the concentration of the clo will likely affect the formation of the chlorate enhanced chlorate concentration after uv cl2 at high ph high applied cl2 dose and high uv dose is therefore expected as the formation of clo and radical products is favored at these conditions the full scale results as shown in fig 6e largely supported this mechanism chlorate concentration as high as 1 1 mg l was observed when 10 mg l of cl2 was applied at ph 8 0 which would exceed the 1 0 mg l chlorate limit in ontario ontario standards 2018 the yield of chlorate from the photolysed free chlorine was in the range of 6 18 molar ratio of the chlorate over the consumed chlorine which increased with chlorine dose and water ph but decreased with the applied uv power levels fig s4 low chlorate yields at low chlorine dose implied that the most feasible way to control chlorate formation in the uv cl2 process would be by reducing the chlorine doses for example from 10 mg l to 5 mg l considering that this did not affect the degradation of the surrogate compounds significantly 3 6 4 nitrite formation during uv h2o2 treatment the influent water contained approximately 0 5 mg l no3 n medium pressure lamps can convert nitrate to nitrite due to photolysis at wavelengths in the low 200 nm range coddington et al 1999 hofman caris et al 2015 mack and bolton 1999 in this study up to 9 net conversion of the nitrate to nitrite was observed during uv h2o2 treatment resulting in a maximum nitrite concentration of 0 2 mg l no2 equal to 0 06 mg l no2 n fig 6 this compares to the world health organization guidelines value of 3 mg l no2 for drinking water world health organization 2017 generally the formation of nitrite was observed to increase with the uv power and the ph in comparison to the nitrite formation by uv alone the addition of h2o2 also increased the formation of the nitrite no nitrite was observed in the uv cl2 aop presumably because nitrite is oxidized to nitrate too quickly by free chlorine to leave a measurable nitrite residual cachaza et al 1976 lahoutifard et al 2002 3 7 nitrate impact the nitrate impact on the aop performance is summarized in table 2 when 1 1 mg l no3 n was added to the water chlorate formation decreased by one third in the uv cl2 aop this implies that the transient reductive nitrogen containing species that are formed by nitrate photolysis may quench the rcs that lead to the formation of chlorate on the other hand in the uv h2o2 aop at ph 6 5 the formation of nitrite was approximately doubled compared to that without nitrate addition no impact was observed on the formation of aox thms hans hks and hnms except for the decrease of the haa formation after the addition of the nitrate the reason for a mechanism behind this decrease remains to be investigated the additional 1 1 mg l no3 n spiked into the water did not show any detrimental effect on the degradation of caffeine and sucralose this is different from sörensen and frimmel 1997 s finding that nitrate behaved more like a uv light filter than an oh radical generator and compromised the performance of uv h2o2 4 conclusions much of the previous work that has compared uv cl2 to uv h2o2 has been performed at small scale these small scale studies suggest that uv cl2 might outcompete uv h2o2 in terms of oh radical formation only at low ph e g 6 given equivalent oxidant molar concentrations our model in the supplemental information suggests however that the relative performance of the two aops is a function of path length i e reactor size so there was a need to confirm such trends at full scale our results suggest that at ph 6 5 uv cl2 produces approximately twice the oh radicals as uv h2o2 under the conditions tested for a similar oxidant dose whereas at ph 8 0 oh formation as indicated by sucralose decay was negligible during uv cl2 treatment nevertheless our work confirmed earlier bench scale research that indicates that a significant amount of rcs may form at the higher ph making uv cl2 a potential treatment alternative even at ph 8 provided that the target contaminants are susceptible to rcs attack a concern associated with uv cl2 treatment is the potential formation of dbps while the water used for this study had an inherently low dbp formation potential toc 2 3 mg c l the results nevertheless indicated only a very small formation of organic dbps of current or emerging regulatory concern always 10 μg l importantly there was no evidence of increased aox formation due to rcs reaction chlorate formation remains a concern with yields up to 18 of photolysed chlorine observed there should be some caution in interpreting these results however since uv cl2 treatment might lead to the formation of dbps that were not monitored as part of this study future work could include toxicity screens to compare uv cl2 treated water to water treated more conventionally this remains an area in need of more research acknowledgments this work was funded by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada through the

18707,the presence of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids in the environment is an emerging concern owing to their potential threat on aquatic ecosystems and living organisms to investigate the bioremoval potential of a biological activated carbon bac filter for the removal of nsaids removal of diclofenac dcf ibuprofen ibu and naproxen nap by biofilms on a bench scaled bac column operated for 400 days was studied the results showed that the bac column effectively removed the three nsaids 90 one bacterial strain isolated from the bac pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 was able to simultaneously remove dcf ibu and nap which were supplied as the sole carbon source in 14 days 23 41 and 39 of dcf ibu and nap 50 μg l 1 were bioremoved respectively and strain din 3 eliminated ibu more rapidly than the other two nsaids if only a single drug was added as the sole carbon source ignoring the other drugs the removal ability was overestimated by 5 0 27 0 more efficient bioremoval was achieved concomitantly with bacterial growth via a co metabolism with acetate glucose or methanol their intermediates were identified by uplc qqq ms and their respective degradation pathways were also proposed moreover based on the complete genome sequence of strain din 3 49 related genes encoding the main enzymes involved in dcf ibu and nap biodegradation were identified including heme lpd yihx ligc poba and liga these results suggested that pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 is a potential degrader of dcf ibu and nap and to the best of our knowledge this is the first report that demonstrates the bioremoval of dcf ibu and nap simultaneously by an individual bacterial strain isolated from the environment however the bioremoval potential should be evaluated when assessing the applicability of the strain in the environment because of the combined effects of various pharmaceutical contaminants the obtained results provide a foundation for the use of pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 in the bioremoval of polycyclic nsaid contaminated environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 bioremoval biological activated

academia government and industry alvarino et al 2015 ppcps in an aquatic environment are mainly derived from industrial domestic farming and animal husbandry wastewater in addition owing to the lack of effective treatment methods and technologies a large number of ppcps are discharged through wastewater surface runoff and landfill leachate infiltration evgenidou et al 2015 although the half life of most ppcps is short the frequent use of ppcps by individuals and in animal husbandry leads to continuous introduction of ppcps into aquatic environments in what is considered a pseudo persistent phenomenon many drugs bioaccumulate and cause chronic toxicity with a three cause effect carcinogenesis teratogenesis and mutagenicity observed lajeunesse et al 2013 among them non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids which include ibuprofen ibu naproxen nap diclofenac dcf and ketoprofen are commonly found in raw water source of drinking water treatment plants dwtps because of their widespread and extensive use ternes 1998 heberer et al 2002 zhao et al 2009 investigated acidic drug residues in the pearl river system in china revealing that the highest concentrations of ibu dcf and nap were 685 ng l 1 150 ng l 1 and 125 ng l 1 respectively dcf and ibu were also detected at very low levels in raw or treated drinking water heberer et al 2001 and in groundwater samples sacher et al 2001 although the individual toxicity of nsaids is relatively low once combined with other pharmaceuticals in aqueous solution the toxic effect of each compound is amplified to different degrees mcclellan and halden 2010 cleuvers 2004 studied the effects of ppcp mixtures including dcf ibu and nap on the potential ecotoxicity in aquatic organisms such as water fleas and algae and the results confirmed that the effects of mixed ppcps on aquatic organisms were significantly more severe than those of individual ppcps presenting greater ecological risks studies have shown that conventional treatment processes are relatively ineffective in the removal of ppcps e g dcf ibu and bisphenol a from water sources and wastewater treatment plants wwtps kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 rosal et al 2010 many techniques have been applied to the removal or reduction of some pharmaceuticals in water and wastewater such as ozonation moreira et al 2015 hama aziz et al 2017 photocatalysis mendez arriaga et al 2008 moreira et al 2015 and membrane filtration snyder et al 2007 compared with other techniques adsorption is an important alternative process owing to its simplicity and high removal efficiency saleh and gupta 2012 among the prominent adsorbents granular activated carbon gac exhibiting a characteristic pore structure with large pore volume and high surface area has been widely used to remove organic contaminants from water and wastewater sabio et al 2006 sotelo et al 2014 the activated carbon filter involves both adsorption and biological treatment and is widely used in dwtps i e sand filter activated carbon filter and o3 gac bac ppcps are not currently regulated in drinking water however it is important to understand whether or not the treatments applied to dwtps can eliminate ppcps rigobello et al 2013 few studies have investigated pharmaceutical adsorption in bed columns in dwtps sotelo et al 2012 2014 rigobello et al 2013 sotelo et al 2014 showed that the efficiency of dcf removal by gac column adsorption ranged from 66 74 to 80 85 rigobello et al 2013 found that conventional drinking water treatment followed by gac filtration was effective for removal of dcf 99 7 at the laboratory scale additionally sang et al 2007 demonstrated that conventional drinking water treatment methods were relatively inefficient for pharmaceutical and endocrine disruptor removal whereas efficient removal 99 of ibu was achieved by gac at the seoul drinking water treatment facility ternes et al 2002 suggested that conventional drinking water treatment was ineffective for removal of dcf but after gac filtration dcf was not detected above 2 ng l 1 with 96 elimination in real waterworks the indigenous microbial population is attached to the gac which gradually forms a biological activated carbon bac filter requiring about three months to achieve steady state conditions carlson and amy 1998 therefore the bac process applied to in dwtps greatly improves the ability to remove contaminants through adsorption and biodegradation which occur simultaneously and synergistically although significant removal of dcf 96 was observed in waterworks the mechanism adsorption and biodegradation was not elucidated ternes et al 2002 microbial removal is safe and effective and under reasonable control will not cause secondary pollution of the environment contaminant degrading microorganisms are usually present in the environment in large quantities and are derived from a wide variety of sources meanwhile the residual pollutants in the environment cause genetic mutation of other microorganisms resulting in new mutants in order to adapt to the environment these microorganisms produce corresponding induction enzymes which are involved in certain metabolic functions to degrade these pollutants ensuring normal cell growth during pollutant metabolism in addition the rapid development of molecular biology technology has facilitated studies of the microbial degradation of ppcps the isolated strain labrys portucalensis f11 was able to biodegrade 70 of dcf 1 7 34 μm as a sole carbon source and complete degradation was achieved via co metabolism with acetate moreira et al 2018 marco urrea et al 2010 reported almost complete degradation of 55 μg l 1 nap by fungus trametes after 5 h a strain of sphingomonas sp which can degrade ibu was screened and the metabolic pathway of ibu degradation was preliminarily studied murdoch and hay 2005 in a later study the gene cluster responsibles for ibu degradation and the location of functional genes were clarified murdoch and hay 2013 most studies focusing on microbial degradation of nsaids only evaluated one or a few compounds despite the fact that a wide variety of nsaids are present in the aquatic environment moreover there are relatively few studies regarding the simultaneous microbial degradation of multiple nsaids therefore the main aims of this study were to investigate the removal behavior of dcf nap and ibu through a bench scale bac process and the potential simultaneous elimination of these three nsaids by the isolated bacterial strain pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 the kinetics of biodegradation of the three nsaids as the sole carbon source and in co metabolism with glucose acetate or methanol was studied in addition we assessed the differences in bioremoval of the three nsaids in combination and individually and proposed the degradation pathway of each nsaid by uplc qqq ms analysis further the functional genes involved in the pathways of biodegradation of nsaids were analyzed with complete genome sequencing of din 3 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents a commercially gac huaqing carbon ltd china used in dwtps was chosen for this study it was derived from coal and

gac medium supported by a 20 cm layer of gravel at the bottom fig 1 backwashing was performed twice every week or when the head loss reached a critical value the level stand was used to guarantee a

biofilm formation stage and composed of tap water and deionized water methanol nsaids solution in the domestication period stage prior to commencing the utilization test of the three nsaids in the

bench scale experiments the removal of doc and three nsaids dcf ibu and nap and the growth of microorganisms in the bac column operated continuously for 400 days are shown in fig 2 in the biofilm formation stage the first 150 days the content of the doc in the column was maintained at about 2 mg l 1 by controlling the flow rate ratio of dosing tank solution glucose as carbon source and tap water after 100 days the doc removal remained stable at approximately 80 microorganisms rapidly proliferated and adhered to the surface of carbon particles throughout the operation on the 20th day the biomass was 3 89 107 cfu g and continued to increase by an order of magnitude to 1 30 108 cfu g at the 40th day a stable value of 4 50 108 cfu g was maintained after 90 days and until 150 days a previous study suggested that the growth of organisms was largely consistent with doc removal and when the effluent of the doc reached steady state a mature biofilm was formed on the surface of carbon particles velten et al 2007 therefore in our study glucose was no longer added and the three nsaids at a concentration of 20 μg l 1 were added after 150 days of operation methanol nsaids solution was used as a carbon source and the doc content was around 1 mg l 1 marking the beginning of the domestication period stage after 250 days the doc removal remained relatively stable at about 56 at this time the biomass was also stable at 3 30 108 cfu g after the addition of dcf ibu and nap the nsaids removal was not very consistent until 100 days after 100 days bac column operation for 250 days the removal was largely stable at over 95 however after bac column operation for 380 days the removal of dcf and nap decreased to about 90 and 91 respectively and the ibu removal remained over 95 the results showed that the bac process could efficiently reduce the concentrations of the three nsaids by more than 90 3 2 isolation and identification of the dcf nap and ibu degrading bacterium din 3 results from the bench scale test suggested that the bac treatment could efficiently eliminate the nsaids by more than 90 accordingly batch scale tests to determine the relative contribution to nsaids removal between adsorption and biodegradation were further conducted fig s1 the results showed that the adsorption isotherms of the three nsaids could be described well with the freundlich equation in the adsorption alone tests r2 0 8 fig s2 the nsaids removal increased with the gac concentration and reached a stable state when the dosage was 3 36 g l 1 and the removal of dcf ibu and nap were 96 92 86 24 and 90 50 respectively when the gac bacterial suspension system was obtained the nsaids were absolutely removed with the addition of 2 24 g l 1 of gac compared with adsorption alone nsaids dcf ibu and nap removal increased by 3 08 13 76 and 9 5 respectively mainly because of biodegradation in addition in the gac bacteria suspension system when gac concentration was greater than 1 g l 1 the biodegradation of the three nsaids weakened gradually which was attributed to the competition between biodegradation and gac adsorption and the maximum biodegradability of the nsaids were 14 04 25 58 and 23 64 respectively while in bacteria suspension alone tests dcf ibu and nap removal were 23 68 28 89 and 25 73 respectively the results showed that the removal was not just the simple cumulative effect of biodegradation and gac adsorption in gac bacteria suspension system although the contribution of gac adsorption and biodegradation to three nsaids removal was not distinguished in the bench scale test in this study the results suggested that biodegradation played a role in removing dcf ibu and nap in the bac process and bacteria capable of degrading these nsaids existed in the bac column therefore the dcf nap and ibu degrading bacterium was subsequently isolated and identified one strain with a fast growth rate and high removal rate of three nsaids named din 3 was selected as the experimental strain in this study 16s rdna gene sequence analysis of strain din 3 in the logarithmic growth stage was performed and the obtained gene sequence was registered in genbank with the accession number mh780880 the sequences were compared to known sequences in the genbank database using the blast search program followed by the construction of a phylogenetic tree fig 3 according to the obtained phylogenetic tree din 3 clustered with members of the genus pseudoxanthomonas several members of this genus have been isolated from many different environments patel et al 2012 isolated pseudoxanthomonas sp dmvp2 which was able to completely degrade 300 ppm of phenanthrene in minimal medium an acetamiprid degrading bacterium which was isolated from soil and able to degrade more than 80 of acetamiprid was identified as pseudoxanthomonas sp by wang et al 2013 the strain pseudoxanthomonas sp could degrade over 95 of the total 1 1 1 trichloro 2 2 bis p chlorophenyl ethane ddt 20 mg l 1 in the presence of glucose moreover this bacterium could also simultaneously co metabolize 1 1 dichloro 2 2 bis p chlorophenyl ethane ddd 2 2 bis p chlorophenyl 1 1 dichloroethylene dde and other organochlorine compounds wang et al 2010 bacteria of the genus pseudoxanthomonas play an important role in the biodegradation of organic xenobiotics with diverse metabolic pathways however to the best of our knowledge this is the first isolation of a pseudoxanthomonas strain that can degrade dcf ibu and nap simultaneously the taxonomic diversity of microbial communities among bca samples on operation day 200 and 350 along with the relative abundances are presented in fig 4 at the genus level methylobacillus ds 100 methylophilus norank o obscuribacterales and methyloversatilis were the dominant groups in the bac samples at day 200 and 350 these five genera accounted for more than 62 of the total bacteria in each sample in our study methanol was the main carbon source for the domestication period stage previous studies reported that methylobacillus methylophilus and methyloversatilis were capable of methanol degradation yordy and weaver 1977 windass et al 1980 which might be why these genera were prevalent in our samples in comparison the genus pseudoxanthomonas was rarely found in the sample on day 200 0 43 0 05 but accounted for 2 58 0 25 of bacteria in the 350 day sample which might indicate that these bacteria were stimulated by dcf ibu and nap in the bac process considering that the efficient removal behavior of dcf ibu and nap in the bench scale bac column and in the batch scale tests pseudoxanthomonas played an important role in the removal of the three nsaids 3 3 dcf ibu and nap bioremoval by din 3 in batch scale tests 3 3 1 dcf ibu and nap bioremoval by din 3 to investigate the bioremoval of dcf ibu and nap by pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 the strain was inoculated into inorganic salt medium with the three nsaids ranging in concentration from 10 to 50 μg l 1 as the sole carbon source fig 5 when the dcf concentration was 10 and 20 μg l 1 din 3 had a stable bioremoval of about 45 when the dcf concentration was increased to 30 μg l 1 the bioremoval was reduced to 26 and when the concentration was increased to 50 μg l 1 the bioremoval was reduced to 23 when the ibu concentration was 10 μg l 1 the bioremoval by strain din 3 reached 76 when the concentration was increased to 20 and 30 μg l 1 the removal rate decreased to 48 when increased to 50 μg l 1 the removal rate was reduced to 41 when the concentration of nap was 10 μg l 1 strain din 3 had a stable degradation rate of about 48 when increased to 20 and 30 μg l 1 the removal rate was reduced to 43 finally when the concentration was increased to 50 μg l 1 the removal rate was reduced to 39 when dcf ibu and nap were present without strain din 3 in the control experiments their concentration decreased only slightly suggesting that most of the degradation was caused by strain din 3 fig s3 the average bioremoval rate of the three nsaids was calculated in seven days table s1 when the nsaids concentration ranged from 10 20 μg l 1 the removal rate of ibu was higher than the other two compounds while the nsaids concentration ranged from 30 50 μg l 1 the removal rate of nap was higher than the other two compounds during 7 14 days the concentration of din 3 was stable fig s4 din 3 had almost no removal ability on nap and had a better removal ability on ibu fig 5 it indicated that bacteria have certain selectivity to compounds as shown in table s2 the removal rate constants and half lives ranged from 0 022 to 0 10 d 1 and from 6 9 to 31 5 d 1 respectively the r2 values ranged from 0 713 to 0 983 demonstrating that the first order kinetic model fit the data well when the concentration was increased from 10 to 30 μg l 1 the rate constants of dcf and nap changed minimally ranging from 0 038 to 0 046 and 0 048 to 0 056 respectively and the rate constant of ibu decreased from 0 05 to 0 10 when the concentration was increased to 50 μg l 1 the reaction rate constants of all three nsaids decreased indicating that the degradation ability was affected by the concentration of the drugs however the reaction rate constants of the strain for ibu were higher than for dcf and nap also indicating that the strain was more tolerant to ibu than the other two nsaids in brief the bioremoval of din 3 decreased as the concentration of the three nsaids increased without considering nsaids adsorption onto bacterial surfaces the main reason for this may be that din 3 has a certain selectivity to compounds however when their concentration approached the toxicity tolerance limit of din 3 bacterial activity was effectively inhibited and the bioremoval tended to decrease in turn 3 3 2 factors affecting dcf ibu and nap bioremoval by din 3 in reality a river or lake is a complex organic system with a wide range of biochemical activities that may significantly affect microbial activities including growth and degradation co substrates or co metabolism plays an important role in degradation of pollutants ciprofloxacin can be degraded faster in the presence of substrates that are easier to utilize such as glucose and sodium acetate xiong et al 2017 aquatic organisms are exposed to a mixture of ppcps over long periods of time because multiple ppcps are continuously consumed in large quantities schwaiger et al 2004 most studies on the factors associated with ppcp biodegradation have mainly focused on temperature and ph liao et al 2016 pan et al 2017 and little attention has been paid to the potential effects of a mixture of ppcps and co substrates on biodegradation chemicals in combination can have antagonistic or synergistic effects marking 1977 to assess whether the degradation of an individual contaminant is representative when assessing the environmental risks of mixtures the effect of din 3 on the individual compounds and a mixture thereof was also tested in our study fig 6 and fig s5 when dcf ibu or nap was supplied individually as the sole carbon source at 45 μg l 1 the bioremoval was about 50 8 55 8 and 55 3 respectively fig 6a in order to maintain the total concentration of nsaids 45 μg l 1 when the effect of din 3 on the mixture of nsaids was evaluated the concentration of each compound was set at 15 μg l 1 as shown in fig 6b the bioremoval of dcf ibu and nap in a mixture was 38 68 50 78 and 45 69 respectively in comparison with the bioremoval of the individual compounds those of the mixture decreased by 12 1 5 0 and 9 6 respectively however the bioremoval of ibu on day 14 in the mixture of nsaids at a total concentration of 45 μg l 1 was 52 1 which was in agreement with the ibu bioremoval alone at the concentration of 45 μg l 1 when dcf ibu and nap were considered collectively the total degradation was 44 4 which was 6 4 11 4 and 10 9 lower than that of the single drugs when the concentration of each compound in the mixture and individually was the same 45 μg l 1 the bioremoval of each compound was obviously decreased by 15 3 27 0 fig 6c and the total removal was 33 4 which was because the total concentration of the mixed compounds was three times that of the single compounds if only the presence of a single drug dcf ibu or nap was considered ignoring the presence of the other drugs the degradation ability of the bacterial strain was overestimated by 5 0 27 0 which was mainly due to the cumulative effects on compound concentration and the difference of bacterial resistance to individual compound i e the effect of nap or dcf on strain pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 was greater than that of ibu and thus the degradation rate of ibu was higher than that of dcf or nap in the same condition therefore it appeared that coexistence of some or all substances in an aquatic environment would have a considerable effect this was consistent with cleuvers 2004 earlier finding that the effects of mixed ppcps including dcf ibu and nap on aquatic organisms were significantly more pronounced than those of a single ppcp compound resulting in greater ecological risks consequently considering an aquatic environment with mostly low concentrations of pharmaceuticals and the generally higher toxicity of mixed compounds compared with single compounds we should focus more on investigation of mixed contaminants rather than a single contaminant to investigate the effects of the addition of a co substrate on bioremoval of the three nsaids by din 3 exogenous carbon glucose sodium acetate or methanol 1 mg l 1 doc was added to 50 μg l 1 nsaids with 50 μg l 1 nsaids alone used for the control experiment fig 7 and fig s6 the results revealed that treatment i glucose with nsaids treatment ii sodium acetate with nsaids and treatment iii methanol with nsaids resulted in considerably higher rates of dcf ibu and nap degradation than the corresponding control experiment there was no removal in the abiotic control tests indicating that the degradation was attributed to biodegradation activity fig s6 the dcf bioremoval of treatment i treatment ii and treatment iii were 41 43 and 44 respectively by contrast 22 75 of dcf was degraded in treatment ck the ibu bioremoval of treatment i treatment ii and treatment iii were 53 4 52 6 and 58 7 respectively by contrast 46 of ibu was degraded in treatment ck the nap bioremoval of treatment i treatment ii and treatment iii were 51 49 and 52 respectively by contrast 46 of nap was degraded in treatment ck these results indicated that the addition of exogenous carbon glucose sodium acetate or methanol had little impact on the degradation of dcf and nap however when methanol was used as an exogenous carbon source the degradation rate of ibu was higher than when glucose and sodium acetate were used as shown in table s3 the r2 values ranged from 0 844 to 0 935 demonstrating that the removal of dcf ibu and nap in all treatments could be well fitted using the first order kinetic model in all cases the addition of a carbon source accelerated at least slightly the degradation of the three nsaids compared with no addition of exogenous carbon in present study in terms of biomass din 3 had a short adjustment period in the first several days on day 7 the amount began to increase and the atp content was basically stable on day 10 and 14 fig s7 the average removal rate per biomass as the removal rate μg l 1 d 1 divided by the atp of din 3 ng ml 1 in 14 days was defined fig 7 din 3 was able to use three nsaids as the carbon source the average removal rate per biomass value of dcf ibu and nap was 0 28 0 55 and 0 46 respectively the average removal rate per biomass value of three nsaids was obtained when the glucose sodium acetate and methanol as additional carbon source for example after 14d of incubation the bioremoval rate of dcf was 0 85 μg l 1 d 1 with no additional carbon source while it was 1 47 1 52 and 1 57 μg l 1 d 1 with an additional carbon source glucose sodium acetate and methanol respectively and correspondingly the atp of din 3 was 3 02 5 69 4 81 and 5 58 ng ml 1 respectively fig s7 it was obvious that degradation occurred in the presence of additional exogenous carbon concomitantly with din 3 growth almeida et al 2013a assessed the kinetics of degradation of ibuprofen by patulibacter sp i11 by using the different additional carbon sources yeast extract and tryptone or different initial ibuprofen concentrations and found that ibuprofen degradation was simultaneously dependent on biomass growth rate and the ibuprofen concentration chong 2009 also proposed that degradation of a xenobiotic was a process dependent on the growth of degrading biomass compared with the three nsaids as sole carbon source the simultaneous utilization of exogenous carbon glucose sodium acetate and methanol with nsaids dcf ibu and nap may sustain din 3 growth and facilitate its biodegradability of nsaids overall it was assumed that nsaids degradation by din 3 was more strongly influenced by the exogenous carbon source while there was almost no difference in the average removal rate per biomass value of nsaid degradation among the three exogenous carbon sources 3 5 potential intermediates and pathways of dcf nap and ibu biodegradation the degradation products of dcf ibu and nap were extracted and identified by uplc qqq ms the structural identification of the intermediates was based on the analysis of the total ion chromatogram tic and the corresponding mass spectrum acquired in full scan mode due to the lack of standard chemicals for reference 3 5 1 dcf degradation pathway a total of 8 metabolites were detected in din 3 which were labeled as tp309 tp258 tp281 tp293 tp341 tp311 b tp360 and tp311 a with increasing retention times fig s8 the possible degradation pathway of dcf was shown in fig 8 the mass increase of 16 was observed in relation to the parent compound diclofenac dcf indicating that the addition of a hydroxyl group to the dcf tp311a 4 hydroxy dcf and tp311b 5 hydroxy dcf were already reported as primary transformation products tps jewell et al 2016 moreira et al 2018 the fragment ions of tp311a with m z 267 230 and 196 were indicative of co2 loss and two subsequent losses of hcl the fragment 166 2 2 amino 4 hydroxyphenyl acetic acid was formed due to the broken c n bond that occurred which indicated that hydroxylation must have taken place on the non chlorinated ring fig s9 thus tp311a was proposed to be 2 2 2 6 dichlorophenyl amino 4 hydroxyphenyl acetic acid and tp311b was proposed to be 2 2 2 6 dichloro 4 hydroxyphenyl amino phenyl acetic acid its fragment ions generated revealed the loss of hcl with m z 276 loss of co2 resulting in m z 232 and a final loss of hcl fig s10 the formation of tp309 e 2 6 2 6 dichlorophenyl imino 3 oxocyclohexa 1 4 dien 1 yl acetic acid was formed by an oxidation of tp311 a by dehydrogenation its fragmentation indicated the loss of co2 and two subsequent losses of hcl fig s11 the observed fragmentation with m z 246 and 212 of tp281 can be attributed to two subsequent losses of hcl and no loss of co2 fig s12 which confirmed that the carboxylic group had been already eliminated for tp281 the loss of a mass unit of 28 in relation to tp309 which can be explained by a decarboxylation reaction of the aliphatic chain and oxidation thus tp281 was proposed to be e 4 2 6 dichlorophenyl imino 3 hydroxymethyl cyclohexa 2 5 dien 1 one tp360 was formed via a sulfate conjugation of the hydroxyl group of tp281 the fragment m z 216 was formed due to the broken of c n bond followed by the breaking of the c o bond that occurred in the side chain forming m z 120 fig s13 thus tp360 was proposed to be e 6 2 6 dichlorophenyl imino 3 oxocyclohexa 1 4 dien 1 yl methyl hydrogen sulfate for tp341 its increases of 32 mass units in relation to tp309 corresponded to an addition of oxygen the proposed structure for tp341 was e 2 6 2 6 dichloro 3 4 dihydroxyphenyl imino 3 oxocyclohexa 1 4 dien 1 yl acetic acid the fragment ions showed that loss of co2 produced the m z 296 which was followed by two subsequent losses of hcl forming m z 262 and 228 fig s14 an intramolecular amidation of tp311 b was responsible for the formation of tp293 for which the proposed structure was 1 2 6 dichloro 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 oxoindolin 1 ium between tp258 and tp293 a m z decrease of 35 mass units via dechlorination reaction was found but no fragment m z 258 was found in fragmentation of tp293 fig s15 thus it was proposed that the tp258 was formed via intramolecular amidation and dechlorination reactions of tp311 b and the structure for tp258 was 1 2 chloro 4 hydroxyphenyl indolin 2 one the fragment ion with m z 224 was indicative of a loss of hcl fig s16 3 5 2 ibu degradation pathway the most abundant metabolites during ibuprofen ibu degradation are 1 hydroxy ibuprofen 1 oh ibu 2 hydroxy ibuprofen 2 oh ibu and ibuprofen carboxylic acid cbx ibu ternes 1998 ferrando climent et al 2012 salgado et al 2018 in the present study seven metabolites were detected in din 3 including tp399 tp301 tp297 tp237 tp235 tp265 and tp221 with increasing retention times fig s17 the possible degradation pathway of ibu is shown in fig 9 based on the precursor m z and ms fragmentation patterns the structures of metabolites tp235 and tp221 were proposed to be cbx ibu and 1 oh ibu respectively for tp211 the increase of 16 mass units was observed in relation to ibuprofen ibu indicating that the addition of a hydroxyl group to the ibu its fragment ions m z 177 and 159 likely resulted from a carboxyl group loss and subsequent a hydroxyl loss fig s18 which was consistent with previous studies about the fragmentations of 1 oh ibu ferrando climent et al 2012 salgado et al 2018 thus the proposed structure of tp211 was 2 4 1 hydroxy 2 methylpropyl phenyl propanoic acid tp237 was also generated from hydroxylation of tp221 and its fragment ions at m z 193 and 177 corresponded to a loss of a carboxyl group and then a hydroxyl fig s19 thus its structure was proposed to be 2 4 1 1 dihydroxy 2 methylpropyl phenyl propanoic acid salgado et al 2018 showed the isolated patulibacter medicamentivorans could continue oxidizing the ibu by an oxidation sequence of methyl groups in the present study tp265 and tp297 were likely generated from two subsequent oxidations from ch2oh group to cho and then cooh after the introduction of two hydroxyls in tp237 salgado et al 2018 for tp265 the fragments m z 249 and 219 resulted from a hydroxyl loss and the cleavage of hcoh fig s20 and it was proposed to be 2 4 2 formyl 1 1 dihydroxy 3 oxopropyl phenyl propanoic acid for tp297 the fragments revealed the two successive decarboxylations resulting in m z 209 and then the loss of a hydroxyl fig s21 and its proposed structure was 2 4 1 carboxyethyl phenyl dihydroxymethyl malonic acid with the subsequent oxidation tp339 was further formed with the structure being dimethyl 2 dihydroxy 4 1 methoxy 1 oxopropan 2 yl phenyl methyl malonate the fragments m z 321 and 305 resulted from two successive hydroxyl losses while the fragments m z 281 and 223 were attributed to two successive cleavages of cooch3 fig s22 the fragments m z 191 and 147 of precursor m z 235 were attributed two successive losses of carboxyl group fig s23 which was consistent with results reported for the biological transformation of ibu ferrando climent et al 2012 thus tp235 was proposed to be cbx ibu 3 4 1 carboxyethyl phenyl 2 methylpropanoic acid tp301 was obtained by the hydroxylation process of ibu and its proposed structure was 3 hydroxy 2 4 1 1 2 3 tetrahydroxy 2 hydroxymethyl propyl phenyl propanoic acid the fragment ion m z 241 was indicative of a loss of carboxyl group and a hydroxyl and m z 209 corresponded to the subsequent loss of a hydroxyl group fig s24 3 5 3 nap degradation pathway a total of 7 metabolites were detected in din 3 which were labeled as tp216 tp339 tp262 tp341 tp312 tp353 and tp332 with increasing retention times fig s25 the possible degradation pathway of nap is shown in fig 10 tp 216 presented a decrease of a methyl group to the nap resulting in an m z decrease of 14 the fragment ion m z 170 was indicative of a loss of carboxyl group and electron rearrangement and m z 154 corresponded to the loss of a hydroxyl group fig s26 thus the proposed structure for tp216 was 2 6 hydroxynaphthalen 2 yl propanoic acid the fragment ions at m z 159 can be attributed to a fracture of the naphthalene ring and fragment ions at m z 180 corresponded to tyrosine fig s27 thus tp 339 was proposed to be a tyrosine conjugated metabolite 6 7 dihydroxynaphthalen 2 yl tyrosine accordingly the fragments m z 179 and 159 observed on tp341 may be attributed to the dissociation of the ester side chain subsequent cleavage of hydroxyl group and tyrosine with the loss of co2 and electron rearrangement m z 118 fig s28 thus tp341 was still identified to be a tyrosine conjugated metabolite 6 2 amino 1 hydroxy 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propoxy naphthalene 2 3 diol the metabolite tp 353 was proposed to be a tyrosine conjugated metabolite 7 hydroxy 6 methoxynaphthalen 2 yl tyrosinate and its fragment ions m z 180 and 159 corresponded to the cleavage of the ester group fig s29 tp216 can be explained by conjugation with amino acid deriving a series of tyrosine conjugated metabolites e g tp339 tp341 and tp353 these metabolites were previously reported as a product of nap microbial transformation ding et al 2017 considering the mass increase of 32 between tp262 and parent compound nap tp262 corresponds to the introduction hydroxyl groups and was identified as 2 7 8 dihydroxy 6 methoxynaphthalen 2 yl propanoic acid fragment ions m z 217 and 97 of tp 262 in the spectrum showed the loss of a carboxyl group and a subsequent ring fracture fig s30 tp312 was tentatively identified as a product of hydroxylation and ring opening of naphthalene fig s31 and the proposed structure was e 6 2 carboxy 1 hydroxy 2 methoxyethylidene 4 1 carboxyethyl cyclohexa 2 4 diene 1 carboxylic acid subsequent hydroxylation resulted in the formation of tp332 1 hydroxy 7 hydroxynaphthalen 2 yl methyl naphthalene 2 6 diol and the observed fragment ions m z 268 185 170 and 127 can be attributed to the consecutive losses of hydroxyl groups and a subsequent fracture of naphthalene ring fig s32 3 6 nsaid degrading genes in strain din 3 in this study the isolated strain pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 could not only tolerate dcf ibu and nap at a certain concentration range but also degrade these nsaids however there are few studies regarding their biodegradation pathways the prediction of dcf ibu and nap biodegradation pathways in this study is mainly based on the identification of their degradation products and likewise there is a lack of in depth research on relevant catalytic enzymes and genes that regulate the whole degradation pathway with the breakthrough of sequencing technology the advantages of applying genomics to identify gene function have been gradually highlighted therefore based on the current experiments of dcf ibu and nap degradation by din 3 genomic analysis of their degradation was performed kegg pathway analysis is used to understand the high level functions and utilities of a biological system such as a cell organism and ecosystem using molecular data especially large scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high throughput experimental technologies ogata et al 1999 kegg pathway annotations or metabolic pathway annotations reveal which genes in the whole genome sequence play a common role in the production of target metabolites in this study the whole genome sequencing data of pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 predicted 3929 genes with a total length of 3 7 mb comparing the predictive genes of pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 with the kegg database 1865 genes were annotated in kegg pathways accounting for 47 5 of the total genes in the kegg pathway analysis cell processes accounted for 8 79 environmental information processing for 11 05 genetic information processing for 9 49 human diseases for 6 17 metabolism for 62 25 and organismal systems for 2 25 fig s33 in this study the biodegradation of nsaids by pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 was studied and therefore the genes related to the biodegradation of dcf ibu and nap by din 3 may participate in xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism as shown in figs s33 and 49 of the genes annotated in pseudoxanthomonas sp were related to xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism and mapped to 16 kegg pathways indicating that these genes might play a role in degrading dcf ibu and nap table s4 for example the poba gene in the benzoate degradation pathway ko00362 was detected in the biodegradation of dcf ibu and nap table s4 previous studies suggested that the enzyme catalyzing the first step in 4 hydroxybenzoate degradation by c pinatubonensis was encoded by poba gene donoso et al 2011 in the present study the monooxygenase encoded by poba was involved in the dcf biotransformation from tp309 to tp341 fig 8 the cog database determines the function of a gene by annotating classifying and analyzing the evolution of the predicted proteins by comparing the genes of pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 with the cog database a total of 337 enzymes were found that are possibly involved in dcf ibu and nap degradation some are listed in table 1 among them dehydrogenase and hydrolase accounted for 28 78 and 34 42 respectively followed by oxidoreductase oxidase and dioxygenase accounting for 11 87 11 28 and 8 61 respectively decarboxylase hydroxylase monooxygenase and dehalogenase were also possibly involved monooxygenase which is involved in hydroxylation along with dioxygenase accounted for 1 78 while decarboxylase involved in decarboxylation accounted for 1 5 these results were in agreement with previous studies that revealed that dioxygenase parales et al 2000 and monooxygenase yoshida et al 2007 played a crucial role in nap degradation in addition these results coincided with our pathway analysis based on chemical evaluation and some previous studies which noted that hydroxylation and decarboxylation were the two main biodegradation mechanisms for aromatic rings harayama and rekik 1989 kamada et al 2002 chakraborty and coates 2005 this study attempts to provide a better understanding of the nsaids biodegradation process by pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 with the combination of genome sequencing and uplc qqq ms analyses the fragment m z 209 of the ibu the biodegradation product tp265 was attributed to successive decarboxylation fig s20 the well known primary transformation products tp311 a and tp311 b were obtained by the hydroxylation process of dcf fig 8 almeida et al 2013b found that four orthologous genes ipfabde known to be involved in aromatic acid degradation were also involved in the degradation of ibuprofen in patulibacter sp i11 the other orthologous gene ipff was found to be involved in an acyl coa synthetase amp forming which is well known for the aerobic catabolism of aromatic hydrocarbons by catalyzing the hydroxylation of double bonds after the opening of the aromatic ring martinez blanco et al 1990 although five orthologous genes were not detected in din 3 other annotated genes involved in similar function amp forming were found i e gene2082 gene1243 gene1746 and gene2492 table 1 the nap biodegradation product tp312 fig s31 based on uplc qqq ms analysis was identified as a product of hydroxylation and ring opening of naphthalene by acyl coa synthetase 4 conclusions this study revealed that the bac process is an effective technology for the removal of nsaids in addition the use of pseudoxanthomonas sp for the elimination of nsaids dcf ibu and nap was demonstrated for the first time the bacterial strain pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 isolated from bac columns was able to degrade 23 48 of dcf ibu and nap simultaneously at lower concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 μg l 1 and the strain more effectively degraded ibu than the other two nsaids exogenous carbon effectively boosted the elimination of dcf ibu and nap with a simultaneous increase in bacterial growth the main degradation pathways of dcf ibu and nap appeared to involve hydroxylation decarboxylation and partial dechlorination of the compounds and some enzymes dehydrogenase hydrolase dioxygenase decarboxylase etc played a role in their degradation based on degradation experiments and the newly sequenced genome of strain din 3 if the presence of a single drug ibu dcf or nap was assumed ignoring the other drugs the degradation by strain din 3 was overestimated by 5 0 27 0 nonetheless this research shows the potential of the use of such strain for bioaugmentation of contaminated sites or bioreactors however a reasonable assessment of bioremoval in the environment should be performed considering the combined effects of various contaminants importantly these results may provide a theoretical basis for the development of microbial agents with high removal of dcf ibu and nap as well as the control of environmental pollution with nsaids declaration of interests the authors

18707,the presence of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids in the environment is an emerging concern owing to their potential threat on aquatic ecosystems and living organisms to investigate the bioremoval potential of a biological activated carbon bac filter for the removal of nsaids removal of diclofenac dcf ibuprofen ibu and naproxen nap by biofilms on a bench scaled bac column operated for 400 days was studied the results showed that the bac column effectively removed the three nsaids 90 one bacterial strain isolated from the bac pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 was able to simultaneously remove dcf ibu and nap which were supplied as the sole carbon source in 14 days 23 41 and 39 of dcf ibu and nap 50 μg l 1 were bioremoved respectively and strain din 3 eliminated ibu more rapidly than the other two nsaids if only a single drug was added as the sole carbon source ignoring the other drugs the removal ability was overestimated by 5 0 27 0 more efficient bioremoval was achieved concomitantly with bacterial growth via a co metabolism with acetate glucose or methanol their intermediates were identified by uplc qqq ms and their respective degradation pathways were also proposed moreover based on the complete genome sequence of strain din 3 49 related genes encoding the main enzymes involved in dcf ibu and nap biodegradation were identified including heme lpd yihx ligc poba and liga these results suggested that pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 is a potential degrader of dcf ibu and nap and to the best of our knowledge this is the first report that demonstrates the bioremoval of dcf ibu and nap simultaneously by an individual bacterial strain isolated from the environment however the bioremoval potential should be evaluated when assessing the applicability of the strain in the environment because of the combined effects of various pharmaceutical contaminants the obtained results provide a foundation for the use of pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 in the bioremoval of polycyclic nsaid contaminated environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 bioremoval biological activated

academia government and industry alvarino et al 2015 ppcps in an aquatic environment are mainly derived from industrial domestic farming and animal husbandry wastewater in addition owing to the lack of effective treatment methods and technologies a large number of ppcps are discharged through wastewater surface runoff and landfill leachate infiltration evgenidou et al 2015 although the half life of most ppcps is short the frequent use of ppcps by individuals and in animal husbandry leads to continuous introduction of ppcps into aquatic environments in what is considered a pseudo persistent phenomenon many drugs bioaccumulate and cause chronic toxicity with a three cause effect carcinogenesis teratogenesis and mutagenicity observed lajeunesse et al 2013 among them non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids which include ibuprofen ibu naproxen nap diclofenac dcf and ketoprofen are commonly found in raw water source of drinking water treatment plants dwtps because of their widespread and extensive use ternes 1998 heberer et al 2002 zhao et al 2009 investigated acidic drug residues in the pearl river system in china revealing that the highest concentrations of ibu dcf and nap were 685 ng l 1 150 ng l 1 and 125 ng l 1 respectively dcf and ibu were also detected at very low levels in raw or treated drinking water heberer et al 2001 and in groundwater samples sacher et al 2001 although the individual toxicity of nsaids is relatively low once combined with other pharmaceuticals in aqueous solution the toxic effect of each compound is amplified to different degrees mcclellan and halden 2010 cleuvers 2004 studied the effects of ppcp mixtures including dcf ibu and nap on the potential ecotoxicity in aquatic organisms such as water fleas and algae and the results confirmed that the effects of mixed ppcps on aquatic organisms were significantly more severe than those of individual ppcps presenting greater ecological risks studies have shown that conventional treatment processes are relatively ineffective in the removal of ppcps e g dcf ibu and bisphenol a from water sources and wastewater treatment plants wwtps kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 rosal et al 2010 many techniques have been applied to the removal or reduction of some pharmaceuticals in water and wastewater such as ozonation moreira et al 2015 hama aziz et al 2017 photocatalysis mendez arriaga et al 2008 moreira et al 2015 and membrane filtration snyder et al 2007 compared with other techniques adsorption is an important alternative process owing to its simplicity and high removal efficiency saleh and gupta 2012 among the prominent adsorbents granular activated carbon gac exhibiting a characteristic pore structure with large pore volume and high surface area has been widely used to remove organic contaminants from water and wastewater sabio et al 2006 sotelo et al 2014 the activated carbon filter involves both adsorption and biological treatment and is widely used in dwtps i e sand filter activated carbon filter and o3 gac bac ppcps are not currently regulated in drinking water however it is important to understand whether or not the treatments applied to dwtps can eliminate ppcps rigobello et al 2013 few studies have investigated pharmaceutical adsorption in bed columns in dwtps sotelo et al 2012 2014 rigobello et al 2013 sotelo et al 2014 showed that the efficiency of dcf removal by gac column adsorption ranged from 66 74 to 80 85 rigobello et al 2013 found that conventional drinking water treatment followed by gac filtration was effective for removal of dcf 99 7 at the laboratory scale additionally sang et al 2007 demonstrated that conventional drinking water treatment methods were relatively inefficient for pharmaceutical and endocrine disruptor removal whereas efficient removal 99 of ibu was achieved by gac at the seoul drinking water treatment facility ternes et al 2002 suggested that conventional drinking water treatment was ineffective for removal of dcf but after gac filtration dcf was not detected above 2 ng l 1 with 96 elimination in real waterworks the indigenous microbial population is attached to the gac which gradually forms a biological activated carbon bac filter requiring about three months to achieve steady state conditions carlson and amy 1998 therefore the bac process applied to in dwtps greatly improves the ability to remove contaminants through adsorption and biodegradation which occur simultaneously and synergistically although significant removal of dcf 96 was observed in waterworks the mechanism adsorption and biodegradation was not elucidated ternes et al 2002 microbial removal is safe and effective and under reasonable control will not cause secondary pollution of the environment contaminant degrading microorganisms are usually present in the environment in large quantities and are derived from a wide variety of sources meanwhile the residual pollutants in the environment cause genetic mutation of other microorganisms resulting in new mutants in order to adapt to the environment these microorganisms produce corresponding induction enzymes which are involved in certain metabolic functions to degrade these pollutants ensuring normal cell growth during pollutant metabolism in addition the rapid development of molecular biology technology has facilitated studies of the microbial degradation of ppcps the isolated strain labrys portucalensis f11 was able to biodegrade 70 of dcf 1 7 34 μm as a sole carbon source and complete degradation was achieved via co metabolism with acetate moreira et al 2018 marco urrea et al 2010 reported almost complete degradation of 55 μg l 1 nap by fungus trametes after 5 h a strain of sphingomonas sp which can degrade ibu was screened and the metabolic pathway of ibu degradation was preliminarily studied murdoch and hay 2005 in a later study the gene cluster responsibles for ibu degradation and the location of functional genes were clarified murdoch and hay 2013 most studies focusing on microbial degradation of nsaids only evaluated one or a few compounds despite the fact that a wide variety of nsaids are present in the aquatic environment moreover there are relatively few studies regarding the simultaneous microbial degradation of multiple nsaids therefore the main aims of this study were to investigate the removal behavior of dcf nap and ibu through a bench scale bac process and the potential simultaneous elimination of these three nsaids by the isolated bacterial strain pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 the kinetics of biodegradation of the three nsaids as the sole carbon source and in co metabolism with glucose acetate or methanol was studied in addition we assessed the differences in bioremoval of the three nsaids in combination and individually and proposed the degradation pathway of each nsaid by uplc qqq ms analysis further the functional genes involved in the pathways of biodegradation of nsaids were analyzed with complete genome sequencing of din 3 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents a commercially gac huaqing carbon ltd china used in dwtps was chosen for this study it was derived from coal and

bench scale experiments the removal of doc and three nsaids dcf ibu and nap and the growth of microorganisms in the bac column operated continuously for 400 days are shown in fig 2 in the biofilm formation stage the first 150 days the content of the doc in the column was maintained at about 2 mg l 1 by controlling the flow rate ratio of dosing tank solution glucose as carbon source and tap water after 100 days the doc removal remained stable at approximately 80 microorganisms rapidly proliferated and adhered to the surface of carbon particles throughout the operation on the 20th day the biomass was 3 89 107 cfu g and continued to increase by an order of magnitude to 1 30 108 cfu g at the 40th day a stable value of 4 50 108 cfu g was maintained after 90 days and until 150 days a previous study suggested that the growth of organisms was largely consistent with doc removal and when the effluent of the doc reached steady state a mature biofilm was formed on the surface of carbon particles velten et al 2007 therefore in our study glucose was no longer added and the three nsaids at a concentration of 20 μg l 1 were added after 150 days of operation methanol nsaids solution was used as a carbon source and the doc content was around 1 mg l 1 marking the beginning of the domestication period stage after 250 days the doc removal remained relatively stable at about 56 at this time the biomass was also stable at 3 30 108 cfu g after the addition of dcf ibu and nap the nsaids removal was not very consistent until 100 days after 100 days bac column operation for 250 days the removal was largely stable at over 95 however after bac column operation for 380 days the removal of dcf and nap decreased to about 90 and 91 respectively and the ibu removal remained over 95 the results showed that the bac process could efficiently reduce the concentrations of the three nsaids by more than 90 3 2 isolation and identification of the dcf nap and ibu degrading bacterium din 3 results from the bench scale test suggested that the bac treatment could efficiently eliminate the nsaids by more than 90 accordingly batch scale tests to determine the relative contribution to nsaids removal between adsorption and biodegradation were further conducted fig s1 the results showed that the adsorption isotherms of the three nsaids could be described well with the freundlich equation in the adsorption alone tests r2 0 8 fig s2 the nsaids removal increased with the gac concentration and reached a stable state when the dosage was 3 36 g l 1 and the removal of dcf ibu and nap were 96 92 86 24 and 90 50 respectively when the gac bacterial suspension system was obtained the nsaids were absolutely removed with the addition of 2 24 g l 1 of gac compared with adsorption alone nsaids dcf ibu and nap removal increased by 3 08 13 76 and 9 5 respectively mainly because of biodegradation in addition in the gac bacteria suspension system when gac concentration was greater than 1 g l 1 the biodegradation of the three nsaids weakened gradually which was attributed to the competition between biodegradation and gac adsorption and the maximum biodegradability of the nsaids were 14 04 25 58 and 23 64 respectively while in bacteria suspension alone tests dcf ibu and nap removal were 23 68 28 89 and 25 73 respectively the results showed that the removal was not just the simple cumulative effect of biodegradation and gac adsorption in gac bacteria suspension system although the contribution of gac adsorption and biodegradation to three nsaids removal was not distinguished in the bench scale test in this study the results suggested that biodegradation played a role in removing dcf ibu and nap in the bac process and bacteria capable of degrading these nsaids existed in the bac column therefore the dcf nap and ibu degrading bacterium was subsequently isolated and identified one strain with a fast growth rate and high removal rate of three nsaids named din 3 was selected as the experimental strain in this study 16s rdna gene sequence analysis of strain din 3 in the logarithmic growth stage was performed and the obtained gene sequence was registered in genbank with the accession number mh780880 the sequences were compared to known sequences in the genbank database using the blast search program followed by the construction of a phylogenetic tree fig 3 according to the obtained phylogenetic tree din 3 clustered with members of the genus pseudoxanthomonas several members of this genus have been isolated from many different environments patel et al 2012 isolated pseudoxanthomonas sp dmvp2 which was able to completely degrade 300 ppm of phenanthrene in minimal medium an acetamiprid degrading bacterium which was isolated from soil and able to degrade more than 80 of acetamiprid was identified as pseudoxanthomonas sp by wang et al 2013 the strain pseudoxanthomonas sp could degrade over 95 of the total 1 1 1 trichloro 2 2 bis p chlorophenyl ethane ddt 20 mg l 1 in the presence of glucose moreover this bacterium could also simultaneously co metabolize 1 1 dichloro 2 2 bis p chlorophenyl ethane ddd 2 2 bis p chlorophenyl 1 1 dichloroethylene dde and other organochlorine compounds wang et al 2010 bacteria of the genus pseudoxanthomonas play an important role in the biodegradation of organic xenobiotics with diverse metabolic pathways however to the best of our knowledge this is the first isolation of a pseudoxanthomonas strain that can degrade dcf ibu and nap simultaneously the taxonomic diversity of microbial communities among bca samples on operation day 200 and 350 along with the relative abundances are presented in fig 4 at the genus level methylobacillus ds 100 methylophilus norank o obscuribacterales and methyloversatilis were the dominant groups in the bac samples at day 200 and 350 these five genera accounted for more than 62 of the total bacteria in each sample in our study methanol was the main carbon source for the domestication period stage previous studies reported that methylobacillus methylophilus and methyloversatilis were capable of methanol degradation yordy and weaver 1977 windass et al 1980 which might be why these genera were prevalent in our samples in comparison the genus pseudoxanthomonas was rarely found in the sample on day 200 0 43 0 05 but accounted for 2 58 0 25 of bacteria in the 350 day sample which might indicate that these bacteria were stimulated by dcf ibu and nap in the bac process considering that the efficient removal behavior of dcf ibu and nap in the bench scale bac column and in the batch scale tests pseudoxanthomonas played an important role in the removal of the three nsaids 3 3 dcf ibu and nap bioremoval by din 3 in batch scale tests 3 3 1 dcf ibu and nap bioremoval by din 3 to investigate the bioremoval of dcf ibu and nap by pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 the strain was inoculated into inorganic salt medium with the three nsaids ranging in concentration from 10 to 50 μg l 1 as the sole carbon source fig 5 when the dcf concentration was 10 and 20 μg l 1 din 3 had a stable bioremoval of about 45 when the dcf concentration was increased to 30 μg l 1 the bioremoval was reduced to 26 and when the concentration was increased to 50 μg l 1 the bioremoval was reduced to 23 when the ibu concentration was 10 μg l 1 the bioremoval by strain din 3 reached 76 when the concentration was increased to 20 and 30 μg l 1 the removal rate decreased to 48 when increased to 50 μg l 1 the removal rate was reduced to 41 when the concentration of nap was 10 μg l 1 strain din 3 had a stable degradation rate of about 48 when increased to 20 and 30 μg l 1 the removal rate was reduced to 43 finally when the concentration was increased to 50 μg l 1 the removal rate was reduced to 39 when dcf ibu and nap were present without strain din 3 in the control experiments their concentration decreased only slightly suggesting that most of the degradation was caused by strain din 3 fig s3 the average bioremoval rate of the three nsaids was calculated in seven days table s1 when the nsaids concentration ranged from 10 20 μg l 1 the removal rate of ibu was higher than the other two compounds while the nsaids concentration ranged from 30 50 μg l 1 the removal rate of nap was higher than the other two compounds during 7 14 days the concentration of din 3 was stable fig s4 din 3 had almost no removal ability on nap and had a better removal ability on ibu fig 5 it indicated that bacteria have certain selectivity to compounds as shown in table s2 the removal rate constants and half lives ranged from 0 022 to 0 10 d 1 and from 6 9 to 31 5 d 1 respectively the r2 values ranged from 0 713 to 0 983 demonstrating that the first order kinetic model fit the data well when the concentration was increased from 10 to 30 μg l 1 the rate constants of dcf and nap changed minimally ranging from 0 038 to 0 046 and 0 048 to 0 056 respectively and the rate constant of ibu decreased from 0 05 to 0 10 when the concentration was increased to 50 μg l 1 the reaction rate constants of all three nsaids decreased indicating that the degradation ability was affected by the concentration of the drugs however the reaction rate constants of the strain for ibu were higher than for dcf and nap also indicating that the strain was more tolerant to ibu than the other two nsaids in brief the bioremoval of din 3 decreased as the concentration of the three nsaids increased without considering nsaids adsorption onto bacterial surfaces the main reason for this may be that din 3 has a certain selectivity to compounds however when their concentration approached the toxicity tolerance limit of din 3 bacterial activity was effectively inhibited and the bioremoval tended to decrease in turn 3 3 2 factors affecting dcf ibu and nap bioremoval by din 3 in reality a river or lake is a complex organic system with a wide range of biochemical activities that may significantly affect microbial activities including growth and degradation co substrates or co metabolism plays an important role in degradation of pollutants ciprofloxacin can be degraded faster in the presence of substrates that are easier to utilize such as glucose and sodium acetate xiong et al 2017 aquatic organisms are exposed to a mixture of ppcps over long periods of time because multiple ppcps are continuously consumed in large quantities schwaiger et al 2004 most studies on the factors associated with ppcp biodegradation have mainly focused on temperature and ph liao et al 2016 pan et al 2017 and little attention has been paid to the potential effects of a mixture of ppcps and co substrates on biodegradation chemicals in combination can have antagonistic or synergistic effects marking 1977 to assess whether the degradation of an individual contaminant is representative when assessing the environmental risks of mixtures the effect of din 3 on the individual compounds and a mixture thereof was also tested in our study fig 6 and fig s5 when dcf ibu or nap was supplied individually as the sole carbon source at 45 μg l 1 the bioremoval was about 50 8 55 8 and 55 3 respectively fig 6a in order to maintain the total concentration of nsaids 45 μg l 1 when the effect of din 3 on the mixture of nsaids was evaluated the concentration of each compound was set at 15 μg l 1 as shown in fig 6b the bioremoval of dcf ibu and nap in a mixture was 38 68 50 78 and 45 69 respectively in comparison with the bioremoval of the individual compounds those of the mixture decreased by 12 1 5 0 and 9 6 respectively however the bioremoval of ibu on day 14 in the mixture of nsaids at a total concentration of 45 μg l 1 was 52 1 which was in agreement with the ibu bioremoval alone at the concentration of 45 μg l 1 when dcf ibu and nap were considered collectively the total degradation was 44 4 which was 6 4 11 4 and 10 9 lower than that of the single drugs when the concentration of each compound in the mixture and individually was the same 45 μg l 1 the bioremoval of each compound was obviously decreased by 15 3 27 0 fig 6c and the total removal was 33 4 which was because the total concentration of the mixed compounds was three times that of the single compounds if only the presence of a single drug dcf ibu or nap was considered ignoring the presence of the other drugs the degradation ability of the bacterial strain was overestimated by 5 0 27 0 which was mainly due to the cumulative effects on compound concentration and the difference of bacterial resistance to individual compound i e the effect of nap or dcf on strain pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 was greater than that of ibu and thus the degradation rate of ibu was higher than that of dcf or nap in the same condition therefore it appeared that coexistence of some or all substances in an aquatic environment would have a considerable effect this was consistent with cleuvers 2004 earlier finding that the effects of mixed ppcps including dcf ibu and nap on aquatic organisms were significantly more pronounced than those of a single ppcp compound resulting in greater ecological risks consequently considering an aquatic environment with mostly low concentrations of pharmaceuticals and the generally higher toxicity of mixed compounds compared with single compounds we should focus more on investigation of mixed contaminants rather than a single contaminant to investigate the effects of the addition of a co substrate on bioremoval of the three nsaids by din 3 exogenous carbon glucose sodium acetate or methanol 1 mg l 1 doc was added to 50 μg l 1 nsaids with 50 μg l 1 nsaids alone used for the control experiment fig 7 and fig s6 the results revealed that treatment i glucose with nsaids treatment ii sodium acetate with nsaids and treatment iii methanol with nsaids resulted in considerably higher rates of dcf ibu and nap degradation than the corresponding control experiment there was no removal in the abiotic control tests indicating that the degradation was attributed to biodegradation activity fig s6 the dcf bioremoval of treatment i treatment ii and treatment iii were 41 43 and 44 respectively by contrast 22 75 of dcf was degraded in treatment ck the ibu bioremoval of treatment i treatment ii and treatment iii were 53 4 52 6 and 58 7 respectively by contrast 46 of ibu was degraded in treatment ck the nap bioremoval of treatment i treatment ii and treatment iii were 51 49 and 52 respectively by contrast 46 of nap was degraded in treatment ck these results indicated that the addition of exogenous carbon glucose sodium acetate or methanol had little impact on the degradation of dcf and nap however when methanol was used as an exogenous carbon source the degradation rate of ibu was higher than when glucose and sodium acetate were used as shown in table s3 the r2 values ranged from 0 844 to 0 935 demonstrating that the removal of dcf ibu and nap in all treatments could be well fitted using the first order kinetic model in all cases the addition of a carbon source accelerated at least slightly the degradation of the three nsaids compared with no addition of exogenous carbon in present study in terms of biomass din 3 had a short adjustment period in the first several days on day 7 the amount began to increase and the atp content was basically stable on day 10 and 14 fig s7 the average removal rate per biomass as the removal rate μg l 1 d 1 divided by the atp of din 3 ng ml 1 in 14 days was defined fig 7 din 3 was able to use three nsaids as the carbon source the average removal rate per biomass value of dcf ibu and nap was 0 28 0 55 and 0 46 respectively the average removal rate per biomass value of three nsaids was obtained when the glucose sodium acetate and methanol as additional carbon source for example after 14d of incubation the bioremoval rate of dcf was 0 85 μg l 1 d 1 with no additional carbon source while it was 1 47 1 52 and 1 57 μg l 1 d 1 with an additional carbon source glucose sodium acetate and methanol respectively and correspondingly the atp of din 3 was 3 02 5 69 4 81 and 5 58 ng ml 1 respectively fig s7 it was obvious that degradation occurred in the presence of additional exogenous carbon concomitantly with din 3 growth almeida et al 2013a assessed the kinetics of degradation of ibuprofen by patulibacter sp i11 by using the different additional carbon sources yeast extract and tryptone or different initial ibuprofen concentrations and found that ibuprofen degradation was simultaneously dependent on biomass growth rate and the ibuprofen concentration chong 2009 also proposed that degradation of a xenobiotic was a process dependent on the growth of degrading biomass compared with the three nsaids as sole carbon source the simultaneous utilization of exogenous carbon glucose sodium acetate and methanol with nsaids dcf ibu and nap may sustain din 3 growth and facilitate its biodegradability of nsaids overall it was assumed that nsaids degradation by din 3 was more strongly influenced by the exogenous carbon source while there was almost no difference in the average removal rate per biomass value of nsaid degradation among the three exogenous carbon sources 3 5 potential intermediates and pathways of dcf nap and ibu biodegradation the degradation products of dcf ibu and nap were extracted and identified by uplc qqq ms the structural identification of the intermediates was based on the analysis of the total ion chromatogram tic and the corresponding mass spectrum acquired in full scan mode due to the lack of standard chemicals for reference 3 5 1 dcf degradation pathway a total of 8 metabolites were detected in din 3 which were labeled as tp309 tp258 tp281 tp293 tp341 tp311 b tp360 and tp311 a with increasing retention times fig s8 the possible degradation pathway of dcf was shown in fig 8 the mass increase of 16 was observed in relation to the parent compound diclofenac dcf indicating that the addition of a hydroxyl group to the dcf tp311a 4 hydroxy dcf and tp311b 5 hydroxy dcf were already reported as primary transformation products tps jewell et al 2016 moreira et al 2018 the fragment ions of tp311a with m z 267 230 and 196 were indicative of co2 loss and two subsequent losses of hcl the fragment 166 2 2 amino 4 hydroxyphenyl acetic acid was formed due to the broken c n bond that occurred which indicated that hydroxylation must have taken place on the non chlorinated ring fig s9 thus tp311a was proposed to be 2 2 2 6 dichlorophenyl amino 4 hydroxyphenyl acetic acid and tp311b was proposed to be 2 2 2 6 dichloro 4 hydroxyphenyl amino phenyl acetic acid its fragment ions generated revealed the loss of hcl with m z 276 loss of co2 resulting in m z 232 and a final loss of hcl fig s10 the formation of tp309 e 2 6 2 6 dichlorophenyl imino 3 oxocyclohexa 1 4 dien 1 yl acetic acid was formed by an oxidation of tp311 a by dehydrogenation its fragmentation indicated the loss of co2 and two subsequent losses of hcl fig s11 the observed fragmentation with m z 246 and 212 of tp281 can be attributed to two subsequent losses of hcl and no loss of co2 fig s12 which confirmed that the carboxylic group had been already eliminated for tp281 the loss of a mass unit of 28 in relation to tp309 which can be explained by a decarboxylation reaction of the aliphatic chain and oxidation thus tp281 was proposed to be e 4 2 6 dichlorophenyl imino 3 hydroxymethyl cyclohexa 2 5 dien 1 one tp360 was formed via a sulfate conjugation of the hydroxyl group of tp281 the fragment m z 216 was formed due to the broken of c n bond followed by the breaking of the c o bond that occurred in the side chain forming m z 120 fig s13 thus tp360 was proposed to be e 6 2 6 dichlorophenyl imino 3 oxocyclohexa 1 4 dien 1 yl methyl hydrogen sulfate for tp341 its increases of 32 mass units in relation to tp309 corresponded to an addition of oxygen the proposed structure for tp341 was e 2 6 2 6 dichloro 3 4 dihydroxyphenyl imino 3 oxocyclohexa 1 4 dien 1 yl acetic acid the fragment ions showed that loss of co2 produced the m z 296 which was followed by two subsequent losses of hcl forming m z 262 and 228 fig s14 an intramolecular amidation of tp311 b was responsible for the formation of tp293 for which the proposed structure was 1 2 6 dichloro 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 oxoindolin 1 ium between tp258 and tp293 a m z decrease of 35 mass units via dechlorination reaction was found but no fragment m z 258 was found in fragmentation of tp293 fig s15 thus it was proposed that the tp258 was formed via intramolecular amidation and dechlorination reactions of tp311 b and the structure for tp258 was 1 2 chloro 4 hydroxyphenyl indolin 2 one the fragment ion with m z 224 was indicative of a loss of hcl fig s16 3 5 2 ibu degradation pathway the most abundant metabolites during ibuprofen ibu degradation are 1 hydroxy ibuprofen 1 oh ibu 2 hydroxy ibuprofen 2 oh ibu and ibuprofen carboxylic acid cbx ibu ternes 1998 ferrando climent et al 2012 salgado et al 2018 in the present study seven metabolites were detected in din 3 including tp399 tp301 tp297 tp237 tp235 tp265 and tp221 with increasing retention times fig s17 the possible degradation pathway of ibu is shown in fig 9 based on the precursor m z and ms fragmentation patterns the structures of metabolites tp235 and tp221 were proposed to be cbx ibu and 1 oh ibu respectively for tp211 the increase of 16 mass units was observed in relation to ibuprofen ibu indicating that the addition of a hydroxyl group to the ibu its fragment ions m z 177 and 159 likely resulted from a carboxyl group loss and subsequent a hydroxyl loss fig s18 which was consistent with previous studies about the fragmentations of 1 oh ibu ferrando climent et al 2012 salgado et al 2018 thus the proposed structure of tp211 was 2 4 1 hydroxy 2 methylpropyl phenyl propanoic acid tp237 was also generated from hydroxylation of tp221 and its fragment ions at m z 193 and 177 corresponded to a loss of a carboxyl group and then a hydroxyl fig s19 thus its structure was proposed to be 2 4 1 1 dihydroxy 2 methylpropyl phenyl propanoic acid salgado et al 2018 showed the isolated patulibacter medicamentivorans could continue oxidizing the ibu by an oxidation sequence of methyl groups in the present study tp265 and tp297 were likely generated from two subsequent oxidations from ch2oh group to cho and then cooh after the introduction of two hydroxyls in tp237 salgado et al 2018 for tp265 the fragments m z 249 and 219 resulted from a hydroxyl loss and the cleavage of hcoh fig s20 and it was proposed to be 2 4 2 formyl 1 1 dihydroxy 3 oxopropyl phenyl propanoic acid for tp297 the fragments revealed the two successive decarboxylations resulting in m z 209 and then the loss of a hydroxyl fig s21 and its proposed structure was 2 4 1 carboxyethyl phenyl dihydroxymethyl malonic acid with the subsequent oxidation tp339 was further formed with the structure being dimethyl 2 dihydroxy 4 1 methoxy 1 oxopropan 2 yl phenyl methyl malonate the fragments m z 321 and 305 resulted from two successive hydroxyl losses while the fragments m z 281 and 223 were attributed to two successive cleavages of cooch3 fig s22 the fragments m z 191 and 147 of precursor m z 235 were attributed two successive losses of carboxyl group fig s23 which was consistent with results reported for the biological transformation of ibu ferrando climent et al 2012 thus tp235 was proposed to be cbx ibu 3 4 1 carboxyethyl phenyl 2 methylpropanoic acid tp301 was obtained by the hydroxylation process of ibu and its proposed structure was 3 hydroxy 2 4 1 1 2 3 tetrahydroxy 2 hydroxymethyl propyl phenyl propanoic acid the fragment ion m z 241 was indicative of a loss of carboxyl group and a hydroxyl and m z 209 corresponded to the subsequent loss of a hydroxyl group fig s24 3 5 3 nap degradation pathway a total of 7 metabolites were detected in din 3 which were labeled as tp216 tp339 tp262 tp341 tp312 tp353 and tp332 with increasing retention times fig s25 the possible degradation pathway of nap is shown in fig 10 tp 216 presented a decrease of a methyl group to the nap resulting in an m z decrease of 14 the fragment ion m z 170 was indicative of a loss of carboxyl group and electron rearrangement and m z 154 corresponded to the loss of a hydroxyl group fig s26 thus the proposed structure for tp216 was 2 6 hydroxynaphthalen 2 yl propanoic acid the fragment ions at m z 159 can be attributed to a fracture of the naphthalene ring and fragment ions at m z 180 corresponded to tyrosine fig s27 thus tp 339 was proposed to be a tyrosine conjugated metabolite 6 7 dihydroxynaphthalen 2 yl tyrosine accordingly the fragments m z 179 and 159 observed on tp341 may be attributed to the dissociation of the ester side chain subsequent cleavage of hydroxyl group and tyrosine with the loss of co2 and electron rearrangement m z 118 fig s28 thus tp341 was still identified to be a tyrosine conjugated metabolite 6 2 amino 1 hydroxy 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propoxy naphthalene 2 3 diol the metabolite tp 353 was proposed to be a tyrosine conjugated metabolite 7 hydroxy 6 methoxynaphthalen 2 yl tyrosinate and its fragment ions m z 180 and 159 corresponded to the cleavage of the ester group fig s29 tp216 can be explained by conjugation with amino acid deriving a series of tyrosine conjugated metabolites e g tp339 tp341 and tp353 these metabolites were previously reported as a product of nap microbial transformation ding et al 2017 considering the mass increase of 32 between tp262 and parent compound nap tp262 corresponds to the introduction hydroxyl groups and was identified as 2 7 8 dihydroxy 6 methoxynaphthalen 2 yl propanoic acid fragment ions m z 217 and 97 of tp 262 in the spectrum showed the loss of a carboxyl group and a subsequent ring fracture fig s30 tp312 was tentatively identified as a product of hydroxylation and ring opening of naphthalene fig s31 and the proposed structure was e 6 2 carboxy 1 hydroxy 2 methoxyethylidene 4 1 carboxyethyl cyclohexa 2 4 diene 1 carboxylic acid subsequent hydroxylation resulted in the formation of tp332 1 hydroxy 7 hydroxynaphthalen 2 yl methyl naphthalene 2 6 diol and the observed fragment ions m z 268 185 170 and 127 can be attributed to the consecutive losses of hydroxyl groups and a subsequent fracture of naphthalene ring fig s32 3 6 nsaid degrading genes in strain din 3 in this study the isolated strain pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 could not only tolerate dcf ibu and nap at a certain concentration range but also degrade these nsaids however there are few studies regarding their biodegradation pathways the prediction of dcf ibu and nap biodegradation pathways in this study is mainly based on the identification of their degradation products and likewise there is a lack of in depth research on relevant catalytic enzymes and genes that regulate the whole degradation pathway with the breakthrough of sequencing technology the advantages of applying genomics to identify gene function have been gradually highlighted therefore based on the current experiments of dcf ibu and nap degradation by din 3 genomic analysis of their degradation was performed kegg pathway analysis is used to understand the high level functions and utilities of a biological system such as a cell organism and ecosystem using molecular data especially large scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high throughput experimental technologies ogata et al 1999 kegg pathway annotations or metabolic pathway annotations reveal which genes in the whole genome sequence play a common role in the production of target metabolites in this study the whole genome sequencing data of pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 predicted 3929 genes with a total length of 3 7 mb comparing the predictive genes of pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 with the kegg database 1865 genes were annotated in kegg pathways accounting for 47 5 of the total genes in the kegg pathway analysis cell processes accounted for 8 79 environmental information processing for 11 05 genetic information processing for 9 49 human diseases for 6 17 metabolism for 62 25 and organismal systems for 2 25 fig s33 in this study the biodegradation of nsaids by pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 was studied and therefore the genes related to the biodegradation of dcf ibu and nap by din 3 may participate in xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism as shown in figs s33 and 49 of the genes annotated in pseudoxanthomonas sp were related to xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism and mapped to 16 kegg pathways indicating that these genes might play a role in degrading dcf ibu and nap table s4 for example the poba gene in the benzoate degradation pathway ko00362 was detected in the biodegradation of dcf ibu and nap table s4 previous studies suggested that the enzyme catalyzing the first step in 4 hydroxybenzoate degradation by c pinatubonensis was encoded by poba gene donoso et al 2011 in the present study the monooxygenase encoded by poba was involved in the dcf biotransformation from tp309 to tp341 fig 8 the cog database determines the function of a gene by annotating classifying and analyzing the evolution of the predicted proteins by comparing the genes of pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 with the cog database a total of 337 enzymes were found that are possibly involved in dcf ibu and nap degradation some are listed in table 1 among them dehydrogenase and hydrolase accounted for 28 78 and 34 42 respectively followed by oxidoreductase oxidase and dioxygenase accounting for 11 87 11 28 and 8 61 respectively decarboxylase hydroxylase monooxygenase and dehalogenase were also possibly involved monooxygenase which is involved in hydroxylation along with dioxygenase accounted for 1 78 while decarboxylase involved in decarboxylation accounted for 1 5 these results were in agreement with previous studies that revealed that dioxygenase parales et al 2000 and monooxygenase yoshida et al 2007 played a crucial role in nap degradation in addition these results coincided with our pathway analysis based on chemical evaluation and some previous studies which noted that hydroxylation and decarboxylation were the two main biodegradation mechanisms for aromatic rings harayama and rekik 1989 kamada et al 2002 chakraborty and coates 2005 this study attempts to provide a better understanding of the nsaids biodegradation process by pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 with the combination of genome sequencing and uplc qqq ms analyses the fragment m z 209 of the ibu the biodegradation product tp265 was attributed to successive decarboxylation fig s20 the well known primary transformation products tp311 a and tp311 b were obtained by the hydroxylation process of dcf fig 8 almeida et al 2013b found that four orthologous genes ipfabde known to be involved in aromatic acid degradation were also involved in the degradation of ibuprofen in patulibacter sp i11 the other orthologous gene ipff was found to be involved in an acyl coa synthetase amp forming which is well known for the aerobic catabolism of aromatic hydrocarbons by catalyzing the hydroxylation of double bonds after the opening of the aromatic ring martinez blanco et al 1990 although five orthologous genes were not detected in din 3 other annotated genes involved in similar function amp forming were found i e gene2082 gene1243 gene1746 and gene2492 table 1 the nap biodegradation product tp312 fig s31 based on uplc qqq ms analysis was identified as a product of hydroxylation and ring opening of naphthalene by acyl coa synthetase 4 conclusions this study revealed that the bac process is an effective technology for the removal of nsaids in addition the use of pseudoxanthomonas sp for the elimination of nsaids dcf ibu and nap was demonstrated for the first time the bacterial strain pseudoxanthomonas sp din 3 isolated from bac columns was able to degrade 23 48 of dcf ibu and nap simultaneously at lower concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 μg l 1 and the strain more effectively degraded ibu than the other two nsaids exogenous carbon effectively boosted the elimination of dcf ibu and nap with a simultaneous increase in bacterial growth the main degradation pathways of dcf ibu and nap appeared to involve hydroxylation decarboxylation and partial dechlorination of the compounds and some enzymes dehydrogenase hydrolase dioxygenase decarboxylase etc played a role in their degradation based on degradation experiments and the newly sequenced genome of strain din 3 if the presence of a single drug ibu dcf or nap was assumed ignoring the other drugs the degradation by strain din 3 was overestimated by 5 0 27 0 nonetheless this research shows the potential of the use of such strain for bioaugmentation of contaminated sites or bioreactors however a reasonable assessment of bioremoval in the environment should be performed considering the combined effects of various contaminants importantly these results may provide a theoretical basis for the development of microbial agents with high removal of dcf ibu and nap as well as the control of environmental pollution with nsaids declaration of interests the authors

18708,the elimination of cyanobacteria is frequently required for treating and controlling the waters with harmful algal blooms in this study an improved flotation technology was developed using colloidal gas aphrons cgas surface modified with the inorganic coagulant of polyaluminum chloride pacl the microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa cells were efficiently removed and their re growth was effectively inhibited the so created coagulative cgas ccgas exhibited the attractive characteristics of both cgas and pacl for the cell removal the experimental results clearly showed that 94 2 99 2 of cells were removed within 3 min at the optimum dosage of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide ctab and pacl at three different initial cell densities od680 0 05 0 26 and 0 76 and the re growth of m aeruginosa did not occur in 10 days the flocs derived from the ccga flotation were of smaller size and looser configuration in contrast with those obtained from coagulation flotation the ccgas were robust in charge neutralization cell capture cell attack and destruction even at low ctab dosages those bubbles could provide large surface area for capturing the m aeruginosa cells in both unicellular and colonial form compared with the unmodified ctab cgas the ccgas reduced 59 5 87 9 of ctab dosage with the assistance of pacl and the required flotation retention time was largely shortened in comparison with the sedimentation and flotation based treatment options this would lead to low treatment cost and sludge production the present work provides a novel insight into the development of flotation technologies for treating and controlling dense harmful algal blooms graphical abstract image 1 keywords microcystis aeruginosa re growth inhibition coagulative colloidal gas aphrons bubble surface modification harmful algal blooms 1 introduction cyanobacteria are closely related to the serious environmental issues of harmful algal blooms cyanohabs and microcystin pollution it has been reported that large freshwater lakes are plagued by cyanohabs annually the blooms can last for half a year or even longer in china s important lakes like tai lake krausfeldt et al 2017 qin et al 2010 and dianchi lake zhao et al 2018 in utah lake of u s a cyanohabs started from early july to late august with the peak cell concentration of 105 cells ml page et al 2018 the consequences of cyanohabs have raised increasingly global concerns including ecological risks to aquatic environment health threat to human beings as well as impairment of water quality davis et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 for the treatment of waters with cyanohabs the coagulation flotation separation has been long accepted as an efficient and effective method laamanen et al 2016 since i the negatively surface charged cells are apt to destabilize and agglomerate in the presence of coagulants flocculants during the coagulation flocculation process edzwald 1993 yap et al 2014 ii the cyanobacteria especially with low cell density may float upward easily with their gas vesicles which provide buoyancy to the cells edzwald 1993 huisman et al 2018 and iii the collection and removal of cell sludge from water surface is preferable for the treatment of real water bodies and thus flotation is a practical separation method a feasible direction of improving the coagulation flotation technology is to adopt the surface functionalized microbubbles to reinforce the capture efficiency of cyanobacteria cells most of the research dedicating to this theme has been conducted using dissolved air flotation henderson et al 2010 rao et al 2018 yap et al 2014 in their work surfactants and modifiers including metal coagulants polymers and structure modified cationic polymers were dosed in the saturator for the generation of microbubbles through which the cell removal was achieved to be in excess of 90 the surface functionalized bubbles combine the attributes of both surfactants and coagulants flocculants and thus result in robust bubble adherence and algal cell removal yap et al 2014 apart from creating the microbubbles by pressurizing air into water the colloidal gas aphrons cgas technology also takes advantages in surface functionalizing microbubbles zhang and guiraud 2017 zhang et al 2019b the cgas are surrounded by a multiple layered thin surfactant film and featured as large interfacial area controllable surface properties high stability and air holdup molaei and waters 2015 the cga involved processes have been used in water wastewater treatment and water pollution remediation hashim et al 2012 on using the mixed solution of surfactants and coagulants the so created coagulative colloidal gas aphrons ccgas exhibit typical characteristics of cgas such as mean diameter in micron scale long half life time and more than 50 of air holdup ccgas were found to be capable of fast capturing and removing 90 nanoparticulate pollutants from water and the ccga flotation largely reduced the coagulant dose compared with the coagulation flotation in the latter process the coagulant was directly added into the target water in the coagulation step lu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a the ccga involved flotation may be adapted to the commonly used flotation facilities it should be highlighted that the coagulant has been coated on bubbles during bubble generation and the coagulation occurs when bubbles and target particulate pollutants i e cyanobacteria cells collide and attach zhang et al 2018a b c hence the upstream coagulation unit can be omitted and the facilities are then simplified the typical cationic surfactant of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide ctab c19h42brn has always been used to generate the positively surface charged cgas briefly named ctab cgas dermiki et al 2009 mukherjee et al 2015 santos ebinuma et al 2016 zhang and guiraud 2017 this surfactant is able to interact with the negatively surface charged cells by charge neutralization and acts as a strong and stable flocculant taghavijeloudar et al 2019 it has been adopted alone or combined with coagulants in flotation for efficiently capturing cells 90 coward et al 2013 phoochinda et al 2004 xia et al 2017 however to the authors knowledge no specific research or application has been dedicated to the modification of ctab cgas with coagulants for the separation of cyanobacteria cells noting that ctab is suitable not only for its capacity of effectively separating the algal biomass from water alkarawi et al 2018 but also for its potential of inhibiting the growth of harmful algae this quaternary ammonium compound damages the cell membrane of algae solubilizes the phospholipid bilayer and inhibits the nutrient uptake through declining the algal cell activities coward et al 2014 golubev et al 2016 liang et al 2013 given that the algal growth is quite sensitive to the presence of ctab the ctab involved cgas are proposed to control the re growth of cells in the treatment of cyanohabs though relative study has not been reported it is also noted that the cyanotoxins may be released into water if the cells lyse the cyanotoxins may be intracellular particle bound or dissolved depending on the bloom age and mechanical and chemical stresses ribau teixeira 2005 ribau teixeira and rosa 2006 decreasing the dosage of chemical reagents and shortening the contact time of treatment processes help to alleviate this problem han et al 2013 and they happen to be the typically technical features of ccga flotation besides the prevention of cell growth by surface functionalized ctab cgas is expected to offset the release of caynotoxins in the present work one of the most common cyanobacteria in freshwater microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa was used as treating target this representative cyanobacterial species is notorious for forming dense cyanohabs huisman et al 2018 the objective was to fast remove m aeruginosa and inhibit the re growth thus the cyanohab problem could be effectively solved a highly efficient inorganic polymeric coagulant polyaluminum chloride pacl was used to improve the performance of ctab cgas characteristics and advantages of the flotation with surface functionalized microbubbles ccgas were investigated in terms of the removal efficiency and the re growth inhibition effect moreover the ccga flotation was particularly compared with the coagulation flotation process 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultivation of cyanobacteria in this work m aeruginosa fachb 905 was isolated from dian lake in yunnan province china and was provided by institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences the bg 11 medium being used for the algae cultivation was put into the erlynmer flasks at 120 125 c for 30 min xia et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a b c after being cooled down to the room temperature the medium was inoculated with m aeruginosa and then subjected to a 14 10 h light dark cycle at 25 c the lighting was supplied by a combination of warm and cold fluorescent tubes giving the luminance range of approximately 2200 lux 2 2 basic properties of m aeruginosa suspensions synthetic waters the suspensions of m aeruginosa at three levels of initial cell density were prepared as target cyanohab water for experiments table 1 the cell density od680 of m aeruginosa was determined by measuring the optical density at 680 nm using a uv vis spectrometer uv 1800 shimadzu japan meanwhile the cells were counted in a hemacytometer on an optical microscope ix71 olympus japan for the cell concentration od680 is positively correlated to the cell concentration 106 cells ml with the linear regression equation being established as od680 0 07 cell concentration 0 005 r2 0 99 lv et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a b c according to the world health organization the rapid scum formation can occur at the cyanobacterial density of 105 cells ml giving rise to an increasing risk of public health bartram et al 1999 the effective water treatment is then needed in this study the cell density was 6 7 98 8 times greater than the alert level in natural waters indicating the dense and severe cyanohabs the m aeruginosa cells were analyzed by laser light scattering mastersizer 3000 malvern instruments ltd u k for the mean diameter d 50 and size distribution the morphology of cells was observed by an optical microscope ix71 olympus japan besides the inorganic and organic matrices were also characterized and listed in table 1 the turbidity increased with the increase of cell density the hardness of the waters 66 74 mg l caco3 over the investigated cell densities corresponded to the soft water according to american water works association 2011 the high dissolved organic carbon doc values in waters should be mainly attributed to the presence of algal matter which was derived from the added m aeruginosa cells according to the suva results the dissolved organic matter dom were hydrophilic edzwald and van benschoten 1990 zeta potential ph conductivity turbidity and hardness were measured using zetasizer nanozs 90 malvern instruments co ltd u k ph meter innolab 20p prima china conductivity meter dds 307 inesa scientific instruments co ltd china turbidimeter wgz 20 xinrui instruments co ltd china and water hardness tester markawin biotechnologies inc china respectively after being filtrated through the 0 45 μm membrane the synthetic water was analyzed by a total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu japan and a uv vis spectrometer uv 1800 shimadzu japan for doc and absorbance at 254 nm uv254 individually 2 3 chemicals ctab aluminum chloride alcl3 and sodium hydrogen carbonate nahco3 were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd the reagents were of analytical grade and used as obtained without further purification all the solutions were prepared with deionized water except the pacl solution which was prepared using ultrapure water from a ultrapure water system smart n15vf healforce china with resistivity of 18 2 mω cm 2 4 flotation treatment with surface functionalized microbubbles the surface modifier of bubbles pacl was prepared by slowing titrating nahco3 solution into the fiercely agitated alcl3 solution and then aging for 24 h tang 2006 the basicity hydroxide to aluminum molar ratio and the total al concentration of this inorganic polymer coagulant were determined to be 2 0 and 0 1 mol l respectively the cationic surfactant of ctab was used in this study as basic frother for the generation of cgas the generation solutions of ccgas that is to say the mixed solution of ctab and pacl were prepared by mildly adding the predetermined amount of pacl into the ctab solution carefully shaking for 1 min and aging for 30 min prior to use ccgas or cgas were produced in an improved cga generator fabricated according to the apparatus proposed by sebba 1985 the design and size of the generator have been elaborated previously lu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a b c as presented in fig 1 a high speed agitator tfs 400 tyee industry china was fitted on the top of the cylindrical cga generator in which the bubble generation solution was stirred for 2 min at the speed of 6000 rpm immediately after being generated the suspension of ccgas or cgas 200 ml was pumped out from the ccga outlet at the flow rate of 320 ml min into the flotation tank for the treatment of m aeruginosa suspension 400 ml after the batch mode flotation separation the effluent was collected from the outlet and the floats were obtained from the surface of the flotation suspension as comparison the coagulation flotation trials were carried out under the same conditions as the ccga flotation tests including the stirring speed for bubble generation the flow rate of bubble suspension the dosage of pacl and ctab the volumes of bubble suspension and m aeruginosa suspension and the retention time for flotation separation the experimental procedure is presented in section 1 of supplementary information si being different from ccga flotation pacl was first added in coagulation and the resulting flocs were then separated and removed in the following flotation step to be precise the ccga or cga involved flotation in this study should be classified into dispersed air flotation 2 5 evaluation of process performance the flotation treated water 30 ml was collected from the bottom of the flotation tank effluent outlet in fig 1 for the evaluation of flotation efficiency the flocs were pumped out with supernatant 50 ml at 30 ml min from the scum outlet fig 1 for the characterization of flotation floats the low flow rates were also adopted elsewhere to avoid disturbing the flocs wang et al 2009 zhao et al 2014 the removal efficiency of m aeruginosa cells was calculated and the dilution effect caused by the bubble suspension was considered 1 removal efficiency o d 680 0 v m a e r u g i n o s a v m a e r u g i n

where od 680 0 and od 680 t reflect the optical density of the m aeruginosa cells in the flotation tank before and after the flotation treatment respectively v m aeruginosa ml and v bubbles ml refer to the volumes of m aeruginosa suspension and cga or ccga suspension before flotation which were set to be 400 ml and 200 ml individually hence eq 1 can be expressed as follows 2 removal efficiency 1 3 o d 680 t 2 o d 680 0 100 the zeta potential and ph of the clarified water were analyzed by a zetasizer nanozs 90 malvern instruments ltd u k and a ph meter innolab 20p prima china respectively residual ctab and pacl concentrations were measured under the optimum conditions of ccga flotation the former was determined by spectrophotometry uv 1800 shimadzu japan given that the color retardation of methyl orange with ctab in water results in the yellow associated ion pairs with a maximum absorption at 470 nm guo et al 2012 hu and yang 2010 the concentration of residual al was attained by analyzing the hno3 digested effluent with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry nexion 300x perkinelmer icp ms u s a and the corresponding concentration of residual pacl could then be calculated the size and fractal dimension of floats were analyzed by a laser light scattering instrument mastersizer 3000 malvern instruments ltd u k being carefully collected after flotation the wet flocs were dispersed in the deionized water and then drawn through the optical unit of mastersizer at the flow rate of 25 ml min to avoid damaging the fragile samples the mean diameter d 50 was used as the representative size the principles for the measurement of mean diameter size distribution and fractal dimension are given in the previous study zhang et al 2017 the floats were also freeze dried and observed by scanning electron microscope sem s 4700 ii hitachi japan for morphology observation meanwhile the dried samples were analyzed by atr ftir irtracer 100 shimadzu japan for the identification of binding characteristics in the flotation flocs 2 6 monitoring m aeruginosa re growth after flotation treatment the clarified m aeruginosa suspensions after flotation were transferred to the aerated erlynmer flasks and maintained under the conditions described in section 2 1 which were ideal for the growth of the m aeruginosa cells the suspensions were monitored for up to 240 h for the re growth of algal cells od680 was measured every 24 h since the initial moment and the re growth curves of the treated effluent could then be attained 3 results and discussion 3 1 process performance of pacl modified cgas in m aeruginosa removal and re growth inhibition 3 1 1 removal of m aeruginosa with ctab cgas in the absence and presence of pacl the ctab cgas were first used to remove m aeruginosa in the simulated water at three different levels of cell density in the absence of the pacl coagulant the retention time for flotation separation was controlled to be 180 s as shown in fig 2 a the separation efficiency reached above 95 at the ctab concentration in the flotation suspension 36 4 mg l or even 60 7 mg l for od680 0 0 76 over the investigated ctab concentrations the resulting ph in effluent slightly decreased by 0 5 or even less compared with the initial ph of m aeruginosa suspensions fig s1 a in order to reduce the dosage of ctab without lowering the removal efficacy of m aeruginosa the ccgas modified with pacl were adopted in flotation the result in fig 2 b denotes that when the ctab concentration was fixed to 12 1 mg l for od680 0 0 05 and 0 26 and 24 3 mg l for od680 0 0 76 in the flotation suspension more than 95 of m aeruginosa cells were removed at the pacl dosage of 3 6 mg al l for od680 0 0 05 and 0 76 or 4 5 mg al l od680 0 0 26 the ph of effluent was 6 8 7 4 at the optimum pacl dosages fig s1 b falling in the normal ph range of surface water 6 9 in spite of adding the pacl modified bubbles in the absence of pacl the efficiency was only 0 22 4 and 73 8 at the ctab dosage of 12 1 mg l od680 0 0 05 12 1 mg l od680 0 0 26 and 24 3 od680 0 0 76 respectively highlighted in grey in fig 2 a accordingly the zeta potential of flocs was below 25 0 mv highlighted in grey in fig 2 c for the flotation with ctab cgas the charge neutralization could only be achieved by increasing the addition of the cationic surfactant of ctab when the ctab cgas were surface modified with pacl zeta potential increased to 16 0 to 5 mv at the optimum pacl dosages fig 2 d in contrast with the scenario without pacl the efficient coagulant species in pacl such as al13 and al30 lin et al 2009 shirasaki et al 2016 enhanced the capacity of the microbubbles in capturing the negatively charged cells the process performance of cgas modified with pacl confirmed that those surface functionalized microbubbles facilitated the removal of m aeruginosa during flotation at decreased dosage of surfactant 3 1 2 re growth inhibition by pacl modified cgas after being eliminated by ccga flotation the m aeruginosa in the effluent should be closely monitored for re growth since the objective of the treatment included preventing cyanohabs from re occurring without any treatment od680 increased from 0 05 to 0 58 from 0 26 to 1 15 and from 0 76 to 1 79 individually fig s2 as presented in fig 3 a for the suspension with initial od680 of 0 05 the growth of m aeruginosa was inhibited in 240 h after the flotation treatment with ctab cgas at the ctab dosage of 12 1 mg l though the cells were poorly removed when using the pacl modified cgas the removal efficiency obviously increased but the re growth of m aeruginosa was prevented only at the high pacl dosage i e 6 3 mg al l similar experimental observation was found at higher initial cell densities but the pacl concentration for the effective inhibition of re growth in the investigated 240 h was lower i e 3 6 mg al l fig 3 b and c it could be inferred that when the ctab concentration was low i e 12 1 mg l and the coagulant of pacl was not adopted the cgas were unstable and drained rapidly after being injected into the flotation tank hence the dissolved ctab molecules kept the residual m aeruginosa cells from growing in contrast for the scenario with pacl modified cgas the ctab composited with pacl and the so created ccgas reinforced the elimination of m aeruginosa both of the adopted ctab molecules and dissolved al iii species should be the contributors to the re growth inhibition of m aeruginosa in addition to ctab the dissolved al iii was also related to the toxication of cyanobacteria cells gillmore et al 2016 3 1 3 m aeruginosa removal efficiency with flotation retention time the variation of m aeroginosa removal efficiency with time was investigated at the initial od680 of 0 26 and the results are presented in fig 4 in the cga flotation process without pacl the performance was not stable at the ctab concentration of 12 1 mg l within the initial 180 s in terms of the residual od680 value when the ctab concentration rose to 60 7 mg l approximately 5 times higher the steady and high removal efficiency of m aeruginosa could be achieved after 60 s as for the cgas modified with pacl they reached their highest removal efficiency within 60 s at the low ctab concentration of 12 1 mg l and further increasing the pacl loading concentration on cgas that is to say increasing the pacl dosage in the flotation suspension from 2 7 mg al l to 4 5 mg al l the residual cell density reduced sharply at 30 s 0 013 as od680 apparently the surface modification of pacl on the microbubbles led to a more rapid and robust flotation process in separating and removing m aeruginosa this can be ascribed to the enhanced attachment between bubbles and cells through strengthening the electrostatic attraction sweeping and adsorption based on the results in this subsection the retention time for flotation separation in all the following experiments was then determined to be 180 s 3 2 advantages of flotation with pacl modified cgas compared to coagulation flotation the process performance and characteristics of pacl modified cgas in the removal and re growth inhibition of m aeruginosa were compared with those of the pacl involved coagulation and flotation in the latter process pacl was adopted in the coagulation step and the formed flocs were then removed by ctab cgas without any other modification the ctab dosage in coagulation flotation was 12 1 mg l being consistent with that in ccga flotation and the adopted pacl concentration was below equal to and above the optimum pacl concentration in ccga flotation the treatment duration of ccga flotation and coagulation flotation was 3 min and 14 5 min respectively excluding the time for bubble generation 2 min 3 2 1 comparison of m aeruginosa removal efficacy the difference in the removal efficiency of m aeruginosa between the two flotation processes was more obvious at the low initial cell density as indicated in fig 5 at the initial od680 of 0 05 the removal of the m aeruginosa cells by ccgas was 2 3 3 3 times higher than that induced by coagulation flotation at the same concentrations of chemicals pacl and ctab the difference in treating efficacy between the two ways of coagulant adoption diminished with the increase of initial od680 especially at the initial od680 of 0 76 both processes performed well the experimental phenomena photographed at 1 min of flotation fig s3 revealed that ccga flotation was capable of fast clarifying the suspension of m aeruginosa compared with coagulation flotation accordingly the advantage of the former process in highly efficient separation of m aeruginosa was confirmed the zeta potential of m aeruginosa cells was below 30 0 mv at the investigated initial od680 table 1 indicating the stable dispersion of the cyanobacteria after the flotation treatment the zeta potential of aggregates derived from the ccga involved process was higher than that obtained from the pacl involved coagulation flotation particularly when the pacl dosage was equal and above the optimum pacl concentration of ccga flotation apparently the pacl modified cgas exhibited robust ability of electrostatic attraction which facilitated the capture of negatively surface charged cells in excess of 95 0 of cells were removed by ccgas even though the flotation aggregates remained negatively surface charged and were incipiently unstable it is inferred that the pacl on the bubble surface attached with and remove the m aeruginosa cells via the mechanisms of adsorption sweeping and bridging in addition to charge neutralization on the other hand under the investigated bubble generation conditions the average diameter of pacl modified cgas was measured to be 92 168 μm while the cgas without any functionalization were of 149 307 μm in diameter the bubble size analysis was conducted with an optical microscope combined with imagej software zhang et al 2018a b c the low ctab concentration adopted herein negatively impacted the foamability of the bubble generation solution resulting in large bubbles but the problem was alleviated by ccgas which provided larger surface area for capturing m aeruginosa particularly those single cells this helps to interpret the better process performance of ccga flotation in contrast with that of coagulation flotation at the initial od680 of 0 05 and 0 26 but for the water with very high cell density i e od680 0 0 76 the cells could aggregate themselves and form colonies which were easy to be removed by common bubbles therefore the difference in process performance between the two flotation technologies was not significant in addition at the pacl concentration of 4 5 mg al l ccgas resulted in lower ph in effluent 6 8 7 8 than the pacl coagulation combined with flotation separation 7 6 9 3 but no significant difference was found in the ph of effluent at lower pacl dosage 3 6 mg al l fig s4 3 2 2 comparison of re growth inhibition the inhibition of m aeruginosa re growth by ccga flotation and coagulation flotation is shown in fig 6 at the equivalent pacl dosage the ccga treated suspensions of m aeruginosa cells exhibited lower cell density od680 during the 240 h observation in contrast with those treated by pacl and ctab cgas successively the advantage of ccgas in the inhibition of re growth was particularly apparent at the low initial od680 of 0 05 and 0 26 this could be interpreted by the good attachment between the m aeruginosa cells and the coagulant species loaded on the bubble surface during ccga flotation zhang and guiraud 2017 which resulted in sufficient attack and complete destruction of the m aeruginosa cells the residual cells then lost the ability of growth after treatment comparatively when the pacl was dosed at the beginning of coagulation part of the coagulant might not participate in the capture of m aeruginosa because of the insufficient dispersion of the coagulant and on the other hand the m aeruginosa cells trapped in the flocs might not interact with the ctab molecules on the surface of cgas thus the residual cells could grow in the cultivation medium as for the initial od680 of 0 76 m aeruginosa no more grew during 240 h at the pacl dosage equal to and above the optimum value and the inhibition effect induced by the two flotation processes was quite close in sum over the investigated cell densities in this study the flotation using the cgas modified by pacl presented outstanding performance with respect to both of the removal and the re growth inhibition of cells compared with using ctab cgas alone or adopting pacl and ctab cgas successively in coagulation flotation 3 3 comparison of residual chemicals in effluent as physiochemical treatment technologies the flotation processes in this study inevitably introduced ctab and pacl into water the residual concentrations of chemicals are shown in table 2 over the investigated three initial od680 values the residual ctab concentration was found to be 3 9 6 4 mg l and 2 9 12 3 mg l for ccga flotation and coagulation flotation respectively at the optimum coagulant concentration ctab was reported to inhibit methanogenesis tezel et al 2006 and impair reproductive health melin et al 2014 at the concentration of around 25 mg l the residual ctab concentration in the effluent of ccga flotation was controlled below that alert concentration especially at the initial od680 of 0 26 and 0 76 compared with adopting ctab cgas directly in the flotation separation process the residual ctab concentrations apparently dropped via coating the ctab cgas with pacl as for the residual coagulant concentration in effluent it ranged from 0 6 mg al l to 2 4 mg al l and from 0 7 mg al l to 2 5 mg al l for ccga flotation and coagulation flotation respectively at the highest cell density of 0 76 the former process led to higher residual pacl concentration than the latter it was reported that the cell viability and growth rate of cyanobacteria could be inhibited at the al concentration of 0 5 16 2 mg l gensemer and playle 1999 hence in addition to the effect of ctab the toxicity of residual pacl coagulant to those cells might also contribute to the re growth inhibition nevertheless it has been pointed out that the exposure of al in water treatment can be associated with the development of brain lesions in humans and the al concentration in drinking water and fresh waters is recommended to be no higher than 0 2 mg l edmilson souza freitas et al 2016 given to the consideration mentioned above the ccga flotation technology proposed in this study should be adopted as emergency treatment of the waters with particularly heavy m aeruginosa cell densities 3 2 4 evaluation of different technologies using ctab and or pacl for cell removal furthermore the performance and advantages of flotation with pacl modified cgas were analyzed by comparing this work with other coagulation flotation sedimentation based studies table 3 first more than 94 0 even 99 2 of m aeruginosa elimination efficiency was achieved by the surface modified microbubble system in this study the effectiveness and efficiency of m aeruginosa removal could also be ensured by the classical coagulation flocculation dissolved air flotation for instance as high as 93 0 99 0 of intact cells were removed with low coagulant i e alum and pacl doses ribau teixeira and rosa 2006 2007 ribau teixeira et al 2010 it should be highlighted that the prevention of cell re growth was confirmed by ccga flotation herein which has not been explored or reported by other ctab involved technologies listed in table 3 the sound performance ensured the feasibility of this novel flotation technology in treating the waters with cyanohab problems second in terms of reagent consumption the ccga flotation reduced approximately 59 5 87 9 of ctab dosage with the assistance of pacl compared with froth flotation phoochinda et al 2004 and dispersed air flotation zhang et al 2018a b c meanwhile it is worth noting that the dosage of pacl in ccga flotation was less than that in coagulation flotation and for instance for the initial od680 of 0 26 4 5 mg al l and 7 2 mg al l of pacl was demanded in the former and latter processes respectively to reach their optimum flotation efficiency yet the residual concentrations of ctab and pacl represented as al in the effluent of ccga flotation process could be 3 9 6 4 mg l and 0 6 2 4 mg al l individually see in table 2 given to the possible negative impact of those two chemicals to water treatment and human health as discussed in section 3 2 3 this novel technology is especially recommended as the emergency treatment of dense cyanohabs third the retention time for reaching the complete separation effect was largely shortened to 3 min by ccga flotation which was however apparently longer in other processes liu et al 2010 nguyen et al 2013 phoochinda et al 2004 ribau teixeira and rosa 2006 2007 ribau teixeira et al 2010 zhang et al 2018a b c hence featured as high removal efficiency effective re growth inhibition low reagent demand rapid separation and simplified construction no coagulation unit the flotation with pacl modified ctab cgas greatly improved the coagulation flotation technologies for treating and controlling cyanohabs the treatment cost and sludge production could be obviously reduced this study for the first time used the pacl functionalized ctab cgas to treat the dense cyanohabs the feasibility and efficacy of this novel flotation technology were focused on with respect to eliminating m aeruginosa cells and inhibiting their re growth in the current work besides it should also be noted that the morphology and size of cyanobacterial species the extractable algal matter the microtoxins as well as other natural organic matter can result in significantly different process performance and mechanisms of ccga flotation this needs to be systematically explored in our future studies which are based on both synthetic and natural water the real environment should be particularly considered 3 3 flotation characteristics of ccga flotation in terms of floc properties the flocs of ccga flotation were characterized and compared with those of coagulation flotation at the individual optimum pacl dosage of three initial od680 values the features of the cell aggregates derived from the surface modified microbubbles were closely related to the understanding of their flotation behaviors the cultivated m aeruginosa cells in this study were 4 2 5 1 μm in average diameter according to table 1 the cells are almost spherical and ovoid fig s5 however they are multidisperse with two or three populations see in fig 7 a the cell population with the smallest size 3 6 μm took the largest proportion at the high cell densities investigated herein the aggregation of cells happened forming the colonies which were held together by the slimy matrix secreted during the growth of the colony ribau teixeira 2005 the colonies of algae cells can be extensively found in nature after the flotation treatment the size distribution of flocs in both processes was mutimodal for the m aeruginosa suspensions with the initial od680 of 0 05 and 0 26 the flocs of ccga flotation were smaller 35 0 μm and 10 4 μm respectively than those of the coagulation flotation process 55 4 μm and 46 8 μm respectively fig 7 b much larger flocs around 136 3 μm in diameter were observed for the initial od680 of 0 76 while those in coagulation flotation were 59 3 μm it can be found in fig 7 c that the flocs attained from the ccga flotation were of lower fractal dimension 2 42 for od680 0 0 05 2 43 for od680 0 2 43 and 2 17 for od680 0 0 76 in contrast with those derived from the coagulation flotation 2 57 for od680 0 0 05 2 44 for od680 0 0 26 and 2 30 for od680 0 0 76 obviously the former process led to the flocs with open structure while the latter resulted in compact aggregates lopez exposito et al 2019 according to the sem images at the magnification of 50000 the flocs presented porous morphology in ccga flotation while in turn showed smooth surface in coagulation flotation particularly for the suspension with low cell densities od680 0 0 05 and 0 26 from the water treatment practice point of view the single cells regularly penetrate treatment processes ribau teixeira and rosa 2006 2007 and thus may be more difficult to be removed than the colonies of cells by the conventional water treatment methods for the novel flotation process proposed in this study the effective attachment between bubbles and cells was facilitated when they collided owing to the presence of pacl on the bubble surface the mechanism should work on both unicellular and aggregated cells found in the pristine suspensions of m aeruginosa the so generated flocs were featured as small size and loose morphology after the bubbles drained in the coagulation flotation process m aeruginosa coagulated with pacl in the absence of bubbles which gave rise to the dense and large flocs those flocs would not deform even after the cgas drained after flotation the interaction among m aeruginosa pacl and ctab was explored via analyzing their atr spectra before and after flotation treatment as shown in fig 8 a the characteristic bands at 2914 cm 1 and 2847 cm 1 were assigned to the aliphatic c h stretch in the ctab molecules gonzalez torres et al 2017 sari and chellam 2017 the two peaks went through blue shift to 2916 2922 cm 1 with the increase of initial od680 from 0 05 to 0 76 particularly in coagulation flotation fig 8 b the ctab molecules interacted directly with the m aeruginosa cells in the coagulation flotation process whereas they attached the cells through the coating layer of pacl hence it could be interpeted that the characteristic peaks of ctab were more greatly impacted in the former process the peaks of m aeruginosa at 1649 cm 1 c o stretching and 1348 cm 1 coo stretching or amide c n and nh vibration were related to amide ii and polysaccharides protein amide iii individually gonzalez torres et al 2017 hadjoudja et al 2010 the former band shifted to lower wavenumbers in the spectra of the flocs derived from ccga flotation 1639 cm 1 1636 cm 1 and 1628 cm 1 for od680 0 0 05 0 26 and 0 76 while blue shift of this band occurred in the scenario of coagulation flotation od680 0 0 05 and 0 26 it could be inferred that the c o stretching of m aeruginosa was less influenced by the interaction of cells and pacl in ccga flotation than in coagulation flotation this could be explained by the different mechanisms of capturing the m aeruginosa cells in the two flotation methods during ccga flotation the negatively surface charged cells interacted with the polycationic al iii species of pacl whilst the latter also combined with the ctab molecules for the formation of ccgas as for the coagulation flotation process the cells directly coagulated with pacl during coagulation and then were separated by ctab cgas within 3 min in flotation 4 conclusions in the current study the flotation technology using pacl functionalized ctab cgas was developed and demonstrated as a highly effective method for the treatment of waters with severe cyanohab problems this novel type of ccgas removed more than 94 2 99 2 of m aeruginosa within 3 min at low ctab and pacl dosage of 12 1 24 3 mg l and 3 6 4 5 mg al l over the investigated range of initial cell density od680 0 from 0 05 to 0 76 after the flotation treatment under the optimum conditions the re growth of m aeruginosa did not happen within 10 days at the low ctab dosage the ccgas could provide larger surface area for capturing the m aeruginosa cells in both unicellular and colonial form in contrast with the unmodified ctab cgas the good attachment between the coagulant species coated on the bubble surface and the cells resulted in efficient collection sufficient attack and complete destruction of the m aeruginosa cells during ccga flotation the flocs derived from the ccga flotation were characterized as smaller size and looser configuration in contrast with those obtained from coagulation flotation compared with coagulation flotation as well as other coagulation sedimentation flotation technologies the ctab cgas modified with pacl took great advantages in terms of stronger charge neutralization capacity large reduction of reagent demand fast separation and simplified flotation construction in addition to sound process performance and re growth inhibition effect thus the ccga flotation was promising in treating and controlling cyanohabs with reduced cost and sludge production however given to the possibly negative environmental impact of residual chemicals in effluent at the present stage this technology is more recommended as the emergency treatment of dense cyanohabs as a novel flotation process further study needs to be carried out in terms of i the impact of algal matter natural organic matter as well as cyanobacterial species and morphology on the process performance and mechanisms in both synthetic and natural water the real environment should be particularly considered ii the released cyanotoxins due to the cell damage during ccga flotation and iii the further reduction of residual chemicals to achieve the latter two objectives the operation conditions should be optimized and meanwhile the downstream or simultaneous treatment method i e oxidation is demanded as well declaration of interest statement all of our authors declare no financial or personal relationships with other people or

18708,the elimination of cyanobacteria is frequently required for treating and controlling the waters with harmful algal blooms in this study an improved flotation technology was developed using colloidal gas aphrons cgas surface modified with the inorganic coagulant of polyaluminum chloride pacl the microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa cells were efficiently removed and their re growth was effectively inhibited the so created coagulative cgas ccgas exhibited the attractive characteristics of both cgas and pacl for the cell removal the experimental results clearly showed that 94 2 99 2 of cells were removed within 3 min at the optimum dosage of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide ctab and pacl at three different initial cell densities od680 0 05 0 26 and 0 76 and the re growth of m aeruginosa did not occur in 10 days the flocs derived from the ccga flotation were of smaller size and looser configuration in contrast with those obtained from coagulation flotation the ccgas were robust in charge neutralization cell capture cell attack and destruction even at low ctab dosages those bubbles could provide large surface area for capturing the m aeruginosa cells in both unicellular and colonial form compared with the unmodified ctab cgas the ccgas reduced 59 5 87 9 of ctab dosage with the assistance of pacl and the required flotation retention time was largely shortened in comparison with the sedimentation and flotation based treatment options this would lead to low treatment cost and sludge production the present work provides a novel insight into the development of flotation technologies for treating and controlling dense harmful algal blooms graphical abstract image 1 keywords microcystis aeruginosa re growth inhibition coagulative colloidal gas aphrons bubble surface modification harmful algal blooms 1 introduction cyanobacteria are closely related to the serious environmental issues of harmful algal blooms cyanohabs and microcystin pollution it has been reported that large freshwater lakes are plagued by cyanohabs annually the blooms can last for half a year or even longer in china s important lakes like tai lake krausfeldt et al 2017 qin et al 2010 and dianchi lake zhao et al 2018 in utah lake of u s a cyanohabs started from early july to late august with the peak cell concentration of 105 cells ml page et al 2018 the consequences of cyanohabs have raised increasingly global concerns including ecological risks to aquatic environment health threat to human beings as well as impairment of water quality davis et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 for the treatment of waters with cyanohabs the coagulation flotation separation has been long accepted as an efficient and effective method laamanen et al 2016 since i the negatively surface charged cells are apt to destabilize and agglomerate in the presence of coagulants flocculants during the coagulation flocculation process edzwald 1993 yap et al 2014 ii the cyanobacteria especially with low cell density may float upward easily with their gas vesicles which provide buoyancy to the cells edzwald 1993 huisman et al 2018 and iii the collection and removal of cell sludge from water surface is preferable for the treatment of real water bodies and thus flotation is a practical separation method a feasible direction of improving the coagulation flotation technology is to adopt the surface functionalized microbubbles to reinforce the capture efficiency of cyanobacteria cells most of the research dedicating to this theme has been conducted using dissolved air flotation henderson et al 2010 rao et al 2018 yap et al 2014 in their work surfactants and modifiers including metal coagulants polymers and structure modified cationic polymers were dosed in the saturator for the generation of microbubbles through which the cell removal was achieved to be in excess of 90 the surface functionalized bubbles combine the attributes of both surfactants and coagulants flocculants and thus result in robust bubble adherence and algal cell removal yap et al 2014 apart from creating the microbubbles by pressurizing air into water the colloidal gas aphrons cgas technology also takes advantages in surface functionalizing microbubbles zhang and guiraud 2017 zhang et al 2019b the cgas are surrounded by a multiple layered thin surfactant film and featured as large interfacial area controllable surface properties high stability and air holdup molaei and waters 2015 the cga involved processes have been used in water wastewater treatment and water pollution remediation hashim et al 2012 on using the mixed solution of surfactants and coagulants the so created coagulative colloidal gas aphrons ccgas exhibit typical characteristics of cgas such as mean diameter in micron scale long half life time and more than 50 of air holdup ccgas were found to be capable of fast capturing and removing 90 nanoparticulate pollutants from water and the ccga flotation largely reduced the coagulant dose compared with the coagulation flotation in the latter process the coagulant was directly added into the target water in the coagulation step lu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a the ccga involved flotation may be adapted to the commonly used flotation facilities it should be highlighted that the coagulant has been coated on bubbles during bubble generation and the coagulation occurs when bubbles and target particulate pollutants i e cyanobacteria cells collide and attach zhang et al 2018a b c hence the upstream coagulation unit can be omitted and the facilities are then simplified the typical cationic surfactant of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide ctab c19h42brn has always been used to generate the positively surface charged cgas briefly named ctab cgas dermiki et al 2009 mukherjee et al 2015 santos ebinuma et al 2016 zhang and guiraud 2017 this surfactant is able to interact with the negatively surface charged cells by charge neutralization and acts as a strong and stable flocculant taghavijeloudar et al 2019 it has been adopted alone or combined with coagulants in flotation for efficiently capturing cells 90 coward et al 2013 phoochinda et al 2004 xia et al 2017 however to the authors knowledge no specific research or application has been dedicated to the modification of ctab cgas with coagulants for the separation of cyanobacteria cells noting that ctab is suitable not only for its capacity of effectively separating the algal biomass from water alkarawi et al 2018 but also for its potential of inhibiting the growth of harmful algae this quaternary ammonium compound damages the cell membrane of algae solubilizes the phospholipid bilayer and inhibits the nutrient uptake through declining the algal cell activities coward et al 2014 golubev et al 2016 liang et al 2013 given that the algal growth is quite sensitive to the presence of ctab the ctab involved cgas are proposed to control the re growth of cells in the treatment of cyanohabs though relative study has not been reported it is also noted that the cyanotoxins may be released into water if the cells lyse the cyanotoxins may be intracellular particle bound or dissolved depending on the bloom age and mechanical and chemical stresses ribau teixeira 2005 ribau teixeira and rosa 2006 decreasing the dosage of chemical reagents and shortening the contact time of treatment processes help to alleviate this problem han et al 2013 and they happen to be the typically technical features of ccga flotation besides the prevention of cell growth by surface functionalized ctab cgas is expected to offset the release of caynotoxins in the present work one of the most common cyanobacteria in freshwater microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa was used as treating target this representative cyanobacterial species is notorious for forming dense cyanohabs huisman et al 2018 the objective was to fast remove m aeruginosa and inhibit the re growth thus the cyanohab problem could be effectively solved a highly efficient inorganic polymeric coagulant polyaluminum chloride pacl was used to improve the performance of ctab cgas characteristics and advantages of the flotation with surface functionalized microbubbles ccgas were investigated in terms of the removal efficiency and the re growth inhibition effect moreover the ccga flotation was particularly compared with the coagulation flotation process 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultivation of cyanobacteria in this work m aeruginosa fachb 905 was isolated from dian lake in yunnan province china and was provided by institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences the bg 11 medium being used for the algae cultivation was put into the erlynmer flasks at 120 125 c for 30 min xia et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a b c after being cooled down to the room temperature the medium was inoculated with m aeruginosa and then subjected to a 14 10 h light dark cycle at 25 c the lighting was supplied by a combination of warm and cold fluorescent tubes giving the luminance range of approximately 2200 lux 2 2 basic properties of m aeruginosa suspensions synthetic waters the suspensions of m aeruginosa at three levels of initial cell density were prepared as target cyanohab water for experiments table 1 the cell density od680 of m aeruginosa was determined by measuring the optical density at 680 nm using a uv vis spectrometer uv 1800 shimadzu japan meanwhile the cells were counted in a hemacytometer on an optical microscope ix71 olympus japan for the cell concentration od680 is positively correlated to the cell concentration 106 cells ml with the linear regression equation being established as od680 0 07 cell concentration 0 005 r2 0 99 lv et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a b c according to the world health organization the rapid scum formation can occur at the cyanobacterial density of 105 cells ml giving rise to an increasing risk of public health bartram et al 1999 the effective water treatment is then needed in this study the cell density was 6 7 98 8 times greater than the alert level in natural waters indicating the dense and severe cyanohabs the m aeruginosa cells were analyzed by laser light scattering mastersizer 3000 malvern instruments ltd u k for the mean diameter d 50 and size distribution the morphology of cells was observed by an optical microscope ix71 olympus japan besides the inorganic and organic matrices were also characterized and listed in table 1 the turbidity increased with the increase of cell density the hardness of the waters 66 74 mg l caco3 over the investigated cell densities corresponded to the soft water according to american water works association 2011 the high dissolved organic carbon doc values in waters should be mainly attributed to the presence of algal matter which was derived from the added m aeruginosa cells according to the suva results the dissolved organic matter dom were hydrophilic edzwald and van benschoten 1990 zeta potential ph conductivity turbidity and hardness were measured using zetasizer nanozs 90 malvern instruments co ltd u k ph meter innolab 20p prima china conductivity meter dds 307 inesa scientific instruments co ltd china turbidimeter wgz 20 xinrui instruments co ltd china and water hardness tester markawin biotechnologies inc china respectively after being filtrated through the 0 45 μm membrane the synthetic water was analyzed by a total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu japan and a uv vis spectrometer uv 1800 shimadzu japan for doc and absorbance at 254 nm uv254 individually 2 3 chemicals ctab aluminum chloride alcl3 and sodium hydrogen carbonate nahco3 were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd the reagents were of analytical grade and used as obtained without further purification all the solutions were prepared with deionized water except the pacl solution which was prepared using ultrapure water from a ultrapure water system smart n15vf healforce china with resistivity of 18 2 mω cm 2 4 flotation treatment with surface functionalized microbubbles the surface modifier of bubbles pacl was prepared by slowing titrating nahco3 solution into the fiercely agitated alcl3 solution and then aging for 24 h tang 2006 the basicity hydroxide to aluminum molar ratio and the total al concentration of this inorganic polymer coagulant were determined to be 2 0 and 0 1 mol l respectively the cationic surfactant of ctab was used in this study as basic frother for the generation of cgas the generation solutions of ccgas that is to say the mixed solution of ctab and pacl were prepared by mildly adding the predetermined amount of pacl into the ctab solution carefully shaking for 1 min and aging for 30 min prior to use ccgas or cgas were produced in an improved cga generator fabricated according to the apparatus proposed by sebba 1985 the design and size of the generator have been elaborated previously lu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a b c as presented in fig 1 a high speed agitator tfs 400 tyee industry china was fitted on the top of the cylindrical cga generator in which the bubble generation solution was stirred for 2 min at the speed of 6000 rpm immediately after being generated the suspension of ccgas or cgas 200 ml was pumped out from the ccga outlet at the flow rate of 320 ml min into the flotation tank for the treatment of m aeruginosa suspension 400 ml after the batch mode flotation separation the effluent was collected from the outlet and the floats were obtained from the surface of the flotation suspension as comparison the coagulation flotation trials were carried out under the same conditions as the ccga flotation tests including the stirring speed for bubble generation the flow rate of bubble suspension the dosage of pacl and ctab the volumes of bubble suspension and m aeruginosa suspension and the retention time for flotation separation the experimental procedure is presented in section 1 of supplementary information si being different from ccga flotation pacl was first added in coagulation and the resulting flocs were then separated and removed in the following flotation step to be precise the ccga or cga involved flotation in this study should be classified into dispersed air flotation 2 5 evaluation of process performance the flotation treated water 30 ml was collected from the bottom of the flotation tank effluent outlet in fig 1 for the evaluation of flotation efficiency the flocs were pumped out with supernatant 50 ml at 30 ml min from the scum outlet fig 1 for the characterization of flotation floats the low flow rates were also adopted elsewhere to avoid disturbing the flocs wang et al 2009 zhao et al 2014 the removal efficiency of m aeruginosa cells was calculated and the dilution effect caused by the bubble suspension was considered 1 removal efficiency o d 680 0 v m a e r u g i n o s a v m a e r u g i n

where od 680 0 and od 680 t reflect the optical density of the m aeruginosa cells in the flotation tank before and after the flotation treatment respectively v m aeruginosa ml and v bubbles ml refer to the volumes of m aeruginosa suspension and cga or ccga suspension before flotation which were set to be 400 ml and 200 ml individually hence eq 1 can be expressed as follows 2 removal efficiency 1 3 o d 680 t 2 o d 680 0 100 the zeta potential and ph of the clarified water were analyzed by a zetasizer nanozs 90 malvern instruments ltd u k and a ph meter innolab 20p prima china respectively residual ctab and pacl concentrations were measured under the optimum conditions of ccga flotation the former was determined by spectrophotometry uv 1800 shimadzu japan given that the color retardation of methyl orange with ctab in water results in the yellow associated ion pairs with a maximum absorption at 470 nm guo et al 2012 hu and yang 2010 the concentration of residual al was attained by analyzing the hno3 digested effluent with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry nexion 300x perkinelmer icp ms u s a and the corresponding concentration of residual pacl could then be calculated the size and fractal dimension of floats were analyzed by a laser light scattering instrument mastersizer 3000 malvern instruments ltd u k being carefully collected after flotation the wet flocs were dispersed in the deionized water and then drawn through the optical unit of mastersizer at the flow rate of 25 ml min to avoid damaging the fragile samples the mean diameter d 50 was used as the representative size the principles for the measurement of mean diameter size distribution and fractal dimension are given in the previous study zhang et al 2017 the floats were also freeze dried and observed by scanning electron microscope sem s 4700 ii hitachi japan for morphology observation meanwhile the dried samples were analyzed by atr ftir irtracer 100 shimadzu japan for the identification of binding characteristics in the flotation flocs 2 6 monitoring m aeruginosa re growth after flotation treatment the clarified m aeruginosa suspensions after flotation were transferred to the aerated erlynmer flasks and maintained under the conditions described in section 2 1 which were ideal for the growth of the m aeruginosa cells the suspensions were monitored for up to 240 h for the re growth of algal cells od680 was measured every 24 h since the initial moment and the re growth curves of the treated effluent could then be attained 3 results and discussion 3 1 process performance of pacl modified cgas in m aeruginosa removal and re growth inhibition 3 1 1 removal of m aeruginosa with ctab cgas in the absence and presence of pacl the ctab cgas were first used to remove m aeruginosa in the simulated water at three different levels of cell density in the absence of the pacl coagulant the retention time for flotation separation was controlled to be 180 s as shown in fig 2 a the separation efficiency reached above 95 at the ctab concentration in the flotation suspension 36 4 mg l or even 60 7 mg l for od680 0 0 76 over the investigated ctab concentrations the resulting ph in effluent slightly decreased by 0 5 or even less compared with the initial ph of m aeruginosa suspensions fig s1 a in order to reduce the dosage of ctab without lowering the removal efficacy of m aeruginosa the ccgas modified with pacl were adopted in flotation the result in fig 2 b denotes that when the ctab concentration was fixed to 12 1 mg l for od680 0 0 05 and 0 26 and 24 3 mg l for od680 0 0 76 in the flotation suspension more than 95 of m aeruginosa cells were removed at the pacl dosage of 3 6 mg al l for od680 0 0 05 and 0 76 or 4 5 mg al l od680 0 0 26 the ph of effluent was 6 8 7 4 at the optimum pacl dosages fig s1 b falling in the normal ph range of surface water 6 9 in spite of adding the pacl modified bubbles in the absence of pacl the efficiency was only 0 22 4 and 73 8 at the ctab dosage of 12 1 mg l od680 0 0 05 12 1 mg l od680 0 0 26 and 24 3 od680 0 0 76 respectively highlighted in grey in fig 2 a accordingly the zeta potential of flocs was below 25 0 mv highlighted in grey in fig 2 c for the flotation with ctab cgas the charge neutralization could only be achieved by increasing the addition of the cationic surfactant of ctab when the ctab cgas were surface modified with pacl zeta potential increased to 16 0 to 5 mv at the optimum pacl dosages fig 2 d in contrast with the scenario without pacl the efficient coagulant species in pacl such as al13 and al30 lin et al 2009 shirasaki et al 2016 enhanced the capacity of the microbubbles in capturing the negatively charged cells the process performance of cgas modified with pacl confirmed that those surface functionalized microbubbles facilitated the removal of m aeruginosa during flotation at decreased dosage of surfactant 3 1 2 re growth inhibition by pacl modified cgas after being eliminated by ccga flotation the m aeruginosa in the effluent should be closely monitored for re growth since the objective of the treatment included preventing cyanohabs from re occurring without any treatment od680 increased from 0 05 to 0 58 from 0 26 to 1 15 and from 0 76 to 1 79 individually fig s2 as presented in fig 3 a for the suspension with initial od680 of 0 05 the growth of m aeruginosa was inhibited in 240 h after the flotation treatment with ctab cgas at the ctab dosage of 12 1 mg l though the cells were poorly removed when using the pacl modified cgas the removal efficiency obviously increased but the re growth of m aeruginosa was prevented only at the high pacl dosage i e 6 3 mg al l similar experimental observation was found at higher initial cell densities but the pacl concentration for the effective inhibition of re growth in the investigated 240 h was lower i e 3 6 mg al l fig 3 b and c it could be inferred that when the ctab concentration was low i e 12 1 mg l and the coagulant of pacl was not adopted the cgas were unstable and drained rapidly after being injected into the flotation tank hence the dissolved ctab molecules kept the residual m aeruginosa cells from growing in contrast for the scenario with pacl modified cgas the ctab composited with pacl and the so created ccgas reinforced the elimination of m aeruginosa both of the adopted ctab molecules and dissolved al iii species should be the contributors to the re growth inhibition of m aeruginosa in addition to ctab the dissolved al iii was also related to the toxication of cyanobacteria cells gillmore et al 2016 3 1 3 m aeruginosa removal efficiency with flotation retention time the variation of m aeroginosa removal efficiency with time was investigated at the initial od680 of 0 26 and the results are presented in fig 4 in the cga flotation process without pacl the performance was not stable at the ctab concentration of 12 1 mg l within the initial 180 s in terms of the residual od680 value when the ctab concentration rose to 60 7 mg l approximately 5 times higher the steady and high removal efficiency of m aeruginosa could be achieved after 60 s as for the cgas modified with pacl they reached their highest removal efficiency within 60 s at the low ctab concentration of 12 1 mg l and further increasing the pacl loading concentration on cgas that is to say increasing the pacl dosage in the flotation suspension from 2 7 mg al l to 4 5 mg al l the residual cell density reduced sharply at 30 s 0 013 as od680 apparently the surface modification of pacl on the microbubbles led to a more rapid and robust flotation process in separating and removing m aeruginosa this can be ascribed to the enhanced attachment between bubbles and cells through strengthening the electrostatic attraction sweeping and adsorption based on the results in this subsection the retention time for flotation separation in all the following experiments was then determined to be 180 s 3 2 advantages of flotation with pacl modified cgas compared to coagulation flotation the process performance and characteristics of pacl modified cgas in the removal and re growth inhibition of m aeruginosa were compared with those of the pacl involved coagulation and flotation in the latter process pacl was adopted in the coagulation step and the formed flocs were then removed by ctab cgas without any other modification the ctab dosage in coagulation flotation was 12 1 mg l being consistent with that in ccga flotation and the adopted pacl concentration was below equal to and above the optimum pacl concentration in ccga flotation the treatment duration of ccga flotation and coagulation flotation was 3 min and 14 5 min respectively excluding the time for bubble generation 2 min 3 2 1 comparison of m aeruginosa removal efficacy the difference in the removal efficiency of m aeruginosa between the two flotation processes was more obvious at the low initial cell density as indicated in fig 5 at the initial od680 of 0 05 the removal of the m aeruginosa cells by ccgas was 2 3 3 3 times higher than that induced by coagulation flotation at the same concentrations of chemicals pacl and ctab the difference in treating efficacy between the two ways of coagulant adoption diminished with the increase of initial od680 especially at the initial od680 of 0 76 both processes performed well the experimental phenomena photographed at 1 min of flotation fig s3 revealed that ccga flotation was capable of fast clarifying the suspension of m aeruginosa compared with coagulation flotation accordingly the advantage of the former process in highly efficient separation of m aeruginosa was confirmed the zeta potential of m aeruginosa cells was below 30 0 mv at the investigated initial od680 table 1 indicating the stable dispersion of the cyanobacteria after the flotation treatment the zeta potential of aggregates derived from the ccga involved process was higher than that obtained from the pacl involved coagulation flotation particularly when the pacl dosage was equal and above the optimum pacl concentration of ccga flotation apparently the pacl modified cgas exhibited robust ability of electrostatic attraction which facilitated the capture of negatively surface charged cells in excess of 95 0 of cells were removed by ccgas even though the flotation aggregates remained negatively surface charged and were incipiently unstable it is inferred that the pacl on the bubble surface attached with and remove the m aeruginosa cells via the mechanisms of adsorption sweeping and bridging in addition to charge neutralization on the other hand under the investigated bubble generation conditions the average diameter of pacl modified cgas was measured to be 92 168 μm while the cgas without any functionalization were of 149 307 μm in diameter the bubble size analysis was conducted with an optical microscope combined with imagej software zhang et al 2018a b c the low ctab concentration adopted herein negatively impacted the foamability of the bubble generation solution resulting in large bubbles but the problem was alleviated by ccgas which provided larger surface area for capturing m aeruginosa particularly those single cells this helps to interpret the better process performance of ccga flotation in contrast with that of coagulation flotation at the initial od680 of 0 05 and 0 26 but for the water with very high cell density i e od680 0 0 76 the cells could aggregate themselves and form colonies which were easy to be removed by common bubbles therefore the difference in process performance between the two flotation technologies was not significant in addition at the pacl concentration of 4 5 mg al l ccgas resulted in lower ph in effluent 6 8 7 8 than the pacl coagulation combined with flotation separation 7 6 9 3 but no significant difference was found in the ph of effluent at lower pacl dosage 3 6 mg al l fig s4 3 2 2 comparison of re growth inhibition the inhibition of m aeruginosa re growth by ccga flotation and coagulation flotation is shown in fig 6 at the equivalent pacl dosage the ccga treated suspensions of m aeruginosa cells exhibited lower cell density od680 during the 240 h observation in contrast with those treated by pacl and ctab cgas successively the advantage of ccgas in the inhibition of re growth was particularly apparent at the low initial od680 of 0 05 and 0 26 this could be interpreted by the good attachment between the m aeruginosa cells and the coagulant species loaded on the bubble surface during ccga flotation zhang and guiraud 2017 which resulted in sufficient attack and complete destruction of the m aeruginosa cells the residual cells then lost the ability of growth after treatment comparatively when the pacl was dosed at the beginning of coagulation part of the coagulant might not participate in the capture of m aeruginosa because of the insufficient dispersion of the coagulant and on the other hand the m aeruginosa cells trapped in the flocs might not interact with the ctab molecules on the surface of cgas thus the residual cells could grow in the cultivation medium as for the initial od680 of 0 76 m aeruginosa no more grew during 240 h at the pacl dosage equal to and above the optimum value and the inhibition effect induced by the two flotation processes was quite close in sum over the investigated cell densities in this study the flotation using the cgas modified by pacl presented outstanding performance with respect to both of the removal and the re growth inhibition of cells compared with using ctab cgas alone or adopting pacl and ctab cgas successively in coagulation flotation 3 3 comparison of residual chemicals in effluent as physiochemical treatment technologies the flotation processes in this study inevitably introduced ctab and pacl into water the residual concentrations of chemicals are shown in table 2 over the investigated three initial od680 values the residual ctab concentration was found to be 3 9 6 4 mg l and 2 9 12 3 mg l for ccga flotation and coagulation flotation respectively at the optimum coagulant concentration ctab was reported to inhibit methanogenesis tezel et al 2006 and impair reproductive health melin et al 2014 at the concentration of around 25 mg l the residual ctab concentration in the effluent of ccga flotation was controlled below that alert concentration especially at the initial od680 of 0 26 and 0 76 compared with adopting ctab cgas directly in the flotation separation process the residual ctab concentrations apparently dropped via coating the ctab cgas with pacl as for the residual coagulant concentration in effluent it ranged from 0 6 mg al l to 2 4 mg al l and from 0 7 mg al l to 2 5 mg al l for ccga flotation and coagulation flotation respectively at the highest cell density of 0 76 the former process led to higher residual pacl concentration than the latter it was reported that the cell viability and growth rate of cyanobacteria could be inhibited at the al concentration of 0 5 16 2 mg l gensemer and playle 1999 hence in addition to the effect of ctab the toxicity of residual pacl coagulant to those cells might also contribute to the re growth inhibition nevertheless it has been pointed out that the exposure of al in water treatment can be associated with the development of brain lesions in humans and the al concentration in drinking water and fresh waters is recommended to be no higher than 0 2 mg l edmilson souza freitas et al 2016 given to the consideration mentioned above the ccga flotation technology proposed in this study should be adopted as emergency treatment of the waters with particularly heavy m aeruginosa cell densities 3 2 4 evaluation of different technologies using ctab and or pacl for cell removal furthermore the performance and advantages of flotation with pacl modified cgas were analyzed by comparing this work with other coagulation flotation sedimentation based studies table 3 first more than 94 0 even 99 2 of m aeruginosa elimination efficiency was achieved by the surface modified microbubble system in this study the effectiveness and efficiency of m aeruginosa removal could also be ensured by the classical coagulation flocculation dissolved air flotation for instance as high as 93 0 99 0 of intact cells were removed with low coagulant i e alum and pacl doses ribau teixeira and rosa 2006 2007 ribau teixeira et al 2010 it should be highlighted that the prevention of cell re growth was confirmed by ccga flotation herein which has not been explored or reported by other ctab involved technologies listed in table 3 the sound performance ensured the feasibility of this novel flotation technology in treating the waters with cyanohab problems second in terms of reagent consumption the ccga flotation reduced approximately 59 5 87 9 of ctab dosage with the assistance of pacl compared with froth flotation phoochinda et al 2004 and dispersed air flotation zhang et al 2018a b c meanwhile it is worth noting that the dosage of pacl in ccga flotation was less than that in coagulation flotation and for instance for the initial od680 of 0 26 4 5 mg al l and 7 2 mg al l of pacl was demanded in the former and latter processes respectively to reach their optimum flotation efficiency yet the residual concentrations of ctab and pacl represented as al in the effluent of ccga flotation process could be 3 9 6 4 mg l and 0 6 2 4 mg al l individually see in table 2 given to the possible negative impact of those two chemicals to water treatment and human health as discussed in section 3 2 3 this novel technology is especially recommended as the emergency treatment of dense cyanohabs third the retention time for reaching the complete separation effect was largely shortened to 3 min by ccga flotation which was however apparently longer in other processes liu et al 2010 nguyen et al 2013 phoochinda et al 2004 ribau teixeira and rosa 2006 2007 ribau teixeira et al 2010 zhang et al 2018a b c hence featured as high removal efficiency effective re growth inhibition low reagent demand rapid separation and simplified construction no coagulation unit the flotation with pacl modified ctab cgas greatly improved the coagulation flotation technologies for treating and controlling cyanohabs the treatment cost and sludge production could be obviously reduced this study for the first time used the pacl functionalized ctab cgas to treat the dense cyanohabs the feasibility and efficacy of this novel flotation technology were focused on with respect to eliminating m aeruginosa cells and inhibiting their re growth in the current work besides it should also be noted that the morphology and size of cyanobacterial species the extractable algal matter the microtoxins as well as other natural organic matter can result in significantly different process performance and mechanisms of ccga flotation this needs to be systematically explored in our future studies which are based on both synthetic and natural water the real environment should be particularly considered 3 3 flotation characteristics of ccga flotation in terms of floc properties the flocs of ccga flotation were characterized and compared with those of coagulation flotation at the individual optimum pacl dosage of three initial od680 values the features of the cell aggregates derived from the surface modified microbubbles were closely related to the understanding of their flotation behaviors the cultivated m aeruginosa cells in this study were 4 2 5 1 μm in average diameter according to table 1 the cells are almost spherical and ovoid fig s5 however they are multidisperse with two or three populations see in fig 7 a the cell population with the smallest size 3 6 μm took the largest proportion at the high cell densities investigated herein the aggregation of cells happened forming the colonies which were held together by the slimy matrix secreted during the growth of the colony ribau teixeira 2005 the colonies of algae cells can be extensively found in nature after the flotation treatment the size distribution of flocs in both processes was mutimodal for the m aeruginosa suspensions with the initial od680 of 0 05 and 0 26 the flocs of ccga flotation were smaller 35 0 μm and 10 4 μm respectively than those of the coagulation flotation process 55 4 μm and 46 8 μm respectively fig 7 b much larger flocs around 136 3 μm in diameter were observed for the initial od680 of 0 76 while those in coagulation flotation were 59 3 μm it can be found in fig 7 c that the flocs attained from the ccga flotation were of lower fractal dimension 2 42 for od680 0 0 05 2 43 for od680 0 2 43 and 2 17 for od680 0 0 76 in contrast with those derived from the coagulation flotation 2 57 for od680 0 0 05 2 44 for od680 0 0 26 and 2 30 for od680 0 0 76 obviously the former process led to the flocs with open structure while the latter resulted in compact aggregates lopez exposito et al 2019 according to the sem images at the magnification of 50000 the flocs presented porous morphology in ccga flotation while in turn showed smooth surface in coagulation flotation particularly for the suspension with low cell densities od680 0 0 05 and 0 26 from the water treatment practice point of view the single cells regularly penetrate treatment processes ribau teixeira and rosa 2006 2007 and thus may be more difficult to be removed than the colonies of cells by the conventional water treatment methods for the novel flotation process proposed in this study the effective attachment between bubbles and cells was facilitated when they collided owing to the presence of pacl on the bubble surface the mechanism should work on both unicellular and aggregated cells found in the pristine suspensions of m aeruginosa the so generated flocs were featured as small size and loose morphology after the bubbles drained in the coagulation flotation process m aeruginosa coagulated with pacl in the absence of bubbles which gave rise to the dense and large flocs those flocs would not deform even after the cgas drained after flotation the interaction among m aeruginosa pacl and ctab was explored via analyzing their atr spectra before and after flotation treatment as shown in fig 8 a the characteristic bands at 2914 cm 1 and 2847 cm 1 were assigned to the aliphatic c h stretch in the ctab molecules gonzalez torres et al 2017 sari and chellam 2017 the two peaks went through blue shift to 2916 2922 cm 1 with the increase of initial od680 from 0 05 to 0 76 particularly in coagulation flotation fig 8 b the ctab molecules interacted directly with the m aeruginosa cells in the coagulation flotation process whereas they attached the cells through the coating layer of pacl hence it could be interpeted that the characteristic peaks of ctab were more greatly impacted in the former process the peaks of m aeruginosa at 1649 cm 1 c o stretching and 1348 cm 1 coo stretching or amide c n and nh vibration were related to amide ii and polysaccharides protein amide iii individually gonzalez torres et al 2017 hadjoudja et al 2010 the former band shifted to lower wavenumbers in the spectra of the flocs derived from ccga flotation 1639 cm 1 1636 cm 1 and 1628 cm 1 for od680 0 0 05 0 26 and 0 76 while blue shift of this band occurred in the scenario of coagulation flotation od680 0 0 05 and 0 26 it could be inferred that the c o stretching of m aeruginosa was less influenced by the interaction of cells and pacl in ccga flotation than in coagulation flotation this could be explained by the different mechanisms of capturing the m aeruginosa cells in the two flotation methods during ccga flotation the negatively surface charged cells interacted with the polycationic al iii species of pacl whilst the latter also combined with the ctab molecules for the formation of ccgas as for the coagulation flotation process the cells directly coagulated with pacl during coagulation and then were separated by ctab cgas within 3 min in flotation 4 conclusions in the current study the flotation technology using pacl functionalized ctab cgas was developed and demonstrated as a highly effective method for the treatment of waters with severe cyanohab problems this novel type of ccgas removed more than 94 2 99 2 of m aeruginosa within 3 min at low ctab and pacl dosage of 12 1 24 3 mg l and 3 6 4 5 mg al l over the investigated range of initial cell density od680 0 from 0 05 to 0 76 after the flotation treatment under the optimum conditions the re growth of m aeruginosa did not happen within 10 days at the low ctab dosage the ccgas could provide larger surface area for capturing the m aeruginosa cells in both unicellular and colonial form in contrast with the unmodified ctab cgas the good attachment between the coagulant species coated on the bubble surface and the cells resulted in efficient collection sufficient attack and complete destruction of the m aeruginosa cells during ccga flotation the flocs derived from the ccga flotation were characterized as smaller size and looser configuration in contrast with those obtained from coagulation flotation compared with coagulation flotation as well as other coagulation sedimentation flotation technologies the ctab cgas modified with pacl took great advantages in terms of stronger charge neutralization capacity large reduction of reagent demand fast separation and simplified flotation construction in addition to sound process performance and re growth inhibition effect thus the ccga flotation was promising in treating and controlling cyanohabs with reduced cost and sludge production however given to the possibly negative environmental impact of residual chemicals in effluent at the present stage this technology is more recommended as the emergency treatment of dense cyanohabs as a novel flotation process further study needs to be carried out in terms of i the impact of algal matter natural organic matter as well as cyanobacterial species and morphology on the process performance and mechanisms in both synthetic and natural water the real environment should be particularly considered ii the released cyanotoxins due to the cell damage during ccga flotation and iii the further reduction of residual chemicals to achieve the latter two objectives the operation conditions should be optimized and meanwhile the downstream or simultaneous treatment method i e oxidation is demanded as well declaration of interest statement all of our authors declare no financial or personal relationships with other people or

sediment ss in natural waters are important for the environmental fate of plastic particles this study investigated the effect of heteroaggregation between nano microplastics and ss on the settling of aggregates in nacl solutions 0 05 0 5 m large ss 100 500 μm in diameter significantly increased the settling ratio of polystyrene nanoplastics psnps with an average diameter of 100 nm due to the formation of psnps ss aggregates the settling ratio of the heteroaggregates increased significantly when the nacl concentration increased from 50 to 200 mm this was primarily because higher ionic strength reduced the electrostatic repulsion between large ss and psnps and subsequently increased the heteroaggregation rate no obvious differences in settling ratios were observed in 200 or 500 mm nacl solutions because the heteroaggregation entered the diffusion controlled regime however in ha solutions 10 50 mg l 1 the surface adsorption of ha on psnps and large ss reduced the heteroaggregation of psnps ss and thus led to the low co settling ratio due to the steric hindrance according to the dlvo theory in contrast polyethylene microplastics pemps with diameters of 1 0 1 2 mm were found to always float on water surface up to 8 months even after addition of 500 mg l 1 small ss 10 μm in diameter clearly the heteroaggregation of pemps and small ss had minor effect on the settling of pemps due to the overwhelming boyanccy these results provided new insight into the fate and distribution of nano microplastics in aquatic environment which affect the bioavailability of

besseling et al 2017 adsorption to algae may enable them to entry the food web or trophic chain lagarde et al 2016 long et al 2017 heteroaggregation with seaweeds promoted mps to settle out of surface water leading to accumulation in sediment and benthic environment sundbæk et al 2018 the colonization of mps by microalgae and other microorganisms resulted in an increased plastic density and

clearly affect the mobility stability and distribution of mps or nps in water column long et al 2015 2017 for example the settling process of nps mps not only increases the accumulation in the sediments and adverse effect to benthic organisms imhof et al 2016 wang et al 2018 but also affects the photochemical degradation of nps mps and their weathering processes in aquatic environments homoaggregation and or heteroaggregation of nps mps in the presence of salts surfactant or other species could alter their surface properties surface charges or hydrophobicity dong et al 2019 drechsler and grundke 2005 jódar reyes et al 2006 lagarde et al 2016 for example psnps can rapidly form millimeter sized aggregates in seawater wegner et al 2012 due to the electric double layer suppression by cations such as na k ca2 and mg2 drechsler and grundke 2005 lu et al 2018 the aggregates of psmps after addition of mg2 was much larger than those after addition of na and k primarily because the divalent cations were more effective in neutralization of the surface negative charge and suppression of the thickness of the electric double layer lu et al 2018 humic acid ha can readily adsorb on the surface of psmps through hydrophobic interaction electrostatic interaction or ligand exchange which may enhance the colloidal stability of psmps due to electrostatic repulsion and or steric stabilization chen et al 2018 lu et al 2018 low concentrations 0 48 mm of a cationic surfactant i e domiphen bromide resulted in aggregation of psmps with cooh on their surfaces also due to the charge neutralization effect jódar reyes et al 2006 however how water chemistry e g ionic strength and ha affects the surface properties of plastic particle the heteroaggregation and co settling of nps mps with ss remains unclear in this study psnps of 100 nm in diameter and polyethylene microplastics pemps of 1 0 1 2 mm in diameter were used as model plastic particles due to their broad industrial applications dong et al 2019 lagarde et al 2016 suspended sediments originally sampled from the pearl river in china were employed to study the exposure impacts on stability and co settling of nps mps the following hypotheses were tested 1 psnps could adhere to the surface of ss particles with sizes greater than plastic particles and co settle in water column 2 small ss particles may adhere to pemps and affect aggregation and or settling of pemps and 3 the water salinity and ha could change the interactions between psnps pemps and ss particles in addition the derjaguin landau vervey overbeek dlvo interaction energies peclet number pe and settling velocity were calculated to analyze the heteroaggregation and settling behaviors of psnps or pemps 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization of nano microplastics suspensions 2 1 1 characterization of nanoplastics suspensions briefly 100 μl of 1000 mg l 1 psnp stock solution was diluted by deionized di

cm was obtained from the pearl river at the fengmamiao hydrological station with proper treatment and sieving see detailed description in si the settling experiments were conducted in colorimetric tube at room temperature of 25 c two separate settling experiments were conducted to evaluate the impacts of heteroaggregation on co settling of plastic particles and ss 1 100 ml water suspension of psnps at 10 mg l 1 was mixed with 100 mg l 1 ss with diameters between 100 and 500 μm 2 to investigate the settling kinetics of pemps with or without small ss thirty pemps were added into 100 ml of the water suspension of ss with diameters 10 μm at 500 mg l 1 the corresponding concentration of pemps was approximately 160 mg l 1 the mixed suspensions were sonicated for 1 min to achieve uniform dispersion and then left undisturbed for natural settling the settling kinetics of nps mps with or without ss was analyzed by tracking the concentration changes of nps mps at the water surface in the colorimeter tube while the concentrations of mps or nps in natural waters are estimated to be less than 1 mg l 1 lenz et al 2016 relatively high concentrations of mps nps 10 mg l 1 psnps and 160 mg l 1 pemps were used in our experiments to expedite the experimental observations and facilitate the instrumental analysis or detection for instance the concentration of nps or mps was measured by both the fluorescence spectrophotometer f 4600 hitachi tokyo japan and uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr6000 loveland usa the emission spectra were recorded in the wavelength range of 400 600 nm upon excitation with the wavelength of 388 nm the scanning speed was 1200 nm min 1 and the photomultiplier tube voltage was 700 v the absorption spectra of the collected suspensions were acquired over a wavelength range of 200 800 nm to indicate the decline of suspension turbidity due to the settling process to investigate the effects of electrolyte and natural organic matter nom on the settling kinetics of nps mps different concentrations of nacl 50 200 or 500 mm or and ha 10 20 or 50 mg l 1 was added to the mixed suspension of plastic particle and ss the employed concentrations of nacl and ha in our experiments represent realistic levels in estuaries with salinity or dom transiting from freshwater to seawater pilson 2012 thurman 1985 the nacl concentration in estuaries ranges from a few mm in freshwater up to 500 mm in seawater dong et al 2019 pilson 2012 xu et al 2013 the ha concentration in estuaries may increase from 1 mg l 1 in seawater to 10 mg l 1 in freshwater thomas 1997 thurman 1985 the stock solution of ha 1000 mg l 1 was prepared by dissolving ha powder in di water and adjusting ph to 8 0 with 0 01 m naoh solution the settling ratio r of nps mps as a function of time t h was calculated by eq 1 as an indication of the concentration change of plastics particles due to the settling process 1 r c 0 c t c 0 100 where c 0 is the initial psnp concentration mg l 1 in the suspension c t is the psnp concentration mg l 1 remaining in the supernatant at time t and c t is calculated from a calibration curve between the psnp concentration and fluorescence intensity fig s1 2 3 sem and microscope observation of nano microplastics and suspended sediment interaction after 200 h of settling the samples on the bottom of the reaction suspensions were collected from the suspensions of psnps ss and their mixed suspension in colorimetric tube then a drop of the collected suspension 10 μl was air dried on an aluminum foil coated with gold and observed on a sem at accelerating voltage of 5 kv after 8 months of settling the morphology of pemps on the surface of the mixed suspensions of pemps and small ss were visualized via nikon eclipse ts2 microscope nikon corporation tokyo japan 2 4 fluorescence imaging of nanoplastics with or without suspended sediment liquid samples were taken at different settling times from several depths i e the surface middle or bottom of the water suspensions in colorimetric tube the fluorescence images of psnps were characterized by the same fluorescence microscope at excitation wavelength of 405 nm 2 5 interaction energy calculation by dlvo theory the dlvo theory was used to assess the surface interaction energies between plastic particles and ss for the interaction energies between psnps and large ss a particle plate geometry was employed in the dlvo calculation because psnps diameter of 100 nm behave like small particles that deposit on the surface of large ss diameter of 100 500 μm as shown in the sem images similarly millimeter sized pemps interacting with small ss particles diameter 10 μm can also be viewed as interactions between plate and particle the interaction of psnps psnps was treated as a particle particle geometry a plate plate geometry was used to calculate the interaction energies of pemps pemps detailed calculation processes and equations are provided in section s4 of si 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of nano microplastics and suspended sediment 3 1 1 characterization of nano microplastics fig 1 a and b shows both psnps and pemps are spherical in shape psnps are not uniform in size with diameters ranging from 15 6 4 1 to 92 0 6 8 nm by contrast pemps have a relatively uniform size distribution the averaged diameters of the psnps and pemps were 90 23 nm and 920 61 μm respectively as shown in the size distribution histograms fig s2 of si determined by image j software from the particles in sem images the fluorescence images in fig 1c and d show that both psnps and pemps have bright fluorescence the diameter values were consistent with those provided by the manufacturer fig 1e shows the hydrodynamic particle size distribution of nano microplastics in aqueous suspensions the average hydrodynamic diameters of psnps and pemps were 98 nm and 1277 μm respectively the polydispersivity index value 0 014 for the suspensions of psnps was less than 0 2 which indicated that psnps were stable and well dispersed in water without significant aggregation izquierdo et al 2005 as shown in fig 1f the zeta potentials of psnps in di water are negative in the tested ph range the sulfate groups render the negative charge of psnps lu et al 2018 specifically during the polymerization reaction of styrene sulfate free radicals react with the double bond of a styrene monomer to produce polystyrene chains with high molecular weights lu et al 2018 chain termination occurs when two growing chains react to make a sulfate terminated polymer chain that is located on the surface of psnps lu et al 2018 the zeta potentials of psnps became more negative as ph increased no isoelectric point was observed on psnps within the solution ph range we tested probably because the sulfate group on psnps presents negative charges within a broad range of ph from 2 to 12 gallardo et al 2008 similarly the zeta potential values of pemps were also negative within the ph range of 2 12 to further determine the exact isoelectric points the solution ph must be lower than 2 kirby and hasselbrink 2004 which has no relevance to the environmental conditions in this study 3 1 2 characterization of suspended sediment the sem images in fig 2 a and b shows that the small and large ss have irregular plate shapes and large size variations in water suspensions the average particle diameters of small and large ss from the sem images were 10 9 1 2 and 125 4 5 2 μm respectively and were determined by image j software as shown in fig 2c and d the hydrodynamic diameters of small ss range from 0 4 to 62 2 μm with average diameter of 8 84 μm whereas the hydrodynamic diameters of large ss range from 1 63 to 837 2 μm with average diameter of 105 24 μm fig 2e and f shows that the zeta potential values of small or large ss are all negative with no observed isoelectric points within ph of 2 12 the negative surface charge of ss may be attributed to the organic matters present on the surface of ss including but not limited to carboxylic acid and phenolic functional groups borgnino et al 2006 these functional groups or species are negatively charged in natural waters as reported elsewhere kim and sansalone 2008 zhu et al 2018 3 2 aggregation of large suspended sediment and nanoplastics fig 3 compares the sem images of psnps large ss and their mixture in the presence of 500 mm nacl in row a 10 mg l 1 ha in row b and both nacl and ha in row c psnps in water are stabilized by surface surfactants and aggregation is minor according to the manufacturer the colloidal stability of psnps in water is supported by the results of the dlvo analysis as shown in fig s4a which shows an energy barrier at 5 10 kbt between the interacting psnps when adding 500 mm nacl into the suspension of psnps homoaggregation begins to occur as verified by the sem images in fig 3 and green fluorescence images in fig s6 this was primarily because of the charge neutralization and compression of electrostatic double layer by nacl dong et al 2019 wegner et al 2012 which reduced the repulsive energy barrier between psnps 0 kbt as shown in fig s4a in the presence of 10 mg l 1 ha the interaction energy between psnps was substantially high 20 30 kbt which results in high colloidal stability of psnps images of fig 3b1 and fig s7 also demonstrated that psnps dispersed well in 10 mg l 1 ha solution without significant aggregation ha are negatively charged in the ph range of 3 11 due to the presence of carboxylic acid and phenolic functional groups loosli et al 2013 nps mps may interact with the aromatic structure of ha via π π interactions alimi et al 2018 cai et al 2018 chen et al 2018 the interaction between psnps and ha changes the surface chemistry of psnps chen et al 2018 and enhances negative zeta potential of psnps 30 mv as shown in table s4 therefore the electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance were increased when ha was adsorbed onto the surface of psnps through π π interactions which finally increased the stability of psnps in ha solution alimi et al 2018 cai et al 2018 lu et al 2018 the interaction energy barrier between psnps in 10 mg l 1 ha solution 28 kbt decreased to less than 0 kbt after addition of 500 mg l 1 nacl thus nacl promoted the homoaggregation of psnps in ha solution consequently the aggregates of psnps in the mixture of 10 mg l 1 ha and 500 mm nacl were larger than those in ha solution as compared between parts b1 and c1 in fig 3 as shown in fig 3a2 ss destabilizes and rapidly forms aggregates in 500 mm nacl solution due to the surface charge neutralization and decreased electrostatic repulsion between ss dong et al 2019 wegner et al 2012 in the ha solution the adsorption of ha on the surface of ss improved the electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance between ss which slowed down the aggregation of ss alimi et al 2018 cai et al 2018 lu et al 2018 therefore the particle sizes of ss in nacl solution were larger than those in ha solution in the mixed suspension of ss and psnps psnps adsorbed on the surface of large ss in 500 mm nacl solution fig 3a3 this is consistent with the low interaction energy barrier between 0 kbt psnps and large ss according to the dlvo calculations in fig s4d by contrast a high repulsive energy barrier 300 kbt was established between psnps and large ss in the 10 mg l 1 ha solution due to the above mentioned steric repulsion alimi et al 2018 cai et al 2018 therefore no heteroaggregation occurred between psnps and large ss in ha solution as shown in fig 3b3 similarly adding nacl into the ha solution apparently reduced the interaction energy barrier between psnps and large ss as shown in fig s4f as a result heteroaggregation of psnps and ss was observed in the mixed solution of 10 mg l 1 ha and 500 mm nacl as shown in fig 3c3 and fig s8 3 3 co settling of polystyrene nanoplastics with suspended sediment 3 3 1 effect of nacl concentrations on the settling process fig 4 a shows the settling kinetics of psnps with or without large ss as a function of nacl concentrations in the absence of ss the settling ratios of psnps increased as the nacl concentration increased up to 200 mm because of the formation of psnp homoaggregates in di water only 25 7 of psnps settled after 200 h compared to 55 0 in 50 mm nacl solution after 100 h all psnps settled out from the suspension in 200 or 500 mm nacl solutions the surface charges of psnps became less negative with the increasing nacl concentration due to the charge neutralization and compression of electrostatic double layer table s4 this resulted in weaker electrostatic repulsive forces and faster homoaggregation rates cai et al 2018 drechsler and grundke 2005 which subsequently increased the settling ratio of psnps in nacl solutions fluorescence images in fig s6 confirm that more nps aggregated at higher concentrations of nacl solutions and no psnps remain in the surface of the aqueous suspensions in 200 or 500 mm nacl solutions clearly after settling for 200 h the ps aggregates appeared to be the white floc residing at the bottom of the colorimetric tube with addition of ss the settling ratios of psnps in nacl solutions were significantly improved as verified by the uv vis measurement for the supernatant samples in fig s9 the improved settling ratio was ascribed to the formation of psnps ss aggregates the greenish precipitates in fig s6 previous work has detected high concentration of micro sized plastic foams in the sediment although the density of plastic foams 0 05 0 4 g cm 3 is lower than water primarily due to the adsorption and co settling of plastic foam with suspended sediment song et al 2017 specifically the settling ratio of psnps ss aggregates increased significantly when the nacl concentration increased from 50 mm to 200 mm in the presence of ss almost 100 of psnps settled from water in 200 mm nacl solution after 80 h whereas only 74 8 psnps settled from water in 50 mm nacl solution even after 200 h this highlights the important role of ss in the heteroaggregation and settling process of psnps besseling et al 2017 cai et al 2018 yang et al 2011 no obvious difference in the settling ratios of psnps was observed in 200 or 500 mm nacl solutions with or without addition of ss indicating that above 200 mm the heteroaggregation between psnps and ss may be diffusion controlled and thus the settling behavior became independent of nacl concentrations li et al 2018a 2018b 3 4 effect of humic acid on the settling ratios fig 4b shows in the absence of ss the settling ratios of psnps are 20 6 18 9 or 15 3 in the presence of 10 20 or 50 mg l 1 ha after 200 h respectively which indicates that higher ha concentration slightly decreases the settling ratio correspondingly no obvious precipitates of psnps at the bottom of the colorimetric tube were observed in fig s7 it is plausible that the adsorbed ha on psnps increased the steric repulsion and thus inhibited homoaggregation of psnps alimi et al 2018 cai et al 2018 this speculation is justified by many previous studies that reported ha could retard settling of various colloidal particles such as latex particles c60 carbon nanotubes hematite or titanium dioxide mainly because of the steric hindrance effect chen and elimelech 2008 pelley and tufenkji 2008 after the addition of ss the settling ratio of psnps increased slightly despite of the ha concentrations this should result from the increasing steric hindrance between psnps and ss after surface coating fromation through ha sorption and then decreasing tendency of heteroaggregation according to the dlvo analysis in fig s4 the uv vis spectrometry measurement in fig s10 also confirms retardation effect of ha on the settling processes of psnps 3 4 1 combined effects of nacl and humic acid on the settling ratios fig 4c shows that in the absence of ss the settling ratios of psnps in 10 mg l 1 ha solutions increase from 21 6 to 41 2 when the nacl concentrations increase from 50 to 500 mm similar to the observation above the zeta potentials of psnps became less negative with the increasing concentration of nacl table s4 which resulted in weaker electrostatic repulsion between psnps higher aggregation and settling ratio of psnps dong et al 2019 consistently the heteroaggregation of psnps and ss promoted the settling ratios of psnps from 28 1 to 62 0 because of the heteroaggregation of psnps and ss in the mixture of nacl and ha the ss induced settling ratio improvement of psnps has also been confirmed by the uv vis spectrometry measurement in fig s11 as demonstrated above nacl and ha had opposite influence on the heteroaggregation ratio of psnps and ss therefore the settling ratios of psnps with or without ss were highest in nacl solutions followed by nacl ha mixtures and then ha solutions the settling kinetics of psnps with small ss diameter 10 μm under different conditions have also been investigated fig s12 shows the settling ratios of psnps significantly increase after addition of small ss the effects of nacl and ha on the settling kinetics of psnps after addition of small ss were similar to what we observed after addition of large ss therefore the heteroaggregation of psnps and small ss also enhanced the co settling ratio 3 5 aggregation and settling assessment of polyethylene microplastics with suspended sediment pemps were visible to naked eye and always float on the water surface in nacl solution ha solution or their mixture as shown in fig 5 in the 10 mg l 1 ha solution pemps still aggregated due to the strong hydrophobic attraction cai et al 2018 li et al 2018b despite of the steric hindrance by the surface adsorption by ha cai et al 2018 the homoaggregation of pemps had also been observed in nacl solution with or without ha this is consistent with the low interaction energy barrier between 2 kbt pemps according to the dlvo calculations in fig s5a as shown in fig s5b the repulsive energy between pemps and small ss in all the solutions is substantially high this was consistent with the low extent of surface adsorption of ss 10 μm on the surface of pemps as observed from fig s13 the low pemps small ss heteroaggregation tendency explains why the settling processes of pemps were barely affected by small ss even when the concentration of nacl reached 500 mm no settling of pemps with or without addition of ss occurred after eight months the addition of large ss has minor effect on the settling process of pemps in 500 mm nacl solution 10 mg l 1 ha solution or mixture of 50 mm nacl and 10 mg l 1 ha similarly pemps always float on the water surface with or without large or small ss during our experimental period of eight months under the following water chemical conditions a 50 mm or 200 mm nacl b 20 mg l 1 or 50 mg l 1 ha and c 10 mg l 1 ha and 200 mm nacl 10 mg l 1 ha and 500 mm nacl the results are not provided as they were almost identical to those shown in fig 5 3 6 analysis of the settling mechanisms for nanoplastics and microplastics 3 6 1 analysis of brownian motion and buoyance force of plastic particles to determine the potential influences of brownian motion and buoyancy force on the settling of psnps or pemps the peclet number pe was assessed by eq 2 khaled abdella ahmed et al 2018 kovalchuk and starov 2012 2 p e 2 π δ ρ g r particle 4 3 k b t where δρ is the density difference between the medium liquid ρ medium and psnps pemps ρ particle ps and pe have densities of 1 05 kg dm 3 and 0 96 kg dm 3 respectively the liquid is water with a density of 1 0 kg dm 3 g is the gravity constant 9 81 m s 2 r particle is the average radius of psnps or pemps k b is the boltzmann constant 1 38 10 23 j k 1 and t is the absolute temperature 298 k fig 6 a shows that the values of pe are less than 1 when the diameters of plastics are smaller than c a 1500 nm and 1250 nm for psnps and pemps respectively this indicates that the brownian motion dominates the movement of psnps the buoyancy effect can be ignored by contrast the pemps size is much larger than 1250 nm and the values of pe are always 1 therefore the boyance force results in a permanent floating state of pemps in water whereas the brownian motion effect could be neglected which supports the experimental results in fig 5 3 6 2 heteroaggregation analysis the heteroaggregation rate between psnps and large ss can be analyzed using the smoluchowski s population balance equation zhang 2014 3 d n d t 1 2 α β n 1 n 2 where d n d t is the rate of heteroaggregation between psnps and large ss with number concentrations of n 1 and n 2 α is the collision or attachment efficiency between psnps and large ss and β is the collision frequency since the initial concentrations of psnps and large ss remained the same when varying nacl or ha concentrations only the collision efficiency α was calculated following the reported method fu et al 2018 zhang et al 2012 fig 6b shows that the collision efficiency increases when the nacl concentration increases which causes the heteroaggregation to shift from the reaction limited regime to the diffusion limited regime diffusion limited heteroaggregation perikinetic flocculation occurs when the ionic strength of nacl solution is equal to or greater than the critical coagulation concentration ccc level for the psnps ss system according to our previous study inter particle aggregation will effectively take place only when the brownian kinetic energy of suspended particles exceeds and thus overcome the interaction energy barrier zhang et al 2012 thus when the nacl concentration is above the ccc level the inter particle interaction energy barrier is minimized making the aggregation rate completely depends on the rate of particle diffusion or diffusion limited this explained why similar settling ratios of psnps were observed with or without addition of large ss in 200 and 500 mm nacl solutions that are above the ccc level 200 mm reported in previous works busch et al 1996 jódar reyes et al 2006 the presence of ha clearly reduced α and thus slowed down the heteroaggregation rate which was consistent with the experimental results shown in fig 3 the inhibition for heteroaggregation is because the adsorbed ha clearly creates strong electrostatic repulsion forces and steric stabilization between psnps and large ss alimi et al 2018 cai et al 2018 3 6 3 calculation of the settling velocities of nano microplastics sediment aggregates we conducted the following calculations with hypothesis that ss was considered as a core sphere on which a monolayer of psnps absorbed to form the psnps ss aggregates the assumption of monolayered adsorption of psnps on ss is justified by the fact that psnps electrostatically repel each other according to the dlvo analysis and thus prevent multi layered adsorption we further assume that the psnps ss aggregates followed a type i settling process a discrete particle settling process at least during the initial settling process from the surface water because low concentrations of psnps pemps and ss were employed in our settling experiments the settling velocity v s is calculated under three potential flow conditions laminar transition and turbulent flows as shown in table s6 the corresponding reynolds number re ρ medium v s d plastic sediment μ was also calculated to verify if the employed equations were applicable in section s12 fig 7 shows that the calculated settling velocities of ps ss aggregates change as a function of the sizes of ps and ss as well as re values under three different flow conditions or different re values some common observations are that both v s and re are affected by the diameters of psnps and ss v s and re both decrease as the diameter of psnps increases because the attachment of psnps on ss increases the diameter d plastic sediment of the ps ss aggregate whereas reduces the overall density of the aggregate according to eq s 2 for instance under the laminar flow condition the black square data curve indicates that psnps with diameters less than 16 μm deposit on ss with a diameter of 105 μm the average diameter of large ss used in this study in this condition the v s of the aggregate will decrease with increasing psnp diameter until a negligible level e g 0 005 m s 1 such as brownian motion or buoyancy force may begin to dictate the movement of the aggregate when the diameter of ss is larger than 130 μm both v s and re will increase with decreasing of psnp diameter which may result in the settling of ps ss aggregate in a transition or turbulent flow condition under our experimental condition psnps 100 nm in diameter can deposit onto the surface of large ss mean diameter of 105 μm as indicated by the red star symbol and the heteroaggregate can settle at a terminal settling velocity of 0 010 m s 1 in the laminar flow section as shown in fig 7 for the case of small ss that may deposit onto the surface of large pemps fig s12 shows that the settling velocity for aggregates of pemps and small ss is extremely low 10 5 m s 1 which indicates that the settling process is negligible when the radius of pemps is larger than 1 39 μm the settling velocity becomes zero and pemps will always float which agrees with our experimental results in fig 5 and modeling data in fig 6 the yellow region in fig s14 denotes the settling velocities for heavy plastics such as polytetrafluoroethylene polyvinylidene fluoride and polyvinylchloride that have densities greater than that of water 1 g cm 3 the gray region on the other hand shows the settling velocities for light plastics such as polypropylene and pe that have densities lower than that of water clearly the density of mps significantly affects the settling velocities of plastics ss aggregates 4 conclusions although plastic pollution in marine and freshwater systems has received intensive research there is not yet an in depth understanding of the distribution and fate of psnps pemps in aquatic environments results of this study provide new insight into the role of ss and heteroaggregation settling in the fate and transformation of plastic particles the adsorption of ps plastics particles on large ss will result in the formation of heteroaggregates which can carry and settle psnps down rapidly in water column consequently relatively low abundances of psnps could be found at the water surface which may change their environmental fate for example due to the lack of exposure to sunlight the settled psnps may undergo a long time of decay through microbial degradation or hydrolysis auta et al 2017b paço et al 2017 in other words the bottom sediment and benthic zone of water columns could be a sink for ultra small ps plastic particles which potentially increase the probability of uptake by benthic organisms or benthic suspension feeders and trophic transfer to food webs nakki et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 millimeter sized pemps always float on water surface and surface adsorption of small ss does not cause pemps to settle thus photochemical degradation photolysis weathering process and erosion action could potentially play dominant roles in the transformation of pemps in natural waters consequently the ecological risks of exposure to psnps pemps may vary significantly with different depths of water column due to the presence of nom and high concentration of ss in real estuaries the actual setting may also follow type ii flocculant settling and type iii hindered or zone settling which are worth future investigations interactions with other naturally occurring colloids such as bacteria phytoplankton microalgae and clays may also cause plastic agglomerations and other types of settling processes e g differential settling which certainly deserves further studies to obtain new insight into the environmental fate of plastic particles this calculation permitted relatively simple experimentation and detection of psnps pemps in sandy water using the fluorescence intensity measurement apparently there is a pressing need to develop comprehensive and standardized tools for accurate prediction of transport and stability e g float or sink of plastic particles in complex environmental matrices notes the

sediment ss in natural waters are important for the environmental fate of plastic particles this study investigated the effect of heteroaggregation between nano microplastics and ss on the settling of aggregates in nacl solutions 0 05 0 5 m large ss 100 500 μm in diameter significantly increased the settling ratio of polystyrene nanoplastics psnps with an average diameter of 100 nm due to the formation of psnps ss aggregates the settling ratio of the heteroaggregates increased significantly when the nacl concentration increased from 50 to 200 mm this was primarily because higher ionic strength reduced the electrostatic repulsion between large ss and psnps and subsequently increased the heteroaggregation rate no obvious differences in settling ratios were observed in 200 or 500 mm nacl solutions because the heteroaggregation entered the diffusion controlled regime however in ha solutions 10 50 mg l 1 the surface adsorption of ha on psnps and large ss reduced the heteroaggregation of psnps ss and thus led to the low co settling ratio due to the steric hindrance according to the dlvo theory in contrast polyethylene microplastics pemps with diameters of 1 0 1 2 mm were found to always float on water surface up to 8 months even after addition of 500 mg l 1 small ss 10 μm in diameter clearly the heteroaggregation of pemps and small ss had minor effect on the settling of pemps due to the overwhelming boyanccy these results provided new insight into the fate and distribution of nano microplastics in aquatic environment which affect the bioavailability of

marine organisms e g diatom chaetoceros neogracile or be incorporated in marine phytoplankton aggregates lagarde et al 2016 long et al 2017 the electrostatic interaction force between positively charged polystyrene nanoplastics psnps with amidine surface coating and negatively charged alginate or fe2o3 resulted in charge neutralization and formation of large heteroaggregates oriekhova and stoll 2018 further increase of alginate or fe2o3 concentrations resulted in charge inversion increased stabilization of psnps and decreased aggregate sizes oriekhova and stoll 2018 mps has also been demonstrated to form aggregates with natural minerals or solids such as kaolin or bentonite clays and other colloidal particles e g bacteria which obviously affects the fate of mps in the water column besseling et al 2017 adsorption to algae may enable them to entry the food web or trophic chain lagarde et al 2016 long et al 2017 heteroaggregation with seaweeds promoted mps to settle out of surface water leading to accumulation in sediment and benthic environment sundbæk et al 2018 the colonization of mps by microalgae and other microorganisms resulted in an increased plastic density and variations of vertical transport of mps in an aquatic environment and their long term distribution lagarde et al 2016 under hydrodynamic turbulence resuspension of sediment leads to inevitable interactions e g heteroaggregation between suspended sediment ss and nps mps as the most dominant aquatic substances especially in estuary with high turbidity sediment microplastics interactions clearly affect the mobility stability and distribution of mps or nps in water column long et al 2015 2017 for example the settling process of nps mps not only increases the accumulation in the sediments and adverse effect to benthic organisms imhof et al 2016 wang et al 2018 but also affects the photochemical degradation of nps mps and their weathering processes in aquatic environments homoaggregation and or heteroaggregation of nps mps in the presence of salts surfactant or other species could alter their surface properties surface charges or hydrophobicity dong et al 2019 drechsler and grundke 2005 jódar reyes et al 2006 lagarde et al 2016 for example psnps can rapidly form millimeter sized aggregates in seawater wegner et al 2012 due to the electric double layer suppression by cations such as na k ca2 and mg2 drechsler and grundke 2005 lu et al 2018 the aggregates of psmps after addition of mg2 was much larger than those after addition of na and k primarily because the divalent cations were more effective in neutralization of the surface negative charge and suppression of the thickness of the electric double layer lu et al 2018 humic acid ha can readily adsorb on the surface of psmps through hydrophobic interaction electrostatic interaction or ligand exchange which may enhance the colloidal stability of psmps due to electrostatic repulsion and or steric stabilization chen et al 2018 lu et al 2018 low concentrations 0 48 mm of a cationic surfactant i e domiphen bromide resulted in aggregation of psmps with cooh on their surfaces also due to the charge neutralization effect jódar reyes et al 2006 however how water chemistry e g ionic strength and ha affects the surface properties of plastic particle the heteroaggregation and co settling of nps mps with ss remains unclear in this study psnps of 100 nm in diameter and polyethylene microplastics pemps of 1 0 1 2 mm in diameter were used as model plastic particles due to their broad industrial applications dong et al 2019 lagarde et al 2016 suspended sediments originally sampled from the pearl river in china were employed to study the exposure impacts on stability and co settling of nps mps the following hypotheses were tested 1 psnps could adhere to the surface of ss particles with sizes greater than plastic particles and co settle in water column 2 small ss particles may adhere to pemps and affect aggregation and or settling of pemps and 3 the water salinity and ha could change the interactions between psnps pemps and ss particles in addition the derjaguin landau vervey overbeek dlvo interaction energies peclet number pe and settling velocity were calculated to analyze the heteroaggregation and settling behaviors of psnps or pemps 2 materials and methods 2 1

aluminum foil and coated with gold then the morphology of psnps was observed on a field emission scanning electron microscope sem hitach tokyo japan with an acceleration voltage of 5 kv the morphology and mean particle size distribution of the particles was statistically analyzed with sem images of at least 40 particles by the imagej software nih md usa particle size distributions psds averaged hydrodynamic diameters and zeta potentials of psnps in water were measured by dynamic light scattering dls on a nanobrook omin instrument brookhaven instruments corporation new york usa two ml of 10 mg l 1 psnp suspension was placed into a standard macro cuvette 1 cm in pass length the solution temperature was maintained at room temperature 25 c the scattering angle was 90 the results were averaged from three independent measurements with standard deviations the fluorescence images of nps were observed by the three dimensional structured illumination microscopy applied precision issaquah usa at the excitation wavelength of 405 nm 2 1 2 preparation and characterization of microplastics suspensions stock suspensions of pemps were prepared by dispersing 16 mg of powder into 100

target pressure of 200 mbar 4 target pressure of 200 mbar and time limit of 180 s 2 2 settling kinetics of nano microplastics with or without addition of suspended sediment the surface sediment 0 10 cm was obtained from the pearl river at the fengmamiao hydrological station with proper treatment and sieving see detailed description in si the settling experiments were conducted in colorimetric tube at room temperature of 25 c two separate settling experiments were conducted to evaluate the impacts of heteroaggregation on co settling of plastic particles and ss 1 100 ml water suspension of psnps at 10 mg l 1 was mixed with 100 mg l 1 ss with diameters between 100 and 500 μm 2 to investigate the settling kinetics of pemps with or without small ss thirty pemps were added into 100 ml of the water suspension of ss with diameters 10 μm at 500 mg l 1 the corresponding concentration of pemps was approximately 160 mg l 1 the mixed suspensions were sonicated for 1 min to achieve uniform dispersion and then left undisturbed for natural settling the settling kinetics of nps mps with or without ss was analyzed by tracking the concentration changes of nps mps at the water surface in the colorimeter tube while the concentrations of mps or nps in natural waters are estimated to be less than 1 mg l 1 lenz et al 2016 relatively high concentrations of mps nps 10 mg l 1 psnps and 160 mg l 1 pemps were used in our experiments to expedite the experimental observations and facilitate the instrumental analysis or detection for instance the concentration of nps or mps was measured by both the fluorescence spectrophotometer f 4600 hitachi tokyo japan and uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr6000 loveland usa the emission spectra were recorded in the wavelength range of 400 600 nm upon excitation with the wavelength of 388 nm the scanning speed was 1200 nm min 1 and the photomultiplier tube voltage was 700 v the absorption spectra of the collected suspensions were acquired over a wavelength range of 200 800 nm to indicate the decline of suspension turbidity due to the settling process to investigate the effects of electrolyte and natural organic matter nom on the settling kinetics of nps mps different concentrations of nacl 50 200 or 500 mm or and ha 10 20 or 50 mg l 1 was added to the mixed suspension of plastic particle and ss the employed concentrations of nacl and ha in our experiments represent realistic levels in estuaries with salinity or dom transiting from freshwater to seawater pilson 2012 thurman 1985 the nacl concentration in estuaries ranges from a few mm in freshwater up to 500 mm in seawater dong et al 2019 pilson 2012 xu et al 2013 the ha concentration in estuaries may increase from 1 mg l 1 in seawater to 10 mg l 1 in freshwater thomas 1997 thurman 1985 the stock solution of ha 1000 mg l 1 was prepared by dissolving ha powder in di water and adjusting ph to 8 0 with 0 01 m naoh solution the settling ratio r of nps mps as a function of time t h was calculated by eq 1 as an indication of the concentration change of plastics particles due to the settling process 1 r c 0 c t c 0 100 where c 0 is the initial psnp concentration mg l 1 in the suspension c t is the psnp concentration mg l 1 remaining in the supernatant at time t and c t is calculated from a calibration curve between the psnp concentration and fluorescence intensity fig s1 2 3 sem and microscope observation of nano microplastics and suspended sediment interaction after 200 h of settling the samples on the bottom of the reaction suspensions were collected from the suspensions of psnps ss and their mixed suspension in colorimetric tube then a drop of the collected suspension 10 μl was air dried on an aluminum foil coated with gold and observed on a sem at accelerating voltage of 5 kv after 8 months of settling the morphology of pemps on the surface of the mixed suspensions of pemps and small ss were visualized via nikon eclipse ts2 microscope nikon corporation tokyo japan 2 4 fluorescence imaging of nanoplastics with or without suspended sediment liquid samples were taken at different settling times from several depths i e the surface middle or bottom of the water suspensions in colorimetric tube the fluorescence images of psnps were characterized by the same fluorescence microscope at excitation wavelength of 405 nm 2 5 interaction energy calculation by dlvo theory the dlvo theory was used to assess the surface interaction energies between plastic particles and ss for the interaction energies between psnps and large ss a particle plate geometry was employed in the dlvo calculation because psnps diameter of 100 nm behave like small particles that deposit on the surface of large ss diameter of 100 500 μm as shown in the sem images similarly millimeter sized pemps interacting with small ss particles diameter 10 μm can also be viewed as interactions between plate and particle the interaction of psnps psnps was treated as a particle particle geometry a plate plate geometry was used to calculate the interaction energies of pemps pemps detailed calculation processes and equations are provided in section s4 of si 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of nano microplastics and suspended sediment 3 1 1 characterization of nano microplastics fig 1 a and b shows both psnps and pemps are spherical in shape psnps are not uniform in size with diameters ranging from 15 6 4 1 to 92 0 6 8 nm by contrast pemps have a relatively uniform size distribution the averaged diameters of the psnps and pemps were 90 23 nm and 920 61 μm respectively as shown in the size distribution histograms fig s2 of si determined by image j software from the particles in sem images the fluorescence images in fig 1c and d show that both psnps and pemps have bright fluorescence the diameter values were consistent with those provided by the manufacturer fig 1e shows the hydrodynamic particle size distribution of nano microplastics in aqueous suspensions the average hydrodynamic diameters of psnps and pemps were 98 nm and 1277 μm respectively the polydispersivity index value 0 014 for the suspensions of psnps was less than 0 2 which indicated that psnps were stable and well dispersed in water without significant aggregation izquierdo et al 2005 as shown in fig 1f the zeta potentials of psnps in di water are negative in the tested ph range the sulfate groups render the negative charge of psnps lu et al 2018 specifically during the polymerization reaction of styrene sulfate free radicals react with the double bond of a styrene monomer to produce polystyrene chains with high molecular weights lu et al 2018 chain termination occurs when two growing chains react to make a sulfate terminated polymer chain that is located on the surface of psnps lu et al 2018 the zeta potentials of psnps became more negative as ph increased no isoelectric point was observed on psnps within the solution ph range we tested probably because the sulfate group on psnps presents negative charges within a broad range of ph from 2 to 12 gallardo et al 2008 similarly the zeta potential values of pemps were also negative within the ph range of 2 12 to further determine the exact isoelectric points the solution ph must be lower than 2 kirby and hasselbrink 2004 which has no relevance to the environmental conditions in this study 3 1 2 characterization of suspended sediment the sem images in fig 2 a and b shows that the small and large ss have irregular plate shapes and large size variations in water suspensions the average particle diameters of small and large ss from the sem images were 10 9 1 2 and 125 4 5 2 μm respectively and were determined by image j software as shown in fig 2c and d the hydrodynamic diameters of small ss range from 0 4 to 62 2 μm with average diameter of 8 84 μm whereas the hydrodynamic diameters of large ss range from 1 63 to 837 2 μm with average diameter of 105 24 μm fig 2e and f shows that the zeta potential values of small or large ss are all negative with no observed isoelectric points within ph of 2 12 the negative surface charge of ss may be attributed to the organic matters present on the surface of ss including but not limited to carboxylic acid and phenolic functional groups borgnino et al 2006 these functional groups or species are negatively charged in natural waters as reported elsewhere kim and sansalone 2008 zhu et al 2018 3 2 aggregation of large suspended sediment and nanoplastics fig 3 compares the sem images of psnps large ss and their mixture in the presence of 500 mm nacl in row a 10 mg l 1 ha in row b and both nacl and ha in row c psnps in water are stabilized by surface surfactants and aggregation is minor according to the manufacturer the colloidal stability of psnps in water is supported by the results of the dlvo analysis as shown in fig s4a which shows an energy barrier at 5 10 kbt between the interacting psnps when adding 500 mm nacl into the suspension of psnps homoaggregation begins to occur as verified by the sem images in fig 3 and green fluorescence images in fig s6 this was primarily because of the charge neutralization and compression of electrostatic double layer by nacl dong et al 2019 wegner et al 2012 which reduced the repulsive energy barrier between psnps 0 kbt as shown in fig s4a in the presence of 10 mg l 1 ha the interaction energy between psnps was substantially high 20 30 kbt which results in high colloidal stability of psnps images of fig 3b1 and fig s7 also demonstrated that psnps dispersed well in 10 mg l 1 ha solution without significant aggregation ha are negatively charged in the ph range of 3 11 due to the presence of carboxylic acid and phenolic functional groups loosli et al 2013 nps mps may interact with the aromatic structure of ha via π π interactions alimi et al 2018 cai et al 2018 chen et al 2018 the interaction between psnps and ha changes the surface chemistry of psnps chen et al 2018 and enhances negative zeta potential of psnps 30 mv as shown in table s4 therefore the electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance were increased when ha was adsorbed onto the surface of psnps through π π interactions which finally increased the stability of psnps in ha solution alimi et al 2018 cai et al 2018 lu et al 2018 the interaction energy barrier between psnps in 10 mg l 1 ha solution 28 kbt decreased to less than 0 kbt after addition of 500 mg l 1 nacl thus nacl promoted the homoaggregation of psnps in ha solution consequently the aggregates of psnps in the mixture of 10 mg l 1 ha and 500 mm nacl were larger than those in ha solution as compared between parts b1 and c1 in fig 3 as shown in fig 3a2 ss destabilizes and rapidly forms aggregates in 500 mm nacl solution due to the surface charge neutralization and decreased electrostatic repulsion between ss dong et al 2019 wegner et al 2012 in the ha solution the adsorption of ha on the surface of ss improved the electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance between ss which slowed down the aggregation of ss alimi et al 2018 cai et al 2018 lu et al 2018 therefore the particle sizes of ss in nacl solution were larger than those in ha solution in the mixed suspension of ss and psnps psnps adsorbed on the surface of large ss in 500 mm nacl solution fig 3a3 this is consistent with the low interaction energy barrier between 0 kbt psnps and large ss according to the dlvo calculations in fig s4d by contrast a high repulsive energy barrier 300 kbt was established between psnps and large ss in the 10 mg l 1 ha solution due to the above mentioned steric repulsion alimi et al 2018 cai et al 2018 therefore no heteroaggregation occurred between psnps and large ss in ha solution as shown in fig 3b3 similarly adding nacl into the ha solution apparently reduced the interaction energy barrier between psnps and large ss as shown in fig s4f as a result heteroaggregation of psnps and ss was observed in the mixed solution of 10 mg l 1 ha and 500 mm nacl as shown in fig 3c3 and fig s8 3 3 co settling of polystyrene nanoplastics with suspended sediment 3 3 1 effect of nacl concentrations on the settling process fig 4 a shows the settling kinetics of psnps with or without large ss as a function of nacl concentrations in the absence of ss the settling ratios of psnps increased as the nacl concentration increased up to 200 mm because of the formation of psnp homoaggregates in di water only 25 7 of psnps settled after 200 h compared to 55 0 in 50 mm nacl solution after 100 h all psnps settled out from the suspension in 200 or 500 mm nacl solutions the surface charges of psnps became less negative with the increasing nacl concentration due to the charge neutralization and compression of electrostatic double layer table s4 this resulted in weaker electrostatic repulsive forces and faster homoaggregation rates cai et al 2018 drechsler and grundke 2005 which subsequently increased the settling ratio of psnps in nacl solutions fluorescence images in fig s6 confirm that more nps aggregated at higher concentrations of nacl solutions and no psnps remain in the surface of the aqueous suspensions in 200 or 500 mm nacl solutions clearly after settling for 200 h the ps aggregates appeared to be the white floc residing at the bottom of the colorimetric tube with addition of ss the settling ratios of psnps in nacl solutions were significantly improved as verified by the uv vis measurement for the supernatant samples in fig s9 the improved settling ratio was ascribed to the formation of psnps ss aggregates the greenish precipitates in fig s6 previous work has detected high concentration of micro sized plastic foams in the sediment although the density of plastic foams 0 05 0 4 g cm 3 is lower than water primarily due to the adsorption and co settling of plastic foam with suspended sediment song et al 2017 specifically the settling ratio of psnps ss aggregates increased significantly when the nacl concentration increased from 50 mm to 200 mm in the presence of ss almost 100 of psnps settled from water in 200 mm nacl solution after 80 h whereas only 74 8 psnps settled from water in 50 mm nacl solution even after 200 h this highlights the important role of ss in the heteroaggregation and settling process of psnps besseling et al 2017 cai et al 2018 yang et al 2011 no obvious difference in the settling ratios of psnps was observed in 200 or 500 mm nacl solutions with or without addition of ss indicating that above 200 mm the heteroaggregation between psnps and ss may be diffusion controlled and thus the settling behavior became independent of nacl concentrations li et al 2018a 2018b 3 4 effect of humic acid on the settling ratios fig 4b shows in the absence of ss the settling ratios of psnps are 20 6 18 9 or 15 3 in the presence of 10 20 or 50 mg l 1 ha after 200 h respectively which indicates that higher ha concentration slightly decreases the settling ratio correspondingly no obvious precipitates of psnps at the bottom of the colorimetric tube were observed in fig s7 it is plausible that the adsorbed ha on psnps increased the steric repulsion and thus inhibited homoaggregation of psnps alimi et al 2018 cai et al 2018 this speculation is justified by many previous studies that reported ha could retard settling of various colloidal particles such as latex particles c60 carbon nanotubes hematite or titanium dioxide mainly because of the steric hindrance effect chen and elimelech 2008 pelley and tufenkji 2008 after the addition of ss the settling ratio of psnps increased slightly despite of the ha concentrations this should result from the increasing steric hindrance between psnps and ss after surface coating fromation through ha sorption and then decreasing tendency of heteroaggregation according to the dlvo analysis in fig s4 the uv vis spectrometry measurement in fig s10 also confirms retardation effect of ha on the settling processes of psnps 3 4 1 combined effects of nacl and humic acid on the settling ratios fig 4c shows that in the absence of ss the settling ratios of psnps in 10 mg l 1 ha solutions increase from 21 6 to 41 2 when the nacl concentrations increase from 50 to 500 mm similar to the observation above the zeta potentials of psnps became less negative with the increasing concentration of nacl table s4 which resulted in weaker electrostatic repulsion between psnps higher aggregation and settling ratio of psnps dong et al 2019 consistently the heteroaggregation of psnps and ss promoted the settling ratios of psnps from 28 1 to 62 0 because of the heteroaggregation of psnps and ss in the mixture of nacl and ha the ss induced settling ratio improvement of psnps has also been confirmed by the uv vis spectrometry measurement in fig s11 as demonstrated above nacl and ha had opposite influence on the heteroaggregation ratio of psnps and ss therefore the settling ratios of psnps with or without ss were highest in nacl solutions followed by nacl ha mixtures and then ha solutions the settling kinetics of psnps with small ss diameter 10 μm under different conditions have also been investigated fig s12 shows the settling ratios of psnps significantly increase after addition of small ss the effects of nacl and ha on the settling kinetics of psnps after addition of small ss were similar to what we observed after addition of large ss therefore the heteroaggregation of psnps and small ss also enhanced the co settling ratio 3 5 aggregation and settling assessment of polyethylene microplastics with suspended sediment pemps were visible to naked eye and always float on the water surface in nacl solution ha solution or their mixture as shown in fig 5 in the 10 mg l 1 ha solution pemps still aggregated due to the strong hydrophobic attraction cai et al 2018 li et al 2018b despite of the steric hindrance by the surface adsorption by ha cai et al 2018 the homoaggregation of pemps had also been observed in nacl solution with or without ha this is consistent with the low interaction energy barrier between 2 kbt pemps according to the dlvo calculations in fig s5a as shown in fig s5b the repulsive energy between pemps and small ss in all the solutions is substantially high this was consistent with the low extent of surface adsorption of ss 10 μm on the surface of pemps as observed from fig s13 the low pemps small ss heteroaggregation tendency explains why the settling processes of pemps were barely affected by small ss even when the concentration of nacl reached 500 mm no settling of pemps with or without addition of ss occurred after eight months the addition of large ss has minor effect on the settling process of pemps in 500 mm nacl solution 10 mg l 1 ha solution or mixture of 50 mm nacl and 10 mg l 1 ha similarly pemps always float on the water surface with or without large or small ss during our experimental period of eight months under the following water chemical conditions a 50 mm or 200 mm nacl b 20 mg l 1 or 50 mg l 1 ha and c 10 mg l 1 ha and 200 mm nacl 10 mg l 1 ha and 500 mm nacl the results are not provided as they were almost identical to those shown in fig 5 3 6 analysis of the settling mechanisms for nanoplastics and microplastics 3 6 1 analysis of brownian motion and buoyance force of plastic particles to determine the potential influences of brownian motion and buoyancy force on the settling of psnps or pemps the peclet number pe was assessed by eq 2 khaled abdella ahmed et al 2018 kovalchuk and starov 2012 2 p e 2 π δ ρ g r particle 4 3 k b t where δρ is the density difference between the medium liquid ρ medium and psnps pemps ρ particle ps and pe have densities of 1 05 kg dm 3 and 0 96 kg dm 3 respectively the liquid is water with a density of 1 0 kg dm 3 g is the gravity constant 9 81 m s 2 r particle is the average radius of psnps or pemps k b is the boltzmann constant 1 38 10 23 j k 1 and t is the absolute temperature 298 k fig 6 a shows that the values of pe are less than 1 when the diameters of plastics are smaller than c a 1500 nm and 1250 nm for psnps and pemps respectively this indicates that the brownian motion dominates the movement of psnps the buoyancy effect can be ignored by contrast the pemps size is much larger than 1250 nm and the values of pe are always 1 therefore the boyance force results in a permanent floating state of pemps in water whereas the brownian motion effect could be neglected which supports the experimental results in fig 5 3 6 2 heteroaggregation analysis the heteroaggregation rate between psnps and large ss can be analyzed using the smoluchowski s population balance equation zhang 2014 3 d n d t 1 2 α β n 1 n 2 where d n d t is the rate of heteroaggregation between psnps and large ss with number concentrations of n 1 and n 2 α is the collision or attachment efficiency between psnps and large ss and β is the collision frequency since the initial concentrations of psnps and large ss remained the same when varying nacl or ha concentrations only the collision efficiency α was calculated following the reported method fu et al 2018 zhang et al 2012 fig 6b shows that the collision efficiency increases when the nacl concentration increases which causes the heteroaggregation to shift from the reaction limited regime to the diffusion limited regime diffusion limited heteroaggregation perikinetic flocculation occurs when the ionic strength of nacl solution is equal to or greater than the critical coagulation concentration ccc level for the psnps ss system according to our previous study inter particle aggregation will effectively take place only when the brownian kinetic energy of suspended particles exceeds and thus overcome the interaction energy barrier zhang et al 2012 thus when the nacl concentration is above the ccc level the inter particle interaction energy barrier is minimized making the aggregation rate completely depends on the rate of particle diffusion or diffusion limited this explained why similar settling ratios of psnps were observed with or without addition of large ss in 200 and 500 mm nacl solutions that are above the ccc level 200 mm reported in previous works busch et al 1996 jódar reyes et al 2006 the presence of ha clearly reduced α and thus slowed down the heteroaggregation rate which was consistent with the experimental results shown in fig 3 the inhibition for heteroaggregation is because the adsorbed ha clearly creates strong electrostatic repulsion forces and steric stabilization between psnps and large ss alimi et al 2018 cai et al 2018 3 6 3 calculation of the settling velocities of nano microplastics sediment aggregates we conducted the following calculations with hypothesis that ss was considered as a core sphere on which a monolayer of psnps absorbed to form the psnps ss aggregates the assumption of monolayered adsorption of psnps on ss is justified by the fact that psnps electrostatically repel each other according to the dlvo analysis and thus prevent multi layered adsorption we further assume that the psnps ss aggregates followed a type i settling process a discrete particle settling process at least during the initial settling process from the surface water because low concentrations of psnps pemps and ss were employed in our settling experiments the settling velocity v s is calculated under three potential flow conditions laminar transition and turbulent flows as shown in table s6 the corresponding reynolds number re ρ medium v s d plastic sediment μ was also calculated to verify if the employed equations were applicable in section s12 fig 7 shows that the calculated settling velocities of ps ss aggregates change as a function of the sizes of ps and ss as well as re values under three different flow conditions or different re values some common observations are that both v s and re are affected by the diameters of psnps and ss v s and re both decrease as the diameter of psnps increases because the attachment of psnps on ss increases the diameter d plastic sediment of the ps ss aggregate whereas reduces the overall density of the aggregate according to eq s 2 for instance under the laminar flow condition the black square data curve indicates that psnps with diameters less than 16 μm deposit on ss with a diameter of 105 μm the average diameter of large ss used in this study in this condition the v s of the aggregate will decrease with increasing psnp diameter until a negligible level e g 0 005 m s 1 such as brownian motion or buoyancy force may begin to dictate the movement of the aggregate when the diameter of ss is larger than 130 μm both v s and re will increase with decreasing of psnp diameter which may result in the settling of ps ss aggregate in a transition or turbulent flow condition under our experimental condition psnps 100 nm in diameter can deposit onto the surface of large ss mean diameter of 105 μm as indicated by the red star symbol and the heteroaggregate can settle at a terminal settling velocity of 0 010 m s 1 in the laminar flow section as shown in fig 7 for the case of small ss that may deposit onto the surface of large pemps fig s12 shows that the settling velocity for aggregates of pemps and small ss is extremely low 10 5 m s 1 which indicates that the settling process is negligible when the radius of pemps is larger than 1 39 μm the settling velocity becomes zero and pemps will always float which agrees with our experimental results in fig 5 and modeling data in fig 6 the yellow region in fig s14 denotes the settling velocities for heavy plastics such as polytetrafluoroethylene polyvinylidene fluoride and polyvinylchloride that have densities greater than that of water 1 g cm 3 the gray region on the other hand shows the settling velocities for light plastics such as polypropylene and pe that have densities lower than that of water clearly the density of mps significantly affects the settling velocities of plastics ss aggregates 4 conclusions although plastic pollution in marine and freshwater systems has received intensive research there is not yet an in depth understanding of the distribution and fate of psnps pemps in aquatic environments results of this study provide new insight into the role of ss and heteroaggregation settling in the fate and transformation of plastic particles the adsorption of ps plastics particles on large ss will result in the formation of heteroaggregates which can carry and settle psnps down rapidly in water column consequently relatively low abundances of psnps could be found at the water surface which may change their environmental fate for example due to the lack of exposure to sunlight the settled psnps may undergo a long time of decay through microbial degradation or hydrolysis auta et al 2017b paço et al 2017 in other words the bottom sediment and benthic zone of water columns could be a sink for ultra small ps plastic particles which potentially increase the probability of uptake by benthic organisms or benthic suspension feeders and trophic transfer to food webs nakki et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 millimeter sized pemps always float on water surface and surface adsorption of small ss does not cause pemps to settle thus photochemical degradation photolysis weathering process and erosion action could potentially play dominant roles in the transformation of pemps in natural waters consequently the ecological risks of exposure to psnps pemps may vary significantly with different depths of water column due to the presence of nom and high concentration of ss in real estuaries the actual setting may also follow type ii flocculant settling and type iii hindered or zone settling which are worth future investigations interactions with other naturally occurring colloids such as bacteria phytoplankton microalgae and clays may also cause plastic agglomerations and other types of settling processes e g differential settling which certainly deserves further studies to obtain new insight into the environmental fate of plastic particles this calculation permitted relatively simple experimentation and detection of psnps pemps in sandy water using the fluorescence intensity measurement apparently there is a pressing need to develop comprehensive and standardized tools for accurate prediction of transport and stability e g float or sink of plastic particles in complex environmental matrices notes the
