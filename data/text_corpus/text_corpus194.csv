970,surveys of anthropogenic pressures and their effect on river fish communities have rarely been conducted in the eastern mediterranean countries in contrast to the rest of europe an electrofishing dataset of 1586 samples 818 sites was analyzed to investigate human induced pressures on river fish assemblages in greece pressure patterns and pressure impact analysis towards the national fish bioassessment index hefi and its four constituent metrics are depicted at each sampling site 11 anthropogenic pressure variables were assessed and several integrated grouped pressure indices were computed including hydrology morphology connectivity and water quality almost 60 of samples were classified as impacted the most common pressure groups affecting greek rivers were hydrology recorded at 714 45 samples morphology at 692 44 and artificial barriers at 382 24 samples a similar pattern persists among the six investigated freshwater ecoregions in greece the most impacted ecoregions were thrace 76 impacted samples western aegean 67 impacted samples and macedonia thessaly 67 impacted samples lowlands and large rivers displayed higher levels of degradation but water pollution was not recognized as a key stressor in most running waters pressure impact analysis demonstrates that all hefi component metrics insectivorous omnivorous benthivores potamodromous species respond as expected to almost all integrated pressure indices considered as regards a the direction of response and b the response to pressure intensity gradients however the longitudinal connectivity stressor clearly fails to respond towards metrics the findings confirm the usefulness of model based indices using fish assemblage functional metrics as bioassessment tools specific recommendations for refining the tools are provided keywords stressors response lotic indicators functional metrics ecological status 1 introduction human activities have been imposing diverse pressures on the natural environment freshwaters being of paramount interest worldwide rivers are one of the most dynamic and at the same time economically important natural features and have been subjected to numerous human alterations to regulate their physical character and seasonal variation modification of river morphology alterations of water flow regime artificial barriers to natural connectivity and pollution are only few of the human activities degrading lotic environments and their biota in this general context the european water framework directive wfd directive 2000 60 ec enforces member states to collect and maintain information on the type and magnitude of the significant anthropogenic pressures to which the surface water bodies in each river basin district are liable to be subject annex ii wfd as one in the list of prerequisites in order to achieve and maintain at least good ecological status of running waters in europe human alterations of inland water ecosystems have taken place since ancient and medieval times haidvogl 2018 most of them are subjected to at least one anthropogenic pressure or to various imposed pressures acting in concert tockner et al 2009 mediterranean lotic systems are inherently different from cold temperate systems due to climate and flow regimes solheim et al 2019 and they have a long history of human alteration and abuse in a more localized scale bonada and resh 2013 characterize mediterranean rivers as being among the most vulnerable to environmental damage from human activities a similar situation is reported for rivers in greece skoulikidis et al 2018 exploring pressures that affect biota is essential to manage and restore degraded river ecosystems allan et al 2013 kail wolter 2013 allan 2004 compiled some of the principal pressure categories and their mechanism of affecting river ecosystems helfman 2007 sums up the main pressures applied in aquatic ecosystems and the relative implications to fish assemblages however greater knowledge is needed on ecosystems exposure to multiple stressors stressor interactions e g synergistic antagonistic effects and ecosystem sensitivity to stress combinations hering et al 2015 spears et al 2021 furthermore better understanding of pressure impact response for highly integrative biological quality elements bqes such as fish in rivers is required to plan and prioritize policy relevant management actions birk et al 2012 typically selecting appropriate indicators metrics or indices as bioassessment and monitoring tools includes a pressure impact analysis research has strongly focused on testing indicators ability to detect human degradation hering et al 2006 pont et al 2006 ferreira et al 2007 mecher et al 2007 pont et al 2007 logez pont 2011 trautwein et al 2013 unfortunately considerable gaps exist for countries of southeast europe regarding bioassessment methods in general birk et al 2012 and this concerns pressures and their responsiveness to bioassessment indicators in particular economou et al 2016 to our knowledge no study has ever examined this relationship among various pressures and fish assemblages in east mediterranean rivers the objective of this study is to provide insights on human pressures applied in greek rivers along with their response towards fish assemblages as depicted by a widely used fish bioassessment index in greece the hellenic fish index hefi see zogaris et al 2018 in more detail we aim a to identify dominating anthropogenic pressures b to delineate pressure spatial patterns at the national scale c to analyze pressure response towards the component metrics of hefi and finally d to evaluate sensitivity and specificity between various pressure groupings and the ecological status van de bund solimini 2007 assessed by the hefi index ultimately we aim to fill in some of the blanks for the european portrait of anthropogenic pressures schinegger et al 2012 grizzetti et al 2017 and their response towards particular fish based metrics schinegger et al 2013 in eastern mediterranean rivers this regional depiction of pressures from field surveys of greek rivers could contribute towards a nation wide reference thus provide baselines for future comparisons 2 methods greece together with the balkan peninsula stands out as a hotspot for freshwater biodiversity in europe darwall et al 2014 it is characterized by one of the highest degrees of fish endemism in the mediterranean region crivelli 1996 and a high ratio of threatened species freyhof and brooks 2017 barbieri et al 2015 greece is also defined by high fish assemblage heterogeneity reflecting diverse geological and unique biogeographical processes economidis banarescu 1991 vavalidis et al 2019 located in the crossroads of three continents greece s inland waters and its ichthyofauna shows remarkable geographical fragmentation the inland waters of the country have been categorized into eight distinct freshwater ecoregions zogaris economou 2017 within this high heterogeneity of conditions due to the mediterranean climatic zone imposing low summer precipitation and climatic variability the varied human induced pressures act in concert to impose severe stresses on natural inland waters and their biota out of a large dataset from electrofishing field surveys of rivers conducted by the hellenic centre for marine research hcmr between 2002 and 2016 we incorporated 1586 samples belonging to 818 sampling sites fig 1 our full dataset encompasses 106 river basins within six freshwater ecoregions in greece while five river basins are transboundary with neighboring countries of the southern balkans albania north macedonia bulgaria and turkey the dataset comprises environmental habitat anthropogenic pressure and fish assemblage data mainly acquired during summer and late spring samplings following hcmr protocol imbriw hcmr 2013 in brief at each site a representative river reach containing typical fish habitats i e riffle run pool glide was electrofished single pass no stop nets either by wading or from a boat key environmental habitat and pressure parameters were recorded at each site fish sampling and environmental habitat data collection and recordings followed standardized procedures developed during the eu funded research project fame schmutz et al 2007 with some necessary modifications economou et al 2016 tachos et al 2016 accounting for greek rivers 2 1 pressure data and treatment for a selection of 11 common anthropogenic pressures table 1 we scored each pressure at each site according to a gradient of modalities ranging from 1 no impact to 5 strong impact typically most pressure information filled in the sampling protocol forms were binary presence absence of pressure and descriptive stating the pressures affecting a site as identified during survey moreover not all the selected 11 pressure variables were consistently appraised during the field surveys in this study we re evaluated all survey information and relative data including photos and videos for pressures acting beyond the site scale e g barriers reservoirs appropriate information was additionally gathered from google earth images the list of pressure variables was developed based on knowledge of key anthropogenic pressures affecting rivers and the intensity of their impact on fish assemblages see degerman et al 2007 schinegger et al 2012 for relevant references therein it is important to reiterate that pressure scoring focuses specifically on the presumed effects on the ichthyofauna at each survey site this approach methodologically follows the fame fame 2005 and efi consortium 2009 pre classification of pressures a full documentation for scoring criteria and modalities of the assessed pressure variables is presented in annex appendix table a1 for 818 sites 1586 samples all 11 anthropogenic pressure variables were assessed table 1 some pressure variables were scored into three modalities while others into four or five modalities nine pressure variables were assessed at site and two at river segment scale as in the work of the efi consortium 2009 for segment classification all pressure variables were scored bearing in mind the impact related to all fish species at site except for barrier variables which were scored considering only potamodromous fish species table 1 water quality pressure as related to pollution was only visually assessed on site and also considering all available information on pollution affecting the site i e known sources of point or diffuse pollution and any published or unpublished material on pollution affecting the site no or very limited data on eutrophication acidification or toxic substances were available at the time of sampling implying that more information would be needed to accurately score this particular pressure variable in a next step for all samples 1586 three integrated pressure indices were assessed a pressure group indices all single pressure variables were assigned into four pressure group indices connectivity pressure index cpi hydrology pressure index hpi morphology pressure index mpi and water quality pressure index wqpi table 1 all pressure group indices were scored according to their component single pressure variables e g mpi m chann m instr hab m embank m rip veg 4 averaging only pressures with scores 3 schinegger et al 2012 b affected group index agi involving the number of affected pressure groups a pressure group was considered as affected when its score was 3 c global pressure index gpi averaging only affected pressure groups i e gpi cpi hpi mpi wqpi 4 agi 3 efi 2008 schinegger et al 2012 consequently unimpacted or slightly impacted sites all single pressure variables 3 had a zero agi and gpi value agi 0 gpi 0 in addition every sample was classified into a pressure type and named with respect to the agi index affected groups that is for samples with agi 0 none affected group the type name unimpacted was assigned for samples with agi 1 one affected group the type name of the corresponding group was assigned e g mpi for samples with agi 2 two affected groups the type name of the corresponding groups was assigned e g cpi mpi etc in this way every sample in the dataset was assigned with a type name 2 2 fish assemblage data and treatment fish assemblage data consisted of species abundance data for 111 fish species assigned to length classes of 5 cm utilizing fish species trait characterizations presented in zogaris et al 2018 data tables were transformed accordingly to assess hefi s four component trait metrics 1 relative abundance of insectivorous species larger than 100 mm insv 2 relative abundance of omnivorous species smaller than 100 mm omni 3 relative abundance of benthivore smaller than 150mm benth and 4 relative abundance of potamodromous species potad descriptive statistics for fish sampling data and hefi s four component trait metrics are presented in annex appendix table a2 in a second step the hefi model was employed to extract ecological quality ratio values eqr and subsequently the ecological status van de bund solimini 2007 for the fish biological quality element bqe all samples that did not meet the criteria set for the construction of the hefi sampling length 50m sampling area 100m2 see zogaris et al 2018 were excluded from the analysis additionally an expert judgment filter was also applied excluding all samples with absolute abundance below 15 specimens from further analysis considering limitations of the model for poor abundance sites finally out of the 1586 samples 818 sites in the environmental and pressure dataset 914 samples 541 sites were introduced to hefi model 2 3 environmental descriptors key environmental descriptors altitude slope catchment area source altitude mean temperature of january and mean annual temperature were compiled for all 818 sampling sites using gis analysis and climatic data from worldclim http www worldclim org these descriptors except for mean annual temperature apart from describing the physical characteristics of the sites are utilized for the application of the bioassessment model of hefi zogaris et al 2018 in order to apply the model every sample was assigned a regional characterization of the southern balkans biogeographic area by combining south e aegean w aegean ionian and north se adriatic mac thes thrace freshwater ecoregions as compiled zogaris and colleagues 2018 see fig 1 this grouping is based on the fact that there is an overriding ichthyo geographic boundary between north and southern of the balkan peninsula economou et al 2016 zogaris economou 2017 additionally all samples were classified a according to altitude into three altitude groups down stream 100 m mid stream 100 600 m up stream 600 m and b according to catchment area drainage basin assessed from the sampling site into four area groups small 100 km2 medium 100 1 000 km2 large 1 000 10 000 km2 very large 10 000 km2 following the work of van de bund and colleagues 2004 as well as lazaridou and colleagues 2018 classification scheme for mediterranean rives 2 4 pressures metric analysis two main steps assist in exploring pressure impact response a the direction of response i e metric values should increase decrease as expected when a pressure is applied and b the response into pressure intensity gradients i e metric values should increase decrease as expected along pressure intensity analyses of the response between different pressure groupings and the four hefi component metrics insv omni benth potad are displayed using redundancy analysis rda and several descriptive boxplots moreover welch s independent samples t test for significance was performed between boxplot categories all the analysis listed below concerns 914 samples for which the hefi model was applied a a multivariate ordination analysis was applied to detect the direction of the relationship between pressure group indices cpi hpi mpi wqpi and hefi metrics insv omni benth potad the gradient length of the first axis in dca analysis was used for specifying the unimodal or linear response of the data this value was estimated at 2 405 3 indicating a linear response concluding that redundancy analysis rda as the appropriate multivariate regression analysis prior to rda analysis the monte carlo permutation test 499 permutations was used to specify the statistically significant pressure groups that take part in the model p 05 additionally to avoid variables pressure group indices that are correlated thus have no unique contribution to the regression model only those variables with inflation factor 20 was used ter braak smilauer 2002 ultimately no pressure group was excluded since the inflation factor was below 1 5 for each of them b testing the response between the gpi index global pressure index and hefi metrics all samples were assigned as unimpacted gpi 0 or impacted gpi 3 four boxplots display the corresponding metric values a test for significance independent 2 sample t test was applied for all cases between impacted and unimpacted categories c testing the response between the agi index affected group index and hefi metrics all samples were classified as unimpacted no affected group and 1 one affected group 2 two affected group 3 three affected group or 4 four affected group categories according to the agi value four boxplots display the corresponding metric values category 4 was excluded from the analysis since only two samples were classified accordingly a test for significance independent 2 sample t test was applied pairwise among all categories unimpacted 1 unimpacted 2 unimpacted 3 1 2 1 3 2 3 d testing the response between various pressure type combinations and hefi metrics four boxplots display the corresponding metric values involving all possible type combinations e g cpi cpi hpi cpi hpi mpi etc as well as samples with no pressure unimpacted all type combinations with less than 30 samples were excluded from the analysis for statistical reasons ultimately out of 15 possible pressure type combinations only 6 were analyzed a test for significance independent 2 sample t test was applied pairwise among unimpacted samples and all type combinations respectively unimpacted cpi unimpacted mpi unimpacted hpi unimpacted cpi hpi unimpacted mpi hpi unimpacted cpi mpi hpi t test analyses were performed using r software r core team 2020 and rda analysis was performed using canoco see canoco 4 5 for windows ter braak smilauer 2002 2 5 pressure ecological status analysis eu water policy aims to achieve at least good ecological status for all rivers by the year 2027 consequently a theoretical policy relevant boundary between unimpacted high good status and impacted moderate poor bad status is implied therefore insights on sensitivity and specificity between pressures and bioassessment indices exploring this boundary level of site misclassification are crucial for reporting to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity between various pressure groupings with hefi ecological status two contingency tables were created a agi index against hefi ecological status and b various pressure type combinations against hefi ecological status the range of gpi index is also presented in both tables for sensitivity the null hypothesis h0 was set as samples classified as impacted at least one affected group according to various pressure groupings are also assessed as impacted moderate poor bad with hefi that is sensitivity would account for samples correctly classified as impacted conversely for specificity the null hypothesis h0 was set as samples classified as unimpacted no affected group according to various pressure groupings are also assessed as unimpacted high good with hefi therefore specificity would account for samples correctly classified as unimpacted 3 results 3 1 pressures across ecoregions the environmental characteristics for sampling sites in each ecoregion along with those for all ecoregions are presented in table 2 the global pressure index value gpi for unimpacted sites none affected group was zero for samples with one affected group gpi ranged from 3 to 5 for those with two affected groups from 6 to 10 and for samples exhibiting three affected groups from 9 to 14 only two samples belonging in one site were affected by quadruple groups fig 2 a and gpi value for both samples was 14 5 of 1586 samples 945 almost 60 were classified as impacted affected by one or more pressure groups fig 2a specifically 308 samples 19 42 were affected by one pressure group 392 samples 24 72 were affected by two pressure groups 243 samples 15 32 were affected by three pressure groups only two samples 0 13 were affected by four affected groups fig 2a the most common pressure group affecting greek rivers fig 2b was hpi hydrological recorded in 714 samples 45 followed by mpi morphological in 692 samples 44 and cpi connectivity recorded in 382 24 samples fig 2b wqpi water quality was recorded only in 41 2 6 samples since it was only visually assessed on site see methods among ecoregions the same pattern persists with hpi and mpi groups being the most common source of degradation followed by cpi and wpi fig 2d thrace western aegean and macedonia thessaly ecoregions display a high proportion of multiple affected groups fig 2c thrace 76 was the most impacted ecoregion followed by western aegean 67 macedonia thessaly 67 eastern aegean 58 and ionian 48 the only ecoregion with a low pressure profile was southeast adriatic with 19 of samples assessed as impacted the distribution of multiple pressures agi index across all sites is illustrated in fig 3 a in fig 3b and 3c agi index is depicted against altitude and catchment area groups lowland low altitude and near river mouth larger catchment area sites exhibit a higher level of degradation multiple affected groups than sites situated in the mainland higher altitude smaller catchment area that exhibit low levels of degradation 3 2 pressure metric response rda analysis was applied setting pressure group indices cpi hpi mpi wqpi as explanatory variables and metric values insv omni benth potad as response variables fig 4 according to the permutation test monte carlo hydrological pressures hpi morphological pressures mpi and water quality pressure wqpi were highly significant p 01 in contrast connectivity pressures cpi were not statistically significant p 05 the first axis explained 97 8 f ratio 224 78 p value 002 that is almost all the variation in the model the second axes explained 99 6 and all four axes explained 100 f ratio 57 81 p value 002 as expected insectivorous insv benthivore benth and potamodromous potad fish species metrics plot in opposite directions against all pressure groups in contrast with omnivorous omni species that arrange in line with them fig 4 in addition hydrological hpi and morphological mpi pressures are the main variables to explain the four metrics water quality pressure wqpi is statistically significantly attached to the model but the strength of relationship is relatively weak figure 5 illustrates samples classified as unimpacted gpi 0 and impacted gpi 3 towards the four metric values insv omni benth potad for each metric t test showed a statistically high significance p 001 between these two categories rejecting the null hypothesis h0 that the means of the relative categories are equal thus gpi clearly separates impacted from unimpacted sites towards metric values in addition the direction of response to impact distribution of unimpacted vs impacted for each metric is in accordance with what was expected in the metric trends therefore increased pressure degradation makes insectivorous fig 5a benthivore fig 5c and potamodromous fig 5d species to decrease while omnivorous species fig 5b increase supporting the findings of the rda analysis in fig 6 samples classified according to agi index number of affected groups towards the four metric values insv omni benth potad are illustrated category 4 quadruple affected groups was excluded from the analysis since only two samples were classified accordingly a t test was applied pairwise between all pressure groupings for each metric t test exhibited a statistical significance between almost all testing groupings at least p 05 thus rejecting the null hypothesis h0 that the means of the relative categories are equal non significant differences p 05 were assessed only between the categories with two and three affected groups across all metrics as well as between categories with one and two affected groups regarding only potad metric though moving from lower intensity to higher intensity gradients was not statistically significant in all pairwise testing e g from gradient two to gradient three all boxplots exhibit an incremental trend towards impact intensity and are consistent with the expected metric direction trends fig 6 figure 7 depicts samples with various pressure type combinations towards the four metric values insv omni benth potad out of 15 possible type combinations only six met the cut off criteria set 30 samples consequently cpi only connectivity pressures hpi only hydrological pressures mpi only morphological pressures cpi hpi only connectivity and hydrological pressures mpi hpi only morphological and hydrological pressures and cpi mpi hpi only connectivity morphological and hydrological pressures are presented together with samples with no pressure unimpacted a t test was applied pairwise between unimpacted category and all other pressure type categories cpi hpi mpi cpi hpi mpi hpi cpi mpi hpi for each metric the t test exhibited high significance p 001 between all testing groupings except for cpi category thus rejecting the null hypothesis h0 that the means of the relative categories are equal fig 7 in accordance with rda analysis fig 4 connectivity pressures cpi failed to distinguish between unimpacted and impacted sites even more for benth metric cpi exhibited a significant p 01 but unexpected response of increasing values fig 7 rather than decreasing as would be expected 3 3 pressure ecological status sensitivity specificity table 3 presents the affected group index agi and the associated global pressure index values gpi for 913 samples against corresponding hefi ecological status expressed in five ecological status classes high good moderate poor bad only one sample was affected by quadruple pressure groups agi 4 thus this category is not presented sensitivity scores correctly classified as impacted were high for all affected group categories especially for samples exhibiting multiple affected groups for samples with a single affected group sensitivity score was 65 34 while for samples with multiple affected groups sensitivity score increased to 82 20 and 87 27 two and three affected groups respectively suggesting that increased pressure intensity is more accurately reflected in the fish assemblage in addition specificity score correctly classified as unimpacted was also high reaching 74 31 table 4 presents 453 samples affected by the six pressure type combinations analyzed in fig 7 only combinations with 30 samples against corresponding hefi ecological status expressed in five ecological status classes high good moderate poor bad only the sensitivity measure is presented in this case since specificity has no meaning all samples are impacted except for cpi all pressure type combinations exhibit a high percentage of sensitivity in accordance with the findings in fig 7 where all pressure types apart from cpi display a statistically significant difference in relation to unimpacted sites double and triple pressure types cpi hpi mpi hpi cpi mpi hpi exhibit a higher sensitivity score in comparison with single pressure types hpi mpi cpi as showed also in contingency table 3 suggesting a clear response of fish assemblage to pressure intensity gradients moreover since sensitivity scores of multiple pressure types are lower than the sum of their single sensitivity e g h p i m p i h p i m p i an antagonistic interaction between pressure groups analyzed is assumed in contrast cpi exhibits a low sensitivity score in accordance with the previous findings of rda analysis and its response presented in fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 main achievements and limitations of the study the assessment of anthropogenic pressures incorporating standardized electrofishing sampling has been used in broad scale river reviews in europe but east mediterranean countries were not well represented due to data scarcity degerman et al 2007 schinegger et al 2012 schinegger et al 2013 east mediterranean data is also missing in several studies examining fish assemblage indicator response towards various river pressure indices e g pont et al 2006 logez and pont 2011 schinegger et al 2013 trautwein et al 2013 furthermore considerable differences among fish assemblages from the western to eastern mediterranean even at the level of trait compositions makes broad generalizations of fish metric reactions to pressures difficult for this region ferreira et al 2007 therefore a distinct knowledge gap persists with regards to assessing pressure response towards fish assemblages in the eastern mediterranean countries birk et al 2012 schinegger et al 2012 trautwein et al 2013 zogaris et al 2018 this study provides an analysis on aspects of the response between various pressure integrated indices and fish assemblages expressed through the four functional metrics of a national standard bioassessment index the hefi in greece this kind of analysis must be based on data acquired by standardized sampling and pressure inventory methods a streamlined fish sampling routines with extensive datasets and b anthropogenic pressure assessment methods relevant to the local ichthyofauna with standardized scoring criteria and modalities in terms of biotic sampling electrofishing in rivers is considered the best and most cost effective sampling method for standardized bioassessment surveying pressure analyses have also been streamlined in fish based river monitoring due to the application of the eu wfd process degerman et al 2007 zogaris et al 2018 however experience in routinely assessing anthropogenic pressures while sampling for fishes is still sparse in much of southeast europe and the eastern mediterranean countries e g shumka et al 2013 sapounidis et al 2019 grapci kotori et al 2020 two principal questions arise when the response of bioassessment indicators towards degradation are explored a the direction of response and b the response to intensity gradients unquestionably there are inherent uncertainties concerning in between stressors interaction potentially including antagonistic additive synergetic effects hering et al 2015 that is the assessed response of a stressor towards fish assemblages might conceal various interactions with other stressors these potential interactions have not been addressed in the context of this study the need to tackle stressor interactions and the understanding of the in between stressor relationships are crucial for policy relevant research and management and new approaches are being developed to tackle this problem spears et al 2021 hefi was originally designed to comply with the eu wfd and in this way it may not be sensitive to the full array of degradation including aspects concerning biodiversity integrity for example hefi chooses to include alien species since the preponderance of key aliens is rather low in the southern balkan rivers however alien and translocated non indigenous species are becoming an important problem in biodiversity conservation in many types of inland waters sommerwerk et al 2017 koutsikos et al 2019 and this aspect is not expressed as a degradation effect in hefi despite such potential shortfalls our survey provides an initial screening of multiple pressures in a relatively wide area of eastern mediterranean rivers including a wide variety of lotic waters in six freshwater ecoregions 4 2 stressor dominance and patterns the study confirms that multiple pressures are evident in most sampled areas almost 60 of samples were classified as impacted by one 19 4 or multiple 40 2 pressure groups showing that human pressures are widespread across all examined ecoregions additionally a concordance between presence and intensity of pressure degradation against altitude and catchment area groupings was depicted sites at higher altitudes and lower catchment area near headwaters exhibit less degradation than sites at lower altitudes and higher catchment area lowlands the former are typically sites with low population densities and agricultural activities are either absent or fragmented compared to the latter these finding are consistent with trends in the rest of europe schinegger et al 2012 trautwein et al 2013 the most widespread and responsive types of degradation across all ecoregions was hydrological hpi and morphological mpi stressors in the hydrological pressure group water abstraction and hydrograph modification stand as the most common single pressure variables affecting sites as would be expected in an area of seasonally arid conditions and water stressed basins skoulikidis et al 2011 zogaris and economou 2017 in the morphological pressure group riparian vegetation degradation was identified as the most significant single pressure variable as mentioned by other authors at the european scale hering et al 2015 both hydrological and morphological stressors have repeatedly been acknowledged as two of the main impact groups in european running waters schinegger et al 2016 schinegger et al 2012 grizetti et al 2017 carvalho et al 2019 so our results mirror the europe wide reviews even though point source pollutants have decreased in many european countries including greece skoulikidis et al 2018 water pollution still stands as one of the major sources of degradation for european rivers argillier et al 2015 european commission 2015 in our on site visual assessment pollution was recorded in only 2 6 of the samples but not all aspects of water pollution e g eutrophication acidification toxic substances have been incorporated in this study since systematic pollution monitoring data in greece are very recent since 2013 and our data comprise field survey samplings since 2002 therefore at this point we may presume that water pollution assessed primarily through on site visual recordings is not a key stressor for most running waters in greece we hypothesize that this is due to various reasons including the steep gradient of most lotic environments in greece effectively dispersing pollution affects many river systems in greece also exhibit self cleansing capacity due to local relief and the rather low number of large settlements or industrial zones chaztinikolaou lazaridou 2007 moreover there is a highly seasonal variability of pollution reflecting mostly agricultural sources of nutrient enrichment in contrast to the more permanent sources originating from heavy industry which is extremely localized in greece stefanidis et al 2020 despite remarkable spatio temporal variability there is a strong need to address pollution stressors in a more thorough way karaouzas et al 2018 4 3 fish assemblage s response to ecosystem degradation the direction of response of fish functional metrics towards human degradation has been explored in various studies across europe e g pont et al 2006 melcher et al 2007 noble et al 2007 furthermore during the development of hefi expected metric responses have been depicted tachos et al 2016 zogaris et al 2018 but not statistically tested the current study confirms that all hefi component functional metrics relative abundance of insectivorous omnivorous benthivore and potamodromous species respond significantly t test p 001 towards the expected direction against all pressure groupings namely hydrological index morphological index water quality index global pressure index affected group index pressure type combinations except for connectivity thus insectivorous benthivore and potamodromous fish species significantly decrease towards increased pressures in contrast with omnivorous species that significantly increase in addition with regards to the response towards impact intensity gradients a clear trend is depicted in the study decreasing metrics exhibit significantly lower values and conversely increasing metrics exhibit significantly higher values towards pressure intensity additional affected groups the same outcome is revealed for hefi index ecological status where additional affected groups or additional pressure type combinations leads to greater sensitivity samples correctly classified as impacted in the context of this study several implications can be made regarding the level of site misclassification of unimpacted none affected group and impacted at least one affected group sites but three are the main findings a misclassification of unimpacted samples specificity is low and notably misclassified samples are typically assessed by the hefi model as in moderate status rather than poor or bad status b low levels of degradation makes the bioassessment model hefi more susceptible to wrong predictions samples with one affected group agi 1 exhibit considerably lower sensitivity than those with multiple affected groups agi 2 or 3 and c an antagonistic interaction between pressure groups analyzed cpi hpi mpi is assumed since their combined impact sensitivity score assessed is less than the sum of their independent effects jackson et al 2016 we identified an important discrepancy as regards the assessment of the connectivity degradation cpi though recorded in nearly a quarter of the samples 24 no hefi metric responded towards the expected direction t test p 05 not even for potamodromous species that are strongly migratory along the longitudinal axes of rivers sensitivity score for sites impacted only from cpi was also particularly low furthermore benthivore species exhibited a significant t test p 01 but unexpected increase of values for sites impacted only from the connectivity stressor this discrepancy has also been recorded in other studies e g degerman et al 2007 but largely goes against our collective knowledge of the profound impact of barriers in the mediterranean dams have been associated as one of the most important perturbations for rivers throughout europe and the mediterranean countries e g clavero et al 2004 zogaris et al 2012 we can only postulate that barriers especially in water stressed conditions may increase water depth and provide refugia during low flow periods thus locally becoming beneficial to fish communities in this context it is important to note that most barriers in greece account for very low barriers e g river fords and the like unlike much of western europe and many other mediterranean countries greece has relatively few large dams mentzafou et al 2019 and a rather low numbers of alien species originating from artificial lentic waters in its lotic water environments koutsikos et al 2019 5 conclusions and outlook on future research we encourage bioassessment practitioners managers and conservationists to take special care when analyzing and interpreting fish based metric responses to pressures since the biota such as fish may yield complex ecological responses to perturbations birk et al 2020 we encourage the use of on site pressure assessment also backed by desk study methods as utilized in bioassessment index development and monitoring surveys during the last two decades in europe considerations should be given not only to single pressures but also to specific pressure combinations in order to address planning and prioritization of research conservation and restoration requirements more detailed studies on the combined impact of stressor combinations on fish communities are needed e g antagonistic synergetic additive effects especially in endemic rich areas and naturally depauperate fish communities such as in the eastern mediterranean region our review provides the following recommendations fish based pressure assessment approaches promoting the gpi global pressure and agi affected group integrated indices as standard tools for expressing anthropogenic degradation are obviously important for bioassessment metrics and index development as well as for monitoring in the eastern mediterranean region just like in the rest of europe though we are aware of the loss of pressure related information by reducing dimensions from single pressure variables to an integrated index we understand the need to promote comparable pressure indices for use among broad european regions in terms of comparing and intercallibrating indices monitoring trends and for reporting we confirm the unmet need to address water quality water pollution and connectivity stressors in greece s fish based bioassessment approach although it is well known that fish may respond in various ways to nutrient pollution and to barriers these two stressors excibited a poor ability to track responses of the fish community in our dataset we suggest pressure impact and pressure interaction analysis towards a larger number of functional fish assemblage metrics in order to comprehend how single and multiple pressures affect structural elements of fish communities we urge investigation into specific river types since hefi is a model based index site specific index transcending river typology this requires further exploring reference condition baselines especially for

970,surveys of anthropogenic pressures and their effect on river fish communities have rarely been conducted in the eastern mediterranean countries in contrast to the rest of europe an electrofishing dataset of 1586 samples 818 sites was analyzed to investigate human induced pressures on river fish assemblages in greece pressure patterns and pressure impact analysis towards the national fish bioassessment index hefi and its four constituent metrics are depicted at each sampling site 11 anthropogenic pressure variables were assessed and several integrated grouped pressure indices were computed including hydrology morphology connectivity and water quality almost 60 of samples were classified as impacted the most common pressure groups affecting greek rivers were hydrology recorded at 714 45 samples morphology at 692 44 and artificial barriers at 382 24 samples a similar pattern persists among the six investigated freshwater ecoregions in greece the most impacted ecoregions were thrace 76 impacted samples western aegean 67 impacted samples and macedonia thessaly 67 impacted samples lowlands and large rivers displayed higher levels of degradation but water pollution was not recognized as a key stressor in most running waters pressure impact analysis demonstrates that all hefi component metrics insectivorous omnivorous benthivores potamodromous species respond as expected to almost all integrated pressure indices considered as regards a the direction of response and b the response to pressure intensity gradients however the longitudinal connectivity stressor clearly fails to respond towards metrics the findings confirm the usefulness of model based indices using fish assemblage functional metrics as bioassessment tools specific recommendations for refining the tools are provided keywords stressors response lotic indicators functional metrics ecological status 1 introduction human activities have been imposing diverse pressures on the natural environment freshwaters being of paramount interest worldwide rivers are one of the most dynamic and at the same time economically important natural features and have been subjected to numerous human alterations to regulate their physical character and seasonal variation modification of river morphology alterations of water flow regime artificial barriers to natural connectivity and pollution are only few of the human activities degrading lotic environments and their biota in this general context the european water framework directive wfd directive 2000 60 ec enforces member states to collect and maintain information on the type and magnitude of the significant anthropogenic pressures to which the surface water bodies in each river basin district are liable to be subject annex ii wfd as one in the list of prerequisites in order to achieve and maintain at least good ecological status of running waters in europe human alterations of inland water ecosystems have taken place since ancient and medieval times haidvogl 2018 most of them are subjected to at least one anthropogenic pressure or to various imposed pressures acting in concert tockner et al 2009 mediterranean lotic systems are inherently different from cold temperate systems due to climate and flow regimes solheim et al 2019 and they have a long history of human alteration and abuse in a more localized scale bonada and resh 2013 characterize mediterranean rivers as being among the most vulnerable to environmental damage from human activities a similar situation is reported for rivers in greece skoulikidis et al 2018 exploring pressures that affect biota is essential to manage and restore degraded river ecosystems allan et al 2013 kail wolter 2013 allan 2004 compiled some of the principal pressure categories and their mechanism of affecting river ecosystems helfman 2007 sums up the main pressures applied in aquatic ecosystems and the relative implications to fish assemblages however greater knowledge is needed on ecosystems exposure to multiple stressors stressor interactions e g synergistic antagonistic effects and ecosystem sensitivity to stress combinations hering et al 2015 spears et al 2021 furthermore better understanding of pressure impact response for highly integrative biological quality elements bqes such as fish in rivers is required to plan and prioritize policy relevant management actions birk et al 2012 typically selecting appropriate indicators metrics or indices as bioassessment and monitoring tools includes a pressure impact analysis research has strongly focused on testing indicators ability to detect human degradation hering et al 2006 pont et al 2006 ferreira et al 2007 mecher et al 2007 pont et al 2007 logez pont 2011 trautwein et al 2013 unfortunately considerable gaps exist for countries of southeast europe regarding bioassessment methods in general birk et al 2012 and this concerns pressures and their responsiveness to bioassessment indicators in particular economou et al 2016 to our knowledge no study has ever examined this relationship among various pressures and fish assemblages in east mediterranean rivers the objective of this study is to provide insights on human pressures applied in greek rivers along with their response towards fish assemblages as depicted by a widely used fish bioassessment index in greece the hellenic fish index hefi see zogaris et al 2018 in more detail we aim a to identify dominating anthropogenic pressures b to delineate pressure spatial patterns at the national scale c to analyze pressure response towards the component metrics of hefi and finally d to evaluate sensitivity and specificity between various pressure groupings and the ecological status van de bund solimini 2007 assessed by the hefi index ultimately we aim to fill in some of the blanks for the european portrait of anthropogenic pressures schinegger et al 2012 grizzetti et al 2017 and their response towards particular fish based metrics schinegger et al 2013 in eastern mediterranean rivers this regional depiction of pressures from field surveys of greek rivers could contribute towards a nation wide reference thus provide baselines for future comparisons 2 methods greece together with the balkan peninsula stands out as a hotspot for freshwater biodiversity in europe darwall et al 2014 it is characterized by one of the highest degrees of fish endemism in the mediterranean region crivelli 1996 and a high ratio of threatened species freyhof and brooks 2017 barbieri et al 2015 greece is also defined by high fish assemblage heterogeneity reflecting diverse geological and unique biogeographical processes economidis banarescu 1991 vavalidis et al 2019 located in the crossroads of three continents greece s inland waters and its ichthyofauna shows remarkable geographical fragmentation the inland waters of the country have been categorized into eight distinct freshwater ecoregions zogaris economou 2017 within this high heterogeneity of conditions due to the mediterranean climatic zone imposing low summer precipitation and climatic variability the varied human induced pressures act in concert to impose severe stresses on natural inland waters and their biota out of a large dataset from electrofishing field surveys of rivers conducted by the hellenic centre for marine research hcmr between 2002 and 2016 we incorporated 1586 samples belonging to 818 sampling sites fig 1 our full dataset encompasses 106 river basins within six freshwater ecoregions in greece while five river basins are transboundary with neighboring countries of the southern balkans albania north macedonia bulgaria and turkey the dataset comprises environmental habitat anthropogenic pressure and fish assemblage data mainly acquired during summer and late spring samplings following hcmr protocol imbriw hcmr 2013 in brief at each site a representative river reach containing typical fish habitats i e riffle run pool glide was electrofished single pass no stop nets either by wading or from a boat key environmental habitat and pressure parameters were recorded at each site fish sampling and environmental habitat data collection and recordings followed standardized procedures developed during the eu funded research project fame schmutz et al 2007 with some necessary modifications economou et al 2016 tachos et al 2016 accounting for greek rivers 2 1 pressure data and treatment for a selection of 11 common anthropogenic pressures table 1 we scored each pressure at each site according to a gradient of modalities ranging from 1 no impact to 5 strong impact typically most pressure information filled in the sampling protocol forms were binary presence absence of pressure and descriptive stating the pressures affecting a site as identified during survey moreover not all the selected 11 pressure variables were consistently appraised during the field surveys in this study we re evaluated all survey information and relative data including photos and videos for pressures acting beyond the site scale e g barriers reservoirs appropriate information was additionally gathered from google earth images the list of pressure variables was developed based on knowledge of key anthropogenic pressures affecting rivers and the intensity of their impact on fish assemblages see degerman et al 2007 schinegger et al 2012 for relevant references therein it is important to reiterate that pressure scoring focuses specifically on the presumed effects on the ichthyofauna at each survey site this approach methodologically follows the fame fame 2005 and efi consortium 2009 pre classification of pressures a full documentation for scoring criteria and modalities of the assessed pressure variables is presented in annex appendix table a1 for 818 sites 1586 samples all 11 anthropogenic pressure variables were assessed table 1 some pressure variables were scored into three modalities while others into four or five modalities nine pressure variables were assessed at site and two at river segment scale as in the work of the efi consortium 2009 for segment classification all pressure variables were scored bearing in mind the impact related to all fish species at site except for barrier variables which were scored considering only potamodromous fish species table 1 water quality pressure as related to pollution was only visually assessed on site and also considering all available information on pollution affecting the site i e known sources of point or diffuse pollution and any published or unpublished material on pollution affecting the site no or very limited data on eutrophication acidification or toxic substances were available at the time of sampling implying that more information would be needed to accurately score this particular pressure variable in a next step for all samples 1586 three integrated pressure indices were assessed a pressure group indices all single pressure variables were assigned into four pressure group indices connectivity pressure index cpi hydrology pressure index hpi morphology pressure index mpi and water quality pressure index wqpi table 1 all pressure group indices were scored according to their component single pressure variables e g mpi m chann m instr hab m embank m rip veg 4 averaging only pressures with scores 3 schinegger et al 2012 b affected group index agi involving the number of affected pressure groups a pressure group was considered as affected when its score was 3 c global pressure index gpi averaging only affected pressure groups i e gpi cpi hpi mpi wqpi 4 agi 3 efi 2008 schinegger et al 2012 consequently unimpacted or slightly impacted sites all single pressure variables 3 had a zero agi and gpi value agi 0 gpi 0 in addition every sample was classified into a pressure type and named with respect to the agi index affected groups that is for samples with agi 0 none affected group the type name unimpacted was assigned for samples with agi 1 one affected group the type name of the corresponding group was assigned e g mpi for samples with agi 2 two affected groups the type name of the corresponding groups was assigned e g cpi mpi etc in this way every sample in the dataset was assigned with a type name 2 2 fish assemblage data and treatment fish assemblage data consisted of species abundance data for 111 fish species assigned to length classes of 5 cm utilizing fish species trait characterizations presented in zogaris et al 2018 data tables were transformed accordingly to assess hefi s four component trait metrics 1 relative abundance of insectivorous species larger than 100 mm insv 2 relative abundance of omnivorous species smaller than 100 mm omni 3 relative abundance of benthivore smaller than 150mm benth and 4 relative abundance of potamodromous species potad descriptive statistics for fish sampling data and hefi s four component trait metrics are presented in annex appendix table a2 in a second step the hefi model was employed to extract ecological quality ratio values eqr and subsequently the ecological status van de bund solimini 2007 for the fish biological quality element bqe all samples that did not meet the criteria set for the construction of the hefi sampling length 50m sampling area 100m2 see zogaris et al 2018 were excluded from the analysis additionally an expert judgment filter was also applied excluding all samples with absolute abundance below 15 specimens from further analysis considering limitations of the model for poor abundance sites finally out of the 1586 samples 818 sites in the environmental and pressure dataset 914 samples 541 sites were introduced to hefi model 2 3 environmental descriptors key environmental descriptors altitude slope catchment area source altitude mean temperature of january and mean annual temperature were compiled for all 818 sampling sites using gis analysis and climatic data from worldclim http www worldclim org these descriptors except for mean annual temperature apart from describing the physical characteristics of the sites are utilized for the application of the bioassessment model of hefi zogaris et al 2018 in order to apply the model every sample was assigned a regional characterization of the southern balkans biogeographic area by combining south e aegean w aegean ionian and north se adriatic mac thes thrace freshwater ecoregions as compiled zogaris and colleagues 2018 see fig 1 this grouping is based on the fact that there is an overriding ichthyo geographic boundary between north and southern of the balkan peninsula economou et al 2016 zogaris economou 2017 additionally all samples were classified a according to altitude into three altitude groups down stream 100 m mid stream 100 600 m up stream 600 m and b according to catchment area drainage basin assessed from the sampling site into four area groups small 100 km2 medium 100 1 000 km2 large 1 000 10 000 km2 very large 10 000 km2 following the work of van de bund and colleagues 2004 as well as lazaridou and colleagues 2018 classification scheme for mediterranean rives 2 4 pressures metric analysis two main steps assist in exploring pressure impact response a the direction of response i e metric values should increase decrease as expected when a pressure is applied and b the response into pressure intensity gradients i e metric values should increase decrease as expected along pressure intensity analyses of the response between different pressure groupings and the four hefi component metrics insv omni benth potad are displayed using redundancy analysis rda and several descriptive boxplots moreover welch s independent samples t test for significance was performed between boxplot categories all the analysis listed below concerns 914 samples for which the hefi model was applied a a multivariate ordination analysis was applied to detect the direction of the relationship between pressure group indices cpi hpi mpi wqpi and hefi metrics insv omni benth potad the gradient length of the first axis in dca analysis was used for specifying the unimodal or linear response of the data this value was estimated at 2 405 3 indicating a linear response concluding that redundancy analysis rda as the appropriate multivariate regression analysis prior to rda analysis the monte carlo permutation test 499 permutations was used to specify the statistically significant pressure groups that take part in the model p 05 additionally to avoid variables pressure group indices that are correlated thus have no unique contribution to the regression model only those variables with inflation factor 20 was used ter braak smilauer 2002 ultimately no pressure group was excluded since the inflation factor was below 1 5 for each of them b testing the response between the gpi index global pressure index and hefi metrics all samples were assigned as unimpacted gpi 0 or impacted gpi 3 four boxplots display the corresponding metric values a test for significance independent 2 sample t test was applied for all cases between impacted and unimpacted categories c testing the response between the agi index affected group index and hefi metrics all samples were classified as unimpacted no affected group and 1 one affected group 2 two affected group 3 three affected group or 4 four affected group categories according to the agi value four boxplots display the corresponding metric values category 4 was excluded from the analysis since only two samples were classified accordingly a test for significance independent 2 sample t test was applied pairwise among all categories unimpacted 1 unimpacted 2 unimpacted 3 1 2 1 3 2 3 d testing the response between various pressure type combinations and hefi metrics four boxplots display the corresponding metric values involving all possible type combinations e g cpi cpi hpi cpi hpi mpi etc as well as samples with no pressure unimpacted all type combinations with less than 30 samples were excluded from the analysis for statistical reasons ultimately out of 15 possible pressure type combinations only 6 were analyzed a test for significance independent 2 sample t test was applied pairwise among unimpacted samples and all type combinations respectively unimpacted cpi unimpacted mpi unimpacted hpi unimpacted cpi hpi unimpacted mpi hpi unimpacted cpi mpi hpi t test analyses were performed using r software r core team 2020 and rda analysis was performed using canoco see canoco 4 5 for windows ter braak smilauer 2002 2 5 pressure ecological status analysis eu water policy aims to achieve at least good ecological status for all rivers by the year 2027 consequently a theoretical policy relevant boundary between unimpacted high good status and impacted moderate poor bad status is implied therefore insights on sensitivity and specificity between pressures and bioassessment indices exploring this boundary level of site misclassification are crucial for reporting to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity between various pressure groupings with hefi ecological status two contingency tables were created a agi index against hefi ecological status and b various pressure type combinations against hefi ecological status the range of gpi index is also presented in both tables for sensitivity the null hypothesis h0 was set as samples classified as impacted at least one affected group according to various pressure groupings are also assessed as impacted moderate poor bad with hefi that is sensitivity would account for samples correctly classified as impacted conversely for specificity the null hypothesis h0 was set as samples classified as unimpacted no affected group according to various pressure groupings are also assessed as unimpacted high good with hefi therefore specificity would account for samples correctly classified as unimpacted 3 results 3 1 pressures across ecoregions the environmental characteristics for sampling sites in each ecoregion along with those for all ecoregions are presented in table 2 the global pressure index value gpi for unimpacted sites none affected group was zero for samples with one affected group gpi ranged from 3 to 5 for those with two affected groups from 6 to 10 and for samples exhibiting three affected groups from 9 to 14 only two samples belonging in one site were affected by quadruple groups fig 2 a and gpi value for both samples was 14 5 of 1586 samples 945 almost 60 were classified as impacted affected by one or more pressure groups fig 2a specifically 308 samples 19 42 were affected by one pressure group 392 samples 24 72 were affected by two pressure groups 243 samples 15 32 were affected by three pressure groups only two samples 0 13 were affected by four affected groups fig 2a the most common pressure group affecting greek rivers fig 2b was hpi hydrological recorded in 714 samples 45 followed by mpi morphological in 692 samples 44 and cpi connectivity recorded in 382 24 samples fig 2b wqpi water quality was recorded only in 41 2 6 samples since it was only visually assessed on site see methods among ecoregions the same pattern persists with hpi and mpi groups being the most common source of degradation followed by cpi and wpi fig 2d thrace western aegean and macedonia thessaly ecoregions display a high proportion of multiple affected groups fig 2c thrace 76 was the most impacted ecoregion followed by western aegean 67 macedonia thessaly 67 eastern aegean 58 and ionian 48 the only ecoregion with a low pressure profile was southeast adriatic with 19 of samples assessed as impacted the distribution of multiple pressures agi index across all sites is illustrated in fig 3 a in fig 3b and 3c agi index is depicted against altitude and catchment area groups lowland low altitude and near river mouth larger catchment area sites exhibit a higher level of degradation multiple affected groups than sites situated in the mainland higher altitude smaller catchment area that exhibit low levels of degradation 3 2 pressure metric response rda analysis was applied setting pressure group indices cpi hpi mpi wqpi as explanatory variables and metric values insv omni benth potad as response variables fig 4 according to the permutation test monte carlo hydrological pressures hpi morphological pressures mpi and water quality pressure wqpi were highly significant p 01 in contrast connectivity pressures cpi were not statistically significant p 05 the first axis explained 97 8 f ratio 224 78 p value 002 that is almost all the variation in the model the second axes explained 99 6 and all four axes explained 100 f ratio 57 81 p value 002 as expected insectivorous insv benthivore benth and potamodromous potad fish species metrics plot in opposite directions against all pressure groups in contrast with omnivorous omni species that arrange in line with them fig 4 in addition hydrological hpi and morphological mpi pressures are the main variables to explain the four metrics water quality pressure wqpi is statistically significantly attached to the model but the strength of relationship is relatively weak figure 5 illustrates samples classified as unimpacted gpi 0 and impacted gpi 3 towards the four metric values insv omni benth potad for each metric t test showed a statistically high significance p 001 between these two categories rejecting the null hypothesis h0 that the means of the relative categories are equal thus gpi clearly separates impacted from unimpacted sites towards metric values in addition the direction of response to impact distribution of unimpacted vs impacted for each metric is in accordance with what was expected in the metric trends therefore increased pressure degradation makes insectivorous fig 5a benthivore fig 5c and potamodromous fig 5d species to decrease while omnivorous species fig 5b increase supporting the findings of the rda analysis in fig 6 samples classified according to agi index number of affected groups towards the four metric values insv omni benth potad are illustrated category 4 quadruple affected groups was excluded from the analysis since only two samples were classified accordingly a t test was applied pairwise between all pressure groupings for each metric t test exhibited a statistical significance between almost all testing groupings at least p 05 thus rejecting the null hypothesis h0 that the means of the relative categories are equal non significant differences p 05 were assessed only between the categories with two and three affected groups across all metrics as well as between categories with one and two affected groups regarding only potad metric though moving from lower intensity to higher intensity gradients was not statistically significant in all pairwise testing e g from gradient two to gradient three all boxplots exhibit an incremental trend towards impact intensity and are consistent with the expected metric direction trends fig 6 figure 7 depicts samples with various pressure type combinations towards the four metric values insv omni benth potad out of 15 possible type combinations only six met the cut off criteria set 30 samples consequently cpi only connectivity pressures hpi only hydrological pressures mpi only morphological pressures cpi hpi only connectivity and hydrological pressures mpi hpi only morphological and hydrological pressures and cpi mpi hpi only connectivity morphological and hydrological pressures are presented together with samples with no pressure unimpacted a t test was applied pairwise between unimpacted category and all other pressure type categories cpi hpi mpi cpi hpi mpi hpi cpi mpi hpi for each metric the t test exhibited high significance p 001 between all testing groupings except for cpi category thus rejecting the null hypothesis h0 that the means of the relative categories are equal fig 7 in accordance with rda analysis fig 4 connectivity pressures cpi failed to distinguish between unimpacted and impacted sites even more for benth metric cpi exhibited a significant p 01 but unexpected response of increasing values fig 7 rather than decreasing as would be expected 3 3 pressure ecological status sensitivity specificity table 3 presents the affected group index agi and the associated global pressure index values gpi for 913 samples against corresponding hefi ecological status expressed in five ecological status classes high good moderate poor bad only one sample was affected by quadruple pressure groups agi 4 thus this category is not presented sensitivity scores correctly classified as impacted were high for all affected group categories especially for samples exhibiting multiple affected groups for samples with a single affected group sensitivity score was 65 34 while for samples with multiple affected groups sensitivity score increased to 82 20 and 87 27 two and three affected groups respectively suggesting that increased pressure intensity is more accurately reflected in the fish assemblage in addition specificity score correctly classified as unimpacted was also high reaching 74 31 table 4 presents 453 samples affected by the six pressure type combinations analyzed in fig 7 only combinations with 30 samples against corresponding hefi ecological status expressed in five ecological status classes high good moderate poor bad only the sensitivity measure is presented in this case since specificity has no meaning all samples are impacted except for cpi all pressure type combinations exhibit a high percentage of sensitivity in accordance with the findings in fig 7 where all pressure types apart from cpi display a statistically significant difference in relation to unimpacted sites double and triple pressure types cpi hpi mpi hpi cpi mpi hpi exhibit a higher sensitivity score in comparison with single pressure types hpi mpi cpi as showed also in contingency table 3 suggesting a clear response of fish assemblage to pressure intensity gradients moreover since sensitivity scores of multiple pressure types are lower than the sum of their single sensitivity e g h p i m p i h p i m p i an antagonistic interaction between pressure groups analyzed is assumed in contrast cpi exhibits a low sensitivity score in accordance with the previous findings of rda analysis and its response presented in fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 main achievements and limitations of the study the assessment of anthropogenic pressures incorporating standardized electrofishing sampling has been used in broad scale river reviews in europe but east mediterranean countries were not well represented due to data scarcity degerman et al 2007 schinegger et al 2012 schinegger et al 2013 east mediterranean data is also missing in several studies examining fish assemblage indicator response towards various river pressure indices e g pont et al 2006 logez and pont 2011 schinegger et al 2013 trautwein et al 2013 furthermore considerable differences among fish assemblages from the western to eastern mediterranean even at the level of trait compositions makes broad generalizations of fish metric reactions to pressures difficult for this region ferreira et al 2007 therefore a distinct knowledge gap persists with regards to assessing pressure response towards fish assemblages in the eastern mediterranean countries birk et al 2012 schinegger et al 2012 trautwein et al 2013 zogaris et al 2018 this study provides an analysis on aspects of the response between various pressure integrated indices and fish assemblages expressed through the four functional metrics of a national standard bioassessment index the hefi in greece this kind of analysis must be based on data acquired by standardized sampling and pressure inventory methods a streamlined fish sampling routines with extensive datasets and b anthropogenic pressure assessment methods relevant to the local ichthyofauna with standardized scoring criteria and modalities in terms of biotic sampling electrofishing in rivers is considered the best and most cost effective sampling method for standardized bioassessment surveying pressure analyses have also been streamlined in fish based river monitoring due to the application of the eu wfd process degerman et al 2007 zogaris et al 2018 however experience in routinely assessing anthropogenic pressures while sampling for fishes is still sparse in much of southeast europe and the eastern mediterranean countries e g shumka et al 2013 sapounidis et al 2019 grapci kotori et al 2020 two principal questions arise when the response of bioassessment indicators towards degradation are explored a the direction of response and b the response to intensity gradients unquestionably there are inherent uncertainties concerning in between stressors interaction potentially including antagonistic additive synergetic effects hering et al 2015 that is the assessed response of a stressor towards fish assemblages might conceal various interactions with other stressors these potential interactions have not been addressed in the context of this study the need to tackle stressor interactions and the understanding of the in between stressor relationships are crucial for policy relevant research and management and new approaches are being developed to tackle this problem spears et al 2021 hefi was originally designed to comply with the eu wfd and in this way it may not be sensitive to the full array of degradation including aspects concerning biodiversity integrity for example hefi chooses to include alien species since the preponderance of key aliens is rather low in the southern balkan rivers however alien and translocated non indigenous species are becoming an important problem in biodiversity conservation in many types of inland waters sommerwerk et al 2017 koutsikos et al 2019 and this aspect is not expressed as a degradation effect in hefi despite such potential shortfalls our survey provides an initial screening of multiple pressures in a relatively wide area of eastern mediterranean rivers including a wide variety of lotic waters in six freshwater ecoregions 4 2 stressor dominance and patterns the study confirms that multiple pressures are evident in most sampled areas almost 60 of samples were classified as impacted by one 19 4 or multiple 40 2 pressure groups showing that human pressures are widespread across all examined ecoregions additionally a concordance between presence and intensity of pressure degradation against altitude and catchment area groupings was depicted sites at higher altitudes and lower catchment area near headwaters exhibit less degradation than sites at lower altitudes and higher catchment area lowlands the former are typically sites with low population densities and agricultural activities are either absent or fragmented compared to the latter these finding are consistent with trends in the rest of europe schinegger et al 2012 trautwein et al 2013 the most widespread and responsive types of degradation across all ecoregions was hydrological hpi and morphological mpi stressors in the hydrological pressure group water abstraction and hydrograph modification stand as the most common single pressure variables affecting sites as would be expected in an area of seasonally arid conditions and water stressed basins skoulikidis et al 2011 zogaris and economou 2017 in the morphological pressure group riparian vegetation degradation was identified as the most significant single pressure variable as mentioned by other authors at the european scale hering et al 2015 both hydrological and morphological stressors have repeatedly been acknowledged as two of the main impact groups in european running waters schinegger et al 2016 schinegger et al 2012 grizetti et al 2017 carvalho et al 2019 so our results mirror the europe wide reviews even though point source pollutants have decreased in many european countries including greece skoulikidis et al 2018 water pollution still stands as one of the major sources of degradation for european rivers argillier et al 2015 european commission 2015 in our on site visual assessment pollution was recorded in only 2 6 of the samples but not all aspects of water pollution e g eutrophication acidification toxic substances have been incorporated in this study since systematic pollution monitoring data in greece are very recent since 2013 and our data comprise field survey samplings since 2002 therefore at this point we may presume that water pollution assessed primarily through on site visual recordings is not a key stressor for most running waters in greece we hypothesize that this is due to various reasons including the steep gradient of most lotic environments in greece effectively dispersing pollution affects many river systems in greece also exhibit self cleansing capacity due to local relief and the rather low number of large settlements or industrial zones chaztinikolaou lazaridou 2007 moreover there is a highly seasonal variability of pollution reflecting mostly agricultural sources of nutrient enrichment in contrast to the more permanent sources originating from heavy industry which is extremely localized in greece stefanidis et al 2020 despite remarkable spatio temporal variability there is a strong need to address pollution stressors in a more thorough way karaouzas et al 2018 4 3 fish assemblage s response to ecosystem degradation the direction of response of fish functional metrics towards human degradation has been explored in various studies across europe e g pont et al 2006 melcher et al 2007 noble et al 2007 furthermore during the development of hefi expected metric responses have been depicted tachos et al 2016 zogaris et al 2018 but not statistically tested the current study confirms that all hefi component functional metrics relative abundance of insectivorous omnivorous benthivore and potamodromous species respond significantly t test p 001 towards the expected direction against all pressure groupings namely hydrological index morphological index water quality index global pressure index affected group index pressure type combinations except for connectivity thus insectivorous benthivore and potamodromous fish species significantly decrease towards increased pressures in contrast with omnivorous species that significantly increase in addition with regards to the response towards impact intensity gradients a clear trend is depicted in the study decreasing metrics exhibit significantly lower values and conversely increasing metrics exhibit significantly higher values towards pressure intensity additional affected groups the same outcome is revealed for hefi index ecological status where additional affected groups or additional pressure type combinations leads to greater sensitivity samples correctly classified as impacted in the context of this study several implications can be made regarding the level of site misclassification of unimpacted none affected group and impacted at least one affected group sites but three are the main findings a misclassification of unimpacted samples specificity is low and notably misclassified samples are typically assessed by the hefi model as in moderate status rather than poor or bad status b low levels of degradation makes the bioassessment model hefi more susceptible to wrong predictions samples with one affected group agi 1 exhibit considerably lower sensitivity than those with multiple affected groups agi 2 or 3 and c an antagonistic interaction between pressure groups analyzed cpi hpi mpi is assumed since their combined impact sensitivity score assessed is less than the sum of their independent effects jackson et al 2016 we identified an important discrepancy as regards the assessment of the connectivity degradation cpi though recorded in nearly a quarter of the samples 24 no hefi metric responded towards the expected direction t test p 05 not even for potamodromous species that are strongly migratory along the longitudinal axes of rivers sensitivity score for sites impacted only from cpi was also particularly low furthermore benthivore species exhibited a significant t test p 01 but unexpected increase of values for sites impacted only from the connectivity stressor this discrepancy has also been recorded in other studies e g degerman et al 2007 but largely goes against our collective knowledge of the profound impact of barriers in the mediterranean dams have been associated as one of the most important perturbations for rivers throughout europe and the mediterranean countries e g clavero et al 2004 zogaris et al 2012 we can only postulate that barriers especially in water stressed conditions may increase water depth and provide refugia during low flow periods thus locally becoming beneficial to fish communities in this context it is important to note that most barriers in greece account for very low barriers e g river fords and the like unlike much of western europe and many other mediterranean countries greece has relatively few large dams mentzafou et al 2019 and a rather low numbers of alien species originating from artificial lentic waters in its lotic water environments koutsikos et al 2019 5 conclusions and outlook on future research we encourage bioassessment practitioners managers and conservationists to take special care when analyzing and interpreting fish based metric responses to pressures since the biota such as fish may yield complex ecological responses to perturbations birk et al 2020 we encourage the use of on site pressure assessment also backed by desk study methods as utilized in bioassessment index development and monitoring surveys during the last two decades in europe considerations should be given not only to single pressures but also to specific pressure combinations in order to address planning and prioritization of research conservation and restoration requirements more detailed studies on the combined impact of stressor combinations on fish communities are needed e g antagonistic synergetic additive effects especially in endemic rich areas and naturally depauperate fish communities such as in the eastern mediterranean region our review provides the following recommendations fish based pressure assessment approaches promoting the gpi global pressure and agi affected group integrated indices as standard tools for expressing anthropogenic degradation are obviously important for bioassessment metrics and index development as well as for monitoring in the eastern mediterranean region just like in the rest of europe though we are aware of the loss of pressure related information by reducing dimensions from single pressure variables to an integrated index we understand the need to promote comparable pressure indices for use among broad european regions in terms of comparing and intercallibrating indices monitoring trends and for reporting we confirm the unmet need to address water quality water pollution and connectivity stressors in greece s fish based bioassessment approach although it is well known that fish may respond in various ways to nutrient pollution and to barriers these two stressors excibited a poor ability to track responses of the fish community in our dataset we suggest pressure impact and pressure interaction analysis towards a larger number of functional fish assemblage metrics in order to comprehend how single and multiple pressures affect structural elements of fish communities we urge investigation into specific river types since hefi is a model based index site specific index transcending river typology this requires further exploring reference condition baselines especially for non temperate types of rivers such as non perennial rivers species poor lowland rivers mediterranean large lowland rivers and other unique river ichthyofaunal assemblage types declaration of competing

971,the taperaçu estuary is distinct from other amazonian estuaries due to the absence of significant fluvial discharge and consequent dominance of marine influence the present study investigated the influence of physical chemical variables on the composition and dynamics of the local phytoplankton and their spatiotemporal variation with emphasis on the taxonomic analysis of the diatoms of the order eupodiscales during the rainy and dry seasons of 2013 and 2014 three sectors of this estuary were monitored over cycles of 24 hours the samples were analyzed by light and scanning electron microscopy significant temporal and spatial differences were found in salinity which was high 32 in all the sectors turbidity and chl a concentrations were higher during the rainy period due to the increased input of water from the relatively small drainage basin of the estuary as well as the material washed out of the soil of the adjacent mangroves the local phytoplankton community was dominated by diatoms which reached high abundances during the dry season the local hydrodynamics determined the occurrence of benthic and or tychoplanktonic species in the water column including the eupodiscales hobaniella longicruris odontella aurita and zygoceros rhombus while the high salinity recorded during the dry season favored the presence of trieres species the presence of high abundances of the benthic diatom cymatosira belgica contributed to the observed high chl a concentrations and endorse the ecological importance of sediment resuspension processes and the consequent accumulation of phytobenthos cells in the water column in shallow estuarine amazonian ecosystems key words bacillariophyta benthic diatoms environmental variables equatorial estuary phytoplankton dynamics 1 introduction tropical estuaries and the circumjacent mangroves are among the world s most productive and valuable aquatic systems they provide an enormous quantity of natural resources of socioeconomic importance as the production of food and recycling of nutrients and the provision of services that guarantee the wellbeing of the local populations of both humans and other organisms kaiser et al 2005 ricklefs 2010 costanza et al 2014 located at the ocean continent interface these ecosystems are influenced by the continental drainage and tidal fluctuations the understanding of the processes of the transfer of terrestrial material to the ocean resulting from the fluvial discharge and the input transport of organic matter produced by the mangrove forests depends on the systematic study of these ecosystems dittmar and lara 2001 estuaries are complex and dynamic environments subject to large fluctuations in their physical and chemical variables which influence in turn their biological components sarma et al 2009 reliable data on the structure of biological communities and their ecological relationships are fundamentally important for the understanding of coastal environments and the estuarine phytoplankton plays an important role as primary producers in the estuarine trophic web cloern and dufford 2005 paerl et al 2006 contributing directly to the flow of the organic carbon in pelagic environments reynolds 2006 the organisms that make up the phytoplankton present a short life cycle and a rapid response to environmental changes which makes them suitable as biological indicators of changes observed in aquatic ecosystems casini et al 2008 molinero et al 2013 while some species adapt to changes others are intolerant to variation in the environment and may become locally extinct affecting ecosystem services boyd et al 2016 therefore studies of the spatial and temporal variability in the occurrence of phytoplankton species can provide administrators with potential indicators for the assessment of modifications in the hierarchy of aquatic ecosystems contributing to their management and conservation the amazon coastal zone located in northern brazil is an extreme dynamic and complex environment in which physical forces interact through processes generated by the tidal currents beardsley et al 1995 the input of freshwater combined with the variation in the amazon estuarine plume lentz and limeburner 1995 and the north brazil current johns et al 1998 this coast is influenced strongly by the local macrotidal regime as well as the input of organic matter derived from the mangrove forests which make this region extremely productive especially in terms of its plentiful fishery resources isaac nahum 2006 the estuaries are an important feature of this littoral providing horizontal transport and the exchange of nutrients and organisms between both terrestrial and oceanic environments short term variations in physical and chemical variables such as temperature salinity nutrients organic matter and tidal currents have an impact on the biological interactions of the system miranda et al 2002 in this context the trophic relationships of the plankton found in estuarine systems would be expected to be more complex than those found in more stable environments guenther et al 2012 the available data on the amazon region refer primarily to the interactions between environmental variables and the phytoplankton composition abundance diversity and biomass previous phytoplankton studies of the amazon coastal region have highlighted the importance of the diatoms as the principal organisms responsible for the high abundance and species richness paiva et al 2006 ribeiro et al 2008 sousa et al 2008 monteiro et al 2009 sousa et al 2009 pereira et al 2010 santana et al 2010 costa et al 2011 matos et al 2011 sodré et al 2011 matos et al 2012 costa et al 2013 matos et al 2013 goes et al 2014 matos et al 2016a the predominance of diatoms is associated with their opportunist ecological role many r strategist species and their euryhaline characteristics most diatoms recorded are either neritic or tychoplanktonic species which reflects the influence of the local marine waters and the strong hydrodynamics observed in the coastal zones of this region in general there is a paucity of taxonomic studies in this region which emphasizes the need for further research given that the species is the basic unit in the structure and dynamics of the phytoplankton community in the present study we investigated the composition biomass and abundance of the phytoplankton and its spatiotemporal fluctuations in the taperaçu estuary northern brazil and in particular the taxonomic features of the order eupodiscales bacillariophyta species of this order are well represented in the coastal and marine ecosystems of northern brazil sousa et al 2008 santana et al 2010 matos et al 2012 matos et al 2016a b in this study the effect of rainfall seasonality on hydrological variables and phytoplankton variations was analyzed based on the following hypotheses a dissolved nutrients do not limit local phytoplankton development b even without significant rivers a marked salinity gradient during the dry period contribute to the occurrence and growth of coastal marine species in this period c local hydrodynamics associated to rainfall and wetland runoff increase water mixture and turbidity favoring the resuspension of dissolved nutrients and benthic microalgae thus enhancing biomass d eupodiscales constitute an important fraction of diatoms in taperaçu estuary and other amazonian estuaries and their correct identification is of paramount importance for local ecological studies 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the taperaçu estuary 00 50 00 57 s 46 42 46 45 w is located on the coastal plain of bragança in northeastern pará state northern brazil fig 1 dominated by semidiurnal macrotides with a tidal amplitude of around 5 m reaching 6 m during the equinoctial spring tides dhn 2019 dominated by tidal currents this estuary 21 km2 is of the open type shallow depth mean 4 2 m and turbid mean 378 1 ntu with strong tidal currents up to 2 04 ms 1 and delimited by extensive mangrove forests and tidal plains asp et al 2012 in contrast with other amazonian estuaries the taperaçu lacks any significant source of freshwater and the local drainage consists only of small tidal creeks and wetlands as well as the taici tidal channel asp et al 2012 which connects the taperaçu estuary to the neighbouring estuary of the caeté river fig 1 the general morphology of the taperaçu ecosystem is dominated by its funnel shape and the presence of extensive sandbanks in the central and upper portions the general circulation pattern is typical of a shallow estuary with marked vertical homogeneity in salinity and water temperature pereira et al 2017 the lack of any significant continental drainage impedes the formation of distinct longitudinal gradients in its hydrological components magalhães et al 2009 2 2 climatology the amazon coast presents a hot and humid equatorial climate amw classified as megathermal by moraes et al 2005 and pereira et al 2009 the region s climate is highly seasonal with a rainy season between january and june and a dry season between july and december

rainfall patterns has a direct influence on the oscillations in the region s hydrological variables pereira et al 2013 pereira et al 2017 causing major alterations in the structure and dynamics of the phytoplankton populations of the amazonian estuaries paiva et al 2006 sodré et al 2011 matos et al 2011 pamplona et al 2013 costa et al 2013 even in the taperaçu estuary which is shallow and lacks any significant continental drainage asp et al 2012 the distribution of the annual rains was the principal factor influencing the local fluctuations in hydrological variables the observed variation in salinity turbidity and dissolved nutrient concentrations was highly seasonal and influenced the development and blooms of the phytoplankton identified during the study salinity was invariably higher near the mouth of the estuary sectors s2 and s3 than in the internal sector s1 due to the sporadic flow of freshwater from the adjacent marshes asp et al 2012 during the dry season salinity increased considerably in sector s1 as observed in other estuaries on the amazon coast due to the increased intrusion of marine waters and greater evaporation domingues et al 2005 silva et al 2008 leite et al 2009 sodré et al 2011 pamplona et al 2013 pereira et al 2017 similar high salinity levels 34 0 38 7 to the mean value recorded in the present study 37 6 1 were previously observed in the taperaçu estuary asp et al 2012 magalhães et al 2015 andrade et al 2016 the local hydrodynamics and the high salinity of the taperaçu estuary principally during the period of low precipitation favoured the incursion of marine species to the most internal portion of the estuary sector s1 most of the biological variables presented a negative correlation with salinity fig 5 in particular the chl a concentration which indicated the presence of a reduced phytoplankton biomass during the dry season in this estuary as expected the concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients were high during the rainy season in particular in sectors s1 and s2 the high nutrient concentrations typically found in the amazon coastal region demaster and pope 1996 santos et al 2008 are determined by the presence of extensive mangroves throughout the local estuaries souza filho 2005 in addition the shallow depth of the taperaçu estuary contributes to intense resuspension and further fertilization of the environment magalhães et al 2011 asp et al 2012 andrade et al 2016 pereira et al 2017 according to cohen et al 1999 dittmar and lara 2001 and cohen et al 2004 the processes of resuspension of materials from the bottom to the surface help in the maintenance of nutrients in the water column which contributes considerably to the assimilation by the phytoplankton contributing to the increase in primary productivity the availability of nutrients in the water contributes to the synthesis of substances which support the growth and reproduction of the phytoplankton and leads ultimately to an increase in its biomass in the amazon region goes et al 2014 and other parts of the world pan et al 2016 the variation in particulate and dissolved nutrient concentrations in estuaries are associated with the interactions between the sediment and the processes of adsorption desorption transport and biological transformation dittmar and lara 2001 goes et al 2014 andrade et al 2016 previous studies confirm that the processes related to nutrient enrichment in amazonian estuarine environments especially in caeté estuary located adjacent to study area are related to strong local hydrodynamics due to their macrotides tidal ranges 4m in fact the macrotides help in the leaching processes of mangrove soils carrying nitrogen and even phosphate compounds resulting from decomposition of mangrove plants to the estuary these nutrients are deposited at the bottom and the processes of resuspension from the bottom to the water column surface favours high primary productivity dittmar and lara 2001 for the caeté estuary studies developed by cohen et al 1999 and cohen et al 2004 showed that nutrient enrichment in the estuarine environment takes place through small creeks located in the estuary dittmar and lara 2001 further point out that the positive long term sedimentation balance and mineralization in the mangrove sediment presumably balance the export of dissolved silicate and phosphate according to these authors litter retention in the mangrove sediment is abundant in the estuary and its surroundings and consequently high leaching and mineralization rates within the forest lead to high concentrations of nutrients and organic matter in the water column in the taperaçu estuary dissolved nutrients also seem to come from neighboring estuaries through tidal channels connectivity recent studies have shown that the water in the upper and middle sectors of the caeté estuary which is connected to taperaçu estuary through taici creek have an average total dissolved nitrogen concentration around 30 approximately 30 μmol l 1 higher than the levels observed in the taperaçu estuary which reasonable suggests that the caeté estuary can be also an important source of nutrients for the taperaçu estuary pereira et al 2017 rosa filho et al 2018 the dissolved nutrient concentrations observed in the present study are higher than those recorded in the estuaries of northeastern brazil grego et al 2009 bastos et al 2011 machado et al 2017 but similar to those of other amazonian estuaries such as the caeté pereira et al 2010 atique et al 2016 quatipuru pamplona et al 2013 paracauari monteiro et al 2015 and that of the arari river on marajó island alves et al 2010 pamplona et al 2013 recorded tn concentrations higher 20 µm l 1 than those found in the present study due to the anthropogenic input from domestic effluents and agricultural runoff which increased the concentrations of nitrogen compounds it seems reasonable to infer that the tdn and tdp concentrations recorded in the taperaçu estuary are characteristic of amazonian environments with little or no anthropogenic input in which the input of rainfall favours the washing out of the mangroves and the inundation of the marshes located in the upper portion of the estuary contributing to the natural fertilization in comparison with other estuarine ecosystems the results of the present study indicate that the taperaçu estuary has relatively lower concentration of dissolved nutrients than expected for tropical costa et al 2009 pan et al 2016 and subtropical haraguchi et al 2015 hart et al 2015 estuaries the absorption of tdn and tdp by primary producers and bacteria tends to be the principal factor determining relatively low concentrations in the surface layer of the water column braga et al 2005 piveli and kato 2006 the chl a concentrations recorded in the present study were associated with the fluctuations in precipitation salinity and dissolved nutrients with higher concentrations being observed during the rainy season which is typical of other systems of the amazon coast matos et al 2011 pamplona et al 2013 pereira et al 2013 goes et al 2014 and tropical estuaries in general damme et al 2005 duggan et al 2008 grego et al 2009 the positive effect of the onset of the rains on the local phytoplankton may be related to the availability of dissolved nutrients in particular ammonia and silicate table 1 the negative relationship between salinity and the chl a concentration cca fig 5 was strongly associated with the occurrence of diatoms in particular those of the family cymatosiraceaea cymatosira belgica the principal species responsible for the chl a peaks is typical of brackish environments and benthic habitats guiry and guiry 2019 and peaks in its abundance were probably favoured by resuspension processes the intense local hydrodynamics contributes to the resuspension of benthic microalgae in other amazonian estuaries sousa et al 2009 matos et al 2011 matos et al 2012 the resuspension of tychoplanktonic organisms combined with the input of nutrients from the local mangrove forests may be one of the principal factors contributing to the high chl a concentrations found on the amazon coast 4 2 structure of the phytoplankton community the species composition of estuarine phytoplankton communities and their response to environmental factors will depend on the physical and chemical configuration of the estuary wetzel 2001 the diatoms were the predominant group in the taperaçu estuary followed by the dinoflagellates cyanobacteria and chlorophytes in terms of their species composition abundance relative abundance and frequency the typical worldwide predominance of diatoms in coastal environments tilstone et al 2000 raviers 2006 simon et al 2009 gallegos et al 2010 wang et al 2017 is related to their adaptations for survival when faced with the physical stress generated by the turbulence and the exposure to different levels of luminosity allowing them to take advantage of the high nutrient concentrations lomas and glibert 2000 maranon et al 2012 diatoms tend to be both highly diverse and abundant in tropical and subtropical estuaries sarthou et al 2005 procopiak et al 2006 matos et al 2011 sodré et al 2011 pan et al 2016 the low abundance of dinoflagellates observed in the present study indicated that the availability of resources and the instability of the surface of the water of taperaçu estuary were unfavourable to their development in particular in sectors s2 and s3 in either season due to the high energy hydrodynamics observed in these sectors in addition to having lower abundances than the diatoms in all the study sectors the dinoflagellates were poorly distributed within the estuary however the bloom of alexandrium sp observed in june was worthy of note given that this genus includes species that produce paralyzing toxins that may be harmful even at low concentrations raviers 2006 the reduced participation of cyanobacteria and chlorophytes represented primarily by organisms that inhabit freshwater environments raviers 2006 is typical of coastal ecosystems on the amazon coast pereira et al 2010 sodré et al 2011 matos et al 2013 matos et al 2016b goes et al 2014 the relatively high abundances of predominantly limnetic cyanobacteria and chlorophytes observed in the more internal sectors of the estuary in both seasons even when dominated by marine conditions salinity 30 is likely the result of the transport of these organisms from less saline zones to the estuary the high frequency of occurrence 96 of the diatoms trieres mobiliensis t sinensis t regia hobaniella longicruris odontella aurita and zygoceros rhombus in the taperaçu estuary may be related to their adaptations to coastal environments and their euryhaline characteristics moreira filho et al 1999 guiry and guiry 2019 the presence of o aurita in the taperaçu estuary during periods of moderate salinity 10 18 indicates that this species is even more tolerant to salinity variations odontella aurita is common in the benthic habitat tychoplanktonic mode of life and muddy substrate such as mangrove areas fernandes et al 1994 hoppenrath et al 2009 and is transported to the water column with the disturbance by winds or currents turbulence and the breakdown of the substrate resuspension processes the shallow depth of the taperaçu estuary and its intense hydrodynamics probably contributed to the presence of o aurita in the water column 4 3 taxonomic aspects for a better understanding of the taxonomy of a group of organisms molecular data are an increasingly important complement for the traditional morphological criteria used to identify taxa ashworth et al 2013 investigated the phylogenetic relationships in the eupodiscaceae using molecular markers and demonstrated that while this family is monophyletic the odontella species analyzed represent a polyphyletic group of clades related to different genera the authors described the new genus trieres to accommodate three species previously inserted in odontella based on the molecular phylogeny of ashworth et al 2013 sims et al 2018 used scanning electron microscopy to investigate the relationships among the members of the family eupodiscaceae and found evidence of the existence of a new family odontellaceae and three new genera pseudictyota hobaniella and ralfsiella including hobaniella longicruris odontella longicruris the taxon trieres applied to a number of species previously classified as odontella c agardh was characterized by the valve delimited by a crest or ring ocelli with loculated perforation at the apex of the horn and elongated external tubes with divergent rimoportulae close to the margin of the crest ashworth et al 2013 specimens of parodontella s komura have the same morphological characteristics but can be distinguished by the presence of a sternum annulus which is absent in trieres however sims et al 2018 discussed the definition of the sternum and concluded that this structure is present in the valve of trieres as observed in the specimens examined in the present study see figs 6e and 8e lavigne et al 2015 and sims et al 2018 added further diagnostic characteristics such as the presence of areolated horns in trieres and smoother structures in parodontella and two rimoportulae in trieres versus four in parodontella in addition while some of the rimoportulae tubes in parodontella emerge from the valvar crest this is not observed in trieres the principal difference between trieres sinensis and t regia is found in the rimoportulae which are elevated in t sinensis not or only little divergent and parallel to the short horns in t regia the rimoportulae are divergent curved at the tip and more distant from the long horns hoban 1979 hoppenrath et al 2009 ashworth et al 2013 some differences in the morphometry of these species were noted in the present study in comparison with the available data specifically the minimum length of the apical axis of the valves of t sinensis 56 7 145 μm mean standard deviation 88 4 17 1 μm and t regia 28 1 89 4 μm mean 55 6 18 2 μm was much shorter than the values recorded in previous studies mayer and schmid 1995 hoppenrath et al 2009 lavigne et al 2015 the length of the apical axis of the diatoms is known to vary according to the reproductive stage of the population jewson 1992 and this pattern has been observed in t regia by hegde et al 2011 in the taperaçu estuary the reduced apical axis indicates that the population has been undergoing vegetative division for a number of generations possibly favoured by the local environmental conditions most of the diatoms that have ocelli present a tychoplanktonic mode of life ashworth et al 2013 lavine et al 2015 and rarely have planktonic habits as observed in trieres mobiliensis t sinensis and t regia the ocellus is formed by an elevated plate of silica perforated by different types of pores and surrounded by a thick border of perforated silica and secretes mucus figs 6h 7g and 8g the mucus is used to fix the diatom to substrates or other cells forming colonies graham and wilcox 2000 in the taperaçu estuary the highest abundances of t mobiliensis and t regia were recorded during periods of low precipitation with greater marine influence table 1 probably due to their preference for high salinity and low turbidity garibotii et al 2011 matos et al 2016a b the ecological characteristics of hobaniella longicruris are poorly known sims et al 2018 the higher abundances in the water column of taperaçu estuary during the dry season of the benthic hobaniella longicruris and zygoceros rhombus probably reflect their marine nature and adaptation to turbulent conditions hoppenrath et al 2009 lavigne et al 2015 relatively high abundance of these species were recorded in november 633 273 and 367 163 cells l 1 respectively especially at the mouth of the estuary sector s3 675 417 cells l 1 during the rainy season lower salinity of the coastal water probably contributed to the reduction in the abundances of both h longicruris and z rhombus the recently proposed genus hobaniella can be distinguished from odontella sims et al 2018 by its oval circular convex valvar face with an inflated circular area and the presence of 1 3 long and narrow rimoportulae bifurcated at the tip and inclined away from the horns in hobaniella the horns are long and extend vertically with an ocellus at each end the mantle is steep with poroid areolae radiating out in rows from the centre lavigne et al 2015 recorded benthic or tychoplanktonic habits of this species designated as odontella longicruris which are consistent with the present study given that most of the analysed specimens were covered with detritic particles as also observed in z rhombus see figs 9c 10d and 10e in z rhombus in fact the accumulation of particles hampered the complete analysis of frustules microstructures 5 conclusion in conclusion the tropical taperaçu estuary is distinct from the other estuaries of the amazon coast due to the absence of any significant fluvial discharge and its extremely small drainage area in addition the shallow waters and strong hydrodynamics of the estuary influence the phytoplankton community variations marked salinity differences were observed between the dry and rainy seasons associated to the local precipitation pattern and hydrodynamics which determine the circulation of the estuary and marine waters these factors regulate the variation in other environmental properties turbidity inorganic nutrients and also the local biological processes favouring the presence of different species in the estuary during a given period the diatoms were the most diverse phytoplankton group throughout the study the most abundant being cymatosirales cymatosira belgica and thalassiosirales skeletonema costatum thalassiosira sp the spatial and temporal variation in the composition and distribution of the phytoplankton reflected the influence of the incursion of the marine waters into the taperaçu estuary the strong local hydrodynamics also determined the occurrence of benthic and tychoplanktonic species of eupodiscales in the water column as hobaniella longicruris odontella aurita and zygoceros rhombus the relatively high salinity recorded during the dry season favoured the development of three species of trieres the high abundances of the benthic diatom cymatosira belgica observed in the taperaçu estuary reflected the influence of the shallow waters and strong hydrodynamics which contributed to the suspension of sediment and nutrients and in turn the accumulation of phytobenthic cells in the water column contributing to the high cellular abundances and chl a concentrations observed during the present study declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements

971,the taperaçu estuary is distinct from other amazonian estuaries due to the absence of significant fluvial discharge and consequent dominance of marine influence the present study investigated the influence of physical chemical variables on the composition and dynamics of the local phytoplankton and their spatiotemporal variation with emphasis on the taxonomic analysis of the diatoms of the order eupodiscales during the rainy and dry seasons of 2013 and 2014 three sectors of this estuary were monitored over cycles of 24 hours the samples were analyzed by light and scanning electron microscopy significant temporal and spatial differences were found in salinity which was high 32 in all the sectors turbidity and chl a concentrations were higher during the rainy period due to the increased input of water from the relatively small drainage basin of the estuary as well as the material washed out of the soil of the adjacent mangroves the local phytoplankton community was dominated by diatoms which reached high abundances during the dry season the local hydrodynamics determined the occurrence of benthic and or tychoplanktonic species in the water column including the eupodiscales hobaniella longicruris odontella aurita and zygoceros rhombus while the high salinity recorded during the dry season favored the presence of trieres species the presence of high abundances of the benthic diatom cymatosira belgica contributed to the observed high chl a concentrations and endorse the ecological importance of sediment resuspension processes and the consequent accumulation of phytobenthos cells in the water column in shallow estuarine amazonian ecosystems key words bacillariophyta benthic diatoms environmental variables equatorial estuary phytoplankton dynamics 1 introduction tropical estuaries and the circumjacent mangroves are among the world s most productive and valuable aquatic systems they provide an enormous quantity of natural resources of socioeconomic importance as the production of food and recycling of nutrients and the provision of services that guarantee the wellbeing of the local populations of both humans and other organisms kaiser et al 2005 ricklefs 2010 costanza et al 2014 located at the ocean continent interface these ecosystems are influenced by the continental drainage and tidal fluctuations the understanding of the processes of the transfer of terrestrial material to the ocean resulting from the fluvial discharge and the input transport of organic matter produced by the mangrove forests depends on the systematic study of these ecosystems dittmar and lara 2001 estuaries are complex and dynamic environments subject to large fluctuations in their physical and chemical variables which influence in turn their biological components sarma et al 2009 reliable data on the structure of biological communities and their ecological relationships are fundamentally important for the understanding of coastal environments and the estuarine phytoplankton plays an important role as primary producers in the estuarine trophic web cloern and dufford 2005 paerl et al 2006 contributing directly to the flow of the organic carbon in pelagic environments reynolds 2006 the organisms that make up the phytoplankton present a short life cycle and a rapid response to environmental changes which makes them suitable as biological indicators of changes observed in aquatic ecosystems casini et al 2008 molinero et al 2013 while some species adapt to changes others are intolerant to variation in the environment and may become locally extinct affecting ecosystem services boyd et al 2016 therefore studies of the spatial and temporal variability in the occurrence of phytoplankton species can provide administrators with potential indicators for the assessment of modifications in the hierarchy of aquatic ecosystems contributing to their management and conservation the amazon coastal zone located in northern brazil is an extreme dynamic and complex environment in which physical forces interact through processes generated by the tidal currents beardsley et al 1995 the input of freshwater combined with the variation in the amazon estuarine plume lentz and limeburner 1995 and the north brazil current johns et al 1998 this coast is influenced strongly by the local macrotidal regime as well as the input of organic matter derived from the mangrove forests which make this region extremely productive especially in terms of its plentiful fishery resources isaac nahum 2006 the estuaries are an important feature of this littoral providing horizontal transport and the exchange of nutrients and organisms between both terrestrial and oceanic environments short term variations in physical and chemical variables such as temperature salinity nutrients organic matter and tidal currents have an impact on the biological interactions of the system miranda et al 2002 in this context the trophic relationships of the plankton found in estuarine systems would be expected to be more complex than those found in more stable environments guenther et al 2012 the available data on the amazon region refer primarily to the interactions between environmental variables and the phytoplankton composition abundance diversity and biomass previous phytoplankton studies of the amazon coastal region have highlighted the importance of the diatoms as the principal organisms responsible for the high abundance and species richness paiva et al 2006 ribeiro et al 2008 sousa et al 2008 monteiro et al 2009 sousa et al 2009

diatoms is associated with their opportunist ecological role many r strategist species and their euryhaline characteristics most diatoms recorded are either neritic or tychoplanktonic species which reflects the influence of the local marine waters and the strong hydrodynamics observed in the coastal zones of this region in general there is a paucity of taxonomic studies in this region which emphasizes the need for further research given that the species is the basic unit in the structure and dynamics of the phytoplankton community in the present study we investigated the composition biomass and abundance of the phytoplankton and its spatiotemporal fluctuations in the taperaçu estuary northern brazil and in particular the taxonomic features of the order eupodiscales bacillariophyta species of this order are well represented in the coastal and marine ecosystems of northern brazil sousa et al 2008 santana et al 2010 matos et al 2012 matos et al 2016a b in this study the effect of rainfall seasonality on hydrological variables and phytoplankton variations was analyzed based on the following hypotheses a dissolved nutrients do not limit local phytoplankton development b even without significant rivers a marked salinity gradient during the dry period contribute to the occurrence and growth of coastal marine species in this period c local hydrodynamics

an important fraction of diatoms in taperaçu estuary and other amazonian estuaries and their correct identification is of paramount importance for local ecological studies 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the taperaçu estuary 00 50 00 57 s 46 42 46 45 w is located on the coastal plain of bragança in northeastern pará state northern brazil fig 1 dominated by semidiurnal macrotides with a tidal amplitude of around 5 m reaching 6 m during the equinoctial spring tides dhn 2019 dominated by tidal currents this estuary 21 km2 is of the open type shallow depth mean 4 2 m and turbid mean 378 1 ntu with strong tidal currents up to 2 04 ms 1 and delimited by extensive mangrove forests and tidal plains asp et al 2012 in contrast with other amazonian estuaries the taperaçu lacks any significant source of freshwater and the local drainage consists only of small tidal creeks and wetlands as well as the taici tidal channel asp et al 2012 which connects the taperaçu estuary to the neighbouring estuary of the caeté river fig 1 the general morphology of the taperaçu ecosystem is dominated by its funnel shape and the presence of extensive sandbanks in the central and upper portions the general circulation pattern is typical of a shallow estuary with marked vertical homogeneity in salinity and water temperature pereira et al 2017 the lack of any significant continental drainage impedes the formation of distinct longitudinal gradients in its hydrological components magalhães et al 2009 2 2 climatology the amazon coast presents a hot and humid equatorial climate amw classified as megathermal by moraes et al 2005 and pereira et al 2009 the region s climate is highly seasonal with a rainy season between january and june and a dry season between july and december moraes et al 2005 the mean temperature is approximately 25 5 c while the mean annual precipitation is around 2 550 mm with 75 of the total volume being recorded during the rainy season inmet 2014 during the dry season mean precipitation is typically 100 200 mm per season with high rates of insolation and evaporation and maximum temperature of 32 0 c inmet 2014 monthly precipitation data were obtained for 2013 1 612 1 mm year 1 and 2014 2 069 3 mm year 1 from the tracuateua station 01 04 s 46 54 w of the national meteorological institute inmet which is located 17 km southeast of the

phytoplankton populations of the amazonian estuaries paiva et al 2006 sodré et al 2011 matos et al 2011 pamplona et al 2013 costa et al 2013 even in the taperaçu estuary which is shallow and lacks any significant continental drainage asp et al 2012 the distribution of the annual rains was the principal factor influencing the local fluctuations in hydrological variables the observed variation in salinity turbidity and dissolved nutrient concentrations was highly seasonal and influenced the development and blooms of the phytoplankton identified during the study salinity was invariably higher near the mouth of the estuary sectors s2 and s3 than in the internal sector s1 due to the sporadic flow of freshwater from the adjacent marshes asp et al 2012 during the dry season salinity increased considerably in sector s1 as observed in other estuaries on the amazon coast due to the increased intrusion of marine waters and greater evaporation domingues et al 2005 silva et al 2008 leite et al 2009 sodré et al 2011 pamplona et al 2013 pereira et al 2017 similar high salinity levels 34 0 38 7 to the mean value recorded in the present study 37 6 1 were previously observed in the taperaçu estuary asp et al 2012 magalhães et al 2015 andrade et al 2016 the local hydrodynamics and the high salinity of the taperaçu estuary principally during the period of low precipitation favoured the incursion of marine species to the most internal portion of the estuary sector s1 most of the biological variables presented a negative correlation with salinity fig 5 in particular the chl a concentration which indicated the presence of a reduced phytoplankton biomass during the dry season in this estuary as expected the concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients were high during the rainy season in particular in sectors s1 and s2 the high nutrient concentrations typically found in the amazon coastal region demaster and pope 1996 santos et al 2008 are determined by the presence of extensive mangroves throughout the local estuaries souza filho 2005 in addition the shallow depth of the taperaçu estuary contributes to intense resuspension and further fertilization of the environment magalhães et al 2011 asp et al 2012 andrade et al 2016 pereira et al 2017 according to cohen et al 1999 dittmar and lara 2001 and cohen et al 2004 the processes of resuspension of materials from the bottom to the surface help in the maintenance of nutrients in the water column which contributes considerably to the assimilation by the phytoplankton contributing to the increase in primary productivity the availability of nutrients in the water contributes to the synthesis of substances which support the growth and reproduction of the phytoplankton and leads ultimately to an increase in its biomass in the amazon region goes et al 2014 and other parts of the world pan et al 2016 the variation in particulate and dissolved nutrient concentrations in estuaries are associated with the interactions between the sediment and the processes of adsorption desorption transport and biological transformation dittmar and lara 2001 goes et al 2014 andrade et al 2016 previous studies confirm that the processes related to nutrient enrichment in amazonian estuarine environments especially in caeté estuary located adjacent to study area are related to strong local hydrodynamics due to their macrotides tidal ranges 4m in fact the macrotides help in the leaching processes of mangrove soils carrying nitrogen and even phosphate compounds resulting from decomposition of mangrove plants to the estuary these nutrients are deposited at the bottom and the processes of resuspension from the bottom to the water column surface favours high primary productivity dittmar and lara 2001 for the caeté estuary studies developed by cohen et al 1999 and cohen et al 2004 showed that nutrient enrichment in the estuarine environment takes place through small creeks located in the estuary dittmar and lara 2001 further point out that the positive long term sedimentation balance and mineralization in the mangrove sediment presumably balance the export of dissolved silicate and phosphate according to these authors litter retention in the mangrove sediment is abundant in the estuary and its surroundings and consequently high leaching and mineralization rates within the forest lead to high concentrations of nutrients and organic matter in the water column in the taperaçu estuary dissolved nutrients also seem to come from neighboring estuaries through tidal channels connectivity recent studies have shown that the water in the upper and middle sectors of the caeté estuary which is connected to taperaçu estuary through taici creek have an average total dissolved nitrogen concentration around 30 approximately 30 μmol l 1 higher than the levels observed in the taperaçu estuary which reasonable suggests that the caeté estuary can be also an important source of nutrients for the taperaçu estuary pereira et al 2017 rosa filho et al 2018 the dissolved nutrient concentrations observed in the present study are higher than those recorded in the estuaries of northeastern brazil grego et al 2009 bastos et al 2011 machado et al 2017 but similar to those of other amazonian estuaries such as the caeté pereira et al 2010 atique et al 2016 quatipuru pamplona et al 2013 paracauari monteiro et al 2015 and that of the arari river on marajó island alves et al 2010 pamplona et al 2013 recorded tn concentrations higher 20 µm l 1 than those found in the present study due to the anthropogenic input from domestic effluents and agricultural runoff which increased the concentrations of nitrogen compounds it seems reasonable to infer that the tdn and tdp concentrations recorded in the taperaçu estuary are characteristic of amazonian environments with little or no anthropogenic input in which the input of rainfall favours the washing out of the mangroves and the inundation of the marshes located in the upper portion of the estuary contributing to the natural fertilization in comparison with other estuarine ecosystems the results of the present study indicate that the taperaçu estuary has relatively lower concentration of dissolved nutrients than expected for tropical costa et al 2009 pan et al 2016 and subtropical haraguchi et al 2015 hart et al 2015 estuaries the absorption of tdn and tdp by primary producers and bacteria tends to be the principal factor determining relatively low concentrations in the surface layer of the water column braga et al 2005 piveli and kato 2006 the chl a concentrations recorded in the present study were associated with the fluctuations in precipitation salinity and dissolved nutrients with higher concentrations being observed during the rainy season which is typical of other systems of the amazon coast matos et al 2011 pamplona et al 2013 pereira et al 2013 goes et al 2014 and tropical estuaries in general damme et al 2005 duggan et al 2008 grego et al 2009 the positive effect of the onset of the rains on the local phytoplankton may be related to the availability of dissolved nutrients in particular ammonia and silicate table 1 the negative relationship between salinity and the chl a concentration cca fig 5 was strongly associated with the occurrence of diatoms in particular those of the family cymatosiraceaea cymatosira belgica the principal species responsible for the chl a peaks is typical of brackish environments and benthic habitats guiry and guiry 2019 and peaks in its abundance were probably favoured by resuspension processes the intense local hydrodynamics contributes to the resuspension of benthic microalgae in other amazonian estuaries sousa et al 2009 matos et al 2011 matos et al 2012 the resuspension of tychoplanktonic organisms combined with the input of nutrients from the local mangrove forests may be one of the principal factors contributing to the high chl a concentrations found on the amazon coast 4 2 structure of the phytoplankton community the species composition of estuarine phytoplankton communities and their response to environmental factors will depend on the physical and chemical configuration of the estuary wetzel 2001 the diatoms were the predominant group in the taperaçu estuary followed by the dinoflagellates cyanobacteria and chlorophytes in terms of their species composition abundance relative abundance and frequency the typical worldwide predominance of diatoms in coastal environments tilstone et al 2000 raviers 2006 simon et al 2009 gallegos et al 2010 wang et al 2017 is related to their adaptations for survival when faced with the physical stress generated by the turbulence and the exposure to different levels of luminosity allowing them to take advantage of the high nutrient concentrations lomas and glibert 2000 maranon et al 2012 diatoms tend to be both highly diverse and abundant in tropical and subtropical estuaries sarthou et al 2005 procopiak et al 2006 matos et al 2011 sodré et al 2011 pan et al 2016 the low abundance of dinoflagellates observed in the present study indicated that the availability of resources and the instability of the surface of the water of taperaçu estuary were unfavourable to their development in particular in sectors s2 and s3 in either season due to the high energy hydrodynamics observed in these sectors in addition to having lower abundances than the diatoms in all the study sectors the dinoflagellates were poorly distributed within the estuary however the bloom of alexandrium sp observed in june was worthy of note given that this genus includes species that produce paralyzing toxins that may be harmful even at low concentrations raviers 2006 the reduced participation of cyanobacteria and chlorophytes represented primarily by organisms that inhabit freshwater environments raviers 2006 is typical of coastal ecosystems on the amazon coast pereira et al 2010 sodré et al 2011 matos et al 2013 matos et al 2016b goes et al 2014 the relatively high abundances of predominantly limnetic cyanobacteria and chlorophytes observed in the more internal sectors of the estuary in both seasons even when dominated by marine conditions salinity 30 is likely the result of the transport of these organisms from less saline zones to the estuary the high frequency of occurrence 96 of the diatoms trieres mobiliensis t sinensis t regia hobaniella longicruris odontella aurita and zygoceros rhombus in the taperaçu estuary may be related to their adaptations to coastal environments and their euryhaline characteristics moreira filho et al 1999 guiry and guiry 2019 the presence of o aurita in the taperaçu estuary during periods of moderate salinity 10 18 indicates that this species is even more tolerant to salinity variations odontella aurita is common in the benthic habitat tychoplanktonic mode of life and muddy substrate such as mangrove areas fernandes et al 1994 hoppenrath et al 2009 and is transported to the water column with the disturbance by winds or currents turbulence and the breakdown of the substrate resuspension processes the shallow depth of the taperaçu estuary and its intense hydrodynamics probably contributed to the presence of o aurita in the water column 4 3 taxonomic aspects for a better understanding of the taxonomy of a group of organisms molecular data are an increasingly important complement for the traditional morphological criteria used to identify taxa ashworth et al 2013 investigated the phylogenetic relationships in the eupodiscaceae using molecular markers and demonstrated that while this family is monophyletic the odontella species analyzed represent a polyphyletic group of clades related to different genera the authors described the new genus trieres to accommodate three species previously inserted in odontella based on the molecular phylogeny of ashworth et al 2013 sims et al 2018 used scanning electron microscopy to investigate the relationships among the members of the family eupodiscaceae and found evidence of the existence of a new family odontellaceae and three new genera pseudictyota hobaniella and ralfsiella including hobaniella longicruris odontella longicruris the taxon trieres applied to a number of species previously classified as odontella c agardh was characterized by the valve delimited by a crest or ring ocelli with loculated perforation at the apex of the horn and elongated external tubes with divergent rimoportulae close to the margin of the crest ashworth et al 2013 specimens of parodontella s komura have the same morphological characteristics but can be distinguished by the presence of a sternum annulus which is absent in trieres however sims et al 2018 discussed the definition of the sternum and concluded that this structure is present in the valve of trieres as observed in the specimens examined in the present study see figs 6e and 8e lavigne et al 2015 and sims et al 2018 added further diagnostic characteristics such as the presence of areolated horns in trieres and smoother structures in parodontella and two rimoportulae in trieres versus four in parodontella in addition while some of the rimoportulae tubes in parodontella emerge from the valvar crest this is not observed in trieres the principal difference between trieres sinensis and t regia is found in the rimoportulae which are elevated in t sinensis not or only little divergent and parallel to the short horns in t regia the rimoportulae are divergent curved at the tip and more distant from the long horns hoban 1979 hoppenrath et al 2009 ashworth et al 2013 some differences in the morphometry of these species were noted in the present study in comparison with the available data specifically the minimum length of the apical axis of the valves of t sinensis 56 7 145 μm mean standard deviation 88 4 17 1 μm and t regia 28 1 89 4 μm mean 55 6 18 2 μm was much shorter than the values recorded in previous studies mayer and schmid 1995 hoppenrath et al 2009 lavigne et al 2015 the length of the apical axis of the diatoms is known to vary according to the reproductive stage of the population jewson 1992 and this pattern has been observed in t regia by hegde et al 2011 in the taperaçu estuary the reduced apical axis indicates that the population has been undergoing vegetative division for a number of generations possibly favoured by the local environmental conditions most of the diatoms that have ocelli present a tychoplanktonic mode of life ashworth et al 2013 lavine et al 2015 and rarely have planktonic habits as observed in trieres mobiliensis t sinensis and t regia the ocellus is formed by an elevated plate of silica perforated by different types of pores and surrounded by a thick border of perforated silica and secretes mucus figs 6h 7g and 8g the mucus is used to fix the diatom to substrates or other cells forming colonies graham and wilcox 2000 in the taperaçu estuary the highest abundances of t mobiliensis and t regia were recorded during periods of low precipitation with greater marine influence table 1 probably due to their preference for high salinity and low turbidity garibotii et al 2011 matos et al 2016a b the ecological characteristics of hobaniella longicruris are poorly known sims et al 2018 the higher abundances in the water column of taperaçu estuary during the dry season of the benthic hobaniella longicruris and zygoceros rhombus probably reflect their marine nature and adaptation to turbulent conditions hoppenrath et al 2009 lavigne et al 2015 relatively high abundance of these species were recorded in november 633 273 and 367 163 cells l 1 respectively especially at the mouth of the estuary sector s3 675 417 cells l 1 during the rainy season lower salinity of the coastal water probably contributed to the reduction in the abundances of both h longicruris and z rhombus the recently proposed genus hobaniella can be distinguished from odontella sims et al 2018 by its oval circular convex valvar face with an inflated circular area and the presence of 1 3 long and narrow rimoportulae bifurcated at the tip and inclined away from the horns in hobaniella the horns are long and extend vertically with an ocellus at each end the mantle is steep with poroid areolae radiating out in rows from the centre lavigne et al 2015 recorded benthic or tychoplanktonic habits of this species designated as odontella longicruris which are consistent with the present study given that most of the analysed specimens were covered with detritic particles as also observed in z rhombus see figs 9c 10d and 10e in z rhombus in fact the accumulation of particles hampered the complete analysis of frustules microstructures 5 conclusion in conclusion the tropical taperaçu estuary is distinct from the other estuaries of the amazon coast due to the absence of any significant fluvial discharge and its extremely small drainage area in addition the shallow waters and strong hydrodynamics of the estuary influence the phytoplankton community variations marked salinity differences were observed between the dry and rainy seasons associated to the local precipitation pattern and hydrodynamics which determine the circulation of the estuary and marine waters these factors regulate the variation in other environmental properties turbidity inorganic nutrients and also the local biological processes favouring the presence of different species in the estuary during a given period the diatoms were the most diverse phytoplankton group throughout the study the most abundant being cymatosirales cymatosira belgica and thalassiosirales skeletonema costatum thalassiosira sp the spatial and temporal variation in the composition and distribution of the phytoplankton reflected the influence of the incursion of the marine waters into the taperaçu estuary the strong local hydrodynamics also determined the occurrence of benthic and tychoplanktonic species of eupodiscales in the water column as hobaniella longicruris odontella aurita and zygoceros rhombus the relatively high salinity recorded during the dry season favoured the development of three species of trieres the high abundances of the benthic diatom cymatosira belgica observed in the taperaçu estuary reflected the influence of the shallow waters and strong hydrodynamics which contributed to the suspension of sediment and nutrients and in turn the accumulation of phytobenthic cells in the water column contributing to the high cellular abundances and chl a concentrations observed during the present study declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements

972,as a common measure for grassland restoration the fence for prohibition of grazing is usually applied to the steppe in northern china a study in hulunbuir grassland showed the average litter mass in the steppes that enclosed for ten years can reach 70 550g m2 the excessive accumulation of litter caused by long term grazing prohibition can intercept more precipitation which will reduce the water available to grassland plants and hinder the further recovery of plant communities therefore the establishment of a reasonable litter interception model can help estimating the interception of steppes with different litter accumulation and provide some theoretical support for the formulation of fencing policies based on the model of litter interception rate change we established a dynamic interception model of litter i i m 1 e k t t time i dynamic interception i m maximum interception k exponential coefficient of litter interception after testing by an indoor simulated rainfall experiment we found that this model has high accuracy r 2 0 908 0 992 the litter mass lm determines the maximum interception and the rainfall intensity ri determines the speed of interception which

easily obtainable characteristics of lm and ri data make this model easy to apply keywords steppe litter interception litter mass rainfall intensity litter interception rate hulunbuir glassland litter interception process model maximum litter interception 1 introduction fences for grazing prohibition is the main method for solving the degradation problem caused by overgrazing hu and guillemin 2016 in semi arid steppes northern china in the process of grazing prohibition the development of plant communities can be mainly divided into two stages according to the time sequence the first stage is community recovery the diversity and coverage of plant community will increase lv et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 the second stage is suspended recovery cheng and zou 1998 the aboveground biomass growth rate of plant community will slow down yang and zhang 2005 liu et al 2005 and along with the community richness diversity and species evenness show a downward trend in some grasslands lamb 2008 yan and tang 2007 the excessive accumulation of litter is generally considered to be one of the main reasons that limiting the further growth and development of plant communities in steppes with prohibition of grazing immo et al 2016 lamb 2008 wu et al 2013 due to the lack of livestock trampling the contact between litter and soil is insufficient which will decrease the decomposition rate of litter and then leads to a large accumulation of litter in a long term fenced grassland wu et al 2013 lamb 2008 this will significantly increase the rainfall interception of litter layer and result in the drying of the soil layer under litter a study in russia founds that overgrazing and litter accumulation had a significant negative correlation with species richness immo et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to clarify the rainfall interception process of different accumulation of litter which can provide part of the theoretical support for the formulation of a reasonable fencing plan as the main source of water in semi arid steppes precipitation not only affects the ecological functions and productivity of plant communities svoray and karnieli 2011 but also an important driving force for community succession sherry et al 2012 the precipitation level in semi arid steppe will influence the competitive advantage of plant under continuous arid or humid conditions and it has a complicated regulation mechanism for plant seed germination plant development and litter accumulation sherry et al 2012 excessive accumulation of litter will significantly increase rainfall interception which will reduce the water available to the plants in this situation some plants with poor drought resistance will lose their growth advantages hobbs et al 2007 and some rhizome type plants will multiply due to their strong drought resistance resulting in the increase in species differences among different communities in the long term fenced grassland lv et al 2008 in the dry period of the semi arid grassland most of the rainfall is with low intensity which makes the litter with more accumulation have a greater rainfall interception effect hou et al 2019 therefore the interception of litter in semi arid grasslands is an important hydrological process in general the interception process i can be defined as the sum of the change in interception storage si and the evaporation ei i d s i d t e i in the case of litter interception i l the process can also be described as the difference between the net precipitation p l and the infiltration f l i l p l f l gerrits and savenijie 2011 there are three main factors that affect the interception of litter layer rainfall conditions litter characteristics leaf type litter accumulation and thickness et al gerrits and savenijie 2011 van stan ii et al 2017 and the potential evaporation the water holding capacity of litter differs per litter type or forest floor type and thickness or mass gerrits et al 2010 and the frequency of precipitation have a large influence on the interception process sato et al 2004 gerrits et al 2007 although potential evaporation has a smaller impact on interception during precipitation it can still increase interception during a long term precipitation scholars conclusions about the influence of forest litter type on interception were not uniform for example studies had found that broad leaved litter can intercept more water than needle leaved litter xia et al 2019 li et al 2013 however it had also been found that needle leaved litter and broad leaved litter have almost the same water holding capacity zagyvai kiss et al 2019 furthermore the laminar structure of broad leaved litter had been found to form a transverse moving passage for rainwater under a certain slope resulting in less rainwater held by broad leaved litter than by needle leaved litter zhao et al 2019 a study from the eastern forests of the united states found that the interception by the empty fruiting heads is considerable ranging from 2 6 to 218 5 of the incident gross precipitation with a mean of 42 7 levia et al 2004 these different conclusions illustrate the complex effects of forest litter types on interception however for semi arid steppes the influence of litter type on interception was not obvious the leaves of grassland plants are mostly slender and their leaf types have little difference a study had found that in the semi arid steppe the stem and leaf weight ratio and decomposition degree of litter are the key factors affecting the water holding capacity of litter and have nothing to do with plant species xie and su 2020 this makes it possible to study the interception process of litter in semi arid steppe in a more extensive way without regard to plant species but the related research is still insufficient simulating precipitation is one of the commonly used methods for studying litter interception neto et al 2012 li et al 2013 sato et al 2004 xia et al 2019 compared with actual precipitation it can simulate more extreme precipitation conditions and control variables such as wind speed and slope at the same time this helps to set a more reasonable precipitation intensity gradient allowing scholars to focus more on the impact of precipitation conditions on litter interception furthermore the setting of a reasonable precipitation gradient also helps to establish a more reasonable litter interception model the changes in the hydrological process of the ecosystem caused by the accumulation of litter are gradually receiving attention and the litter interception model has become one of the important contents of the evaluation of the water cycle system in some areas for example the litter interception models established in three commercial forests in south africa were used to supplement the local water resource planning model bulcock and jewitt 2012 models established in tropical eucalyptus plantations were used to predict local interception by litter neto et al 2012 however for the semi arid grassland ecosystem which is sensitive to precipitation although the establishment of litter interception model is very necessary for the assessment of effective water resources related research is still lacking the main purpose of this study is to establish and supplement the dynamic interception model of litter in semi arid grassland the specific research contents are as follows 1 according to the characteristics of litter interception a dynamic model of the litter interception process in semi arid grassland was first established 2 through the precipitation simulation system the interception processes of four kinds of litter with different accumulation under four rainfall intensities were recorded and their results were brought into the previous dynamic model for verification 3 based on the litter mass lm and rainfall intensity ri a model that is more suitable for applications can be established by the conversion of coefficients 2 materials and methods 2 1 litter interception process model the interception of litter is a dynamic process that takes place from the moment the water reaches the top of the litter layer until the water holding capacity of the litter layer is reached which is also the process of water absorbing of litter it involves a dynamic equilibrium between a series of complex mechanical actions such as adhesion surface tension deformation forces gravity and adsorption forces although the interception between these mechanical forces is complex the dynamic change of litter interception process from the beginning to the end is easier to understand theoretically the rate of interception should be the highest at the beginning of the litter interception process because the litter is in a relatively dry state with the increase of intercepted water and the decrease of the water potential difference between inside and outside of the litter layer the rate of interception gradually decreases ultimately the interception will reach its maximum value with the interception speed approaching zero and the entire litter layer achieving dynamic water balance the dynamic interception should vary between zero no interception and maximum interception therefore the performance of the change in litter interception ratio should be an exponential function from 0 to 1 with the growth rate gradually decreases and approaches zero 1 i i m 1 e k t 0 α 1 0 i i m where is the interception ratio t is the interception time duration h i is the dynamic interception at a given time mm i m is the maximum interception mm and k is the exponential coefficient of the litter interception when t 0 the dynamic interception is 0 i e i 0 the dynamics of interception ratios with different exponential coefficients k is shown in the figure 1 the given time interception of litter can be transformed by equation 1 2 i i m 1 e k t 0 i i m 2 2 study area the research site fig 2 is in eastern hulunbuir grassland the grassland is connected with the outer baikal grassland in russia to the north and the eastern mongolian grassland to the west it belongs to the eurasian grassland and is a typical semi arid meadow steppe the terrain belongs to the combination of landforms in the hills and high plains with an elevation of 700 800m the area is within the temperate continental climate the annual precipitation is 300 350mm 70 of which is in summer and autumn from june to august the average daily evapotranspiration et of different communities in the growing season june to august is 0 9mm 24h to 2 8mm 24h and the average daily infiltration is 1 4mm 24h to 3 3mm 24h 2 3 sampling the litter samples used in this study were all taken from the area shown in figure 2 three different types of steppes were selected including a seven year enclosed steppe typical plants leymus chinensis stipa baicalensis cleistogenes squarrosa klasea centauroides et al a three year enclosed steppe typical plants leymus chinensis cleistogenes squarrosa carex duriuscula calamagrostis epigeios et al and a normal grazing steppe typical plants leymus chinensis artemisia frigida poa annua potentilla chinensis et al seven regions were randomly selected from each steppe using a 100m sample line and three 1m by 1m quadrats were randomly selected from each region along the sample line the litter in each quadrat was collected after the green parts of plants above the ground were mowed by scissors the mixed soils were separated by 20 mesh sieve after natural drying a study found that the ratio of stem to leaf mass of litter in grassland can affect its maximum interception xie and su 2020 therefore we mixed the litter samples from the three steppes respectively to achieve the purpose that the experimental materials can represent the water holding capacity of litter in each steppe 2 4 measuring system of interception the interception measurement was conducted in the laboratory and the measuring system is shown in figure 3 it was comprised of four parts including of a simulated precipitation device with sprayer valve and a water holding tank a device to hold the litter samples 25 cm in diameter an electronic balance quintix5102 1cn sartorius goettingen germany with an accuracy of 10 mg and a computer for data recording the same method was also used in a study of alfalfa canopy precipitation interception jiao et al 2016 as shown in figure 3 the simulated precipitation device with adjustable spray intensity was placed half a meter above the collection device the droplet size of the sprinkler spray varied from 1 15mm to 4 12 mm and the speed varied from 1 27 to 2 79 m s a collection device is used to hold the litter to record the mass of intercepted water and the water that is not intercepted can flow out through the drain pipe to prevent litter debris from being washed away by water during the experiment a plastic net with an average diameter of 1 5 mm was put on the bottom of the litter sample all plastic nets and the inner walls of the device were sprayed with hydrophobic solution company ecleanstar product code jsyjx101 6 before the experiment after drying they can be used to carry out experiments to prevent moisture from trapping on the plastic net and the inner wall of the device to cause errors in the simulated rainfall process the change in the intercepted water volume of the litter in the collection device will be calculated by the electronic balance and automatically recorded in the computer 2 5 experimental procedures this study used a two factor cross grouping design with four litter weight gradients 50 100 200 300 g m2 and four simulated precipitation intensity gradients 5 10 20 40mm h and each combination repeated three times the litter weight gradient was set by changing the litter weight in the sample tray keeping the area constant the way to set the precipitation intensity gradient was to keep the total amount of water constant and change the duration of precipitation the specific design of experimental duration spray intervals spray times and water volume for one spray are listed as table 1 2 6 statistical analyses this research uses spss statistics 20 matlab r2017a and origin 2018 for statistical analysis and plotting of data the following indicators are used to evaluate the litter interception model 1 the goodness of fit r2 to measure the overall fit of the regression equation the closer the value of r² is to 1 the better the fit of the model 2 the mean absolute error mae to accurately reflect the size of the error between the actual value and the predicted value the closer the mae value is to 1 the smaller the error 3 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ens to verify the quality of the hydrological model simulation results ens is close to 1 indicating that the model is of good quality and the model has high reliability ens is close to 0 indicating that the simulation result is close to the average level of the observations that is the overall result is credible but the process simulation error is large when ens is far less than 0 the model is untrustworthy 3 results 3 1 interception processes in the interception process i i m 1 e k t the two factor cross grouping results of four litter masses and four precipitation intensity are shown in figure 4 and table 2 the actual results and theoretical results have high fitting accuracy the value of r2 ranges from 0 908 to 0 992 and all the values of p are less than 0 001 the mean absolute error mae is small with the range from 0 010 to 0 047 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ens is ranged from 0 525 to 0 997 which indicates the high reliability of the model 2 the interception increased rapidly in the initial stage but the growth rate gradually slowed down and approached zero with the passage of time until the maximum interception was reached under the same precipitation intensity the maximum interception i m increases with the increase of litter weight under the same litter mass the greater the simulated precipitation intensity the shorter the time to reach the maximum interception 3 2 model coefficients as important coefficients of the litter interception process model i m can express the maximum interception during precipitation and the k can express the time to reach the maximum

combining with the linear fitting results figure 6 that the range of i m is 0 481 1 425mm which has a significant positive correlation with the litter mass has no correlation with rainfall intensity the range of k is 3 664 18 48 which has a significant positive correlation with rainfall intensity has no correlation with litter mass the linear fitting model of i m is 3 i m 0 003 l m 0 44 r 2 0 79

it can be seen from the comparison between the theoretical value and the actual value of eq 5 figure 7 that the distribution of the two is relatively uniform and there is no significant difference 4 discussion the higher coefficients of determination in the fitting results r 2 0 908 0 992 table 2 prove that the hypothetical model of litter interception process i i m 1 e k t in this study has higher accuracy many constructions of interception related models are based on exponential functions as same as this study rutter et al 1975 jiao et al 2016 rutter et al 1971 the basic assumption of our litter interception model is that there must be a sufficiently long time interval between adjacent rains so that the litter remains sufficiently dry before each rain the initial interception is 0 this is the same as some interception models of forest canopy such as the gash model gash 1979 zeng model zeng et al 2000 and murakami model murakami 2007 the measurement of i m in this study is based on the dynamic precipitation which makes the water absorption rate of the litter itself and the formation rate of interstitial water in the litter structure slower than in the case of flooding zagyvai kiss et al 2019 xie and su 2020 this is the reason why the maximum interception and water holding capacity of litter are not always the same and it can also partially explain the reason why the fitted i m is slightly smaller than the measured i m in this study figure 4 as important coefficients in the model the i m determines the upper limit of the model s results and is mainly affected by lm figure 6 the k determines the speed at which i approach i m and is mainly affected by ri figure 6 different from some models that use the water balance method to predict the canopy interception loss xiao et al 2000 massman 1983 rutter et al 1971 rutter et al 1975 the key to the application of the model in this study is the easy to obtain feature of the maximum interception of litter in meadow steppe the maximum interception of forest canopy varies greatly among different communities coners et al 2016 but the water holding capacity of litter in semi arid steppe is less affected by the plant types xie and su 2020 this makes it feasible to use a uniform litter maximum interception model in different communities in semi arid steppe the results of this study also show that there is a significant positive linear relationship between lm and i m and lm can be used to convert i m eq 3 in addition there is a significant positive linear relationship between the coefficient k and ri and ri can be used to convert k eq 4 therefore this enables eq 5 to be obtained by transforming the coefficients in equation 2 the interception prediction model i 0 003 l m 0 44 1 e 0 33 r i 3 76 t r 2 0

characteristics of litter during precipitation in addition as an important hydrological process in semi arid steppes the litter interception prediction model can be used as an important supplement to researches on water balance rose et al 2011 coners et al 2016 quansah et al 2017 however the ens 0 27 close to 0 indicates that although the overall result of model 5 is reliable its process simulation error is large this litter interception model model 5 still has some shortcomings that need to be improved in subsequent studies 1 the assumption that the litter must be in a dry state before each precipitation makes the prediction results larger when in two adjacent precipitations with short intervals 2 in some steppe communities with large above ground biomass short term low intensity precipitation will interfere with the estimation of litter interception due to the interception of the plant canopy 3 although the evaporation area of the litter layer is much smaller than that of the forest canopy it is still necessary to consider the evaporation intensity during the precipitation process otherwise the prediction result of this model will be smaller than the actual interception loss 4 it can be seen from eq 3 that there is still room for improvement in the accuracy of the conversion model between i m and lm subdividing lm into stem weight and leaf weight can help to accurately determine the maximum interception between litter in different steppe communities xie and su 2020 5 conclusion in this study we established a hypothetical model of the litter

972,as a common measure for grassland restoration the fence for prohibition of grazing is usually applied to the steppe in northern china a study in hulunbuir grassland showed the average litter mass in the steppes that enclosed for ten years can reach 70 550g m2 the excessive accumulation of litter caused by long term grazing prohibition can intercept more precipitation which will reduce the water available to grassland plants and hinder the further recovery of plant communities therefore the establishment of a reasonable litter interception model can help estimating the interception of steppes with different litter accumulation and provide some theoretical support for the formulation of fencing policies based on the model of litter interception rate change we established a dynamic interception model of litter i i m 1 e k t t time i dynamic interception i m maximum interception k exponential coefficient of litter interception after testing by an indoor simulated rainfall experiment we found that this model has high accuracy r 2 0 908 0 992 the litter mass lm determines the maximum interception and the rainfall intensity ri determines the speed of interception which

easily obtainable characteristics of lm and ri data make this model easy to apply keywords steppe litter interception litter mass rainfall intensity litter interception rate hulunbuir glassland litter interception process model maximum litter interception 1 introduction fences for grazing prohibition is the main method for solving the degradation problem caused by overgrazing hu and guillemin 2016 in semi arid steppes northern china in the process of grazing prohibition the development of plant communities can be mainly divided into two stages according to the time sequence the first stage is community recovery the diversity and coverage of plant community will increase lv et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 the second stage is suspended recovery cheng and zou 1998 the aboveground biomass growth rate of plant community will slow down yang and zhang 2005 liu et al 2005 and along with the community richness diversity and species evenness show a downward trend in some grasslands lamb 2008 yan and tang 2007 the excessive accumulation of litter is generally considered to be one of the main reasons that limiting the further growth and development of plant communities in steppes with prohibition of grazing immo et al 2016 lamb 2008 wu et al 2013 due to the lack of livestock trampling the contact between litter and soil is insufficient which will decrease the decomposition rate of litter and then leads to a large accumulation of litter in a long term fenced grassland wu et al 2013 lamb 2008 this will significantly increase the rainfall interception of litter layer and result in the drying of the soil layer under litter a study in russia founds that overgrazing and litter accumulation had a significant negative correlation with species richness immo et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to clarify the rainfall interception process of different accumulation of litter which can provide part of the theoretical support for the formulation of a reasonable fencing plan as the main source of water in semi arid steppes precipitation not only affects the ecological functions and productivity of plant communities svoray and karnieli 2011 but also an important driving force for community succession sherry et al 2012 the precipitation level in semi arid steppe will influence the competitive advantage of plant under continuous arid or humid conditions and it has a complicated regulation mechanism for plant seed germination plant development and litter accumulation sherry et al 2012 excessive accumulation of litter will significantly increase rainfall interception which will reduce the water available to the plants in this situation some plants with poor drought resistance will lose their growth advantages hobbs et al 2007 and some rhizome type plants will multiply due to their strong drought resistance resulting in the increase in species differences among different communities in the long term fenced grassland lv et al 2008 in the dry period of the semi arid grassland most of the rainfall is with low intensity which makes the litter with more accumulation have a greater rainfall interception effect hou et al 2019 therefore the interception of litter in semi arid grasslands is an important hydrological process in general the interception process i can be defined as the sum of the change in interception storage si and the evaporation ei i d s i d t e i in the case of litter interception i l the process can also be described as the difference between the net precipitation p l and the infiltration f l i l p l f l gerrits and savenijie 2011 there are three main factors that affect the interception of litter layer rainfall conditions litter characteristics leaf type litter accumulation and thickness et al gerrits and savenijie 2011 van stan ii et al 2017 and the potential evaporation the water holding capacity of litter differs per litter type or forest floor type and thickness or mass gerrits et al 2010 and the frequency of precipitation have a large influence on the interception process sato et al 2004 gerrits et al 2007 although potential evaporation has a smaller impact on interception during precipitation it can still increase interception during a long term precipitation scholars conclusions about the influence of forest litter type on interception were not uniform for example studies had found that broad leaved litter can intercept more water than needle leaved litter xia et al 2019 li et al 2013 however it had also been found that needle leaved litter and broad leaved litter have almost the same water holding capacity zagyvai kiss et al 2019 furthermore the laminar structure of broad leaved litter had been found to form a transverse moving passage for rainwater under a certain slope resulting in less rainwater held by broad leaved litter than by needle leaved litter zhao et al 2019 a study from the eastern forests of the united states found that the interception by the empty fruiting heads is considerable ranging from 2 6 to 218 5 of the incident gross precipitation with a mean of 42 7 levia et al 2004 these different conclusions illustrate the complex effects of forest litter types on interception however for semi arid steppes the influence of litter type on interception was not obvious the leaves of grassland plants are mostly slender and their leaf types have little difference a study had found that in the semi arid steppe the stem and leaf weight ratio and decomposition degree of litter are the key factors affecting the water holding capacity of litter and have nothing to do with plant species xie and su 2020 this makes it possible to study the interception process of litter in semi arid steppe in a more extensive way without regard to plant species but the related research is still insufficient simulating precipitation is one of the commonly used methods for studying litter interception neto et al 2012 li et al 2013 sato et al 2004 xia et al 2019 compared with actual precipitation it can simulate more extreme precipitation conditions and control variables such as wind speed and slope at the same time this helps to set a more reasonable precipitation intensity gradient allowing scholars to focus more on the impact of precipitation conditions on litter interception furthermore the setting of a reasonable precipitation gradient also helps to establish a more reasonable litter interception model the changes in the hydrological process of the ecosystem caused by the accumulation of litter are gradually receiving attention and the litter interception model has become one of the important contents of the evaluation of the water cycle system in some areas for example the litter interception models established in three commercial forests in south africa were used to supplement the local water resource planning model bulcock and jewitt 2012 models established in tropical eucalyptus plantations were used to predict local interception by litter neto et al 2012 however for the semi arid grassland ecosystem which is sensitive to precipitation although the establishment of litter interception model is very necessary for the assessment of effective water resources related research is still lacking the main purpose of this study is to establish and supplement the dynamic interception model of litter in semi arid grassland the specific research contents are as follows 1 according to the characteristics of litter interception a dynamic model of the litter interception process in semi arid grassland was first established 2 through the precipitation simulation system the interception processes of four kinds of litter with different accumulation under four rainfall intensities were recorded and their results were brought into the previous dynamic model for verification 3 based on the litter mass lm and rainfall intensity ri a model that is more suitable for applications can be established by the conversion of coefficients 2 materials and methods 2 1 litter interception process model the interception of litter is a dynamic process that takes place from the moment the water reaches the top of the litter layer until the water holding capacity of the litter layer is reached which is also the process of water absorbing of litter it involves a dynamic equilibrium between a series of complex mechanical actions such as adhesion surface tension deformation forces gravity and adsorption forces although the interception between these mechanical forces is complex the dynamic change of litter interception process from the beginning to the end is easier to understand theoretically the rate of interception should be the highest at the beginning of the litter interception process because the litter is in a relatively dry state with the increase of intercepted water and the decrease of the water potential difference between inside and outside of the litter layer the rate of interception gradually decreases ultimately the interception will reach its maximum value with the interception speed approaching zero and the entire litter layer achieving dynamic water balance the dynamic interception should vary between zero no interception and maximum interception therefore the performance of the change in litter interception ratio should be an exponential function from 0 to 1 with the growth rate gradually decreases and approaches zero 1 i i m 1 e k t 0 α 1 0 i i m where is the interception ratio t is the interception time duration h i is the dynamic interception at a given time mm i m is the maximum interception mm and k is the exponential coefficient of the litter interception when t 0 the dynamic interception is 0 i e i 0 the dynamics of interception ratios with different exponential coefficients k is shown in the figure 1 the given time interception of litter can be transformed by equation 1 2 i i m 1 e k t 0 i i m 2 2 study area the research site fig 2 is in eastern hulunbuir grassland the grassland is connected with the outer baikal grassland in russia to the north and the eastern mongolian grassland to the west it belongs to the eurasian grassland and is a typical semi arid meadow steppe the terrain belongs to the combination of landforms in the hills and high plains with an elevation of 700 800m the area is within the temperate continental climate the annual precipitation is 300 350mm 70 of which is in summer and autumn from june to august the average daily evapotranspiration et of different communities in the growing season june to august is 0 9mm 24h to 2 8mm 24h and the average daily infiltration is 1 4mm 24h to 3 3mm 24h 2 3 sampling the litter samples used in this study were all taken from the area shown in figure 2 three different types of steppes were selected including a seven year enclosed steppe typical plants leymus chinensis stipa baicalensis cleistogenes squarrosa klasea centauroides et al a three year enclosed steppe typical plants leymus chinensis cleistogenes squarrosa carex duriuscula calamagrostis epigeios et al and a normal grazing steppe typical plants leymus chinensis artemisia frigida poa annua potentilla chinensis et al seven regions were randomly selected from each steppe using a 100m sample line and three 1m by 1m quadrats were randomly selected from each region along the sample line the litter in each quadrat was collected after the green parts of plants above the ground were mowed by scissors the mixed soils were separated by 20 mesh sieve after natural drying a study found that the ratio of stem to leaf mass of litter in grassland can affect its maximum interception xie and su 2020 therefore we mixed the litter samples from the three steppes respectively to achieve the purpose that the experimental materials can represent the water holding capacity of litter in each steppe 2 4 measuring system of interception the interception measurement was conducted in the laboratory and the measuring system is shown in figure 3 it was comprised of four parts including of a simulated precipitation device with sprayer valve and a water holding tank a device to hold the litter samples 25 cm in diameter an electronic balance quintix5102 1cn sartorius goettingen germany with an accuracy of 10 mg and a computer for data recording the same method was also used in a study of alfalfa canopy precipitation interception jiao et al 2016 as shown in figure 3 the simulated precipitation device with adjustable spray intensity was placed half a meter above the collection device the droplet size of the sprinkler spray varied from 1 15mm to 4 12 mm and the speed varied from 1 27 to 2 79 m s a collection device is used to hold the litter to record the mass of intercepted water and the water that is not intercepted can flow out through the drain pipe to prevent litter debris from being washed away by water during the experiment a plastic net with an average diameter of 1 5 mm was put on the bottom of the litter sample all plastic nets and the inner walls of the device were sprayed with hydrophobic solution company ecleanstar product code jsyjx101 6 before the experiment after drying they can be used to carry out experiments to prevent moisture from trapping on the plastic net and the inner wall of the device to cause errors in the simulated rainfall process the change in the intercepted water volume of the litter in the collection device will be calculated by the electronic balance and automatically recorded in the computer 2 5 experimental procedures this study used a two factor cross grouping design with four litter weight gradients 50 100 200 300 g m2 and four simulated precipitation intensity gradients 5 10 20 40mm h and each combination repeated three times the litter weight gradient was set by changing the litter weight in the sample tray keeping the area constant the way to set the precipitation intensity gradient was to keep the total amount of water constant and change the duration of precipitation the specific design of experimental duration spray intervals spray times and water volume for one spray are listed as table 1 2 6 statistical analyses this research uses spss statistics 20 matlab r2017a and origin 2018 for statistical analysis and plotting of data the following indicators are used to evaluate the litter interception model 1 the goodness of fit r2 to measure the overall fit of the regression equation the closer the value of r² is to 1 the better the fit of the model 2 the mean absolute error mae to accurately reflect the size of the error between the actual value and the predicted value the closer the mae value is to 1 the smaller the error 3 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ens to verify the quality of the hydrological model simulation results ens is close to 1 indicating that the model is of good quality and the model has high reliability ens is close to 0 indicating that the simulation result is close to the average level of the observations that is the overall result is credible but the process simulation error is large when ens is far less than 0 the model is untrustworthy 3 results 3 1 interception processes in the interception process i i m 1 e k t the two factor cross grouping results of four litter masses and four precipitation intensity are shown in figure 4 and table 2 the actual results and theoretical results have high fitting accuracy the value of r2 ranges from 0 908 to 0 992 and all the values of p are less than 0 001 the mean absolute error mae is small with the range from 0 010 to 0 047 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ens is ranged from 0 525 to 0 997 which indicates the high reliability of the model 2 the interception increased rapidly in the initial stage but the growth rate gradually slowed down and approached zero with the passage of time until the maximum interception was reached under the same precipitation intensity the maximum interception i m increases with the increase of litter weight under the same litter mass the greater the simulated precipitation intensity the shorter the time to reach the maximum interception 3 2 model coefficients as important coefficients of the litter interception process model i m can express the maximum interception during precipitation and the k can express the time to reach the maximum interception we constructed an observation figure figure 5 of the change trend of i m and k under different litter mass and precipitation intensity through interpolation method it can be seen by

973,understanding soil water dynamics and their influencing factors is an important basis for formulating efficient water use strategies aimed at alleviating water stress especially in areas with water shortages in this research six plots with different densities were designed to systematically analyze the influences of phragmites australis density and groundwater level on soil water in a semiarid wetland 1 the phragmites australis density had a negative influence on the soil water in the 0 40 cm profile and from april to august 2 the phragmites australis density had a positive effect on the annual variation degree of the soil water storage the water replenishment could be implemented in april and june for low and high phragmites australis densities respectively 3 the groundwater level had a significant influence on the soil water content of the 0 50 cm layer and the change was positively correlated with the phragmites australis density the influence of groundwater level on soil water was more influential than that of phragmites australis density 4 the suitable average groundwater depth for the 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 densities were 76 cm 63 cm 50 cm 37 cm 23 cm and 10 cm respectively the suitable average densities of phragmites australis for the groundwater depth of 35 cm 40 cm 45 cm and 50 cm were 62 55 47 and 40 respectively this research can provide a theoretical support for the management of phragmites australis density and groundwater level in the baiyangdian wetland keywords phragmites australis density groundwater level surface soil water content water distribution in the soil profile soil water storage timing of water replenishment 1 introduction wetlands provide many important ecosystem services to human society such as biodiversity conservation and water quality improvement engelhardt and ritchie 2001 ricaurte et al 2012 as an important medium of material exchange in the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac soil water plays an important role in the ecological hydrological process of wetland ecosystems plants roots can uptake water from soil recharged by precipitation or groundwater zhang et al 2017 and thus soil water can affect vegetation health and ecological water consumption in the spac system and reflect water profit and loss sala et al 1981 li et al 2005 chikamoto et al 2015 ventrella et al 2019 since soil water dynamics are an important basis for formulating water use strategies in wetland management understanding the characteristics of soil moisture variations is of great significance for the alleviation of water stress under the influences of climate change and human activities especially in areas with water shortages thus research on variations in soil water dynamics and their influencing factors has been widely conducted li et al 2015 it is agreed that groundwater level is a direct factor affecting soil water dynamics muneepeerakul et al 2008 zhu et al 2015 the fluctuation of groundwater level has a significant impact on soil water distribution and affects crop growth and development kandil and willardson 1992 kang et al 2002 matsuo et al 2013 karimov et al 2014 xu et al 2016 most relevant studies have focused on the health of agricultural ecosystems and related research results are expected to expand to wetland ecosystems the vegetation pattern of an area is another important factor affecting soil water dynamics generally vegetation coverage increases evapotranspiration for example phragmites australis p australis a kind of reed is the most widely distributed and the largest community type in wetland ecosystems brix et al 2001 borin et al 2011 and greatly affects the ecohydrological processes of lakes the evapotranspiration of shallow lakes dominated by p australis is one to seven times as high as the evaporation of water bodies without vegetation coverage baird 1999 zhou and zhou 2009 vegetation density as one of the commonly used indicators to characterize vegetation structure has a significant impact on water transport and dissipation in the spac system especially in soil water zhang and schilling 2006 chen et al 2007 fu et al 2012 she et al 2014 however most of these studies on the impact of vegetation density on soil water have focused on ecosystems other than wetlands such as forest and grassland ecosystems these research results provide technical support for supporting sustainable water resource utilization in forest and grassland ecosystems therefore it is of great significance to analyze the soil water dynamics with different vegetation densities for the efficient utilization of regional water resources through vegetation density management in wetland ecosystems under high water shortage pressure to alleviate water stress and protect vulnerable wetland ecosystems in semiarid areas some artificial water supplement projects are often implemented to raise lake water levels wang et al 2013 in addition vegetation densities can be changed to maintain suitable soil water content and reduce ecological water consumption in the spac system of p australis in the wetland ecology and environmental management an interesting problem arises and is worthy of in depth investigation as far as groundwater level and vegetation density are concerned which factor is more influential on soil water therefore it is necessary to deeply and jointly analyze the influences of vegetation density and groundwater on soil water dynamics in wetlands this information can provide a theoretical basis and technical support for vegetation density and groundwater level management with the aim of improving the utilization efficiency of water resources and the ecological environment taking the baiyangdian wetland in the semiarid area in china as the research area the overall aims of this study were to analyze and evaluate the dynamic characteristics of the soil water of the p australis community in wetlands with different vegetation densities and groundwater level fluctuations through the comparison method of experimental observations additionally we wanted to determine which of these two parameters was more influential on soil water compared with previous studies in which the effects of vegetation density and groundwater depth on soil water were rarely simultaneously considered in wetland ecosystems zhang and schilling 2006 chen et al 2007 fu et al 2012 she et al 2014 liu 2014 this study gave an in depth investigation on the soil water dynamics with detailed comparisons of these two impact factors in the spac system of p australis during vegetation growth periods in a semiarid area in addition rather than focused on one aspect of soil water as has been done in most existing studies zhang and schilling 2006 chen et al 2007 she et al 2014 this study performed a systematic analysis from four perspectives including the surface water content the water distribution in the soil profile the coefficient of variation of soil water and soil water storage it is beneficial to expand the current methods used for the restoration of hydrological or environmental elements that are only focused on engineering treatment this study can provide a theoretical basis for the ecological and hydrological management specifically vegetation density and groundwater level management of wetland systems and provide a new perspective for research on wetland health maintenance and protection through the interaction of patterns and processes of ecology and hydrology under a changing environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the baiyangdian wetland 38 43 39 02 n and 115 38 116 07 e in the xiong an new area fig 1 is the largest freshwater lake in the north china plain which is mostly in the semiarid area the wetland lies in the middle reaches of the daqing river basin and discharges into the bohai gulf yellow sea it is a grass type shallow lake consisting of 143 islands and 67 km2 of p australis marshes with a 31 200 km2 catchment the lake surface area is 366 km2 and the average amount of water inflow is 908 million m3 wang et al 2014a 2014b there are natural low lying depressions and p australis marshes wang et al 2012 the regional climate is a warm temperate continental monsoon climate in baiyangdian wetland the average annual precipitation is 524 8 mm and about 67 of the precipitation is from june to september the average annual evaporation of water surfaces is 1369 mm the average annual potential evapotranspiration of the baiyangdian wetland from 1972 to 2012 is 993 0 mm the average annual temperature is 12 8 c july has the maximum temperature and the average is 26 9 c january has the minimum temperature and the average is 4 7 c in baiyangdian wetland which has high water shortage pressure it is necessary to deeply and jointly analyze the influences of vegetation density and groundwater on soil water dynamics for the efficient utilization of regional water resources through vegetation density and groundwater level management the observation area is located in raised fields the middle area of the baiyangdian wetland which is dominated by p australis under natural conditions the coordinates of the observation area are 115 98 e and 38 87 n the total area is 1 km2 and the terrain is flat the type of soil in the experimental field is sandy loam and there is no significant difference in the profile of 0 120cm there were six p australis density plots of 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 with each plot being 10 m 10 m and a 5 m interval between plots fig 1 because the groundwater depth of the raised fields of observation area is small the water movement and dissipation are dominated by vertical infiltration and evapotranspiration rather than a lateral flow between different plots at the same we thought a 5 m interval between different plots was enough interval distance therefore we considered the soil water of a plot would be mainly affected by groundwater and evapotranspiration of this plot and the influence of adjacent plots on soil water was small the water supply source of each experimental plot was precipitation taking the natural condition of p australis in the area as 100 density it is approximately 40 plants m2 the densities of the s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 and s6 plots were 0 plants m2 8 plants m2 16 plants m2 24 plants m2 32 plants m2 and 40 plants m2 respectively in the research vegetation density management in each plot was achieved mainly through the strip cut method every 10 days 2 2 data collection and processing 2 2 1 measurement of soil water content and groundwater level a 120 cm observation tube of soil water and a groundwater level observation well were installed in the middle of each plot for each p australis density experimental plot a divier 2000 portable soil water content measuring instrument sentek pty ltd australia based on the frequency domain reflection principle was used to measure the volumetric water content of the 0 120 cm soil profile in each plot the measurement interval of the soil water in the 0 120 cm profile was 10 cm the monitoring period was from may 16 2018 to september 30 2018 covering the whole growing period of p australis the monitoring interval was 15 days and it was shortened after heavy rainfall 2 2 2 calculation of soil water storage the divier 2000 measuring instrument was used to measure the dynamic characteristics of the volumetric water content of the 0 120 cm soil profile from the surface layer every 10 cm interval the total soil water storage of the 0 120 cm profile was calculated using the following formula 1 s w s 10 i 1 n θ i δ z where sws is the soil water storage of the 0 120 cm profile mm n is the number of soil water observation layers in the monitoring plot n 12 θ i is the volumetric water content in layer i of the soil profile cm3 cm3 δ z is the depth interval of the soil water measurement cm and δ z 10 cm and the factor 10 is for the conversion of cm to mm 2 2 3 calculation of the average water content in the soil profile for the 0 120 cm soil profile of the experimental plot the average volumetric water content of the soil profile was calculated by the following formula 2 s w mean 1 n i 1 n θ i where sw mean is the average volumetric water content of the 0 120 cm soil profile cm3 cm3 n is the number of soil water observation layers in the monitoring plot n 12 and θ i is the volumetric water content in layer i of the soil profile cm3 cm3 2 2 4 coefficient of variation of soil water content cv the variation coefficient of soil water content was used to quantitatively express the dynamic change characteristics of soil water content on a vertical spatial scale and time scale and was defined as follows 3 c v σ μ 100 where σ is the standard deviation of the soil water content and μ is the average soil water content cm3 cm3 the coefficient of variation of soil water content can be used to analyze the relative change degree of the soil water content under different vegetation densities the higher values indicate more intense changes in soil water content the lower values indicate the soil water content was relatively stable 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of soil water content under different groundwater levels fig 2 shows the fluctuations of groundwater depths in the experimental plots in the growth period it illustrated that groundwater depths did not vary orderly with the gradual increase of vegetation densities in other words vegetation densities had no regular effects on groundwater depths actually as for the baiyangdian wetland located in semiarid areas was concerned some artificial water supplement projects were often implemented with the aim of raising water levels to alleviate regional water stress in addition the experimental raised field was surrounded by water of wetland variations of groundwater depths of each experimental raised field were mainly affected by variations of water levels in the wetland in view of these facts we thought the differences in groundwater depths among different plots were mainly affected by microtopography of the experimental raised field rather than vegetation density and thus influences of the vegetation density on the groundwater level was not stressed in this study the groundwater depth fluctuations were obvious during the year from may to july p australis was in a period of rapid growth and development the groundwater level in all vegetation density plots continued to decline and the groundwater depth continued to rise from july to september due to the flood season and the increase in rainfall in the baiyangdian wetland the groundwater level increased significantly and the groundwater depth decreased there was a close relationship between groundwater depth and water dynamics in the vadose zone and the groundwater level was usually the lower boundary of the vadose zone in this research the partial correlation coefficient and pearson correlation coefficient were used to analyze the relationship between groundwater level and soil profile water content when p australis density was the control variable the partial correlation coefficients between groundwater depth and soil water content at different profile depths are shown in table 1 performed by spss 24 0 software there was a significant linear negative correlation between the groundwater depth and the soil water content of the 0 50 cm profile and the correlation level decreased significantly with increasing depth however there wasn t a significant linear correlation between the groundwater depth and the soil water content of the 50 120 cm profile the reason was that there was a constant value of the capillary rise in the depth range of 50 120 cm in the study plot under the fluctuation characteristics of current groundwater depth in the study area the variations in soil water content were not obvious in the depth range of 50 120 cm 3 2 analysis of surface soil water contents under different phragmites australis densities the variations in surface soil water content 0 10 cm under the low and high densities of p australis are shown in fig 3 during the early growth period of p australis from april to the end of june the surface soil water content under the low p australis density 0 40 was significantly lower than that under the high p australis density 60 100 and the discrepancy of surface soil water content between high p australis density and low p australis density was 5 11 fig 3 from april to june there was less precipitation total 2 73 cm and p australis was in the early stage of germination and growth in the study area the water requirement of p australis transpiration did not reach the maximum level however the evaporation of soil played a leading role at this stage the branches of high density p australis had a certain role in blocking solar radiation decreasing soil evaporation and alleviating the loss of soil water content from july to the middle of august the discrepancies in the surface soil water content between low density and high density p australis were small with less than 2 the main reason for this was that with the increase in rainfall the soil water contents showed an increasing trend and sufficient rainfall reduced the differences in soil water contents between different densities however from september to the end of october the surface soil water contents under low p australis density were significantly higher than those under high vegetation density and the discrepancies in the surface soil water content between high p australis density and low p australis density were 1 4 during this stage the rainfall decreased and p australis was stable until the terminal stage the transpiration of p australis was still maintained at a high level with continuous root water uptake from the soil in addition to the significant discrepancy in surface soil water content between high and low densities of p australis there were some similarities in the surface soil water contents between high and low densities in the entire growth period for example the changing trend within the year of surface soil water content between low density and high density conditions was consistent generally from april to the end of june the surface soil water contents of p australis decreased continuously 52 and 43 decline range for low and high vegetation density respectively due to the increase in evapotranspiration of p australis with the arrival of the rainy season and the increase in rainfall the surface soil water content began to increase rapidly however there was a slight decrease 2 and 3 decline range for low and high vegetation density respectively in the surface soil water contents between the middle of july and early august the main reason may be that the temperature and solar radiation in this period reached the highest values during the year leading to the highest water consumption by evapotranspiration specifically the average evapotranspiration was 9 9 mm d in this stage which was 10 higher than the annual average therefore the surface soil water content declined slightly from the middle of september to the withering timing of p australis the surface soil water content showed a temporary decrease fig 3 the main reason may be the increase in soil evaporation at the late growth period of p australis 3 3 analysis of water distributions in the soil profile under different p australis densities the water content distribution characteristics of the 0 120 cm soil profile in the growth period under different p australis densities and months in 2018 are shown in fig 4 first compared with the soil water distribution of the 0 120 cm profile in different months the results showed that the soil water content increased gradually from the surface to the deep layer under each p australis density condition between april and august 2018 however after september the differences in soil water contents at different depths within the 0 120 cm profile were small for each p australis density 3 9 7 2 difference range for 0 100 density and close to the saturated water contents fig 4 f the main reason was that the water discharged upstream in the flood season began to flow into the baiyangdian wetland and the continuous rise of the water level in the wetland effectively supplemented the soil water content at each depth resulting in only small discrepancies among the soil water contents at different depths from april to august compared with the soil water distribution under different densities the p australis density influenced the soil water at each depth of 0 120 cm the soil water content in the entire profile under low p australis density was relatively high and it showed a downward trend with increasing p australis density especially at the 0 40 cm depth of the soil profile the average difference range of soil water content between high and low densities during april to august was 40 4 fig 4 however at the 50 120 cm depth of the soil profile the difference in soil water content between high density and low density plots was relatively small the average value of this difference from april to august was 6 5 and the soil water content was close to the saturated soil water content at each depth the main reason was that there were many artificial ecological water transfer projects in 2018 and the high water level in the baiyangdian wetland throughout the year therefore the p australis density had a significant effect on the soil water content in the 0 40 cm depth range in the study area this was the depth at which water content showed most changes for p australis transpiration soil evaporation and rainfall infiltration the consumption and supplementation of water led to significant differences in soil water among different densities in summary the density of p australis had a significant effect on soil water in the 0 40 cm profile and between april and august when the gap between water supply and demand was most prominent this characteristic indicated that attention should be paid to the appropriate time to replenish water in water resources planning and management from the perspective of water consumption of the spac 3 4 variation coefficients of soil water content under different p australis densities to quantitatively describe the dynamic characteristics of the soil water contents under different p australis densities on vertical spatial scale and temporal scale the variation coefficient of soil water content was used for evaluation according to eq 3 variation coefficients for the soil water contents under different densities on the vertical spatial scale and temporal scale were calculated variation coefficients of the soil water content on a temporal scale at different depths as shown in fig 5 a could usually be used for the vertical stratification of the variation characteristics of soil water content the results showed that the variation coefficients of the soil water contents in the surface layer were significantly higher than those in the bottom layer the average of variation coefficients of soil water contents for different densities in the 0 40 cm depth were approximately 10 which indicated a layer with rapidly changing soil water content the averages of variation coefficients of soil water contents for different densities at the 50 120 cm depth were only approximately 1 which indicated constant soil water content at the same time the variation coefficients of soil water at high vegetation density were significantly higher than those at low vegetation density at the 0 40 cm depth the averages of variation coefficients of soil water contents at low densities 0 40 were approximately 6 while the averages variation coefficients of soil water contents at high densities 60 100 were approximately 14 in conclusion the annual variations in soil water under high vegetation densities were more severe than those under low vegetation densities at depths of 0 40 cm the variation coefficients of soil water contents on the vertical spatial scale in different months are shown in fig 5 b and they could be used to judge the period with the most severe soil water content change the results showed that the variation coefficients of soil water contents were significantly high from april to august and the average of variation coefficients was approximately 9 the variation coefficient of the soil water content in june was the highest of the year the most intense period of evapotranspiration was in june resulting in a low soil water content at the 0 40 cm depth from september to october the variation coefficient of soil water content was relatively low at approximately 2 the main reason was that the water discharged from the upstream began to flow into the baiyangdian wetland which made the water level continually rise in the baiyangdian wetland the soil water at each depth was effectively supplemented and the differences in soil water contents were not significant on the vertical spatial scale at the same time the variations in soil water at the 0 120 cm depth under high p australis density were more severe than those under low p australis density from april to august the average of variation coefficients of soil water contents at low densities 0 40 were approximately 6 while those at high densities 60 100 were approximately 12 3 5 analysis of soil water storage in the entire profile under different p australis densities according to eq 2 the statistics among different months for the average water content of the 0 120 cm soil profile under different vegetation density conditions are shown in fig 6 a the p australis density had a significant effect on the average soil water content of the 0 120 cm soil profile and decreased significantly with increasing p australis density in each month during the growth period the average soil water contents of the 0 120 cm profile from densities of 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 were 0 47 cm3 cm3 0 46 cm3 cm3 0 46 cm3 cm3 0 45 cm3 cm3 0 44 cm3 cm3 and 0 43 cm3 cm3 respectively the difference in average soil water content between bare and 100 density was approximately 8 during the growth period when groundwater depth was the control variable the partial correlation coefficient between p australis density and the average soil water content of the 0 120 cm profile was 0 84 p 0 01 from densities of 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 the annual variations in the average soil water content of the 0 120 cm profile were 5 7 9 9 12 and 14 respectively in general the annual variation degree of the average soil water content of the 0 120 cm profile increased with increasing p australis density the statistics among different densities for the average water content of the 0 120 cm soil profile in the growth period are shown in fig 6 b the difference in the average water content of the 0 120 cm soil profile among different densities was the largest in june during the growth period for instance the average soil water content of 100 p australis density was approximately 14 lower than that of bare land on june 30 the results illustrated that june was the period with the most severe soil water content change from april to october the average soil water content of the 0 120 cm soil profile for each p australis density condition overall showed a trend of increasing decreasing increasing and then decreasing these dynamic characteristics of soil water content could reflect not only the responses to precipitation and groundwater recharge but also the response to the soil drying process after evapotranspiration this result showed the seasonal alternation of dry and wet conditions of wetland soil water from april to early may the soil water content showed a short term increasing trend which was mainly due to the influence of artificial ecological water transfer and water supplement projects in spring in the baiyangdian wetland from may to the end of june the soil water content showed a significant downward trend mainly because of the rapid growth period of p australis and the lower rainfall amounts from may to june in the study area the accumulated rainfall in may and june was only 14 mm and 13 mm respectively from july to the end of august the average soil water content showed an increasing trend which was mainly due to the effective supplementation of soil water from the increase in rainfall the accumulated rainfall in july and august was 145 mm and 159 mm respectively however from the end of august to the withering period of p australis due to the decrease in rainfall and the gradual leaf withering of p australis the shielding effect of leaves on solar radiation began to weaken resulting in the increase in soil evaporation therefore at the end period of p australis the average soil water content in the 0 120 cm soil profile under each vegetation density condition showed a temporary decline again in general the density of p australis had a significant effect on the average soil water content of the soil profile and the average soil water content had obvious seasonality according to eq 1 the dynamic characteristics of total soil water storage of the 0 120 cm layer under different densities in the growing season are shown in fig 7 at densities of 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 the annual average soil water storage was 563 mm 555 mm 549 mm 543 mm 532 mm and 524 mm respectively the density of p australis had a significant negative effect on the soil water storage of the 0 120 cm profile especially in june the difference in soil water storage between the 0 density and 100 vegetation density was 65 mm 13 difference range which showed that june was the period with the most severe soil water storage change during the growth period of p australis the variation trend of total soil water storage of the 0 120 cm layer for different density conditions was similar it had obvious seasonality and was usually related to the vegetation growth stage and rainfall amount however affected by the evapotranspiration of p australis the annual variation degree of soil water storage was not similar and usually increased with increasing p australis density in general soil water consumed by evapotranspiration could be replenished under each vegetation density condition before and after the growth of p australis the soil water storage showed an increase which was beneficial to the balance of soil water storage in the year affected by rainfall and inflow of upstream water in the flood season the highest value of total soil water storage for different vegetation densities all appeared from august to september at densities of 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 the highest soil water storage values during the year were 579 mm 570 mm 571 mm 565 mm 560 mm and 558 mm respectively however the lowest total soil water storage values for different densities appeared in different months the lowest total soil water storage value for the high density conditions 60 100 appeared in june when evapotranspiration was the highest throughout the year while it appeared in april for the low density conditions 0 40 the main reason was that the rainfall amount was lower in april and the transpiration of p australis was relatively low at the early growth stage but the water consumption of soil evaporation was high soil evaporation became the main method of water consumption for low p australis density and it was significantly higher than the water supply in april additionally for low p australis density transpiration was low in june and soil evaporation was also low because of the shielding effect of the leaves therefore the lowest value of total soil water storage under low density conditions appeared in april at densities of 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 the lowest soil water storage values during the year were 540 mm 543 mm 529 mm 519 mm 507 mm and 490 mm respectively according to the above analysis results for the management of semiarid wetlands very low soil water content would affect the health of ecohydrological processes to avoid soil that is too dry the soil water in april should be considered for low p australis density and that in june should be considered for high density in the semiarid wetland the timing of water replenishment could be implemented in these two months and should be based on the actual precipitation and soil water in these two months in summary the soil water analysis results from the four perspectives showed that p australis density had a significant effect on soil water dynamics in the spac system of p australis the results in the wetland were similar to those in other ecosystems fu et al 2012 she et al 2014 however compared with the research results of forest and grassland ecosystems the degree of influence of vegetation density on soil water in wetland ecosystems was relatively low for example in forest and grassland ecosystems the soil under high density vegetation even appeared to desiccate guo and shao 2003 wang et al 2008 in spring summer and autumn the soil water content of p australis was approximately 0 42 cm3 cm3 and the discrepancy in p australis density had the greatest influence on the soil water content of the 0 40 cm layer these soil water characteristics and the variation trend of soil water in the year were consistent with the results of other studies xu et al 2014 at present in the actual management of baiyangdian wetland the timing of water replenishment is often implemented in winter and spring and this research can enrich the choice of replenishment timing for high and low p australis densities in semiarid wetlands 3 6 which factor has more influential on soil water content the pearson correlation coefficient method was used to analyze the correlation between the average soil water content of the 0 120 cm profile and groundwater level under different p australis densities as shown in table 2 performed by spss 24 0 software the average soil water content had a good linear negative correlation with the groundwater depth under different vegetation density conditions and the correlation level between them increased significantly with increasing p australis density the main reason may be that the water transport and dissipation of the spac system under high density conditions were intense the fluctuation range of soil water was large and soil water was highly dependent on groundwater under high density conditions the change in groundwater level had more influence on soil water content under high density conditions than under low density conditions in summary the groundwater level had a significant impact on the soil water content of the 0 50 cm layer and the impact degree gradually increased with increasing p australis density from the analysis results of different densities and groundwater levels we found that p australis density and groundwater level all had significant linear correlations with soil water content especially in the depth range of 0 40 cm to identify the dominant factor affecting the soil water content in the depth range of 0 40 cm from these two factors including the groundwater depth and vegetation density this research used the linear analysis and nonlinear surface fit analysis method to explore the multiple equation of soil water content with the groundwater depth and vegetation density as shown in table 3 performed by spss 24 0 software origin 2021 software for nonlinear surface fit the 2d quadratic polynomial function was used in this research for nonlinear surface fit no matter linear and nonlinear analysis the results showed that there was reliable prediction accuracy between soil water and independent variables in the depth range of 0 40 cm the results showed that the precision of the nonlinear surface fit was slightly higher than that of linear regression in the linear regression equation the regression coefficient absolute value of the groundwater depth variable was obviously greater than that of the density variable table 3 therefore it could be considered that the influence of groundwater depth on soil water in the study area was significantly higher than that of p australis density on soil water in the analysis of water transport dissipation in the spac system the groundwater level factor should not be ignored for identifying the main factor affecting soil moisture in different months we also calculated partial correlation coefficients between the soil water content and the groundwater depth vegetation density at different months as shown in table 4 performed by spss 24 0 software the results showed that partial correlation coefficients between the vegetation density and the soil water content were higher than those between the groundwater depth and the soil water content in each month illustrating that vegetation density had a higher impact on the soil water than that of the groundwater depth on the monthly scale the main reason was due to the characteristics of water abundance in the wetland ecosystems there was no significant difference in the groundwater depth among different sites for the same month so the vegetation density will have a more significant impact on soil water on the monthly scale that is the role of the groundwater depth was hidden however on the yearly scale the groundwater depth changes significantly among different months so it would have a higher impact on the soil water than that of the vegetation density showing that that leading impact factors of the soil water had time scale effects according to the above multiple linear regression equation this research proposed two management suggestions for semiarid wetlands regarding practical groundwater level management and vegetation density management from the perspective of maintaining soil water storage this research took the annual average 0 120 cm soil water storage of each vegetation density as the target soil water storage 544 mm for groundwater level management suitable average groundwater depth for densities of 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 were suggested to be 76 cm 63 cm 50 cm 37 cm 23 cm and 10 cm respectively for vegetation density management suitable average densities of p australis for groundwater depth of 35 cm 40 cm 45 cm and 50 cm were suggested to be 62 55 47 and 40 respectively 4 conclusions the analysis of the dynamic characteristics of soil water is the basis for the study of water transport and dissipation in the spac system in this research the effects of p australis densities on the soil water of the spac system were analyzed and evaluated in experimental plots by the comparative observation method from four perspectives the surface water content the water distribution in the soil profile the coefficient of variation of soil water and soil water storage additionally the influence of groundwater level on soil water in the spac system of p australis was analyzed by statistical methods then which parameter vegetation density or groundwater level had the greatest influence on soil water was identified the surface soil water content had significant differences between high p australis density 40 100 and low p australis density 0 40 from april to the end of june and from july to the middle of august in which the discrepancy of surface soil water between the high and low densities was 5 11 and 1 4 respectively the p australis density had a certain influence on the soil water at each depth of 0 120 cm especially in the 0 40 cm profile which belonged to the rapidly changing layer of soil water and from april to august when the contradiction between water supply and demand was most prominent june was the strongest month for p australis evapotranspiration in the year the p australis density had a significant effect on the soil water storage of the 0 120 cm profile and decreased with increasing p australis density the annual variation degree of soil water storage increased with increasing p australis density the soil water storage had obvious seasonality and generally first decreased and then increased the lowest value of total soil water storage for high density conditions 60 100 appeared in june while it appeared in april for low density conditions 0 40 the groundwater level had a significant influence on the soil water content of the 0 50 cm layer and the impact degree increased with increasing p australis density the influence of groundwater depth on soil water was significantly higher than that of p australis density according to the analysis results this research proposes management suggestions for semiarid wetlands from the perspective of the timing of water replenishment the soil water in april should be considered for low p australis density and in june for high density and the timing of water replenishment could be implemented in these two months and based on the actual precipitation and soil water in these two months from the perspective of maintaining soil water storage there were two management suggestions first for groundwater level management the suitable average groundwater depth for densities of 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 were suggested to be 76 cm 63 cm 50 cm 37 cm 23 cm and 10 cm respectively second for vegetation density management the suitable average densities of p australis for groundwater depth of 35 cm 40 cm 45 cm and 50 cm were suggested to be 62 55 47 and 40 respectively these results can provide theoretical support for p australis density management and groundwater level regulation in the baiyangdian wetland however this research focused only on the impacts of vegetation density and groundwater level on soil water content and the impacts of land cover change climate change and other factors on soil water were not considered therefore quantitative analysis of the effects of these factors on soil water should be considered and the contribution rate of each factor could be compared for adaptive management under changing environments

973,understanding soil water dynamics and their influencing factors is an important basis for formulating efficient water use strategies aimed at alleviating water stress especially in areas with water shortages in this research six plots with different densities were designed to systematically analyze the influences of phragmites australis density and groundwater level on soil water in a semiarid wetland 1 the phragmites australis density had a negative influence on the soil water in the 0 40 cm profile and from april to august 2 the phragmites australis density had a positive effect on the annual variation degree of the soil water storage the water replenishment could be implemented in april and june for low and high phragmites australis densities respectively 3 the groundwater level had a significant influence on the soil water content of the 0 50 cm layer and the change was positively correlated with the phragmites australis density the influence of groundwater level on soil water was more influential than that of phragmites australis density 4 the suitable average groundwater depth for the 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 densities were 76 cm 63 cm 50 cm 37 cm 23 cm and 10 cm respectively the suitable average densities of phragmites australis for the groundwater depth of 35 cm 40 cm 45 cm and 50 cm were 62 55 47 and 40 respectively this research can provide a theoretical

and water quality improvement engelhardt and ritchie 2001 ricaurte et al 2012 as an important medium of material exchange in the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac soil water plays an important role in the ecological hydrological process of wetland ecosystems plants roots can uptake water from soil recharged by precipitation or groundwater zhang et al 2017 and thus soil water can affect vegetation health and ecological water consumption in the spac system and reflect water profit and loss sala et al 1981 li et al 2005 chikamoto et al 2015 ventrella et al 2019 since soil water dynamics are an important basis for formulating water use strategies in wetland management understanding the characteristics of soil moisture variations is of great significance for the alleviation of water stress under the influences of climate change and human activities especially in areas with water shortages thus research on variations in soil water dynamics and their influencing factors has been widely conducted li et al 2015 it is agreed that groundwater level is a direct factor affecting soil water dynamics muneepeerakul et al 2008 zhu et al 2015 the fluctuation of groundwater level has a significant impact on soil water distribution and affects crop growth and development kandil and willardson 1992 kang et al 2002 matsuo et al 2013 karimov et al 2014 xu et al 2016 most relevant studies have focused on the health of agricultural ecosystems and related research results are expected to expand to wetland ecosystems the vegetation pattern of an area is another important factor affecting soil water dynamics generally vegetation coverage increases evapotranspiration for example phragmites australis p australis a kind of reed is the most widely distributed and the largest community type in wetland ecosystems brix et al 2001 borin et al 2011 and greatly affects the ecohydrological processes of lakes the evapotranspiration of shallow lakes dominated by p australis is one to seven times as high as the evaporation of water bodies without vegetation coverage baird 1999 zhou and zhou 2009 vegetation density as one of the commonly used indicators to characterize vegetation structure has a significant impact on water transport and dissipation in the spac system especially in soil water zhang and schilling 2006 chen et al 2007 fu et al 2012 she et al 2014 however most of these studies on the impact of vegetation density on soil water have focused on ecosystems other than wetlands such as forest and grassland ecosystems these research results provide technical support for supporting sustainable water resource utilization in forest and grassland ecosystems therefore it is of great significance to analyze the soil water dynamics with different vegetation densities for the efficient utilization of regional water resources through vegetation density management in wetland ecosystems under high water shortage pressure to alleviate water stress and protect vulnerable wetland ecosystems in semiarid areas some artificial water supplement projects are often implemented to raise lake water levels wang et al 2013 in addition vegetation densities can be changed to maintain suitable soil water content and reduce ecological water consumption in the spac system of p australis in the wetland ecology and environmental management an interesting problem arises and is worthy of in depth investigation as far as groundwater level and vegetation density are concerned which factor is more influential on soil water therefore it is necessary to deeply and jointly analyze the influences of vegetation density and groundwater on soil water dynamics in wetlands this information can provide a theoretical basis and technical support for vegetation density and groundwater level management with the aim of improving the utilization efficiency of water resources and the ecological environment taking the baiyangdian wetland in the semiarid area in china as the research area the overall aims of this study were to analyze and evaluate the dynamic characteristics of the soil water of the p australis community in wetlands with different vegetation densities and groundwater level fluctuations through the comparison method of experimental observations additionally we wanted to determine which of these two parameters was more influential on soil water compared with previous studies in which the effects of vegetation density and groundwater depth on soil water were rarely simultaneously considered in wetland ecosystems zhang and schilling 2006 chen et al 2007 fu et al 2012 she et al 2014 liu 2014 this study gave an in depth investigation on the soil water dynamics with detailed comparisons of these two impact factors in the spac system of p australis during vegetation growth periods in a semiarid area in addition rather than focused on one aspect of soil water as has been done in most existing studies zhang and schilling 2006 chen et al 2007 she et al 2014 this study performed a systematic analysis from four perspectives including the surface water content the water distribution in the soil profile the coefficient of variation of soil water and soil water storage it is beneficial to expand the current methods used for the restoration of hydrological or environmental elements that are only focused on engineering treatment this study can provide a theoretical basis for the ecological and hydrological management specifically vegetation density and groundwater level management of wetland systems and provide a new perspective for research on wetland health maintenance and protection through the interaction of patterns and processes of ecology and hydrology under a changing environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the baiyangdian wetland 38 43 39 02 n and 115 38 116 07 e in the xiong an new area fig 1 is the largest freshwater lake in the north china plain which is mostly in the semiarid area the wetland lies in the middle reaches of the daqing river basin and discharges into the bohai gulf yellow sea it is a grass type shallow lake consisting of 143 islands and 67 km2 of p australis marshes with a 31 200 km2 catchment the lake surface area is 366 km2 and the average amount of water inflow is 908 million m3 wang et al 2014a 2014b there are natural low lying depressions and p australis marshes wang et al 2012 the regional climate is a warm temperate continental monsoon climate in baiyangdian wetland the average annual precipitation is 524 8 mm and about 67 of the precipitation is from june to september the average annual evaporation of water surfaces is 1369 mm the average annual potential evapotranspiration of the baiyangdian wetland from 1972 to 2012 is 993 0 mm the average annual temperature is 12 8 c july has the maximum temperature and the average is 26 9 c january has the minimum temperature and the average is 4 7 c in baiyangdian wetland which has high water shortage pressure it is necessary to deeply and jointly analyze the influences of vegetation density and groundwater on soil water dynamics for the efficient utilization of regional water resources through vegetation density and groundwater level management the observation area is located in raised fields the middle area of the baiyangdian wetland which is dominated by p australis under natural conditions the coordinates of the observation area are 115 98 e and 38 87 n the total area is 1 km2 and the terrain is flat the type of soil in the experimental field is sandy loam and there is no significant difference in the profile of 0 120cm there were six p australis density plots of 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 with each plot being 10 m 10 m and a 5 m interval between plots fig 1 because the groundwater depth of the raised fields of observation area is small the water movement and dissipation are dominated by vertical infiltration and evapotranspiration rather than a lateral flow between different plots at the same we thought a 5 m interval between different plots was enough interval distance therefore we considered the soil water of a plot would be mainly affected by groundwater and evapotranspiration of this plot and the influence of adjacent plots on soil water was small the water supply source of each experimental plot was precipitation taking the natural condition of p australis in the area as 100 density it is approximately 40 plants m2 the densities of the s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 and s6 plots were 0 plants m2 8 plants m2 16 plants m2 24 plants m2 32 plants m2 and 40 plants m2 respectively in the research vegetation density management in each plot was achieved mainly through the strip cut method every 10 days 2 2 data collection and processing 2 2 1 measurement of soil water content and groundwater level a 120 cm observation tube of soil water and a groundwater level observation well were installed in the middle of each plot for each p australis density experimental plot a divier 2000 portable soil water content measuring instrument sentek pty ltd australia based on the frequency domain reflection principle was used to measure the volumetric water content of the 0 120 cm soil profile in each plot the measurement interval of the soil water in the 0 120 cm profile was 10 cm the monitoring period was from may 16 2018 to september 30 2018 covering the whole growing period of p australis the monitoring interval was 15 days and it was shortened after heavy rainfall 2 2 2 calculation of soil water storage the divier 2000 measuring instrument was used to measure the dynamic characteristics of the volumetric water content of the 0 120 cm soil profile from the surface layer every 10 cm interval the total soil water storage of the 0 120 cm profile was calculated using the following formula 1 s w s 10 i 1 n θ i δ z where sws is the soil water storage of the 0 120 cm profile mm n is the number of soil water observation layers in the monitoring plot n 12 θ i is the volumetric water content in layer i of the soil profile cm3 cm3 δ z is the depth interval of the soil water measurement cm and δ z 10 cm and the factor 10 is for the conversion of cm to mm 2 2 3 calculation of the average water content in the soil profile for the 0 120 cm soil profile of the experimental plot the average volumetric water content of the soil profile was calculated by the following formula 2 s w mean 1 n i 1 n θ i where sw mean is the average volumetric water content of the 0 120 cm soil profile cm3 cm3 n is the number of soil water observation layers in the monitoring plot n 12 and θ i is the volumetric water content in layer i of the soil profile cm3 cm3 2 2 4 coefficient of variation of soil water content cv the variation coefficient of soil water content was used to quantitatively express the dynamic change characteristics of soil water content on a vertical spatial scale and time scale and was defined as follows 3 c v σ μ 100 where σ is the standard deviation of the soil water content and μ is the average soil water content cm3 cm3 the coefficient of variation of soil water content can be used to analyze the relative change degree of the soil water content under different vegetation densities the higher values indicate more intense changes in soil water content the lower values indicate the soil water content was relatively stable 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of soil water content under different groundwater levels fig 2 shows the fluctuations of groundwater depths in the experimental plots in the growth period it illustrated that groundwater depths did not vary orderly with the gradual increase of vegetation densities in other words vegetation densities had no regular effects on groundwater depths actually as for the baiyangdian wetland located in semiarid areas was concerned some artificial water supplement projects were often implemented with the aim of raising water levels to alleviate regional water stress in addition the experimental raised field was surrounded by water of wetland variations of groundwater depths of each experimental raised field were mainly affected by variations of water levels in the wetland in view of these facts we thought the differences in groundwater depths among different plots were mainly affected by microtopography of the experimental raised field rather than vegetation density and thus influences of the vegetation density on the groundwater level was not stressed in this study the groundwater depth fluctuations were obvious during the year from may to july p australis was in a period of rapid growth and development the groundwater level in all vegetation density plots continued to decline and the groundwater depth continued to rise from july to september due to the flood season and the increase in rainfall in the baiyangdian wetland the groundwater level increased significantly and the groundwater depth decreased there was a close relationship between groundwater depth and water dynamics in the vadose zone and the groundwater level was usually the lower boundary of the vadose zone in this research the partial correlation coefficient and pearson correlation coefficient were used to analyze the relationship between groundwater level and soil profile water content when p australis density was the control variable the partial correlation coefficients between groundwater depth and soil water content at different profile depths are shown in table 1 performed by spss 24 0 software there was a significant linear negative correlation between the groundwater depth and the soil water content of the 0 50 cm profile and the correlation level decreased significantly with increasing depth however there wasn t a significant linear correlation between the groundwater depth and the soil water content of the 50 120 cm profile the reason was that there was a constant value of the capillary rise in the depth range of 50 120 cm in the study plot under the fluctuation characteristics of current groundwater depth in the study area the variations in soil water content were not obvious in the depth range of 50 120 cm 3 2 analysis of surface soil water contents under different phragmites australis densities the variations in surface soil water content 0 10 cm under the low and high densities of p australis are shown in fig 3 during the early growth period of p australis from april to the end of june the surface soil water content under the low p australis density 0 40 was significantly lower than that under the high p australis density 60 100 and the discrepancy of surface soil water content between high p australis density and low p australis density was 5 11 fig 3 from april to june there was less precipitation total 2 73 cm and p australis was in the early stage of germination and growth in the study area the water requirement of p australis transpiration did not reach the maximum level however the evaporation of soil played a leading role at this stage the branches of high density p australis had a certain role in blocking solar radiation decreasing soil evaporation and alleviating the loss of soil water content from july to the middle of august the discrepancies in the surface soil water content between low density and high density p australis were small with less than 2 the main reason for this was that with the increase in rainfall the soil water contents showed an increasing trend and sufficient rainfall reduced the differences in soil water contents between different densities however from september to the end of october the surface soil water contents under low p australis density were significantly higher than those under high vegetation density and the discrepancies in the surface soil water content between high p australis density and low p australis density were 1 4 during this stage the rainfall decreased and p australis was stable until the terminal stage the transpiration of p australis was still maintained at a high level with continuous root water uptake from the soil in addition to the significant discrepancy in surface soil water content between high and low densities of p australis there were some similarities in the surface soil water contents between high and low densities in the entire growth period for example the changing trend within the year of surface soil water content between low density and high density conditions was consistent generally from april to the end of june the surface soil water contents of p australis decreased continuously 52 and 43 decline range for low and high vegetation density respectively due to the increase in evapotranspiration of p australis with the arrival of the rainy season and the increase in rainfall the surface soil water content began to increase rapidly however there was a slight decrease 2 and 3 decline range for low and high vegetation density respectively in the surface soil water contents between the middle of july and early august the main reason may be that the temperature and solar radiation in this period reached the highest values during the year leading to the highest water consumption by evapotranspiration specifically the average evapotranspiration was 9 9 mm d in this stage which was 10 higher than the annual average therefore the surface soil water content declined slightly from the middle of september to the withering timing of p australis the surface soil water content showed a temporary decrease fig 3 the main reason may be the increase in soil evaporation at the late growth period of p australis 3 3 analysis of water distributions in the soil profile under different p australis densities the water content distribution characteristics of the 0 120 cm soil profile in the growth period under different p australis densities and months in 2018 are shown in fig 4 first compared with the soil water distribution of the 0 120 cm profile in different months the results showed that the soil water content increased gradually from the surface to the deep layer under each p australis density condition between april and august 2018 however after september the differences in soil water contents at different depths within the 0 120 cm profile were small for each p australis density 3 9 7 2 difference range for 0 100 density and close to the saturated water contents fig 4 f the main reason was that the water discharged upstream in the flood season began to flow into the baiyangdian wetland and the continuous rise of the water level in the wetland effectively supplemented the soil water content at each depth resulting in only small discrepancies among the soil water contents at different depths from april to august compared with the soil water distribution under different densities the p australis density influenced the soil water at each depth of 0 120 cm the soil water content in the entire profile under low p australis density was relatively high and it showed a downward trend with increasing p australis density especially at the 0 40 cm depth of the soil profile the average difference range of soil water content between high and low densities during april to august was 40 4 fig 4 however at the 50 120 cm depth of the soil profile the difference in soil water content between high density and low density plots was relatively small the average value of this difference from april to august was 6 5 and the soil water content was close to the saturated soil water content at each depth the main reason was that there were many artificial ecological water transfer projects in 2018 and the high water level in the baiyangdian wetland throughout the year therefore the p australis density had a significant effect on the soil water content in the 0 40 cm depth range in the study area this was the depth at which water content showed most changes for p australis transpiration soil evaporation and rainfall infiltration the consumption and supplementation of water led to significant differences in soil water among different densities in summary the density of p australis had a significant effect on soil water in the 0 40 cm profile and between april and august when the gap between water supply and demand was most prominent this characteristic indicated that attention should be paid to the appropriate time to replenish water in water resources planning and management from the perspective of water consumption of the spac 3 4 variation coefficients of soil water content under different p australis densities to quantitatively describe the dynamic characteristics of the soil water contents under different p australis densities on vertical spatial scale and temporal scale the variation coefficient of soil water content was used for evaluation according to eq 3 variation coefficients for the soil water contents under different densities on the vertical spatial scale and temporal scale were calculated variation coefficients of the soil water content on a temporal scale at different depths as shown in fig 5 a could usually be used for the vertical stratification of the variation characteristics of soil water content the results showed that the variation coefficients of the soil water contents in the surface layer were significantly higher than those in the bottom layer the average of variation coefficients of soil water contents for different densities in the 0 40 cm depth were approximately 10 which indicated a layer with rapidly changing soil water content the averages of variation coefficients of soil water contents for different densities at the 50 120 cm depth were only approximately 1 which indicated constant soil water content at the same time the variation coefficients of soil water at high vegetation density were significantly higher than those at low vegetation density at the 0 40 cm depth the averages of variation coefficients of soil water contents at low densities 0 40 were approximately 6 while the averages variation coefficients of soil water contents at high densities 60 100 were approximately 14 in conclusion the annual variations in soil water under high vegetation densities were more severe than those under low vegetation densities at depths of 0 40 cm the variation coefficients of soil water contents on the vertical spatial scale in different months are shown in fig 5 b and they could be used to judge the period with the most severe soil water content change the results showed that the variation coefficients of soil water contents were significantly high from april to august and the average of variation coefficients was approximately 9 the variation coefficient of the soil water content in june was the highest of the year the most intense period of evapotranspiration was in june resulting in a low soil water content at the 0 40 cm depth from september to october the variation coefficient of soil water content was relatively low at approximately 2 the main reason was that the water discharged from the upstream began to flow into the baiyangdian wetland which made the water level continually rise in the baiyangdian wetland the soil water at each depth was effectively supplemented and the differences in soil water contents were not significant on the vertical spatial scale at the same time the variations in soil water at the 0 120 cm depth under high p australis density were more severe than those under low p australis density from april to august the average of variation coefficients of soil water contents at low densities 0 40 were approximately 6 while those at high densities 60 100 were approximately 12 3 5 analysis of soil water storage in the entire profile under different p australis densities according to eq 2 the statistics among different months for the average water content of the 0 120 cm soil profile under different vegetation density conditions are shown in fig 6 a the p australis density had a significant effect on the average soil water content of the 0 120 cm soil profile and decreased significantly with increasing p australis density in each month during the growth period the average soil water contents of the 0 120 cm profile from densities of 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 were 0 47 cm3 cm3 0 46 cm3 cm3 0 46 cm3 cm3 0 45 cm3 cm3 0 44 cm3 cm3 and 0 43 cm3 cm3 respectively the difference in average soil water content between bare and 100 density was approximately 8 during the growth period when groundwater depth was the control variable the partial correlation coefficient between p australis density and the average soil water content of the 0 120 cm profile was 0 84 p 0 01 from densities of 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 the annual variations in the average soil water content of the 0 120 cm profile were 5 7 9 9 12 and 14 respectively in general the annual variation degree of the average soil water content of the 0 120 cm profile increased with increasing p australis density the statistics among different densities for the average water content of the 0 120 cm soil profile in the growth period are shown in fig 6 b the difference in the average water content of the 0 120 cm soil profile among different densities was the largest in june during the growth period for instance the average soil water content of 100 p australis density was approximately 14 lower than that of bare land on june 30 the results illustrated that june was the period with the most severe soil water content change from april to october the average soil water content of the 0 120 cm soil profile for each p australis density condition overall showed a trend of increasing decreasing increasing and then decreasing these dynamic characteristics of soil water content could reflect not only the responses to precipitation and groundwater recharge but also the response to the soil drying process after evapotranspiration this result showed the seasonal alternation of dry and wet conditions of wetland soil water from april to early may the soil water content showed a short term increasing trend which was mainly due to the influence of artificial ecological water transfer and water supplement projects in spring in the baiyangdian wetland from may to the end of june the soil water content showed a significant downward trend mainly because of the rapid growth period of p australis and the lower rainfall amounts from may to june in the study area the accumulated rainfall in may and june was only 14 mm and 13 mm respectively from july to the end of august the average soil water content showed an increasing trend which was mainly due to the effective supplementation of soil water from the increase in rainfall the accumulated rainfall in july and august was 145 mm and 159 mm respectively however from the end of august to the withering period of p australis due to the decrease in rainfall and the gradual leaf withering of p australis the shielding effect of leaves on solar radiation began to weaken resulting in the increase in soil evaporation therefore at the end period of p australis the average soil water content in the 0 120 cm soil profile under each vegetation density condition showed a temporary decline again in general the density of p australis had a significant effect on the average soil water content of the soil profile and the average soil water content had obvious seasonality according to eq 1 the dynamic characteristics of total soil water storage of the 0 120 cm layer under different densities in the growing season are shown in fig 7 at densities of 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 the annual average soil water storage was 563 mm 555 mm 549 mm 543 mm 532 mm and 524 mm respectively the density of p australis had a significant negative effect on the soil water storage of the 0 120 cm profile especially in june the difference in soil water storage between the 0 density and 100 vegetation density was 65 mm 13 difference range which showed that june was the period with the most severe soil water storage change during the growth period of p australis the variation trend of total soil water storage of the 0 120 cm layer for different density conditions was similar it had obvious seasonality and was usually related to the vegetation growth stage and rainfall amount however affected by the evapotranspiration of p australis the annual variation degree of soil water storage was not similar and usually increased with increasing p australis density in general soil water consumed by evapotranspiration could be replenished under each vegetation density condition before and after the growth of p australis the soil water storage showed an increase which was beneficial to the balance of soil water storage in the year affected by rainfall and inflow of upstream water in the flood season the highest value of total soil water storage for different vegetation densities all appeared from august to september at densities of 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 the highest soil water storage values during the year were 579 mm 570 mm 571 mm 565 mm 560 mm and 558 mm respectively however the lowest total soil water storage values for different densities appeared in different months the lowest total soil water storage value for the high density conditions 60 100 appeared in june when evapotranspiration was the highest throughout the year while it appeared in april for the low density conditions 0 40 the main reason was that the rainfall amount was lower in april and the transpiration of p australis was relatively low at the early growth stage but the water consumption of soil evaporation was high soil evaporation became the main method of water consumption for low p australis density and it was significantly higher than the water supply in april additionally for low p australis density transpiration was low in june and soil evaporation was also low because of the shielding effect of the leaves therefore the lowest value of total soil water storage under low density conditions appeared in april at densities of 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 the lowest soil water storage values during the year were 540 mm 543 mm 529 mm 519 mm 507 mm and 490 mm respectively according to the above analysis results for the management of semiarid wetlands very low soil water content would affect the health of ecohydrological processes to avoid soil that is too dry the soil water in april should be considered for low p australis density and that in june should be considered for high density in the semiarid wetland the timing of water replenishment could be implemented in these two months and should be based on the actual precipitation and soil water in these two months in summary the soil water analysis results from the four perspectives showed that p australis density had a significant effect on soil water dynamics in the spac system of p australis the results in the wetland were similar to those in other ecosystems fu et al 2012 she et al 2014 however compared with the research results of forest and grassland ecosystems the degree of influence of vegetation density on soil water in wetland ecosystems was relatively low for example in forest and grassland ecosystems the soil under high density vegetation even appeared to desiccate guo and shao 2003 wang et al 2008 in spring summer and autumn the soil water content of p australis was approximately 0 42 cm3 cm3 and the discrepancy in p australis density had the greatest influence on the soil water content of the 0 40 cm layer these soil water characteristics and the variation trend of soil water in the year were consistent with the results of other studies xu et al 2014 at present in the actual management of baiyangdian wetland the timing of water replenishment is often implemented in winter and spring and this research can enrich the choice of replenishment timing for high and low p australis densities in semiarid wetlands 3 6 which factor has more influential on soil water content the pearson correlation coefficient method was used to analyze the correlation between the average soil water content of the 0 120 cm profile and groundwater level under different p australis densities as shown in table 2 performed by spss 24 0 software the average soil water content had a good linear negative correlation with the groundwater depth under different vegetation density conditions and the correlation level between them increased significantly with increasing p australis density the main reason may be that the water transport and dissipation of the spac system under high density conditions were intense the fluctuation range of soil water was large and soil water was highly dependent on groundwater under high density conditions the change in groundwater level had more influence on soil water content under high density conditions than under low density conditions in summary the groundwater level had a significant impact on the soil water content of the 0 50 cm layer and the impact degree gradually increased with increasing p australis density from the analysis results of different densities and groundwater levels we found that p australis density and groundwater level all had significant linear correlations with soil water content especially in the depth range of 0 40 cm to identify the dominant factor affecting the soil water content in the depth range of 0 40 cm from these two factors including the groundwater depth and vegetation density this research used the linear analysis and nonlinear surface fit analysis method to explore the multiple equation of soil water content with the groundwater depth and vegetation density as shown in table 3 performed by spss 24 0 software origin 2021 software for nonlinear surface fit the 2d quadratic polynomial function was used in this research for nonlinear surface fit no matter linear and nonlinear analysis the results showed that there was reliable prediction accuracy between soil water and independent variables in the depth range of 0 40 cm the results showed that the precision of the nonlinear surface fit was slightly higher than that of linear regression in the linear regression equation the regression coefficient absolute value of the groundwater depth variable was obviously greater than that of the density variable table 3 therefore it could be considered that the influence of groundwater depth on soil water in the study area was significantly higher than that of p australis density on soil water in the analysis of water transport dissipation in the spac system the groundwater level factor should not be ignored for identifying the main factor affecting soil moisture in different months we also calculated partial correlation coefficients between the soil water content and the groundwater depth vegetation density at different months as shown in table 4 performed by spss 24 0 software the results showed that partial correlation coefficients between the vegetation density and the soil water content were higher than those between the groundwater depth and the soil water content in each month illustrating that vegetation density had a higher impact on the soil water than that of the groundwater depth on the monthly scale the main reason was due to the characteristics of water abundance in the wetland ecosystems there was no significant difference in the groundwater depth among different sites for the same month so the vegetation density will have a more significant impact on soil water on the monthly scale that is the role of the groundwater depth was hidden however on the yearly scale the groundwater depth changes significantly among different months so it would have a higher impact on the soil water than that of the vegetation density showing that that leading impact factors of the soil water had time scale effects according to the above multiple linear regression equation this research proposed two management suggestions for semiarid wetlands regarding practical groundwater level management and vegetation density management from the perspective of maintaining soil water storage this research took the annual average 0 120 cm soil water storage of each vegetation density as the target soil water storage 544 mm for groundwater level management suitable average groundwater depth for densities of 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 were suggested to be 76 cm 63 cm 50 cm 37 cm 23 cm and 10 cm respectively for vegetation density management suitable average densities of p australis for groundwater depth of 35 cm 40 cm 45 cm and 50 cm were suggested to be 62 55 47 and 40 respectively 4 conclusions the analysis of the dynamic characteristics of soil water is the basis for the study of water transport and dissipation in the spac system in this research the effects of p australis densities on the soil water of the spac system were analyzed and evaluated in experimental plots by the comparative observation method from four perspectives the surface water content the water distribution in the soil profile the coefficient of variation of soil water and soil water storage additionally the influence of groundwater level on soil water in the spac system of p australis was analyzed by statistical methods then which parameter vegetation density or groundwater level had the greatest influence on soil water was identified the surface soil water content had significant differences between high p australis density 40 100 and low p australis density 0 40 from april to the end of june and from july to the middle of august in which the discrepancy of surface soil water between the high and low densities was 5 11 and 1 4 respectively the p australis density had a certain influence on the soil water at each depth of 0 120 cm especially in the 0 40 cm profile which belonged to the rapidly changing layer of soil water and from april to august when the contradiction between water supply and demand was most prominent june was the strongest month for p australis evapotranspiration in the year the p australis density had a significant effect on the soil water storage of the 0 120 cm profile and decreased with increasing p australis density the annual variation degree of soil water storage increased with increasing p australis density the soil water storage had obvious seasonality and generally first decreased and then increased the lowest value of total soil water storage for high density conditions 60 100 appeared in june while it appeared in april for low density conditions 0 40 the groundwater level had a significant influence on the soil water content of the 0 50 cm layer and the impact degree increased with increasing p australis density the influence of groundwater depth on soil water was significantly higher than that of p australis density according to the analysis results this research proposes management suggestions for semiarid wetlands from the perspective of the timing of water replenishment the soil water in april should be considered for low p australis density and in june for high density and the timing of water replenishment could be implemented in these two months and based on the actual precipitation and soil water in these two months from the perspective of maintaining soil water storage there were two management suggestions first for groundwater level management the suitable average groundwater depth for densities of 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 were suggested to be 76 cm 63 cm 50 cm 37 cm 23 cm and 10 cm respectively second for vegetation density management the suitable average densities of p australis for groundwater depth of 35 cm 40 cm 45 cm and 50 cm were suggested to be 62 55 47 and 40 respectively these results can provide theoretical support for p australis density management and groundwater level regulation in the baiyangdian wetland however this research focused only on the impacts of vegetation density and groundwater level on soil water content and the impacts of land cover change climate change and other factors on soil water were not considered therefore quantitative analysis of the effects of these factors on soil water should be considered and the contribution rate of each factor could be compared for adaptive management under changing environments in addition in future research on the effect analysis of vegetation density on soil water we would pay attention to the differences in vegetation growth under different densities declaration of

974,the amount and composition of organic carbon are major controls on water quality and ecological processes in streams in this study we explored the fate of the quantity of dissolved organic carbon doc and the composition of dissolved organic matter dom in an agricultural hillslope stream network system we conducted our study in the 66 ha hoal hydrological open air laboratory in lower austria we measured doc of the soil eluates from different land use units water samples from the stream and from seven tributaries and estimated dom components by fluorescent spectrophotometry and parafac analyses soil doc shows the highest concentrations in summer but doc concentrations in the tributaries are lower in summer than in winter by between 19 and 31 dom composition of the soil eluate differs between land use units the forest site exhibits the largest fractions of humic like fluorophores and less labile dom dom composition in the tributaries is in addition to doc controlled by soil moisture we estimated the doc import from the tributaries into the stream as 125 kg during base flow conditions in the period february to december 2017 and the instream doc production as 38 kg considering mass balance and exchange with groundwater six out of seven dom components have a positive net production along the stream only aliphatic dom with low molecular weight is consumed 65 of its input these findings suggest that agricultural land use increases doc input into streams and alters their dom quality instream processes modify dom quality over short distances keywords dissolved organic carbon dissolved organic matter fluorescence parafac land use flow pathways in stream processes 1 introduction agriculture delivers significant amounts of dissolved organic matter dom to stream ecosystems changing basic metabolic processes in the water and at the water sediment interface and affecting the ecological state and the health of aquatic systems fasching and battin 2012 findlay et al 2001 2003 piscart et al 2009 rouhani et al 2021 the amount and composition of terrestrial dom influence benthic microbial growth and respiration as well as co2 emission from streams findlay et al 2003 piscart et al 2009 williams et al 2010 dom is a mixture of various compounds with molecular weights ranging from simple carbohydrates to complex molecules of different aromaticity bolan et al 2011 dissolved organic carbon doc typically represents 67 of the elemental composition of dom bolan et al 2011 and therefore is often used as a proxy when quantifying dom due to light absorbing chromophores and fluorescent fluorophores dom has distinct spectrophotometric properties in terms of both absorption and fluorescence baker et al 2003 chen et al 2003 hudson et al 2007 uv visible 200 800 nm optical properties of dom have been used to determine dom characteristics such as aromaticity suva254 weishaar et al 2003a and molecular size dalrymple et al 2010 recent advances in fluorescent spectrophotometry have provided a new tool for rapidly identifying dom fluorophores via excitation emission matrices eem wavelengths 200 500 nm chen et al 2003 fellman et al 2010 an eem identifies fluorescence peaks that can be attributed to various dom components such as humic fulvic or protein like fluorophores baker et al 2003 thus fluorescence methods are useful for identifying anthropogenic dom sources in streams hudson et al 2007 and for distinguishing bioavailable from refractory dom components the relative abundance of which determines microbial activity and organic matter processing bolan et al 2004 findlay et al 2001 marschner and kalbitz 2003 in natural streams refractory dom originating from terrestrial sources usually dominates over autochthonous labile dom from algal primary production osburn et al 2017 agricultural activities may significantly alter this dom composition graeber et al 2012 both enhanced benthic primary production resulting from increased nutrient supply and light penetration and increased manure inputs with high amino acids contents may shift the composition towards the dominance of labile components fellman et al 2009 kalbitz et al 2003 observed that pore water dom in agricultural soils showed lower molecular weights and less humicity than dom in soils under native vegetation see also delprat et al 1997 in addition dom aromaticity correlated positively with soil moisture indicating that soil drainage may increase the export of labile dom to streams brockett et al 2012 in contrast other studies have found a higher proportion of humic like structurally complex dom in agricultural streams than in pristine streams which may be related to the disturbance of agricultural soils by tillage frank and groffman 2009 kalbitz et al 2000 marschner and kalbitz 2003 comparative studies of soil and stream dom show contradictory results graeber et al 2012 since the processes that drive the modifications are still largely unknown the inconsistency of these findings may be related to differences in land use practices e g fertilization tillage etc and environmental conditions e g climate vegetation etc the significance of the different flow paths surface runoff soil pore water drainage water and different investigation methods xenopoulos et al 2021 summarized that climate pollution hydrology soil properties the intensity of human activities and the extent of natural land covers define how human altered landscapes produce dom pools with diverging characteristics past studies have generally followed one of four sampling strategies some studies focused on the dom of soil eluate water extractable organic carbon from different land uses chantigny 2003 ghani et al 2007 zsolnay 1996 its change with depth cronan and aiken 1985 worrall and burt 2007 and the impact of land management kalbitz et al 2000 steenwerth and belina 2008 sun et al 2017 a second group of studies measured dom in soil pore water either directly in the field with suction cups vinther et al 2006 or via percolation towards drainages from individual land use units such as pastures ghani et al 2007 a third group focused instead on the streams and measured dom within the stream system relating the measured dom quantity and composition to the proportion of different land uses e g ahearn et al 2005 graeber et al 2012 wilson and xenopoulos 2009 or soil types graeber et al 2012 another group estimated instream dom processing via longitudinal sampling fellman et al 2009 or addition studies pucher 2021 however in order to understand the impacts of agriculture on dom concentrations composition and processing in streams an approach is needed that combines measurements of soil dom the corresponding dom in tributaries and changes in the instream dom along stream reaches the aim of this study therefore is to link spatial and temporal variations of doc and dom quality in a stream to the potential terrestrial sources associated with agriculture the delivery pathways and instream processes specifically we explore 1 how dom concentrations and composition change from the soil to the tributaries and along the stream to the catchment outlet and 2 which factors control the spatial patterns and seasonal dynamics of doc and dom quality of these different ecosystem components during base flow conditions the study is set in the hydrological open air laboratory hoal petzenkirchen blöschl et al 2016 which has mainly agricultural land use contains diverse flow paths tile drainages springs saturation area flows within a small area and is well instrumented it is thus ideally suited for investigating the spatial and temporal variations of doc concentrations and dom quality from different land use units arable grassland forest the corresponding flow paths and instream doc production the focus is on base flow conditions as we were mainly interested in the seasonal pattern of instream dom processing although rainfall runoff events certainly influence the seasonal pattern of instream processes we decided to exclude those periods from our calculations as the temporal dynamic of doc transport and metabolic processes during rainfall runoff events cannot be recorded sufficiently their impact only temporarily superimpose the seasonal dynamics and they tend to have their implications further downstream 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the hydrological open air laboratory hoal petzenkirchen figure 1 is situated in the western part of lower austria 48 9 n 15 9 e and has a size of 66 ha the catchment is drained by the seitengraben stream which is 620 m long and has an average flow of 3 93 l s 1 1990 2020 the stream is sustained by eleven tributaries five of which are perennial sys4 q1 sys1 sys2 and sys3 and two are ephemeral frau1 frau2 the tributaries collect water from different pathways these include tile drainages from arable areas frau1 and frau2 tile drainages from mixed areas arable grassland and forest inlet sys4 sys3 a tile drainage from the forest sys2 and groundwater springs q1 sys1 during low flow episodes most of the stream water originates from sys4 the main inlet of the stream followed by deep aquifer water from spring q1 and tile drain sys1 the remaining tributaries contribute only 18 of the total flow during low flow episodes széles et al 2018 the stream itself interacts with the groundwater which enables water and nutrient exchange exner kittridge et al 2016 and results in diurnal fluctuations of stream flow caused by transpiration from the riparian vegetation széles et al 2018 overall 87 of the catchment area is arable land 5 is grassland 6 is forested and 2 is paved the dominant soil types are cambisols 56 of the area planosols 21 and anthrosols 17 iuss working group wrb 2015 the climate is humid with a mean annual temperature of 9 5 c and a mean annual rainfall of 823 mm yr 1 1990 2014 temperature rainfall and rainfall intensity peak during summer the elevation of the catchment ranges from 257 to 325m above sea level the hoal is jointly operated by the federal agency for water management and the technical university of vienna with the aim of studying catchment processes using data with high temporal and spatial resolution blöschl et al 2016 2 2 sampling preparation and analyses a sampling campaign was conducted during the period january to december in 2017 the year was dryer than normal with a precipitation of 707 mm yr 1 compared to the long term mean of 785 mm yr 1 1990 to 2019 stream flow has been measured by calibrated stream gauges h flumes and v notch weirs in combination with pressure transducers and or ultra sonic devices at all relevant tributaries to the stream and at the catchment outlet since 2010 figure 1 blöschl et al 2016 meteorological data are collected at a weather station located approximately in the centre of the catchment soil moisture is measured at 33 irregularly distributed sites at 10 20 30 and 50 cm depths those nearest to the soil sampling sites within the same land use unit were used for the analyses the sampling strategy for the dom analyses comprised three compartments first we took monthly soil samples from the top soil layer 0 5 cm in three different land use units arable grassland and forest to obtain information on the dom sources at each location we took three replicates to minimise errors associated with the heterogeneous mixture of soil components and their non uniform spatial distribution the samples were immediately frozen and stored at 28 c before processing in the laboratory since the fluorescence spectrometer analyses liquids we produced an eluate from the soil samples after defrosting soil was sieved on a size below 4 mm and 40 ml of 0 5 mm k2so4 were added to 20 g of soils and shaken for half an hour at 20 c after hydro extraction at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 20 c the samples were filtered through pre combusted 0 45 µm glass fibre filters soil organic carbon soc content of the soil samples were calculated by subtracting inorganic carbon content determined according to scheibler from total carbon content measured with the shimadzu ssm 5000a after air drying and sieving through 2 mm second monthly water samples during low flow conditions were taken from all tributaries to the seitengraben stream and the catchment outlet mw third additional samples were taken from the stream itself at b1 and b2 to divide the stream into three sections sys4 to b1 b1 to b2 and b2 to mw all water samples were divided into two parts one part was used for the doc dom quality analyses which was immediately filtered through pre combusted glass fibre filters with a pore size of 0 45 µm to minimize further microbial activity the second part was used for the chemical analyses total organic carbon toc nitrate ammonia potassium chloride electric conductivity ph value and suspended sediment concentrations the samples were stored at 4 c and processed not later than 3 days after collection for the dom quality analyses we used spectrophotometric and spectrofluorometric methods the absorbance measurements was conducted with an uv vis spectrometer uv1700 pharma spec shimadzu corporation with a scanning range from 200 to 700 nm chin et al 1994 samples were placed in a 5 cm quartz window cuvette hella analytics fluorescence was measured with a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi f 7000 hitachi high technology corporation in a range from 250 to 600 nm in 5 nm increments due to a scan speed of 1500 nm min 1 it took 15 min per sample to gather an emission excitation matrix with a range of 200 to 450 nm for the excitation and a range of 250 to 600 nm for the emission z values of the matrix represent a light intensity displayed in raman units each day before the start of sample analyses a sensitivity test with distilled water was performed s n peak to peak 250 drift 2 during the analyses temperature was kept constant at 21 c the fluorescence and absorbance spectra of dom were analysed using the stardom package of r version 3 5 r core team 2020 pucher et al 2019 we conducted a parafac analysis murphy et al 2013 pucher et al 2019 and calculated fluorescence as well as absorbance indices to obtain dom compositional parameters we mainly used the relative contribution of the individual parafac components to the total fluorescence gained from the parafac model the dom quality analysis was complemented by determining the humification index hix zsolnay et al 1999 higher values indicate more humification and the biological index bix huguet et al 2009 higher values indicate more autochthonous dom production further we used the absorbance parameters suva254 which is defined as the uv absorbance of a water sample at the wavelength of 254 nm and normalized for dissolved organic carbon doc concentration as a surrogate for aromaticity weishaar et al 2003b and quantified average molecular size by the inverse relationship between dom molecular weight and the peak ratio e2 e3 where e2 and e3 are the absorbance at 254 nm and at 365 nm respectively dalrymple et al 2010 in total we analysed 384 samples 271 water samples of the tributaries and the stream and 36 soil samples inner filter effects of the fluorescence analysis were corrected the results were converted to raman units and raman and rayleigh scattering of first and second order were removed and interpolated in the parafac model seven outliers were removed based on their leverage and later reintroduced in the model with fixed emission and excitation loadings we verified the parafac model using a split half analysis and compared the components by tucker s congruence coefficient tcc 0 963 tucker 1951 component spectra were visually checked for plausibility the final parafac model r² 0 996 resulted in 8 components table 1 the components spectra were compared with findings from other studies using openfluor org murphy et al 2014 2 3 definition of base flow conditions since the focus of the study was on evaluating the seasonal patterns of instream processes during base flow conditions such periods were identified with a recursive digital filter arnold et al 1995 nathan and mcmahon 1990 applied to the streamflow time series of mw on an hourly basis 1 q t β q t 1 1 β 2 q t q t 1 where q t is the filtered quick flow event water at time step t time steps with q t 0 are considered baseflow conditions qt is the original stream flow of mw at time step t the filter parameter β was set to 0 95 after visual data inspection to reflect typical subsurface response of the catchment eder et al 2010 exner kittridge et al 2016 2 4 exfiltration infiltration model in order to estimate the doc production in the stream an infiltration model was setup that accounts for diffuse doc inputs and losses due to water exchange with the subsurface for each time step of one hour doc mass balance gives 2 f p r o d f m w i 1 n f i f d i f f where fprod is the instream doc production g h 1 positive if doc is produced fmw is the measured doc flux at the catchment outlet fi is the measured doc input flux from tributary i n is the number of tributaries n 7 and fdiff is the diffusive doc flux from the groundwater to the stream the doc input flux from the tributaries was estimated as the product of doc concentrations and stream flow at a time interval of 1 minute since doc concentrations were only measured 12 times during the study period while stream flow was measured every minute we established a regression between doc concentrations and the logarithm of flow for each tributary in order to account for doc variability between the sampling these regressions included data from additional sampling during baseflow conditions data not presented in this study to extend the range of flow and avoid extrapolation the diffuse doc flux fdiff was estimated as 3 f d i f f q d i f f c d i f f where qdiff is the diffusive exchange water flux positive when water infiltrates from the groundwater to the stream at time step t and cdiff is its doc concentration water mass balance for each time step gives 4 q d i f f q m w i 1 n q i where qmw and qi are the measured flows at the catchment outlet and at tributary i respectively evaporation was neglected because most of the stream is shaded by trees estimates of daily evaporation from the stream surface were less than 1000 litre per day and thus less than 1 6 percent of daily stream flow on the day with the lowest flow infiltrating water qdiff 0 was assumed to have the doc concentration of the groundwater i e c d i f f c g w which was set to the mean concentration measured at spring q1 exfiltrating water qdiff 0 was assumed to have the average doc concentration of the stream water which was estimated as the weighted mean of the doc concentrations of the tributaries ci as 5 c d i f f n i 1 n l i i 1 n q i i 1 n q i c i l i the weighting was by flow qi as well as by the flow length li from the confluence of the tributary i with the stream to the catchment outlet for the calculation of net production of the individual components c1 c8 the same model was used but doc concentrations were replaced by raman units ru of the components additionally instead of a correlation between flow rate and concentration mean values of the ru at each tributary were used because of the low correlations between flow rate and ru 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variation of doc 3 1 1 soil the lowest doc values from soil eluate were measured at the arable land site with an annual mean of 0 9 mg l 1 and a standard deviation of 0 17 mg l 1 table 2 during the study period higher doc concentrations were observed for the grassland site with a mean of 2 33 0 55 mg l 1 the forest site soil eluate showed the highest doc concentrations 4 36 1 34 mg l 1 in line with the high organic carbon content of the forest soil soc contents were 2 0 0 35 g kg 1 4 1 0 76 g kg 1and 9 2 0 88 g kg 1 for the arable land grassland and forest sites respectively suggesting a clear relationship between soil eluate doc and soc with a linear regression coefficient of r 0 97 in general soil eluate doc concentrations varied seasonally showing slightly increased concentrations at the grassland and forest sites during summer and high peaks in all soils in october figure 2 the peak was especially high in the forest where doc concentration almost doubled to the maximum doc of 7 77 mg l 1 figure 2 this peak occurred at the onset of autumnal leaf fall in the arable field monthly soil doc changed little throughout the year during the project period winter barley was grown seeding in october 2016 until the harvest in early july in march and may mineral fertilizer was applied 2 times 250 kg nac ha 1 which equals 2 times 62 5 kg n ha 1 pesticides were used in april husar iodosulfuron methyl natrium and mefenpyr diethyl and may aviator and atlanil prothioconazol bixafen at the end of august pig slurry was distributed on the arable field and incorporated before the seeding of catch crops these management procedures did however not change the soil doc concentrations much the higher value in october cannot be directly attributed to any documented management operation but it may be a delayed effect of the fertilization with pig slurry and its incorporation into the soil in august 3 1 2 tributaries the doc concentrations of the tributaries show an opposite seasonal variation compared to the soil eluates with the highest concentrations in winter figure 3 during base flow conditions the doc concentrations from the tributaries ranged between 1 5 and 4 9 mg l 1 the highest concentrations were measured in the tributaries that drain the arable land with mean doc concentrations of 2 8 0 71 mg l 1 frau1 and 2 3 0 66 mg l 1 frau2 doc concentrations were lowest for the spring q1 that is groundwater fed 1 50 0 43 mg l 1 and sys4 that has some groundwater contribution 1 55 0 44 mg l 1 surprisingly the doc concentrations of sys2 which drains the forest with the highest doc in soil eluate were also low 1 59 0 48 mg l 1 during the summer the doc concentrations in the tributaries decreased on average by 25 compared to the winter half year as mentioned earlier the tributaries show a contrasting seasonal doc pattern to those of the soil eluates the flow paths and their sources are well known for the hoal petzenkirchen because of the detailed monitoring of all tributaries since 2010 blöschl et al 2016 and additional hypothesis driven studies with focus on sediment transport eder et al 2014 2010 nitrogen transport including groundwater interactions exner kittridge et al 2016 and transpiration effects during low flow conditions széles et al 2018 thus flow paths of water within the hoal petzenkirchen catchment are well investigated and understood based on the results of these previous studies and historic drainage maps fig 1 the drainages frau1 and frau2 can be attributed as drainages from the arable land use unit while the soil sampling was not conducted in the same field because of logistic reasons it was conducted in a field where both management and soil type are identical to those of the field drained by the tile drains also the fields are spatially rather uniform in terms of soil characteristics it was therefore assumed that the soil samples of the arable site are also representative of the area draining frau1 and frau2 sys2 mainly drains the area around the forest on the left bank of the stream and also immediately responds to rainfall the comparison of the doc concentrations of the arable and forest sites and the associated tributaries arable associated with frau1 and frau2 forest associated with sys2 shows that doc concentrations in the soil are not aligned with those in the tributaries at the arable site the mean doc concentration of the soil eluate was 0 87 mg l 1 but 2 8 and 2 77 mg l 1 in the corresponding tributaries frau1 and frau2 in the forest the mean doc concentration of the soil eluate was 3 82 mg l 1 but 1 84 mg l 1 in the corresponding tributary sys2 overall the doc of the six tributaries and the stream were more similar to each other than the doc of the three land use sites the mean over the study period ranged between 1 3 and 3 5 mg l 1 for the tributaries while it ranged between 0 5 and 4 5 mg l 1 for the three soil sites the temporal standard deviations of the tributaries maximum standard deviation at frau1 0 7 mg l 1 were also smaller than those of the soil sites maximum standard deviation in the forest 1 4 mg l 1 both the spatial and temporal patterns of the tributaries show smaller variations than the soils suggesting an important role of doc turnover and buffering along the flow paths from the soil to the stream 3 2 doc from the tributaries to the catchment outlet 3 2 1 hydrology and identification of baseflow conditions for evaluating budgets of water and doc the period february 3rd to december 31st 2017 was used since streamflow data were missing in january 2017 due to frost damages of some pressure transducers the mean flow at the catchment outlet mw in this period was 2 32 l s 1 and thus less than its long term mean of 4 07 l s 1 indicating that the study period was drier than normal the total flow volume was 85533 m³ of which 57570 m³ 67 left the catchment during base flow conditions which occurred 88 of the time over the entire period the contribution of the inlet sys4 to the total flow volume at mw was 29 the highest proportion of the water originates from the spring q1 40 the left bank drainage systems contributed 31 sys1 29 sys2 7 sys3 7 whereas the right bank drainage systems delivered only about 5 frau 1 0 1 frau 2 5 during baseflow the total flow volume contributed by the tributaries was 18 higher than the total flow volume measured at the catchment outlet suggesting an important exfiltration flux into the groundwater this may be related to the relatively dry conditions during the study period 2017 with low groundwater tables for the period 2013 2015 which was much wetter széles et al 2018 found that 37 of the total flow volume measured at mw during low flow periods enters the stream laterally simultaneous grab control measurements of flow in 2017 confirmed the exfiltration 3 2 2 doc mass balance as mentioned earlier the doc loads of the tributaries were calculated using a regression between flow and doc concentration although the correlation coefficients and the slopes of the regressions varied between tributaries we found clear relationships for all sites correlation coefficients between 0 76 and 0 97 exceptions are the spring q1 and frau2 where the correlation coefficients were smaller than 0 5 due to the small flow variability in q1 and hysteresis effects in frau2 we therefore used the mean doc concentrations to calculate loads at q1 and frau2 although the tributaries draining the arable sites frau1 and frau2 had the highest concentrations they only made a minor contribution 7 to the total doc input of 124 kg during feb 3rd to dec 31st into the stream due to their low flow volume figure 5 the highest doc inputs into the stream occurred via the spring q1 35 kg doc 28 of total doc inputs and sys1 34 kg 28 because of their high discharge volumes 24 400 m³ and 16 400 m³ 36 and 24 of total flow the calculated doc loads clearly show that the doc inputs were mainly controlled by the flow volume of the respective tributaries figure 4 3 2 3 instream doc net production instream processes were evaluated by comparing the inputs from the tributaries and the outputs at the catchment outlet for both water volume and doc loads while over the period from february 3rd to december 31st 2017 a total loss of water of 10 300 m³ was measured there was a doc load surplus at the catchment outlet of 13 3 kg figure 5 the exfiltration infiltration model eq 2 5 applied to the base flow data suggests that from february 3rd to may 15th 2017 6900 m³ water infiltrated into the stream and imported 10 4 kg of doc on the other hand the measured water loss during the rest of the year was 17 300 m³ which led to an estimated doc exfiltration of 27 2 kg doc the seasonal patterns of water and doc exchange and the resulting doc net production are given in figure 6 during the periods february 3rd to may 25th 2017 and november 20th to december 31st there was a doc net production of 39 kg with a maximum production rate of 36 g doc h 1 on may 25th the net production turned negative with a minimum of 9 g doc h 1 indicating that more doc was consumed incorporated into microbial biomass or respirated precipitated flocculated or adsorbed than leached or secreted by algae within the stream in july and august the net consumption rate slightly increased to 4 g doc h 1 but showed a second low at the beginning of october similar to the one in june 8 g doc h 1 on november 20th the net production rate turned positive again whenever a rainfall runoff event occurred it caused a temporary peak of doc production indicating an additional release of doc 3 3 spatiotemporal variation of dom quality 3 3 1 soil on average over all soil samples 68 of fluorescence was caused by refractory humic like fluorophores c1 c3 18 by protein like fluorophores c6 and c7 and 14 by labile humic like fluorophores c5 and c8 characterised by low molecular weight both land use and season affected the dom composition figure 7 in summer the forest site showed the highest proportion of refractory humic like dom c1 to c3 63 followed by grassland 61 and the arable site 57 this decrease of the sum of these components from arable to forest is aligned with an increase of labile humic like fluorophores c5 and c8 the proportion of labile humic like dom c5 and c8 decreased from summer to winter for all land use units the proportions of protein like fluorophores c6 and c7 were similar for all land use units in summer 15 to 16 but in the winter half year the mean contribution of c7 protein like tyrosine like was 34 while it was only 13 in summer to understand the differences of the dom quality of soil eluates at different land use sites spearman s rank correlation coefficient between the individual components and doc concentration soil temperature and soil moisture were calculated significant correlations were found between hum c7 and doc spearman s rank correlation coefficient rs 0 90 significance level of p 0 001 hum lab c8 and doc rs 0 78 p 0 05 and hum mic c5 and doc rs 0 73 p 0 01 higher values for measured doc in the soil eluate were associated with higher relative amounts of hum c1 and lower relative amounts of hum mic c5 and hum lab c8 figure 8 panel a soil temperature and soil moisture did not show a significant correlation with any of the components c1 c8 however soil temperature was correlated with aromaticity suva correlation coefficient rs 0 72 p 0 001 and molecular size e2 e3 rs 0 50 p 0 01 indicating that higher temperature has led to less aromatic dom with low molecular weight the means of suva over the study period were highest at the arable site 11 4 l mg 1 m 1 intermediate at the grassland site 10 35 l mg 1 m 1 and lowest at the forest site 4 77 l mg 1 m 1 but the standard deviation was high for all three land use units table 2 on average over the study period the molecular size was highest at the forest site e2 e3 3 4 intermediate at the grassland site e2 e3 4 6 and lowest at the arable site e2 e3 4 8 3 3 2 tributaries at the tributaries refractory humic like fluorophores c1 to c3 contributed between 62 sys4 and 68 sys1 to total fluorescence on average over the study period figure 7 protein like fluorophores c6 and c7 accounted for 11 to 12 of fluorescence for all tributaries with minor differences between the tributaries microbial derived humic like fluorophores c5 contributed between 16 sys2 and 22 frau2 the remaining 1 to 7 were c8 which is described as microbially derived relatively aliphatic humic like fluorophores with low molecular weight relevant seasonal changes occur for tryp c6 and hum lab c8 tryp c6 is lower in summer while hum lab c8 is lower in winter we calculated spearman s rank correlation coefficient between the dom quality of the tributaries and environmental parameters in a similar way as for the soil data but included additional water quality parameters such as nitrate and phosphate concentration the main explanatory variables of dom composition were found to be soil moisture in the catchment the tributary is draining availability of nitrate in the streamflow of the tributary and doc concentration soil moisture is positively correlated with the relative amounts of hum rec c3 and negatively with hum lab c8 of the tributaries figure 8 panel b nitrate was positively correlated with hum lab c8 only rs 0 38 p 0 01 while higher nitrate concentrations are associated with lower aromaticity suva rs 0 36 p 0 01 and smaller molecular size of dom e2 e3 rs 0 55 p 0 001 doc concentration of the tributaries was positively correlated with hum mic c5 rs 0 38 p 0 01 and negatively correlated with aromaticity suva rs 0 51 p 0 001 it appears that increasing doc concentration has led to less aromatic labile dom 3 4 dom quality from source to catchment outlet 3 4 1 soil to tributaries the dom quality differs between soil eluate and tributaries while the proportions of the more refractory components c1 c3 are comparable between eluates and tributaries except for the forest soil in winter the proportions of the more labile fractions vary the tributaries showed a higher relative proportion of hum mic c5 159 and tryp c6 84 and a lower proportion of tyr c7 62 and hum lab c8 63 than the soil eluates figure 7 besides the seasonal variability of the dom composition was much lower in the tributaries than in the eluates frau 2 draining the arable field sys 1 groundwater affected and sys3 draining both arable and forested areas showed lower proportions of hum lab c8 in winter than the other tributaries the lowest seasonal variability occurs at the stream outlet mw figure 7 similar to frau 2 and sys 1 the outlet was characterized by relatively low proportions of hum lab c8 the humification index hix increased from an average of 0 75 in the soil eluate to 0 84 in the tributaries the ratio e2 e3 was higher in the drainage frau2 7 6 frau1 7 0 and sys 2 6 6 than in the soil eluates of the corresponding arable site 4 8 and forest 3 4 table 2 3 4 2 tributary to catchment outlet the instream processes of the individual dom components were evaluated in an analogous way to doc based on mass balance including exchanges with the aquifer due to exfiltration and infiltration during the study period from february 3rd to december 31st 2017 all dom components apart from hum lab c8 showed a positive net production table 3 only hum lab c8 was consumed which almost completely disappeared at the catchment outlet in addition changes of dom quality along the stream were observed at two stream sections the upstream section 1 was between sys4 and b1 190 m and downstream section 2 between b2 and mw 96 m for section 1 only periods without stream flow at frau 1 and frau 2 were compared in both sections the relative contributions of hum c1 hum ter c2 hum rec c3 tyr c6 and tryp c7 increased and hum lab c8 decreased according to the upper results provided in table 3 only hum mic c5 remained on the same level over the stream course molecular size e2 e3 and aromaticity increased along the stream in both sections indicating an increasing proportion of more refractory dom components 4 discussion 4 1 land use impacts on doc and dom quality we observed a distinct impact of land use on the doc concentrations in the soil eluate showing a decrease from the forest to the grassland and the arable land doc concentrations were positively correlated with soc as was also observed by others ghani et al 2007 khomutova et al 2000 ward et al 2007 zhang et al 2007 zsolnay 1996 marschner and kalbitz 2003 and stutter and billett 2003 suggested that doc equilibrates between the mobile aqueous phase and the immobile solid phase indicating that higher soc leads to higher doc in the soil land use is an important factor controlling the soc content in the soil and thus also affects doc concentrations in the soil eluate the same pattern of decreasing doc concentrations from forest floor over grassland a horizon to arable land a horizon was found by chantigny 2003 in general the doc concentrations in the tributaries measured in the present study area the hoal petzenkirchen are relatively low compared to other studies vidon et al 2008 found similar concentrations in tile drains from arable land 2 28 mg l 1 but almost twice the values in groundwater 4 34 mg l 1 and 3 60 mg l 1 and the streams 4 78 mg l 1 and 4 85 mg l 1 graeber et al 2012 found even higher doc concentrations in streams of agricultural catchments 7 6 2 8 mg l 1 but forested catchments had approximately the same mean doc concentration 1 5 0 9 mg l 1 as measured in sys2 draining the forest in the hoal kalbitz et al 2000 reported that dom is strongly adsorbed to clay minerals in the mineral soil resulting in low doc output from these soils this process may explain the generally low doc concentrations in the hoal where the soil mainly consists of heavy clay material surprisingly doc concentrations in the tributaries showed an opposite pattern to the corresponding soils with increasing doc concentrations from the tributary draining the forest to the tributary draining the arable field despite similar flow volumes sys2 and frau2 in figure 5 higher doc outputs from the arable fields may be caused by higher microbial degradation due to the surplus of nutrients by fertilization chantigny et al 1999 frank and groffman 2009 or due to soil treatments on the fields such as ploughing kalbitz et al 2000 steenwerth and belina 2008 fertilizer application lead to a nitrogen surplus increasing the decomposition rate of organic matter through an improved c n ratio chantigny et al 1999 enowashu et al 2009 frank and groffman 2009 and thus the potential leaching the laboratory leaching experiments with soils of the hoal petzenkirchen by tiefenbacher et al 2020 found that fertilization with both mineral and organic fertilizers reduced doc leaching for a few weeks compared to sandy soils from other regions less doc was leached from the clayey soils beside the c n ratio the oxygen supply is important for decomposition processes to occur bueno and ladha 2009 found that cultivation and the turnover of soils accelerate the decomposition of plant residues in soils by providing oxygen thereby resulting also in increased dom leaching tile drains may intensify this process due to the direct linkage of agricultural soils to streams and less retention of doc in the soil blann et al 2009 this could have been the case in our study area as the field is regularly ploughed and drained in addition an accumulation of organic matter in deeper soil layers during dry periods is possible during subsequent rain events this organic matter is leached and may lead to increased doc concentrations in the corresponding drainage pipes frau 1 and frau 2 in our study the dom composition of the soil was only poorly correlated with the dom composition in the corresponding tributaries specifically the labile dom fractions c5 c8 in the soil eluates showed higher proportions of the protein like components tryp c6 and tyr c7 and of the humic like low molecular hum lab c8 while the tributaries were characterised by a higher proportion of the humic like low molecular hum mic c5 graeber et al 2012 concluded that seemingly contradicting results from soil and stream studies imply that only a low percentage of the soil organic matter som lost from agricultural soils is transported to the streams as dom or that dom originating from agricultural som is rapidly taken up in streams besides the dom from terrestrial sources is usually subject to a variety of biological physical and chemical processes in the soil which alter its composition baldock and skjemstad 2000 qualls and richardson 2003 silveira 2005 especially the heavy clayey soils in the hoal petzenkirchen increase the retention time of the soil pore water thereby altering the dom composition tiefenbacher et al 2020 also observed differences in dom composition depending on soil texture the shift from proteins c6 c7 and hum lab c8 to hum mic c5 indicates that hum mic c5 is probably a product of the degradation of one of the other components such relationships between the degradation of one component and the production of another component have also been observed elsewhere pucher et al 2021 submitted casas ruiz et al 2017 weigelhofer et al 2020 the strong modification of dom during the soil passage in our study is also indicated by the increase of hix and the strong decrease of suva254 from soil to the tributaries this is consistent with fellman et al 2009 who observed a decrease in suva254 values as dom moved from soils to sub catchment streams another explanations for the different patterns of doc and dom quality in the soil eluate and the tributaries could be the fact that doc concentrations of soil eluate represent a potential doc tipping et al 1999 rather than the material that is leached from the soil under natural conditions the destruction of the soil aggregates during the analysis and the desorption of organic matter from mineral surfaces by k2so4 stimulate the leaching of soil organic matter from the samples ewing et al 2006 ogle et al 2005 under conditions naturally met in the field water from the fine pores is usually strongly bound and thus not available for transport 4 2 temporal variations of doc and dom quality we observed no clear influence of agricultural practices on the doc content of the arable soil eluate the doc content in the upper soil layer of the arable fields did not vary much evidently caused by the limited soc content 2 0 g kg 1 compared to grassland 4 1 g kg 1 and forest 9 2 g kg 1 although kalbitz et al 2000 found a direct impact of agrotechnical practices on doc in the arable surface soil layer causing more frequent fluctuations in the doc content we did not observe such changes on an about monthly sampling interval similarly rosa and debska 2018 found no direct effect of the organic natural fertilization on the doc content in a 2 year arable soil sampling campaign in poland and chantigny 2003 stated that changes in doc resulting from management activities are generally of short duration shorter sampling intervals may provide more detailed insight into this question however we observed clear seasonal patterns in the forest and the grassland with increased doc concentrations during the warm summer months and a pronounced doc peak in late autumn again this pattern was not reflected by the tributaries in contrast the tributaries showed a general decline in doc concentrations during summer with a small peak in late summer coinciding with a small decline in the doc concentrations of the soil eluates and a larger peak in january and february these patterns may have been mainly driven by precipitation the dry weather in summer may have led to an accumulation of potentially leachable organic matter within the soils resulting also in smaller exports from the terrestrial sources to the tributaries with increasing rain fall and subsequent increasing moisture content in late summer part of the accumulated soil organic matter was probably washed out thereby increasing the doc concentrations of the tributaries this may also explain the correlation between soil moisture and doc concentrations in the tributaries soil moisture affects the physical chemical and biological processes along the transport of dom through soil and thus influences dom export to subsurface and drainage waters tiefenbacher et al 2021 bolan et al 2011 it appears that higher soil moisture also stimulates microbial activity brockett et al 2012 leading to the consumption of humic like fluorophores with low molecular weight c8 and an increase of the relative amounts of terrestrial recalcitrant humic like components c3 a relevant input of organic material and thus potentially leachable material is leaf litter in fall this litter seems to have directly affected soil doc concentration in the forest in addition to temperature induced seasonal variability the same phenomenon with less intensity was also observed at the grassland site these additional organic inputs seem to be immediately leachable and a metabolizable nutrition for microbes leading to higher doc concentrations of the soil eluate in a long term litter manipulation experiment kalbitz et al 2007 found that a doubling of litter input instantaneously doubled the doc concentrations the doc peak in the forest eluates was accompanied by an increase in protein like fluorescence from 15 in summer to 36 in winter fellman et al 2009 observed similar patterns for protein like fluorescence at three soils in alaska where the relative contribution on total fluorescence decreased from 8 and 10 in may to approximately 5 and 3 in july and august the lower level of protein like contribution compared to our results can be explained by the different climate in alaska with much colder temperatures and only 5 months of snow free season 4 3 main drivers of doc at the catchment outlet the annual doc inputs from the tributaries into the stream are largely controlled by water flow while the doc source plays a secondary role blann et al 2009 found that the catchment export of doc was larger with drainages due to higher proportion of total annual precipitation discharged to surface waters relative to the amount that is stored in the soil during the year evaporated or transpired however different land uses affected the doc export to the stream the tributaries draining the arable land exhibited higher doc concentrations than the tributaries draining the mixed or forested land use units an important doc source is the stream itself during baseflow conditions within the period of positive net production from november to may instream processes caused 37 of the total measured doc load at the catchment outlet the seasonal patterns of instream doc production can be explained by changes of temperature light and availability of nutrients in march and april the stream shows a peak in net doc production during this time algae growth and thus primary production are high due to increasing water temperatures and availability of light thus contributing to instream doc production fasching et al 2016 similar short periods of autotrophic production have been observed in other headwater streams weigelhofer et al 2012 in may the stream gets shaded leading to a breakdown of algal biomass and a decrease of primary doc production high water temperatures and nutrient availability control and stimulate bacterial activity leading to an increase of instream net consumption due to carbon incorporation into microbial biomass and respiration demars et al 2011 hill et al 2000 rosemond et al 2014 interestingly the stream becomes net productive again already in november at a time when autotrophic activities are still low we believe that this net doc production in winter is mainly due to an increased leaching of leaves within the stream or at the banks lateral doc inputs not measured and generally low heterotrophic activities due to low water temperatures short rainfall runoff events in summer can lead to temporary peaks of net production during a period of general net consumption shown in figure 6 by individual positive dots during summer such temporary peaks are probably due to lateral inputs of doc from inundated bank areas and or resuspension and mixing of stream bed material encouraging instream leaching in the same catchment eder et al 2014 found that a small rise of stream water level increased transport capacity and caused the resuspension of bed sediments which likely affects organic matter leaching a rise of water level will also increase the water contact area for leaching instream processes also alter dom composition especially during baseflow fasching et al 2016 raymond et al 2016 hum lab c8 almost completely disappeared after 600 m of flow length molecular size e2 e3 and aromaticity suva254 increased along the stream indicating bacterial uptake of aliphatic low molecular weight dom this is consistent with the findings of fellman et al 2009 for two rivers in alaska where the protein rich labile fraction was selectively removed with passage downstream during the period february 3rd to december 31st 2017 only small rainfall runoff events occurred and thus doc instream balances were only calculated for baseflow during high rainfall runoff events import by tributaries diffuse lateral inputs from the floodplain and resuspension will gain in importance while instream processes will be less significant fasching et al 2016 raymond et al 2016 besides terrestrial dom sources for the stream may change in importance 5 summary and conclusions based on a sampling campaign conducted during 2017 in the hoal petzenkirchen in lower austria we draw the following conclusions the doc concentrations of the soil eluates correlate positively with the soc contents and are 5 and 1 5 times higher at the forest site and the grassland site respectively than at the arable land site in summer the soil eluate doc concentration increases probably due to increased microbial activity and the related faster decomposition of organic material additional inputs of organic material such as leaf litter in autumn also increase the doc concentrations in the soil eluate in contrast to the soil eluate the doc concentrations of the tributaries are lower in summer probably due to the lower hydraulic connectivity from the source to the tributaries the strong temporal correlation between doc load and total flow volume of all seven tributaries r 0 91 indicates that total doc inputs into the stream are determined by hydrology i e the water fluxes and land use plays only a secondary role land use and season affect the dom quality of soil eluate leaf litter in winter causes an increase of protein like dom at the tributaries the impacts of land use and season on the dom composition are neglectable as processes in the soil alter the dom quality during transport from the terrestrial source to the stream soil moisture correlates with dom quality indicating that moisture drives organic matter processing and transport in the soil high soil moisture leads to an increased share of refractory dom components and a lower contribution of protein like and labile humic like components the study also demonstrates that methods of doc and dom quality sampling and processing in the soil and the stream are not necessarily comparable while soil eluates are easy to obtain they only represent a doc and dom quality potential even soil pore water collected in the field or from percolation experiments may not represent the doc and dom components actually entering the stream as they are likely modified along the flow path although the catchment of this study is small relatively homogeneous and dominated by agriculture the monitoring of the tributaries shows that small forest patches in the immediate vicinity of the stream may play a significant role in the doc supply since flow volumes tend to vary more in space and time than doc concentrations the former are more important for determining total doc loads thus relationships between doc and dom quality in the stream and the dominating land use is hard to detect and probably do not fully represent the actual drivers of doc input into streams furthermore time lags between activities in the catchment and responses in the aquatic doc need to be accounted for our study also reveals the significance of instream processing of doc and dom components including both production and degradation complicating the detection of land use impacts and agricultural practises on aquatic carbon characteristics further in the study period instream processes increased total doc export from the catchment by 24 compared to the doc inputs from the tributaries from may 25th to november 20th 2017 instream net doc consumption was observed leading to a loss of 12 kg doc probably due to bacterial uptake and respiration instream processes also alter the dom quality the labile humic like component c8 almost completely disappeared after 600 m of flow length molecular size e2 e3 and aromaticity increased along the stream indicating bacterial uptake of aliphatic low molecular weight dom future work may be directed towards rainfall runoff events and their impact on doc inputs from the fields into the stream and the consecutive stimulation of instream processes preliminary results from two observed rainfall runoff events indicate higher doc inputs from the individual tributaries during high flow compared to base flow and a stimulation of the instream doc release alternative methods for characterising soil doc and dom quality may allow the establishment of more direct links across scales furthermore it would be of interest to examine the role of varying levels of doc loads associated with different land uses for instream dom processes in streams of different sizes and shapes ethical statement the research was done according to

974,the amount and composition of organic carbon are major controls on water quality and ecological processes in streams in this study we explored the fate of the quantity of dissolved organic carbon doc and the composition of dissolved organic matter dom in an agricultural hillslope stream network system we conducted our study in the 66 ha hoal hydrological open air laboratory in lower austria we measured doc of the soil eluates from different land use units water samples from the stream and from seven tributaries and estimated dom components by fluorescent spectrophotometry and parafac analyses soil doc shows the highest concentrations in summer but doc concentrations in the tributaries are lower in summer than in winter by between 19 and 31 dom composition of the soil eluate differs between land use units the forest site exhibits the largest fractions of humic like fluorophores and less labile dom dom composition in the tributaries is in addition to doc controlled by soil moisture we estimated the doc import from the tributaries into the stream as 125 kg during base flow conditions in the period february to december 2017 and the instream doc production as 38 kg considering mass balance and exchange with groundwater six out of seven dom components have a positive net production along the stream only aliphatic dom with low molecular weight is consumed 65 of its input these findings suggest that agricultural land use increases doc input into streams and alters their dom quality instream processes modify dom quality over short distances keywords dissolved organic carbon dissolved organic matter fluorescence parafac land use flow pathways in stream processes 1 introduction agriculture delivers significant amounts of dissolved organic matter dom to stream ecosystems changing basic metabolic processes in the water and at the water sediment interface and affecting the ecological state and the health of aquatic systems fasching and battin 2012 findlay et al 2001 2003 piscart et al 2009 rouhani et al 2021 the amount and composition of terrestrial dom influence benthic microbial growth and respiration as well as co2 emission from streams findlay et al 2003 piscart et al 2009 williams et al 2010 dom is a mixture of various compounds with molecular weights ranging from simple carbohydrates to complex molecules of different aromaticity bolan et al 2011 dissolved organic carbon doc typically represents 67 of the elemental composition of dom bolan et al 2011 and therefore is often used as a proxy when quantifying dom due to light absorbing chromophores and fluorescent fluorophores dom has distinct spectrophotometric properties in terms of both absorption and fluorescence baker et al 2003 chen et al 2003 hudson et al 2007 uv visible 200 800 nm optical properties of dom have been used to determine dom characteristics such as aromaticity suva254 weishaar et al 2003a and molecular size dalrymple et al 2010 recent advances in fluorescent spectrophotometry have provided a new tool for rapidly identifying dom fluorophores via excitation emission matrices eem wavelengths 200 500 nm chen et al 2003 fellman et al 2010 an eem identifies fluorescence peaks that can be attributed to various dom components such as humic fulvic or protein like fluorophores baker et al 2003 thus fluorescence methods are useful for identifying anthropogenic dom sources in streams hudson et al 2007 and for distinguishing bioavailable from refractory dom components the relative abundance of which determines microbial activity and organic matter processing bolan et al 2004 findlay et al 2001 marschner and kalbitz 2003 in natural streams refractory dom originating from terrestrial sources usually dominates over autochthonous labile dom from algal primary production osburn et al 2017 agricultural activities may significantly alter this dom composition graeber et al 2012 both enhanced benthic primary production resulting from increased nutrient supply and light penetration and increased manure inputs with high amino acids contents may shift the composition towards the dominance of labile components fellman et al 2009 kalbitz et al 2003 observed that pore water dom in agricultural soils showed lower molecular weights and less humicity than dom in soils under native vegetation see also delprat et al 1997 in addition dom aromaticity correlated positively with soil moisture indicating that soil drainage may increase the export of labile dom to streams brockett et al 2012 in contrast other studies have found a higher proportion of humic like structurally complex dom in agricultural streams than in pristine streams which may be related to the disturbance of agricultural soils by tillage frank and groffman 2009 kalbitz et al 2000 marschner and kalbitz 2003 comparative studies of soil and stream dom show contradictory results graeber et al 2012 since the processes that drive the modifications are still largely unknown the inconsistency of these findings may be related to differences in land use practices e g fertilization tillage etc and environmental conditions e g climate vegetation etc the significance of the different flow paths surface runoff soil pore water drainage water and different investigation methods xenopoulos et al 2021 summarized that climate pollution hydrology soil properties the intensity of human activities and the extent of natural land covers define how human altered landscapes produce dom pools with diverging characteristics past studies have generally followed one of four sampling strategies some studies focused on the dom of soil eluate water extractable organic carbon from different land uses chantigny 2003 ghani et al 2007 zsolnay 1996 its change with depth cronan and aiken 1985 worrall and burt 2007 and the impact of land management kalbitz et al 2000 steenwerth and belina 2008 sun et al 2017 a second group of studies measured dom in soil pore water either directly in the field with suction cups vinther et al 2006 or via percolation towards drainages from individual land use units such as pastures ghani et al 2007 a third group focused instead on the streams and measured dom within the stream system relating the measured dom quantity and composition to the proportion of different land uses e g ahearn et al 2005 graeber et al 2012 wilson and xenopoulos 2009 or soil types graeber et al 2012 another group estimated instream dom processing via longitudinal sampling fellman et al 2009 or addition studies pucher 2021 however in order to understand the impacts of agriculture on dom concentrations composition and processing in streams an approach is needed that combines measurements of soil dom the corresponding dom in tributaries and changes in the instream dom along stream reaches the aim of this study therefore is to link spatial and temporal variations of doc and dom quality in a stream to the potential terrestrial sources associated with agriculture the delivery pathways and instream processes specifically we explore 1 how dom concentrations and composition change from the soil to the tributaries and along the stream to the catchment outlet and 2 which factors control the spatial patterns and seasonal dynamics of doc and dom quality of these different ecosystem components during base flow conditions the study is set in the hydrological open air laboratory hoal petzenkirchen blöschl et al 2016 which has mainly agricultural land use contains diverse flow paths tile drainages springs saturation area flows within a small area and is well instrumented it is thus ideally suited for investigating the spatial and temporal variations of doc concentrations and dom quality from different land use units arable grassland forest the corresponding flow paths and instream doc production the focus is on base flow conditions as we were mainly interested in the seasonal pattern of instream dom processing although rainfall runoff events certainly influence the seasonal pattern of instream processes we decided to exclude those periods from our calculations as the temporal dynamic of doc transport and metabolic processes during rainfall runoff events cannot be recorded sufficiently their impact only temporarily superimpose the seasonal dynamics and they tend to have their implications further downstream 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the hydrological open air laboratory hoal petzenkirchen figure 1 is situated in the western part of lower austria 48 9 n 15 9 e and has a size of 66 ha the catchment is drained by the seitengraben stream which is 620 m long and has an average flow of 3 93 l s 1 1990 2020 the stream is sustained by eleven tributaries five of which are perennial sys4 q1 sys1 sys2 and sys3 and two are ephemeral frau1 frau2 the tributaries collect water from different pathways these include tile drainages from arable areas frau1 and frau2 tile drainages from mixed areas arable grassland and forest inlet sys4 sys3 a tile drainage from the forest sys2 and groundwater springs q1 sys1 during low flow episodes most of the stream water originates from sys4 the main inlet of the stream followed by deep aquifer water from spring q1 and tile drain sys1 the remaining tributaries contribute only 18 of the total flow during low flow episodes széles et al 2018 the stream itself interacts with the groundwater which enables water and nutrient exchange exner kittridge et al 2016 and results in diurnal fluctuations of stream flow caused by transpiration from the riparian vegetation széles et al 2018 overall 87 of the catchment area is arable land 5 is grassland 6 is forested and 2 is paved the dominant soil types are cambisols 56 of the

and rainfall intensity peak during summer the elevation of the catchment ranges from 257 to 325m above sea level the hoal is jointly operated by the federal agency for water management and the technical university of vienna with the aim of studying catchment processes using data with high temporal and spatial resolution blöschl et al 2016 2 2 sampling preparation and analyses a sampling campaign was conducted during the period january to december in 2017 the year was dryer than normal with a precipitation of 707 mm yr 1 compared to the long term mean of 785 mm yr 1 1990 to 2019 stream flow has been measured by calibrated stream gauges h flumes and v notch weirs in combination with pressure transducers and or ultra sonic devices at all relevant tributaries to the stream and at the catchment outlet since 2010 figure 1 blöschl et al 2016 meteorological data are collected at a weather station located approximately in the centre of the catchment soil moisture is measured at 33 irregularly distributed sites at 10 20 30 and 50 cm depths those nearest to the soil sampling sites within the same land use unit were used for the analyses the sampling strategy for the dom analyses comprised three compartments first we took monthly soil samples from the top soil layer 0 5 cm in three different land use units arable grassland and forest to obtain information on the dom sources at each location we took three replicates to minimise errors associated with the heterogeneous mixture of soil components and their non uniform spatial distribution the samples were immediately frozen and stored at 28 c before processing in the laboratory since the fluorescence spectrometer analyses liquids we produced an eluate from the soil samples after defrosting soil was sieved on a size below 4 mm and 40 ml of 0 5 mm k2so4 were added to 20 g of soils and shaken for half an hour at 20 c after hydro extraction at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 20 c the samples were filtered through pre combusted 0 45 µm glass fibre filters soil organic carbon soc content of the soil samples were calculated by subtracting inorganic carbon content determined according to scheibler from total carbon content measured with the shimadzu ssm 5000a after air drying and sieving through 2 mm second monthly water samples during low flow conditions were taken from all tributaries to the seitengraben stream and the catchment outlet mw third additional samples were taken from the stream itself at b1 and b2 to divide the stream into three sections sys4 to b1 b1 to b2 and b2 to mw all water samples were divided into two parts one part was used for the doc dom quality analyses which was immediately filtered through pre combusted glass fibre filters with a pore size of 0 45 µm to minimize further microbial activity the second part was used for the chemical analyses total organic carbon toc nitrate ammonia potassium chloride electric conductivity ph value and suspended sediment concentrations the samples were stored at 4 c and processed not later than 3 days after collection for the dom quality analyses we used spectrophotometric and spectrofluorometric methods the absorbance measurements was conducted with an uv vis spectrometer uv1700 pharma spec shimadzu corporation with a scanning range from 200 to 700 nm chin et al 1994 samples were placed in a 5 cm quartz window cuvette hella analytics fluorescence was measured with a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi f 7000 hitachi high technology corporation in a range from 250 to 600 nm in 5 nm increments due to a scan speed of 1500 nm min 1 it took 15 min per sample to gather an emission excitation matrix with a range of 200 to 450 nm for the excitation and a range of 250 to 600 nm for the emission z values of the matrix represent a light intensity displayed in raman units each day before the start of sample analyses a sensitivity test with distilled water was performed s n peak to peak 250 drift 2 during the analyses temperature was kept constant at 21 c the fluorescence and absorbance spectra of dom were analysed using the stardom package of r version 3 5 r core team 2020 pucher et al 2019 we conducted a parafac analysis murphy et al 2013 pucher et al 2019 and calculated fluorescence as well as absorbance indices to obtain dom compositional parameters we mainly used the relative contribution of the individual parafac components to the total fluorescence gained from the parafac model the dom quality analysis was complemented by determining the humification index hix zsolnay et al 1999 higher values indicate more humification and the biological index bix huguet et al 2009 higher values indicate more autochthonous dom production further we used the absorbance parameters suva254 which is defined as the uv absorbance of a water sample at the wavelength of 254 nm and normalized for dissolved organic carbon doc concentration as a surrogate for aromaticity weishaar et al 2003b and quantified average molecular size by the inverse relationship between dom molecular weight and the peak ratio e2 e3 where e2 and e3 are the absorbance at 254 nm and at 365 nm respectively dalrymple et al 2010 in total we analysed 384 samples 271 water samples of the tributaries and the stream and 36 soil samples inner filter effects of the fluorescence analysis were corrected the results were converted to raman units and raman and rayleigh scattering of first and second order were removed and interpolated in the parafac model seven outliers were removed based on their leverage and later reintroduced in the model with fixed emission and excitation loadings we verified the parafac model using a split half analysis and compared the components by tucker s congruence coefficient tcc 0 963 tucker 1951 component spectra were visually checked for plausibility the final parafac model r² 0 996 resulted in 8 components table 1 the components spectra were compared with findings from other studies using openfluor org murphy et al 2014 2 3 definition of base flow conditions since the focus of the study was on evaluating the seasonal patterns of instream processes during base flow conditions such periods were identified with a recursive digital filter arnold et al 1995 nathan and mcmahon 1990 applied to the streamflow time series of mw on an hourly basis 1 q t β q t 1 1 β 2 q t q t 1 where q t is the filtered quick flow event water at time step t time steps with q t 0 are considered baseflow conditions qt is the original stream flow of mw at time step t the filter parameter β was set to 0 95 after visual data inspection to reflect typical subsurface response of the catchment eder et al 2010 exner kittridge et al 2016 2 4 exfiltration infiltration model in order to estimate the doc production in the stream an infiltration model was setup that accounts for diffuse doc inputs and losses due to water exchange with the subsurface for each time step of one hour doc mass balance gives 2 f p r o d f m w i 1 n f i f d i f f where fprod is the instream doc production g h 1 positive if doc is produced fmw is the measured doc flux at the catchment outlet fi is the measured doc input flux from tributary i n is the number of tributaries n 7 and fdiff is the diffusive doc flux from the groundwater to the stream the doc input flux from the tributaries was estimated as the product of doc concentrations and stream flow at a time interval of 1 minute since doc concentrations were only measured 12 times during the study period while stream flow was measured every minute we established a regression between doc concentrations and the logarithm of flow for each tributary in order to account for doc variability between the sampling these regressions included data from additional sampling during baseflow conditions data not presented in this study to extend the range of flow and avoid extrapolation the diffuse doc flux fdiff was estimated as 3 f d i f f q d i f

each time step gives 4 q d i f f q m w i 1 n q i where qmw and qi are the measured flows at the catchment outlet and at tributary i respectively evaporation was neglected because most of the stream is shaded by trees estimates of daily evaporation from the stream surface were less than 1000 litre per day and thus less than 1 6 percent of daily stream flow on the day with the lowest flow

individual components c1 c8 the same model was used but doc concentrations were replaced by raman units ru of the components additionally instead of a correlation between flow rate and concentration mean values of the ru at each tributary were used because of the low correlations between flow rate and ru 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variation of doc 3 1 1 soil the lowest doc values from soil eluate were measured at the arable land site with an annual mean of 0 9 mg l 1 and a standard deviation of 0 17 mg l 1 table 2 during the study period higher doc concentrations were observed for the grassland site with a mean of 2 33 0 55 mg l 1 the forest site soil eluate showed the highest doc concentrations 4 36 1 34 mg l 1 in line with the high organic carbon content of the forest soil soc contents were 2 0 0 35 g kg 1 4 1 0 76 g kg 1and 9 2 0 88 g kg 1 for the arable land grassland and forest sites respectively suggesting a clear relationship between soil eluate doc and soc with a linear regression coefficient of r 0 97 in general soil eluate doc concentrations varied seasonally showing slightly increased concentrations at the grassland and forest sites during summer and high peaks in all soils in october figure 2 the peak was especially high in the forest where doc concentration almost doubled to the maximum doc of 7 77 mg l 1 figure 2 this peak occurred at the onset of autumnal leaf fall in the arable field monthly soil doc changed little throughout the year during the project period winter barley was grown seeding in october 2016 until the harvest in early july in march and may mineral fertilizer was applied 2 times 250 kg nac ha 1 which equals 2 times 62 5 kg n ha 1 pesticides were used in april husar iodosulfuron methyl natrium and mefenpyr diethyl and may aviator and atlanil prothioconazol bixafen at the end of august pig slurry was distributed on the arable field and incorporated before the seeding of catch crops these management procedures did however not change the soil doc concentrations much the higher value in october cannot be directly attributed to any documented management operation but it may be a delayed effect of the fertilization with pig slurry and its incorporation into the soil in august 3 1 2 tributaries the doc concentrations of the tributaries show an opposite seasonal variation compared to the soil eluates with the highest concentrations in winter figure 3 during base flow conditions the doc concentrations from the tributaries ranged between 1 5 and 4 9 mg l 1 the highest concentrations were measured in the tributaries that drain the arable land with mean doc concentrations of 2 8 0 71 mg l 1 frau1 and 2 3 0 66 mg l 1 frau2 doc concentrations were lowest for the spring q1 that is groundwater fed 1 50 0 43 mg l 1 and sys4 that has some groundwater contribution 1 55 0 44 mg l 1 surprisingly the doc concentrations of sys2 which drains the forest with the highest doc in soil eluate were also low 1 59 0 48 mg l 1 during the summer the doc concentrations in the tributaries decreased on average by 25 compared to the winter half year as mentioned earlier the tributaries show a contrasting seasonal doc pattern to those of the soil eluates the flow paths and their sources are well known for the hoal petzenkirchen because of the detailed monitoring of all tributaries since 2010 blöschl et al 2016 and additional hypothesis driven studies with focus on sediment transport eder et al 2014 2010 nitrogen transport including groundwater interactions exner kittridge et al 2016 and transpiration effects during low flow conditions széles et al 2018 thus flow paths of water within the hoal petzenkirchen catchment are well investigated and understood based on the results of these previous studies and historic drainage maps fig 1 the drainages frau1 and frau2 can be attributed as drainages from the arable land use unit while the soil sampling was not conducted in the same field because of logistic reasons it was conducted in a field where both management and soil type are identical to those of the field drained by the tile drains also the fields are spatially rather uniform in terms of soil characteristics it was therefore assumed that the soil samples of the arable site are also representative of the area draining frau1 and frau2 sys2 mainly drains the area around the forest on the left bank of the stream and also immediately responds to rainfall the comparison of the doc concentrations of the arable and forest sites and the associated tributaries arable associated with frau1 and frau2 forest associated with sys2 shows that doc concentrations in the soil are not aligned with those in the tributaries at the arable site the mean doc concentration of the soil eluate was 0 87 mg l 1 but 2 8 and 2 77 mg l 1 in the corresponding tributaries frau1 and frau2 in the forest the mean doc concentration of the soil eluate was 3 82 mg l 1 but 1 84 mg l 1 in the corresponding tributary sys2 overall the doc of the six tributaries and the stream were more similar to each other than the doc of the three land use sites the mean over the study period ranged between 1 3 and 3 5 mg l 1 for the tributaries while it ranged between 0 5 and 4 5 mg l 1 for the three soil sites the temporal standard deviations of the tributaries maximum standard deviation at frau1 0 7 mg l 1 were also smaller than those of the soil sites maximum standard deviation in the forest 1 4 mg l 1 both the spatial and temporal patterns of the tributaries show smaller variations than the soils suggesting an important role of doc turnover and buffering along the flow paths from the soil to the stream 3 2 doc from the tributaries to the catchment outlet 3 2 1 hydrology and identification of baseflow conditions for evaluating budgets of water and doc the period february 3rd to december 31st 2017 was used since streamflow data were missing in january 2017 due to frost damages of some pressure transducers the mean flow at the catchment outlet mw in this period was 2 32 l s 1 and thus less than its long term mean of 4 07 l s 1 indicating that the study period was drier than normal the total flow volume was 85533 m³ of which 57570 m³ 67 left the catchment during base flow conditions which occurred 88 of the time over the entire period the contribution of the inlet sys4 to the total flow volume at mw was 29 the highest proportion of the water originates from the spring q1 40 the left bank drainage systems contributed 31 sys1 29 sys2 7 sys3 7 whereas the right bank drainage systems delivered only about 5 frau 1 0 1 frau 2 5 during baseflow the total flow volume contributed by the tributaries was 18 higher than the total flow volume measured at the catchment outlet suggesting an important exfiltration flux into the groundwater this may be related to the relatively dry conditions during the study period 2017 with low groundwater tables for the period 2013 2015 which was much wetter széles et al 2018 found that 37 of the total flow volume measured at mw during low flow periods enters the stream laterally simultaneous grab control measurements of flow in 2017 confirmed the exfiltration 3 2 2 doc mass balance as mentioned earlier the doc loads of the tributaries were calculated using a regression between flow and doc concentration although the correlation coefficients and the slopes of the regressions varied between tributaries we found clear relationships for all sites correlation coefficients between 0 76 and 0 97 exceptions are the spring q1 and frau2 where the correlation coefficients were smaller than 0 5 due to the small flow variability in q1 and hysteresis effects in frau2 we therefore used the mean doc concentrations to calculate loads at q1 and frau2 although the tributaries draining the arable sites frau1 and frau2 had the highest concentrations they only made a minor contribution 7 to the total doc input of 124 kg during feb 3rd to dec 31st into the stream due to their low flow volume figure 5 the highest doc inputs into the stream occurred via the spring q1 35 kg doc 28 of total doc inputs and sys1 34 kg 28 because of their high discharge volumes 24 400 m³ and 16 400 m³ 36 and 24 of total flow the calculated doc loads clearly show that the doc inputs were mainly controlled by the flow volume of the respective tributaries figure 4 3 2 3 instream doc net production instream processes were evaluated by comparing the inputs from the tributaries and the outputs at the catchment outlet for both water volume and doc loads while over the period from february 3rd to december 31st 2017 a total loss of water of 10 300 m³ was measured there was a doc load surplus at the catchment outlet of 13 3 kg figure 5 the exfiltration infiltration model eq 2 5 applied to the base flow data suggests that from february 3rd to may 15th 2017 6900 m³ water infiltrated into the stream and imported 10 4 kg of doc on the other hand the measured water loss during the rest of the year was 17 300 m³ which led to an estimated doc exfiltration of 27 2 kg doc the seasonal patterns of water and doc exchange and the resulting doc net production are given in figure 6 during the periods february 3rd to may 25th 2017 and november 20th to december 31st there was a doc net production of 39 kg with a maximum production rate of 36 g doc h 1 on may 25th the net production turned negative with a minimum of 9 g doc h 1 indicating that more doc was consumed incorporated into microbial biomass or respirated precipitated flocculated or adsorbed than leached or secreted by algae within the stream in july and august the net consumption rate slightly increased to 4 g doc h 1 but showed a second low at the beginning of october similar to the one in june 8 g doc h 1 on november 20th the net production rate turned positive again whenever a rainfall runoff event occurred it caused a temporary peak of doc production indicating an additional release of doc 3 3 spatiotemporal variation of dom quality 3 3 1 soil on average over all soil samples 68 of fluorescence was caused by refractory humic like fluorophores c1 c3 18 by protein like fluorophores c6 and c7 and 14 by labile humic like fluorophores c5 and c8 characterised by low molecular weight both land use and season affected the dom composition figure 7 in summer the forest site showed the highest proportion of refractory humic like dom c1 to c3 63 followed by grassland 61 and the arable site 57 this decrease of the sum of these components from arable to forest is aligned with an increase of labile humic like fluorophores c5 and c8 the proportion of labile humic like dom c5 and c8 decreased from summer to winter for all land use units the proportions of protein like fluorophores c6 and c7 were similar for all land use units in summer 15 to 16 but in the winter half year the mean contribution of c7 protein like tyrosine like was 34 while it was only 13 in summer to understand the differences of the dom quality of soil eluates at different land use sites spearman s rank correlation coefficient between the individual components and doc concentration soil temperature and soil moisture were calculated significant correlations were found between hum c7 and doc spearman s rank correlation coefficient rs 0 90 significance level of p 0 001 hum lab c8 and doc rs 0 78 p 0 05 and hum mic c5 and doc rs 0 73 p 0 01 higher values for measured doc in the soil eluate were associated with higher relative amounts of hum c1 and lower relative amounts of hum mic c5 and hum lab c8 figure 8 panel a soil temperature and soil moisture did not show a significant correlation with any of the components c1 c8 however soil temperature was correlated with aromaticity suva correlation coefficient rs 0 72 p 0 001 and molecular size e2 e3 rs 0 50 p 0 01 indicating that higher temperature has led to less aromatic dom with low molecular weight the means of suva over the study period were highest at the arable site 11 4 l mg 1 m 1 intermediate at the grassland site 10 35 l mg 1 m 1 and lowest at the forest site 4 77 l mg 1 m 1 but the standard deviation was high for all three land use units table 2 on average over the study period the molecular size was highest at the forest site e2 e3 3 4 intermediate at the grassland site e2 e3 4 6 and lowest at the arable site e2 e3 4 8 3 3 2 tributaries at the tributaries refractory humic like fluorophores c1 to c3 contributed between 62 sys4 and 68 sys1 to total fluorescence on average over the study period figure 7 protein like fluorophores c6 and c7 accounted for 11 to 12 of fluorescence for all tributaries with minor differences between the tributaries microbial derived humic like fluorophores c5 contributed between 16 sys2 and 22 frau2 the remaining 1 to 7 were c8 which is described as microbially derived relatively aliphatic humic like fluorophores with low molecular weight relevant seasonal changes occur for tryp c6 and hum lab c8 tryp c6 is lower in summer while hum lab c8 is lower in winter we calculated spearman s rank correlation coefficient between the dom quality of the tributaries and environmental parameters in a similar way as for the soil data but included additional water quality parameters such as nitrate and phosphate concentration the main explanatory variables of dom composition were found to be soil moisture in the catchment the tributary is draining availability of nitrate in the streamflow of the tributary and doc concentration soil moisture is positively correlated with the relative amounts of hum rec c3 and negatively with hum lab c8 of the tributaries figure 8 panel b nitrate was positively correlated with hum lab c8 only rs 0 38 p 0 01 while higher nitrate concentrations are associated with lower aromaticity suva rs 0 36 p 0 01 and smaller molecular size of dom e2 e3 rs 0 55 p 0 001 doc concentration of the tributaries was positively correlated with hum mic c5 rs 0 38 p 0 01 and negatively correlated with aromaticity suva rs 0 51 p 0 001 it appears that increasing doc concentration has led to less aromatic labile dom 3 4 dom quality from source to catchment outlet 3 4 1 soil to tributaries the dom quality differs between soil eluate and tributaries while the proportions of the more refractory components c1 c3 are comparable between eluates and tributaries except for the forest soil in winter the proportions of the more labile fractions vary the tributaries showed a higher relative proportion of hum mic c5 159 and tryp c6 84 and a lower proportion of tyr c7 62 and hum lab c8 63 than the soil eluates figure 7 besides the seasonal variability of the dom composition was much lower in the tributaries than in the eluates frau 2 draining the arable field sys 1 groundwater affected and sys3 draining both arable and forested areas showed lower proportions of hum lab c8 in winter than the other tributaries the lowest seasonal variability occurs at the stream outlet mw figure 7 similar to frau 2 and sys 1 the outlet was characterized by relatively low proportions of hum lab c8 the humification index hix increased from an average of 0 75 in the soil eluate to 0 84 in the tributaries the ratio e2 e3 was higher in the drainage frau2 7 6 frau1 7 0 and sys 2 6 6 than in the soil eluates of the corresponding arable site 4 8 and forest 3 4 table 2 3 4 2 tributary to catchment outlet the instream processes of the individual dom components were evaluated in an analogous way to doc based on mass balance including exchanges with the aquifer due to exfiltration and infiltration during the study period from february 3rd to december 31st 2017 all dom components apart from hum lab c8 showed a positive net production table 3 only hum lab c8 was consumed which almost completely disappeared at the catchment outlet in addition changes of dom quality along the stream were observed at two stream sections the upstream section 1 was between sys4 and b1 190 m and downstream section 2 between b2 and mw 96 m for section 1 only periods without stream flow at frau 1 and frau 2 were compared in both sections the relative contributions of hum c1 hum ter c2 hum rec c3 tyr c6 and tryp c7 increased and hum lab c8 decreased according to the upper results provided in table 3 only hum mic c5 remained on the same level over the stream course molecular size e2 e3 and aromaticity increased along the stream in both sections indicating an increasing proportion of more refractory dom components 4 discussion 4 1 land use impacts on doc and dom quality we observed a distinct impact of land use on the doc concentrations in the soil eluate showing a decrease from the forest to the grassland and the arable land doc concentrations were positively correlated with soc as was also observed by others ghani et al 2007 khomutova et al 2000 ward et al 2007 zhang et al 2007 zsolnay 1996 marschner and kalbitz 2003 and stutter and billett 2003 suggested that doc equilibrates between the mobile aqueous phase and the immobile solid phase indicating that higher soc leads to higher doc in the soil land use is an important factor controlling the soc content in the soil and thus also affects doc concentrations in the soil eluate the same pattern of decreasing doc concentrations from forest floor over grassland a horizon to arable land a horizon was found by chantigny 2003 in general the doc concentrations in the tributaries measured in the present study area the hoal petzenkirchen are relatively low compared to other studies vidon et al 2008 found similar concentrations in tile drains from arable land 2 28 mg l 1 but almost twice the values in groundwater 4 34 mg l 1 and 3 60 mg l 1 and the streams 4 78 mg l 1 and 4 85 mg l 1 graeber et al 2012 found even higher doc concentrations in streams of agricultural catchments 7 6 2 8 mg l 1 but forested catchments had approximately the same mean doc concentration 1 5 0 9 mg l 1 as measured in sys2 draining the forest in the hoal kalbitz et al 2000 reported that dom is strongly adsorbed to clay minerals in the mineral soil resulting in low doc output from these soils this process may explain the generally low doc concentrations in the hoal where the soil mainly consists of heavy clay material surprisingly doc concentrations in the tributaries showed an opposite pattern to the corresponding soils with increasing doc concentrations from the tributary draining the forest to the tributary draining the arable field despite similar flow volumes sys2 and frau2 in figure 5 higher doc outputs from the arable fields may be caused by higher microbial degradation due to the surplus of nutrients by fertilization chantigny et al 1999 frank and groffman 2009 or due to soil treatments on the fields such as ploughing kalbitz et al 2000 steenwerth and belina 2008 fertilizer application lead to a nitrogen surplus increasing the decomposition rate of organic matter through an improved c n ratio chantigny et al 1999 enowashu et al 2009 frank and groffman 2009 and thus the potential leaching the laboratory leaching experiments with soils of the hoal petzenkirchen by tiefenbacher et al 2020 found that fertilization with both mineral and organic fertilizers reduced doc leaching for a few weeks compared to sandy soils from other regions less doc was leached from the clayey soils beside the c n ratio the oxygen supply is important for decomposition processes to occur bueno and ladha 2009 found that cultivation and the turnover of soils accelerate the decomposition of plant residues in soils by providing oxygen thereby resulting also in increased dom leaching tile drains may intensify this process due to the direct linkage of agricultural soils to streams and less retention of doc in the soil blann et al 2009 this could have been the case in our study area as the field is regularly ploughed and drained in addition an accumulation of organic matter in deeper soil layers during dry periods is possible during subsequent rain events this organic matter is leached and may lead to increased doc concentrations in the corresponding drainage pipes frau 1 and frau 2 in our study the dom composition of the soil was only poorly correlated with the dom composition in the corresponding tributaries specifically the labile dom fractions c5 c8 in the soil eluates showed higher proportions of the protein like components tryp c6 and tyr c7 and of the humic like low molecular hum lab c8 while the tributaries were characterised by a higher proportion of the humic like low molecular hum mic c5 graeber et al 2012 concluded that seemingly contradicting results from soil and stream studies imply that only a low percentage of the soil organic matter som lost from agricultural soils is transported to the streams as dom or that dom originating from agricultural som is rapidly taken up in streams besides the dom from terrestrial sources is usually subject to a variety of biological physical and chemical processes in the soil which alter its composition baldock and skjemstad 2000 qualls and richardson 2003 silveira 2005 especially the heavy clayey soils in the hoal petzenkirchen increase the retention time of the soil pore water thereby altering the dom composition tiefenbacher et al 2020 also observed differences in dom composition depending on soil texture the shift from proteins c6 c7 and hum lab c8 to hum mic c5 indicates that hum mic c5 is probably a product of the degradation of one of the other components such relationships between the degradation of one component and the production of another component have also been observed elsewhere pucher et al 2021 submitted casas ruiz et al 2017 weigelhofer et al 2020 the strong modification of dom during the soil passage in our study is also indicated by the increase of hix and the strong decrease of suva254 from soil to the tributaries this is consistent with fellman et al 2009 who observed a decrease in suva254 values as dom moved from soils to sub catchment streams another explanations for the different patterns of doc and dom quality in the soil eluate and the tributaries could be the fact that doc concentrations of soil eluate represent a potential doc tipping et al 1999 rather than the material that is leached from the soil under natural conditions the destruction of the soil aggregates during the analysis and the desorption of organic matter from mineral surfaces by k2so4 stimulate the leaching of soil organic matter from the samples ewing et al 2006 ogle et al 2005 under conditions naturally met in the field water from the fine pores is usually strongly bound and thus not available for transport 4 2 temporal variations of doc and dom quality we observed no clear influence of agricultural practices on the doc content of the arable soil eluate the doc content in the upper soil layer of the arable fields did not vary much evidently caused by the limited soc content 2 0 g kg 1 compared to grassland 4 1 g kg 1 and forest 9 2 g kg 1 although kalbitz et al 2000 found a direct impact of agrotechnical practices on doc in the arable surface soil layer causing more frequent fluctuations in the doc content we did not observe such changes on an about monthly sampling interval similarly rosa and debska 2018 found no direct effect of the organic natural fertilization on the doc content in a 2 year arable soil sampling campaign in poland and chantigny 2003 stated that changes in doc resulting from management activities are generally of short duration shorter sampling intervals may provide more detailed insight into this question however we observed clear seasonal patterns in the forest and the grassland with increased doc concentrations during the warm summer months and a pronounced doc peak in late autumn again this pattern was not reflected by the tributaries in contrast the tributaries showed a general decline in doc concentrations during summer with a small peak in late summer coinciding with a small decline in the doc concentrations of the soil eluates and a larger peak in january and february these patterns may have been mainly driven by precipitation the dry weather in summer may have led to an accumulation of potentially leachable organic matter within the soils resulting also in smaller exports from the terrestrial sources to the tributaries with increasing rain fall and subsequent increasing moisture content in late summer part of the accumulated soil organic matter was probably washed out thereby increasing the doc concentrations of the tributaries this may also explain the correlation between soil moisture and doc concentrations in the tributaries soil moisture affects the physical chemical and biological processes along the transport of dom through soil and thus influences dom export to subsurface and drainage waters tiefenbacher et al 2021 bolan et al 2011 it appears that higher soil moisture also stimulates microbial activity brockett et al 2012 leading to the consumption of humic like fluorophores with low molecular weight c8 and an increase of the relative amounts of terrestrial recalcitrant humic like components c3 a relevant input of organic material and thus potentially leachable material is leaf litter in fall this litter seems to have directly affected soil doc concentration in the forest in addition to temperature induced seasonal variability the same phenomenon with less intensity was also observed at the grassland site these additional organic inputs seem to be immediately leachable and a metabolizable nutrition for microbes leading to higher doc concentrations of the soil eluate in a long term litter manipulation experiment kalbitz et al 2007 found that a doubling of litter input instantaneously doubled the doc concentrations the doc peak in the forest eluates was accompanied by an increase in protein like fluorescence from 15 in summer to 36 in winter fellman et al 2009 observed similar patterns for protein like fluorescence at three soils in alaska where the relative contribution on total fluorescence decreased from 8 and 10 in may to approximately 5 and 3 in july and august the lower level of protein like contribution compared to our results can be explained by the different climate in alaska with much colder temperatures and only 5 months of snow free season 4 3 main drivers of doc at the catchment outlet the annual doc inputs from the tributaries into the stream are largely controlled by water flow while the doc source plays a secondary role blann et al 2009 found that the catchment export of doc was larger with drainages due to higher proportion of total annual precipitation discharged to surface waters relative to the amount that is stored in the soil during the year evaporated or transpired however different land uses affected the doc export to the stream the tributaries draining the arable land exhibited higher doc concentrations than the tributaries draining the mixed or forested land use units an important doc source is the stream itself during baseflow conditions within the period of positive net production from november to may instream processes caused 37 of the total measured doc load at the catchment outlet the seasonal patterns of instream doc production can be explained by changes of temperature light and availability of nutrients in march and april the stream shows a peak in net doc production during this time algae growth and thus primary production are high due to increasing water temperatures and availability of light thus contributing to instream doc production fasching et al 2016 similar short periods of autotrophic production have been observed in other headwater streams weigelhofer et al 2012 in may the stream gets shaded leading to a breakdown of algal biomass and a decrease of primary doc production high water temperatures and nutrient availability control and stimulate bacterial activity leading to an increase of instream net consumption due to carbon incorporation into microbial biomass and respiration demars et al 2011 hill et al 2000 rosemond et al 2014 interestingly the stream becomes net productive again already in november at a time when autotrophic activities are still low we believe that this net doc production in winter is mainly due to an increased leaching of leaves within the stream or at the banks lateral doc inputs not measured and generally low heterotrophic activities due to low water temperatures short rainfall runoff events in summer can lead to temporary peaks of net production during a period of general net consumption shown in figure 6 by individual positive dots during summer such temporary peaks are probably due to lateral inputs of doc from inundated bank areas and or resuspension and mixing of stream bed material encouraging instream leaching in the same catchment eder et al 2014 found that a small rise of stream water level increased transport capacity and caused the resuspension of bed sediments which likely affects organic matter leaching a rise of water level will also increase the water contact area for leaching instream processes also alter dom composition especially during baseflow fasching et al 2016 raymond et al 2016 hum lab c8 almost completely disappeared after 600 m of flow length molecular size e2 e3 and aromaticity suva254 increased along the stream indicating bacterial uptake of aliphatic low molecular weight dom this is consistent with the findings of fellman et al 2009 for two rivers in alaska where the protein rich labile fraction was selectively removed with passage downstream during the period february 3rd to december 31st 2017 only small rainfall runoff events occurred and thus doc instream balances were only calculated for baseflow during high rainfall runoff events import by tributaries diffuse lateral inputs from the floodplain and resuspension will gain in importance while instream processes will be less significant fasching et al 2016 raymond et al 2016 besides terrestrial dom sources for the stream may change in importance 5 summary and conclusions based on a sampling campaign conducted during 2017 in the hoal petzenkirchen in lower austria we draw the following conclusions the doc concentrations of the soil eluates correlate positively with the soc contents and are 5 and 1 5 times higher at the forest site and the grassland site respectively than at the arable land site in summer the soil eluate doc concentration increases probably due to increased microbial activity and the related faster decomposition of organic material additional inputs of organic material such as leaf litter in autumn also increase the doc concentrations in the soil eluate in contrast to the soil eluate the doc concentrations of the tributaries are lower in summer probably due to the lower hydraulic connectivity from the source to the tributaries the strong temporal correlation between doc load and total flow volume of all seven tributaries r 0 91 indicates that total doc inputs into the stream are determined by hydrology i e the water fluxes and land use plays only a secondary role land use and season affect the dom quality of soil eluate leaf litter in winter causes an increase of protein like dom at the tributaries the impacts of land use and season on the dom composition are neglectable as processes in the soil alter the dom quality during transport from the terrestrial source to the stream soil moisture correlates with dom quality indicating that moisture drives organic matter processing and transport in the soil high soil moisture leads to an increased share of refractory dom components and a lower contribution of protein like and labile humic like components the study also demonstrates that methods of doc and dom quality sampling and processing in the soil and the stream are not necessarily comparable while soil eluates are easy to obtain they only represent a doc and dom quality potential even soil pore water collected in the field or from percolation experiments may not represent the doc and dom components actually entering the stream as they are likely modified along the flow path although the catchment of this study is small relatively homogeneous and dominated by agriculture the monitoring of the tributaries shows that small forest patches in the immediate vicinity of the stream may play a significant role in the doc supply since flow volumes tend to vary more in space and time than doc concentrations the former are more important for determining total doc loads thus relationships between doc and dom quality in the stream and the dominating land use is hard to detect and probably do not fully represent the actual drivers of doc input into streams furthermore time lags between activities in the catchment and responses in the aquatic doc need to be accounted for our study also reveals the significance of instream processing of doc and dom components including both production and degradation complicating the detection of land use impacts and agricultural practises on aquatic carbon characteristics further in the study period instream processes increased total doc export from the catchment by 24 compared to the doc inputs from the tributaries from may 25th to november 20th 2017 instream net doc consumption was observed leading to a loss of 12 kg doc probably due to bacterial uptake and respiration instream processes also alter the dom quality the labile humic like component c8 almost completely disappeared after 600 m of flow length molecular size e2 e3 and aromaticity increased along the stream indicating bacterial uptake of aliphatic low molecular weight dom future work may be directed towards rainfall runoff events and their impact on doc inputs from the fields into the stream and the consecutive stimulation of instream processes preliminary results from two observed rainfall runoff events indicate higher doc inputs from the individual tributaries during high flow compared to base flow and a stimulation of the instream doc release alternative methods for characterising soil doc and dom quality may allow the establishment of more direct links across scales furthermore it would be of interest to examine the role of varying levels of doc loads associated with different land uses for instream dom processes in streams of different sizes and shapes ethical statement the research was done according to
