11405,the excessive water use in central asian countries has caused an environmental disaster in the aral sea in this regard they need to improve the efficiency of the use of shared water resources to overcome their environmental and economic difficulties accordingly the twin objectives of this study were firstly to analyse the challenges for the use of water resources in the aral sea basin and secondly to estimate the agricultural water use efficiency according to the crop types and irrigation methods the results showed that the economic efficiency of water use in central asian countries was lower than that of other asian countries finally this study illustrated that the selection of crop types and irrigation methods can improve the quantitative and economic efficiency of water use however a clear preliminary outline of interactions is necessary to avoid failure of coordination and collaboration for a regional win win approach in such an outline this study will deliver valuable information on water efficiency in the aral sea basin keywords central asia aral sea basin economy water use efficiency regional water governance 1 introduction the aral sea disaster is the result of water mismanagement and inefficient irrigation systems in the aral sea basin where water resources are shared by the five key riparian countries in central asia uzbekistan turkmenistan tajikistan kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan peachey 2004 micklin 2006 after the collapse of the soviet union water security issues grew regarding the basin as the five riparian governments each tried to utilize freshwater resources only for their own national development lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 abbink et al 2010 chatalova et al 2017 over the 40 years since they have done little to reduce the environmental consequences of water development including the decline in the depth of the aral sea by 26 m micklin 2010 consequently the aral sea has been depleted losing more than half of its surface area and roughly three quarters of its volume compared to the levels measured in the 1960 s the water resource system in the aral sea basin is one of the most complicated networks in the world because of the imbalance of shared water resources available to countries in central asia the geopolitical issues among these countries make water governance in the basin difficult each has their own water policy to promote food security energy generation and economic growth wegerich 2004 bazilian et al 2011 these national water policies are however mostly focused on obtaining more water from the aral sea basin s limited water supply such excessive competition for water has often led to water conflicts among the countries karaev 2005 recently more attention has been paid to regional cooperation by these countries in determining the allocation of transboundary water resources schiff and winters 2002 mckinney 2004 schluter et al 2005 sadegh et al 2010 libert and lipponen 2012 dinar et al 2015 yet these countries still have not reached a compromise and appear to be stuck in an impasse because of different views on water governance at the national and regional levels allouche 2007 the main economic activity in aral sea basin is agriculture kienzler et al 2012 climatic and hydrological conditions of the countries in central asia are however unfavourable for farming because the region is arid despite this agricultural production has focused on crops with high water demands such as cotton and wheat pereira et al 2009 furthermore crop irrigation using the traditional method of furrow irrigation has been shown to decrease the efficiency of water use and crop yield ward and pulido velazquez 2008 consequently agricultural water use has become a significant threat to water security and economic growth in the region to resolve these problems new and innovative methods have been suggested in the literature gordon et al 2010 molden et al 2010 chaudhry and barbier 2013 water intensive crops remain the main source of income in many parts of the region thereby depleting the available water resources needed for continued economic growth as previously mentioned central asian countries will have to clear many hurdles to see sustained economic growth including substantial environmental and economic pressures bichsel 2009 collins 2009 pomfret 2014 to resolve this issue they need to pursue growth potential while minimizing long term risk to the ecosystem for example the concept of green growth or green economy is one of several workable suggestions to overcome the complex problems facing the aral sea basin because it aligns well with the activities the region has pursued pearce et al 1989 hoffmann 2011 mathews 2012 resnick et al 2012 antonelli et al 2013 young and esau 2013 in addition such concepts may be an appropriate approach as a solution for issues that arise from the water energy food nexus waughray 2011 unescap 2013 allouche et al 2014 granit et al 2013 in this regard the concept of water energy food nexus has been studied in many countries jobbins et al 2015 portney et al 2017 yang and wi 2018 however water energy food in a transboundary river basin can be weakened by excessive water competition at the regional scale therefore more effort and time are needed to move gradually towards achieving water energy food nexus in the aral sea basin this study focused on the water use efficiency for water food nexus in the aral sea basin in this regard the objectives of this study are as follows 1 to analyse the challenges facing water resources in terms of the climate and economy and 2 to calculate changes in agricultural water use if wheat land was converted to cotton land or vice versa and if furrow irrigation or subsurface drip irrigation was used to achieve these objectives the authors investigated the water status of the five central asian countries kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan in the aral sea basin at the regional level 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of aral sea basin the aral sea basin includes portions of kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan uzbekistan afghanistan iran and china however the five central asian countries were the main focus of this study because most water resources in the aral sea basin are consumed by these five countries the aral sea basin is morphologically divided into two zones a plain in the central and western parts of the basin and mountains in the east dukhovny and sokolov 2003 fig 1 the plain zone has two main deserts the kara kum desert in the western and southwestern parts of the basin and the kyzyl kum desert in the northern part of the basin the mountainous areas includes two main mountain ranges the tien shan and pamir hydrologically these two mountain ranges are a very important source of water in the aral sea basin because the two main transboundary rivers the syr darya and the amu darya are fed by runoff from melting snows and glaciers bernauer and siegfried 2012 hagg et al 2013 sorg et al 2014 the area of aral sea basin is approximately 154 8 mha million hectares in total and consists of lands controlled by kazakhstan 34 4 mha kyrgyzstan 12 5 mha tajikistan 14 3 mha turkmenistan 48 8 mha and uzbekistan 44 8 mha the basin therefore makes up approximately 39 of the total 400 mha area of the five countries cawaterinfo 2015 the population in the aral sea basin was 46 million in 2006 and includes many diverse cultures the population in the basin has grown by 31 million people in less than 50 years sokolov 2009 the basin has a continental arid and semi arid climate with precipitation concentrated during the spring and winter seasons precipitation exhibits a spatial difference according to the morphological characteristics of the basin for example yearly precipitation ranges from 80 to 150 mm on the plains and from 600 to 800 mm in the mountains cawaterinfo 2015 the amount of precipitation may not be enough to ensure that the rivers flow into the basin perennially during the dry season river flow is maintained by snow and glacier meltwater from mountainous regions rather than from precipitation granit et al 2010 the sources of water for the central asian countries are the syr darya and the amu darya rivers glantz 1999 ntegeka et al 2014 each river basin has a separate network of hydraulic structures to control or reserve water resources fang et al 2005 allouche 2007 the regional operation of each network is very complicated because these hydraulic structures are constructed and operated under the guidance of the national water policy of each country vinogradov and langford 2001 micklin 2007 scheer et al 2008 the syr darya river and its tributaries flow along and within the borders of four countries kirghizstan kazakhstan tajikistan and uzbekistan the syr darya is the main source of irrigation water to kazakhstan tajikistan and uzbekistan immerzeel et al 2010 kaser et al 2010 the syr darya has a bearing capacity of 37 2 billion m3 and is 3019 km long making it the longest river in the basin the amu darya river and its major tributaries flow along and within the borders of three countries tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan the amu darya provides water for hydropower generation and irrigation in those countries mergili et al 2013 it has an average annual flow of 79 3 billion m3 making it the largest river in terms of water capacity in the aral sea basin and measures 2540 km in length from the headwaters of its tributary the pyandzh to the aral sea cawaterinfo 2015 since the soviet era 1918 1991 the increasing demand for water within these transboundary rivers has made it difficult to assign water allocations among the countries furthermore agricultural irrigation water in central asia has significantly contributed to economic production accounting for more than 15 of the total gdp except in kazakhstan 9 9 kienzler et al 2012 in these situations unclear water allocation regulations incite competition among the countries to secure more water bichsel 2009 libert and lipponen 2012 as a result excessive water consumption has led to a remarkable decrease in the surface area of and volume of the aral sea over the last 50 years compared to 1960 the surface area and volume decreased to 12 5 and 7 7 respectively in 2009 micklin 2010 in the aral sea basin inefficient irrigation systems and mismanagement of irrigation water allocations have also resulted in elevated water and soil salinity levels widespread environmental degradation and diminished agricultural productivity niyazov et al 2012 lioubimtseva 2014 furthermore in an effort to obtain sufficient water resources these central asian countries have pursued independent water policies resulting in conflicts 2 2 status of water and land resources in the aral sea basin available water resources in the aral sea basin include surface water groundwater and return water from residential areas and agricultural activities the average annual river flow in the basin is 116 48 km3 yr with contributions from the amu darya 79 28 km3 yr and syr darya basins 37 20 km3 yr table 1 among the central asian countries tajikistan and kazakhstan have the most and the least river flow in the basin respectively specifically the average annual river flow is highest in tajikistan for the amu darya basin and kyrgyzstan for the syr darya basin both tajikistan and kyrgyzstan are located in upstream reaches of each basin and are more mountainous with more rain than the other countries agricultural lands including irrigated lands measure 9 86 mha making up 5 8 of total area of the basin table 2 uzbekistan has more agricultural land 5 48 mha than the other four countries combined as a whole these countries have created an imbalance between water use and natural water generation because agricultural water supply mostly depends on irrigation with a large contribution to river flow and a very low amount of agricultural area kyrgyzstan is a notable exception land used for cotton and wheat production the main crops in the basin measure 2 66 mha and 2 92 mha respectively high water consumption is required to produce these two crops however immediate replacement of these water intensive crops is difficult because of the extent to which this traditional agricultural structure has influenced regional or national infrastructure soil labour and farming methods nevertheless the inefficient irrigation system used to irrigate these water intensive crops is the main factor for water stress in the aral sea basin 2 3 challenges of water resources in terms of climate and economy economic and climatic aspects of the water resource challenge in the aral sea basin were analyzed a comparative analysis of the relationship between water use and economy at the national level is needed to investigate efficiency of water use in the basin for this reason two other regions northeast asia and southeast asia are included in this analysis to evaluate the relative efficiency of water use in other regions of asia the selected northeast asian countries are the republic of korea japan and china and the selected southeast asian countries are china lao people s democratic republic thailand vietnam and cambodia in the mekong river basin because of its geographical position china is the only country involved in both the northeast asian and southeast asian regions although the selected countries including the five central asian countries have different economic levels most of the water is consumed in the agricultural sector in all of them specifically water use for agriculture in central and southeast asian countries accounts for more than 80 of its total use brooks et al 2005 mirumachi and allan 2007 in this study data on the gross national product gnp per capita and withdrawal per capita were obtained from the world bank the aral sea basin has suffered water shortages because of excessive water use in addition to excessive water use natural factors including long term climate change have complicated existing water challenges because they reduce the quantity of available water climate change adaptation is a major component of sustainable water use climate change has a strong effect on water governance in the basin which is in a semi arid region with extremely little precipitation an important component of climate change adaptation is an understanding of the hydrologic and ecologic responses to future climate various climate scenarios can be found in literature wang et al 2014 fao 2011 unescap 2011 julia and duchin 2013 however this study used the past climatic data instead of future climate change scenarios to understand the history of climate change in the basin the rainfall and temperature data obtained from the world bank for 1960 to 2009 were analyzed to explore climatic change by comparing the differences between the two periods 1960 1990 a part of soviet era and 1990 2009 after soviet era 2 4 quantification of water use for efficiency of irrigation methods irrigation plays a vital role in increasing crop yield and stabilizing production in arid and semi arid regions such as the aral sea basin irrigation is essential for economically viable agriculture whereas in semi humid and humid areas it is often required only on a supplementary basis to select an irrigation method the farmer must know the advantages and disadvantages of each method and understand which method suits the local conditions best for example considering climate and water conditions in the aral sea basin adoption of subsurface drip irrigation hereby referred to as drip irrigation can be one of the best approaches for reducing water consumption because this method can increase water use efficiency more than other methods in particular in arid regions it is necessary to avoid huge loss of water from evapotranspiration which can be achieved with drip irrigation because it is based on pipe networks however the high cost for initial installation and potential for damage to pipes from freezing are the main concerns central asian countries have for adopting drip irrigation conversely furrow irrigation which is one of the least efficient irrigation methods is still a popular method because of low cost as a result 99 of the total irrigated area in central asian countries is under furrow irrigation woznicki and pouyan nejadhashemi 2014 however the increasing attention on the environmental problems and concerns about water security are forcing reconsideration of the irrigation systems within the aral sea basin uzbekistan has the largest irrigated area 4 2 mha and the most water withdrawal for irrigation 44 7 km3 year whereas kyrgyzstan has the least irrigated area 0 428 mha and the least water withdrawal 2 3 km3 table 3 uzbekistan contributes approximately 9 6 of river flow to the aral sea basin but accounts for 52 8 of water withdrawals for irrigation on contrary kyrgyzstan contributes 24 4 but accounts only for 2 7 of water withdrawals for irrigation in the case of other countries in central asia most countries located upstream tend to contribute large amounts to river flow in the aral sea basin and have small water withdrawals for irrigation whereas the countries located downstream tend to make a small contribution to river flow in the basin but have significant water withdrawals for irrigation therefore this study attempted to promote the shared water resource and quantify the volume needed to obtain a sustainable water level in the aral sea through changes in irrigation methods this study attempts to analyse and compare water use and economic profit of furrow irrigation and drip irritation methods in cotton and wheat production for analysing water use yield productivity and economic efficiency according to irrigation method the ratio of drip irrigation to furrow irrigation in an irrigated area was calculated to evaluate productivity as well as the ratio of wheat to cotton in a given irrigated area to evaluate economic benefits these ratios were estimated based on the data from ward and pulido velazquez ward and pulido velazquez 2008 working with data from semi arid regions of texas usa and ciudad jua rez mexico table 4 to minimize the uncertainty arising from the fact that central asia and previously measured places have different climate and economic conditions the relationship was described with ratios with the assumption that the irrigation water used for each crop in each country was proportional to the area of each crop and that the current irrigation is controlled by the furrow irrigation technique this study developed eqs 1 5 to calculate efficiency of water quantity qe economic efficiency ee and economic efficiency per efficiency of water quantity epq in water use here qe ee and epq are dimensionless and can be respectively calculated by eqs 1 5 when drip irrigation was installed in cotton and wheat at the same ratio and cotton to wheat ctw or wheat to cotton wtc conversions were made in an irrigated area of crop in each country table 3 in addition in eqs 1 4 the constants indicating the relative efficiency ratio between irrigation methods or crop types are based on values in table 4 q e c t w eq 1 and e e c t w eq 3 represent qe and ee respectively when converting an irrigated cotton area into a wheat area and q e w t c eq 2 and e e w t c eq 4 are qe and ee respectively at the time of converting an irrigated wheat area into a cotton area the epq can be calculated by eq 5 more precisely to explain eq1 q e c t w let a c resp a w be the irrigated area ha for cotton resp wheat and r w c resp r c w be conversion ratios dimensionless from cotton to wheat resp from wheat to cotton we also let d resp f be the ratio of the drip irrigation resp the furrow irrigation to total irrigation dimensionless therefore f 1 d to calculate q e c t w i e efficiency of water quantity with conversion rate r w c we need to consider the following factors 1 when converting an irrigated cotton area into a wheat area with conversion rate r w c area for cotton area that is converted from cotton to wheat and area for wheat before conversion are a c 1 r w c a c r w c and a w respectively 2 the relative efficiency ratio in irrigation water of drip irrigation to furrow for cotton and wheat are 0 54 and 0 56 respectively table 4 3 the relative efficiency ratio in irrigation water between wheat and cotton is 0 89 furrow irrigation and 0 93 drip irrigation respectively table 4 following the above three factors we have 1 q e c t w a c 1 r w c a c r w c 0 89 a w f a c 1 r w c 0 54 a c r w c 0 56 0 93 a w 0 56 d a c a w in front of f in eq 1 we multiply a c r w c by 0 89 because 0 89 is the relative efficiency ratio in furrow irrigation between wheat and cotton in front of d in eq 1 we also multiply a c 1 r w c a c r w c a w by 0 54 0 56 and 0 56 respectively because these constants are the relative efficiency ratios of drip irrigation to furrow for cotton and wheat we further multiply a c r w c by 0 93 because 0 93 is the relative efficiency ratio in drip irrigation water between wheat and cotton similarly we also calculate q e w t c as follows 2 q e w t c a w 1 r c w a w r c w 0 89 a c f a w 1 r c w 0 56 a w r c w 0 54 0 93 a c 0 54 d a c a w water use efficiency is higher when qe is lower similarly to calculate e e c t w i e economic efficiency with conversion rate r w c we need to consider the following factors 1 when converting an irrigated cotton area into a wheat area with conversion rate r w c the area for cotton area that is converted from cotton to wheat and area for wheat before conversion are a c 1 r w c a c r w c and a w respectively 2 the relative efficiency ratio in economic benefit of drip irrigation to furrow for cotton and wheat is 1 25 table 4 3 the relative efficiency ratio in economic benefit between wheat and cotton is 0 46 table 4 3 e e c t w a c 1 r w c a c r w c 0 46 a w f a c 1 r w c 1 25 a c r w c 1 25 0 46 a w 1 25 d a c a w in front of f in eq 3 we multiply a c r w c by 0 46 because it is the relative efficiency ratio in furrow irrigation between wheat and cotton in front of d in eq 1 we also multiply a c 1 r w c a c r w c and a w by 1 25 respectively because it is the relative efficiency ratio in economic benefit of drip irrigation to furrow for cotton and wheat we further multiply a c r w c by 0 46 because it is the relative efficiency ratio in drip irrigation between wheat and cotton similarly we also calculate e e w t c as follows 4 e e w t c a w 1 r c w a w r c w 0 46 a c f a w 1 r c w 1 25 a w r c w 1 25 0 46 a c 1 25 d a c a w finally we are able to calculate epq as follows 5 e p q e e c t w q e c t w for conversion from cotton to wheat e e w t c q e w t c for conversion from wheat to cotton 3 results and discussion 3 1 challenges to water resource management in the aral sea basin 3 1 1 challenges to socio economic conditions fig 2 shows the relationship between water withdrawals per capita and gross national production gnp per capita in constant 2000 u s dollars based on data retrieved from the world bank for several locations around the world the selected countries are characterized by three main groups according to the relationship between water use and economic level the first group comprises northeast asian countries which have high water use and high economic productivity the second group comprises southeast asian countries in the mekong river basin which have low water use and low economic productivity the last one comprises central asian countries in aral sea basin which have high water use but low economic productivity specifically water use per capita including industrial agricultural and domestic water is highest in turkmenistan and lowest in cambodia in addition gnp per capita which is an important development indicator is highest in japan and lowest in tajikistan economic levels of kazakhstan thailand and china are similar but there is a difference in the quantity of water use kazakhstan thailand and china have higher economic productivity than other countries in central and southeast asia largely caused by oil production in kazakhstan tourism in thailand and the growth of the domestic economy in china of course industrial development can affect both water consumption and economy in a country although central asia and southeast asia have similar economic levels of productivity water consumption per capita in central asia is much higher than that of southeast asia annual water consumption per capita is more than 1000 m3 in central asia and less than 1000 m3 in southeast asia group the two groups have struggled to achieve economic growth but the analysis shows that the economy of central asia depends on relatively inefficient use of water resources one major factor causing the difference in water use between central and southeast asia could be local climatic conditions water demand for irrigation is typically higher in arid regions such as central asia than in humid regions such as southeast asia because arid conditions mean there is little precipitation or groundwater available to meet the demand for water required for crop growth inefficient water use in central asia not only degrades the environment in the aral sea basin but also becomes an obstacle to their economic growth low efficiency in water use drives the need for regional and national water governance in the aral sea basin cotton production in the basin places excessive demands on water supplies but it is still a major contributor to the economy of central asian countries the position of cotton production as a main income source in central asian countries however has become unstable because of the development of other textiles increases in labour and fertilizer prices and decreases in cotton price therefore central asian countries should explore alternatives to minimize environmental damage and promote economic growth through efficient and sustainable water use improvements in industrial infrastructure upgrades in existing irrigation facilities changes in the main agricultural crops and development of technology to promote crop productivity are some possible alternatives that should be explored in addition it is necessary to provide educational opportunities to reduce water demand by promoting efficiency in water use especially by farmers who consume a lot of water resources 3 1 2 challenges due to climate change the analysis of climate change in the aral sea basin revealed an overall decline in the annual rainfall and an increase in the average annual temperature figs 3 and 4 in the case of rainfall monthly rainfall was converted to annual cumulative rainfall and then the annual rainfall was averaged over two periods the average annual rainfall was larger in the period from 1960 to 1990 relative to the period from 1990 to 2009 for all countries except uzbekistan the average annual rainfall between the two periods increased by 11 mm in uzbekistan but it decreased by a surprising 44 mm in tajikistan table 5 based on the reduced standard deviation of monthly rainfall between two periods the average monthly rainfall over the year decreased in its variability such a phenomenon may be mainly caused by a decrease in rainfall between the two periods the decline in the quantity of rainfall directly propagates a decrease in the available water resources in the basin unlike the reduced rainfall average annual temperature between the two periods increased by approximately 1 2 2 7 c for all five countries table 6 the effect of increased temperature could accelerate evapotranspiration which is the movement of water from land and vegetation to the atmosphere allen et al 1998 presented findings regarding the amount of evapotranspiration for climatic regions in response to changes in temperature as shown in table 7 the response of evapotranspiration to temperature increases is more sensitive in semi arid and arid regions than in humid and sub humid regions frenken 2013 the main side effect of the increased evapotranspiration because of poor water resource management is the decrease in soil moisture in fallow and vegetated areas therefore the increasing trend of evapotranspiration in the basin can increase the challenge of satisfying the water demand for agriculture to summarize the trend of the changes in climate showed a decrease in rainfall fig 3 and table 5 and increase in temperatures in the basin such climate changes will have a negative influence on national and regional water governance of the aral sea basin if climate change factors are not considered in future water resource management regarding the current physical geopolitical and social situation of the region vulnerability to water related disasters will be increased over time 3 1 3 quantification of efficiency in water use in the aral sea basin this study calculated qe and ee in water use and epq of each country according to crop types and irrigation methods tables 8 10 from the perspective of qe when cultivation of cotton was fully converted into wheat using drip irrigation for all countries the efficiency was the highest 0 52 0 54 whereas when wheat was fully converted into cotton using the current irrigation method furrow irrigation the efficiency was the lowest 1 04 1 09 table 8 regarding ee when wheat was fully converted into cotton using drip irrigation for all countries the efficiency was the highest 1 68 2 28 and when cotton was fully converted into wheat using furrow irrigation the efficiency was the lowest 0 62 0 84 table 9 in terms of epq when wheat was fully converted into cotton using drip irrigation the efficiency was the highest 3 00 3 86 and when cotton was fully converted into wheat using furrow irrigation the efficiency was the lowest 0 67 0 87 table 10 in particular among all the countries tajikistan had the highest epq under all conditions however the size of the agricultural area was not considered it is not prudent to request tajikistan to change its crop types and irrigation methods given the relatively small acreages involved for instance although turkmenistan and uzbekistan have lower epq than tajikistan they have much larger agricultural lands therefore it is necessary to take into consideration the amount of water that the two countries use in the aral sea basin the study indicated that the efficiency obtainable through changes in crop types and irrigation methods in the aral sea basin is as follows qe ee and epq were calculated to be 0 53 1 06 1 74 2 01 and 0 78 3 53 tables 8 10 fig 5 illustrates the efficiency according to the changes in crop and irrigation across the basin based on this result the change in water use more sensitively influenced ee than qe in addition drip irrigation further influenced epq as more wheat land was converted to cotton land the greatest limitation of this study is a lack of information particularly regarding the irrigated areas of each country and each crop thus an agricultural area ratio was assigned to an irrigated area for each crop in this case an irrigated area could be different depending on the actual crop and uncertainty about an irrigated area could affect estimation of water use efficiency because there was little information available on qe and ee in water use according to measured crop types and irrigation methods in the aral sea basin this study used the data in texas usa and ciudad juárez mexico ward and pulido velazquez 2008 although the region is semi arid it is different from the aral sea basin in terms of temperature wind and sunshine these differences can influence the actual water use necessary to cultivate crops in addition because the countries are at different stages of economic development and scale economic benefit could be different depending on crop types and irrigation methods to reduce such uncertainty this study applied a relative ratio nevertheless it will be necessary to keep collecting relevant information in the aral sea basin and determine more accurately the water efficiency suitable to regional characteristics of the basin in addition in estimating water efficiency according to crop changes there was insufficient information regarding water demands and economic profits for all crops for this reason this study needed to focus on wheat and cotton and was limited in its ability to explore the efficiency of other crop changes additionally this study did not address the costs for crop changes and for irrigation installation and management despite these limitations this study presents important conclusions about water use efficiency as a consideration in decisions about crop changes and irrigation methods in particular the ability to indirectly predict the cost to increase water efficiency based on qe and ee of water use as calculated in this study could contribute to establishing a systematic plan for future water resource management in the aral sea basin 4 conclusions in the aral sea basin water conflicts arise from different water policies regarding the distribution of the shared water resources in the related central asian countries it is necessary therefore to not only achieve technical improvements through agreements among these countries but to develop regional water governance through the legal systems of the aral sea basin in addition the countries need to jointly increase qe and ee in water use thereby realizing water security and economic growth this study analyzed the correlations between water resources in the aral sea basin and climatic and economic conditions and estimated the efficiency of agricultural water use under various irrigation methods according to the analysis on the relationship between water usage and gnp per capita it was found that asia was divided into three groups central asia group southeast asia group and northeast asia group the group that produced the lowest gnp per capita in proportion to water use was the central asia group this inefficient water use not only degraded the environment of the aral sea basin but also led to a failure in realizing successful economic growth climate change in the semi arid aral sea basin can directly influence the status of water resources previous studies predicted that climate changes would increase precipitation in most areas however precipitation in the aral sea basin shows almost no change or has been reduced over the last 50 years in addition a rise in atmospheric temperature can lead into an increase in evapotranspiration and more dry soil that causes declines in available water resources furthermore increasing temperatures can result in reduced amounts of snowfall and lower glacier extent which are the main sources of water in the aral sea basin this may raise the risk of floods in the near future and water scarcity in the far future this study revealed that the selection of crop types and irrigation methods would help to improve qe and ee in water use in making such a selection it is also necessary to consider economic conditions food and energy security technology education employment geographical condition population and the legal system in each country to improve water use efficiency such analysis would likely provide more options for the successful regional water governance in the aral sea basin

water mismanagement and inefficient irrigation systems in the aral sea basin where water resources are shared by the five key riparian countries in central asia uzbekistan turkmenistan tajikistan

these countries in determining the allocation of transboundary water resources schiff and winters 2002 mckinney 2004 schluter et al 2005 sadegh et al 2010 libert and lipponen 2012 dinar et al 2015 yet these countries still have not reached a compromise and appear to be stuck in an impasse because of different views on water governance at the national and regional levels allouche 2007 the main economic activity in aral sea basin is agriculture kienzler et al 2012 climatic and hydrological conditions of the countries in central asia are however unfavourable for farming because the region is arid despite this agricultural production has focused on crops with high water demands such as cotton and wheat pereira et al 2009 furthermore crop irrigation using the traditional method of furrow irrigation has been shown to decrease the efficiency of water use and crop yield ward and pulido velazquez 2008 consequently agricultural water use has become a significant threat to water security and economic growth in the region to resolve these problems new and innovative methods have been suggested in the literature gordon et al 2010 molden et al 2010 chaudhry and barbier 2013 water intensive crops remain the main source of income in many parts of the region thereby depleting the available water resources needed for continued economic growth as previously mentioned central asian countries will have to clear many hurdles to see sustained economic growth including substantial environmental and economic pressures bichsel 2009 collins 2009 pomfret 2014 to resolve this issue they need to pursue growth potential while minimizing long term risk to the ecosystem for example the concept of green growth or green economy is one of several workable suggestions to overcome the complex problems facing the aral sea basin because it aligns well with the activities the region has pursued pearce et al 1989 hoffmann 2011 mathews 2012 resnick et al 2012 antonelli et al 2013 young and esau 2013 in addition such concepts may be an appropriate approach as a solution for issues that arise from the water energy food nexus waughray 2011 unescap 2013 allouche et al 2014 granit et al 2013 in this regard the concept of water energy food nexus has been studied in many countries jobbins et al 2015 portney et al 2017 yang and wi 2018 however water energy food in a transboundary river basin can be weakened by excessive water competition at the regional scale therefore more effort and time are needed to move gradually towards achieving water energy food nexus in the aral sea basin this study focused on the water use efficiency for water food nexus in the aral sea basin in this regard the objectives of this study are as follows 1 to analyse the challenges facing water resources in terms of the climate and economy and 2 to calculate changes in agricultural water use if wheat land was converted to cotton land or vice versa and if furrow irrigation or subsurface drip irrigation was used to achieve these objectives the authors investigated the water status of the five central asian countries kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan in the aral sea basin at the regional level 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of aral sea basin the aral sea basin includes portions of kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan uzbekistan afghanistan iran and china however the five central asian countries were the main focus of this study because most water resources in the aral sea basin are consumed by these five countries the aral sea basin is morphologically divided into two zones a plain in the central and western parts of the basin and mountains in the east dukhovny and sokolov 2003 fig 1 the plain zone has two main deserts the kara kum desert in the western and southwestern parts of the basin and the kyzyl kum desert in the northern part of the basin the mountainous areas includes two main mountain ranges the tien shan and pamir hydrologically these two mountain ranges are a very important source of water in the aral sea basin because the two main transboundary rivers the syr darya and the amu darya are fed by runoff from melting snows and glaciers bernauer and siegfried 2012 hagg et al 2013 sorg et al 2014 the area of aral sea basin is approximately 154 8 mha million hectares in total and consists of lands controlled by kazakhstan 34 4 mha kyrgyzstan 12 5 mha tajikistan 14 3 mha turkmenistan 48 8 mha and uzbekistan 44 8 mha the basin therefore makes up approximately 39 of the total 400 mha area of the five countries cawaterinfo 2015 the population in the aral sea basin was 46 million in 2006 and includes many diverse cultures the population in the basin has grown by 31 million people in less than 50 years sokolov 2009 the basin has a continental arid and semi arid climate with precipitation concentrated during the spring and winter seasons precipitation exhibits a spatial difference according to the morphological characteristics of the basin for example yearly precipitation ranges from 80 to 150 mm on the plains and from 600 to 800 mm in the mountains cawaterinfo 2015 the amount of precipitation may not be enough to ensure that the rivers flow into the basin perennially during the dry season river flow is maintained by snow and glacier meltwater from mountainous regions rather than from precipitation granit et al 2010 the sources of water for the central asian countries are the syr darya and the amu darya rivers glantz 1999 ntegeka et al 2014 each river basin has a separate network of hydraulic structures to control or reserve water resources fang et al 2005 allouche 2007 the regional operation of each network is very complicated because these hydraulic structures are constructed and operated under the guidance of the national water policy of each country vinogradov and langford 2001 micklin 2007 scheer et al 2008 the syr darya river and its tributaries flow along and within the borders of four countries kirghizstan kazakhstan tajikistan and uzbekistan the syr darya is the main source of irrigation water to kazakhstan tajikistan and uzbekistan immerzeel et al 2010 kaser et al 2010 the syr darya has a bearing capacity of 37 2 billion m3 and is 3019 km long making it the longest river in the basin the amu darya river and its major tributaries flow along and within the borders of three countries tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan the amu darya provides water for hydropower generation and irrigation in those countries mergili et al 2013 it has an average annual flow of 79 3 billion m3 making it the largest river in terms of water capacity in the aral sea basin and measures 2540 km in length from the headwaters of its tributary the pyandzh to the aral sea cawaterinfo 2015 since the soviet era 1918 1991 the increasing demand for water within these transboundary rivers has made it difficult to assign water allocations among the countries furthermore agricultural irrigation water in central asia has significantly contributed to economic production accounting for more than 15 of the total gdp except in kazakhstan 9 9 kienzler et al 2012 in these situations unclear water allocation regulations incite competition among the countries to secure more water bichsel 2009 libert and lipponen 2012 as a result excessive water consumption has led to a remarkable decrease in the surface area of and volume of the aral sea over the last 50 years compared to 1960 the surface area and volume decreased to 12 5 and 7 7 respectively in 2009 micklin 2010 in the aral sea basin inefficient irrigation systems and mismanagement of irrigation water allocations have also resulted in elevated water and soil salinity levels widespread environmental degradation and diminished agricultural productivity niyazov et al 2012 lioubimtseva 2014 furthermore in an effort to obtain sufficient water resources these central asian countries have pursued independent water policies resulting in conflicts 2 2 status of water and land resources in the aral sea basin available water resources in the aral sea basin include surface water groundwater and return water from residential areas and agricultural activities the average annual river flow in the basin is 116 48 km3 yr with contributions from the amu darya 79 28 km3 yr and syr darya basins 37 20 km3 yr table 1 among the central asian countries tajikistan and kazakhstan have the most and the least river flow in the basin respectively specifically the average annual river flow is highest in tajikistan for the amu darya basin and kyrgyzstan for the syr darya basin both tajikistan and kyrgyzstan are located in upstream reaches of each basin and are more mountainous with more rain than the other countries agricultural lands including irrigated lands measure 9 86 mha making up 5 8 of total area of the basin table 2 uzbekistan has more agricultural land 5 48 mha than the other four countries combined as a whole these countries have created an imbalance between water use and natural water generation because agricultural water supply mostly depends on irrigation with a large contribution to river flow and a very low amount of agricultural area kyrgyzstan is a notable exception land used for cotton and wheat production the main crops in the basin measure 2 66 mha and 2 92 mha respectively high water consumption is required to produce these two crops however immediate replacement of these water intensive crops is difficult because of the extent to which this traditional agricultural structure has influenced regional or national infrastructure soil labour and farming methods nevertheless the inefficient irrigation system used to irrigate these water intensive crops is the main factor for water stress in the aral sea basin 2 3 challenges of water resources in terms of climate and economy economic and climatic aspects of the water resource challenge in the aral sea basin were analyzed a comparative analysis of the relationship between water use and economy at the national level is needed to investigate efficiency of water use in the basin for this reason two other regions northeast asia and southeast asia are included in this analysis to evaluate the relative efficiency of water use in other regions of asia the selected northeast asian countries are the republic of korea japan and china and the selected southeast asian countries are china lao people s democratic republic thailand vietnam and cambodia in the mekong river basin because of its geographical position china is the only country involved in both the northeast asian and southeast asian regions although the selected countries including the five central asian countries have different economic levels most of the water is consumed in the agricultural sector in all of them specifically water use for agriculture in central and southeast asian countries accounts for more than 80 of its total use brooks et al 2005 mirumachi and allan 2007 in this study data on the gross national product gnp per capita and withdrawal per capita were obtained from the world bank the aral sea basin has suffered water shortages because of excessive water use in addition to excessive water use natural factors including long term climate change have complicated existing water challenges because they reduce the quantity of available water climate change adaptation is a major component of sustainable water use climate change has a strong effect on water governance in the basin which is in a semi arid region with extremely little precipitation an important component of climate change adaptation is an understanding of the hydrologic and ecologic responses to future climate various climate scenarios can be found in literature wang et al 2014 fao 2011 unescap 2011 julia and duchin 2013 however this study used the past climatic data instead of future climate change scenarios to understand the history of climate change in the basin the rainfall and temperature data obtained from the world bank for 1960 to 2009 were analyzed to explore climatic change by comparing the differences between the two periods 1960 1990 a part of soviet era and 1990 2009 after soviet era 2 4 quantification of water use for efficiency of irrigation methods irrigation plays a vital role in increasing crop yield and stabilizing production in arid and semi arid regions such as the aral sea basin irrigation is essential for economically viable agriculture whereas in semi humid and humid areas it is often required only on a supplementary basis to select an irrigation method the farmer must know the advantages and disadvantages of each method and understand which method suits the local conditions best for example considering climate and water conditions in the aral sea basin adoption of subsurface drip irrigation hereby referred to as drip irrigation can be one of the best approaches for reducing water consumption because this method can increase water use efficiency more than other methods in particular in arid regions it is necessary to avoid huge loss of water from evapotranspiration which can be achieved with drip irrigation because it is based on pipe networks however the high cost for initial installation and potential for damage to pipes from freezing are the main concerns central asian countries have for adopting drip irrigation conversely furrow irrigation which is one of the least efficient irrigation methods is still a popular method because of low cost as a result 99 of the total irrigated area in central asian countries is under furrow irrigation woznicki and pouyan nejadhashemi 2014 however the increasing attention on the environmental problems and concerns about water security are forcing reconsideration of the irrigation systems within the aral sea basin uzbekistan has the largest irrigated area 4 2 mha and the most water withdrawal for irrigation 44 7 km3 year whereas kyrgyzstan has the least irrigated area 0 428 mha and the least water withdrawal 2 3 km3 table 3 uzbekistan contributes approximately 9 6 of river flow to the aral sea basin but accounts for 52 8 of water withdrawals for irrigation on contrary kyrgyzstan contributes 24 4 but accounts only for 2 7 of water withdrawals for irrigation in the case of other countries in central asia most countries located upstream tend to contribute large amounts to river flow in the aral sea basin and have small water withdrawals for irrigation whereas the countries located downstream tend to make a small contribution to river flow in the basin but have significant water withdrawals for irrigation therefore this study attempted to promote the shared water resource and quantify the volume needed to obtain a sustainable water level in the aral sea through changes in irrigation methods this study attempts to analyse and compare water use and economic profit of furrow irrigation and drip irritation methods in cotton and wheat production for analysing water use yield productivity and economic efficiency according to irrigation method the ratio of drip irrigation to furrow irrigation in an irrigated area was calculated to evaluate productivity as well as the ratio of wheat to cotton in a given irrigated area to evaluate economic benefits these ratios were estimated based on the data from ward and pulido velazquez ward and pulido velazquez 2008 working with data from semi arid regions of texas usa and ciudad jua rez mexico table 4 to minimize the uncertainty arising from the fact that central asia and previously measured places have different climate and economic conditions the relationship was described with ratios with the assumption that the irrigation water used for each crop in each country was proportional to the area of each crop and that the current irrigation is controlled by the furrow irrigation technique this study developed eqs 1 5 to calculate efficiency of water quantity qe economic efficiency ee and economic efficiency per efficiency of water quantity epq in water use here qe ee and epq are dimensionless and can be respectively calculated by eqs 1 5 when drip irrigation was installed in cotton and wheat at the same ratio and cotton to wheat ctw or wheat to cotton wtc conversions were made in an irrigated area of crop in each country table 3 in addition in eqs 1 4 the constants indicating the relative efficiency ratio between irrigation methods or crop types are based on values in table 4 q e c t w eq 1 and e e c t w eq 3 represent qe and ee respectively when converting an irrigated cotton area into a wheat area and q e w t c eq 2 and e e w t c eq 4 are qe and ee respectively at the time of converting an irrigated wheat area into a cotton area the epq can be calculated by eq 5 more precisely to explain eq1 q e c t w let a c resp a w be the irrigated area ha for cotton resp wheat and r w c resp r c w be conversion ratios dimensionless from cotton to wheat resp from wheat to cotton we also let d resp f be the ratio of the drip irrigation resp the furrow irrigation to total irrigation dimensionless therefore f 1 d to calculate q e c t w i e efficiency of water quantity with conversion rate r w c we need to consider the following factors 1 when converting an irrigated cotton area into a wheat area with conversion rate r w c area for cotton area that is converted from cotton to wheat and area for wheat before conversion are a c 1 r w c a c r w c and a w respectively 2 the relative efficiency ratio in irrigation water of drip irrigation to furrow for cotton and wheat are 0 54 and 0 56 respectively table 4 3 the relative efficiency ratio in irrigation water between wheat and cotton is 0 89 furrow irrigation and 0 93 drip irrigation respectively table 4 following the above three factors we have 1 q e c t w a c 1 r w c a c r w c 0 89 a w f a c 1 r w c 0 54 a c r w c 0 56 0 93 a w 0 56 d a c a w in front of f in eq 1 we multiply a c r w c by 0 89 because 0 89 is the relative efficiency ratio in furrow irrigation between wheat and cotton in front of d in eq 1 we also multiply a c 1 r w c a c r w c a w by 0 54 0 56 and 0 56 respectively because these constants are the relative efficiency ratios of drip irrigation to furrow for cotton and wheat we further multiply a c r w c by 0 93 because 0 93 is the relative efficiency ratio in drip irrigation water between wheat and cotton similarly we also calculate q e w t c as follows 2 q e w t c a w 1 r c w a w r c w 0 89 a c f a w 1 r c w 0 56 a w r c w 0 54 0 93 a c 0 54 d a c a w water use efficiency is higher when qe is lower similarly to calculate e e c t w i e economic efficiency with conversion rate r w c we need to consider the following factors 1 when converting an irrigated cotton area into a wheat area with conversion rate r w c the area for cotton area that is converted from cotton to wheat and area for wheat before conversion are a c 1 r w c a c r w c and a w respectively 2 the relative efficiency ratio in economic benefit of drip irrigation to furrow for cotton and wheat is 1 25 table 4 3 the relative efficiency ratio in economic benefit between wheat and cotton is 0 46 table 4 3 e e c t w a c 1 r w c a c r w c 0 46 a w f a c 1 r w c 1 25 a c r w c 1 25 0 46 a w 1 25 d a c a w in front of f in eq 3 we multiply a c r w c by 0 46 because it is the relative efficiency ratio in furrow irrigation between wheat and cotton in front of d in eq 1 we also multiply a c 1 r w c a c r w c and a w by 1 25 respectively because it is the relative efficiency ratio in economic benefit of drip irrigation to furrow for cotton and wheat we further multiply a c r w c by 0 46 because it is the relative efficiency ratio in drip irrigation between wheat and cotton similarly we also calculate e e w t c as follows 4 e e w t c a w 1 r c w a w r c w 0 46 a c f a w 1 r c w 1 25 a w r c w 1 25 0 46 a c 1 25 d a c a w finally we are able to

resource management in the aral sea basin 3 1 1 challenges to socio economic conditions fig 2 shows the relationship between water withdrawals per capita and gross national production gnp per capita in constant 2000 u s dollars based on data retrieved from the world bank for several locations around the world the selected countries are characterized by three main groups according to the relationship between water use and economic level the first group comprises northeast asian countries which have high water use and high economic productivity the second group comprises southeast asian countries in the mekong river basin which have low water use and low economic productivity the last one comprises central asian countries in aral sea basin which have high water use but low economic productivity specifically water use per capita including industrial agricultural and domestic water is highest in turkmenistan and lowest in cambodia in addition gnp per capita which is an important development indicator is highest in japan and lowest in tajikistan economic levels of kazakhstan thailand and china are similar but there is a difference in the quantity of water use kazakhstan thailand and china have higher economic productivity than other countries in central and southeast asia largely caused by oil production in kazakhstan tourism in thailand and the growth of the domestic economy in china of course industrial development can affect both water consumption and economy in a country although central asia and southeast asia have similar economic levels of productivity water consumption per capita in central asia is much higher than that of southeast asia annual water consumption per capita is more than 1000 m3 in central asia and less than 1000 m3 in southeast asia group the two groups have struggled to achieve economic growth but the analysis shows that the economy of central asia depends on relatively inefficient use of water resources one major factor causing the difference in water use between central and southeast asia could be local climatic conditions water demand for irrigation is typically higher in arid regions such as central asia than in humid regions such as southeast asia because arid conditions mean there is little precipitation or groundwater available to meet the demand for water required for crop growth inefficient water use in central asia not only degrades the environment in the aral sea basin but also becomes an obstacle to their economic growth low efficiency in water use drives the need for regional and national water governance in the aral sea basin cotton production in the basin places excessive demands on water supplies but it is still a major contributor to the economy of central asian countries the position of cotton production as a main income source in central asian countries however has become unstable because of the development of other textiles increases in labour and fertilizer prices and decreases in cotton price therefore central asian countries should explore alternatives to minimize environmental damage and promote economic growth through efficient and sustainable water use improvements in industrial infrastructure upgrades in existing irrigation facilities changes in the main agricultural crops and development of technology to promote crop productivity are some possible alternatives that should be explored in addition it is necessary to provide educational opportunities to reduce water demand by promoting efficiency in water use especially by farmers who consume a lot of water resources 3 1 2 challenges due to climate change the analysis of climate change in the aral sea basin revealed an overall decline in the annual rainfall and an increase in the average annual temperature figs 3 and 4 in the case of rainfall monthly rainfall was converted to annual cumulative rainfall and then the annual rainfall was averaged over two periods the average annual rainfall was larger in the period from 1960 to 1990 relative to the period from 1990 to 2009 for all countries except uzbekistan the average annual rainfall between the two periods increased by 11 mm in uzbekistan but it decreased by a surprising 44 mm in tajikistan table 5 based on the reduced standard deviation of monthly rainfall between two periods the average monthly rainfall over the year decreased in its variability such a phenomenon may be mainly caused by a decrease in rainfall between the two periods the decline in the quantity of rainfall directly propagates a decrease in the available water resources in the basin unlike the reduced rainfall average annual temperature between the two periods increased by approximately 1 2 2 7 c for all five countries table 6 the effect of increased temperature could accelerate evapotranspiration which is the movement of water from land and vegetation to the atmosphere allen et al 1998 presented findings regarding the amount of evapotranspiration for climatic regions in response to changes in temperature as shown in table 7 the response of evapotranspiration to temperature increases is more sensitive in semi arid and arid regions than in humid and sub humid regions frenken 2013 the main side effect of the increased evapotranspiration because of poor water resource management is the decrease in soil moisture in fallow and vegetated areas therefore the increasing trend of evapotranspiration in the basin can increase the challenge of satisfying the water demand for agriculture to summarize the trend of the changes in climate showed a decrease in rainfall fig 3 and table 5 and increase in temperatures in the basin such climate changes will have a negative influence on national and regional water governance of the aral sea basin if climate change factors are not considered in future water resource management regarding the current physical geopolitical and social situation of the region vulnerability to water related disasters will be increased over time 3 1 3 quantification of efficiency in water use in the aral sea basin this study calculated qe and ee in water use and epq of each country according to crop types and irrigation methods tables 8 10 from the perspective of qe when cultivation of cotton was fully converted into wheat using drip irrigation for all countries the efficiency was the highest 0 52 0 54 whereas when wheat was fully converted into cotton using the current irrigation method furrow irrigation the efficiency was the lowest 1 04 1 09 table 8 regarding ee when wheat was fully converted into cotton using drip irrigation for all countries the efficiency was the highest 1 68 2 28 and when cotton was fully converted into wheat using furrow irrigation the efficiency was the lowest 0 62 0 84 table 9 in terms of epq when wheat was fully converted into cotton using drip irrigation the efficiency was the highest 3 00 3 86 and when cotton was fully converted into wheat using furrow irrigation the efficiency was the lowest 0 67 0 87 table 10 in particular among all the countries tajikistan had the highest epq under all conditions however the size of the agricultural area was not considered it is not prudent to request tajikistan to change its crop types and irrigation methods given the relatively small acreages involved for instance although turkmenistan and uzbekistan have lower epq than tajikistan they have much larger agricultural lands therefore it is necessary to take into consideration the amount of water that the two countries use in the aral sea basin the study indicated that the efficiency obtainable through changes in crop types and irrigation methods in the aral sea basin is as follows qe ee and epq were calculated to be 0 53 1 06 1 74 2 01 and 0 78 3 53 tables 8 10 fig 5 illustrates the efficiency according to the changes in crop and irrigation across the basin based on this result the change in water use more sensitively influenced ee than qe in addition drip irrigation further influenced epq as more wheat land was converted to cotton land the greatest limitation of this study is a lack of information particularly regarding the irrigated areas of each country and each crop thus an agricultural area ratio was assigned to an irrigated area for each crop in this case an irrigated area could be different depending on the actual crop and uncertainty about an irrigated area could affect estimation of water use efficiency because there was little information available on qe and ee in water use according to measured crop types and irrigation methods in the aral sea basin this study used the data in texas usa and ciudad juárez mexico ward and pulido velazquez 2008 although the region is semi arid it is different from the aral sea basin in terms of temperature wind and sunshine these differences can influence the actual water use necessary to cultivate crops in addition because the countries are at different stages of economic development and scale economic benefit could be different depending on crop types and irrigation methods to reduce such uncertainty this study applied a relative ratio nevertheless it will be necessary to keep collecting relevant information in the aral sea basin and determine more accurately the water efficiency suitable to regional characteristics of the basin in addition in estimating water efficiency according to crop changes there was insufficient information regarding water demands and economic profits for all crops for this reason this study needed to focus on wheat and cotton and was limited in its ability to explore the efficiency of other crop changes additionally this study did not address the costs for crop changes and for irrigation installation and management despite these limitations this study presents important conclusions about water use efficiency as a consideration in decisions about crop changes and irrigation methods in particular the ability to indirectly predict the cost to increase water efficiency based on qe and ee of water use as calculated in this study could contribute to establishing a systematic plan for future water resource management in the aral sea basin 4 conclusions in the aral sea basin water conflicts arise from different water policies regarding the distribution of the shared water resources in the related central asian countries it is necessary therefore to not only achieve technical improvements through agreements among these countries but to develop regional water governance through the legal systems of the aral sea basin in addition the countries need to jointly increase qe and ee in water use thereby realizing water security and economic growth this study analyzed the correlations between water resources in the aral sea basin and climatic and economic conditions and estimated the efficiency of agricultural water use under various irrigation methods according to the analysis on the relationship between water usage and gnp per capita it was found that asia was divided into three groups central asia group southeast asia group and northeast asia group the group that produced the lowest gnp per capita in proportion to water use was the central asia group this inefficient water use not only degraded the environment of the aral sea basin but also led to a failure in realizing successful economic growth climate change in the semi arid aral sea basin can directly influence the status of water resources previous studies predicted that climate changes would increase precipitation in most areas however precipitation in the aral sea basin shows almost no change or has been reduced over the last 50 years in addition a rise in atmospheric temperature can lead into an increase in evapotranspiration and more dry soil that causes declines in available water resources furthermore increasing temperatures can result in reduced amounts of snowfall and lower glacier extent which are the main sources of water in the aral sea basin this may raise the risk of floods in the near future and water scarcity in the far future this study revealed that the selection of crop types and irrigation methods would help to improve qe and ee in water use in making such a selection it is also necessary to consider economic conditions food and energy security technology education employment geographical condition population and the legal system in each country to improve water use efficiency such analysis would likely provide more options for the successful regional water governance in the aral sea basin

11406,critical water shortage and hyperaridity are the principal reasons limiting cotton cultivation on desert oases in northwest china however if water dearth is effectively managed then these terrains can also add significant contribution in regional and country s total cotton production due to favorable climate in that perspective a 2 years 2015 2016 field study was conducted on cultivable southern periphery of taklamakan desert to optimize water productivity of deficit drip irrigated cotton through evaluating its water use etc growth and physiology based water relations treatments included four drip irrigation regimes based on 100 d100 80 d80 60 d60 and 40 d40 replenishment of depleted water from field capacity results revealed that average etc ranged from 510 mm at 40 to 1079 mm at 100 water replenishment crop growth and pre dawn leaf water potential ψpd successively declined with reducing irrigation amount photosynthesis a and stomatal conductance gs of d80 plants decreased by 15 at squaring and by only 8 at later stages while this decline was more vigorous under 60 and 40 water replenishments the 80 irrigated plants resulted in only 13 yield reduction from d100 whereas the average seed cotton yield varied from 2433 kg ha 1 in 40 to 4376 kg ha 1 under 100 water replenishment the maximum irrigation and crop water use efficiencies iwue wue were recorded 0 62 and 0 48 kg m 3 respectively which reduced with increasing irrigation amounts in addition crop growth and physiological attributes showed linear correlations with etc and irrigation regimes during yield formation following economic evaluation these results suggested that irrigating cotton up to 80 field capacity would provide the optimum yield and net income with 20 water saving while d60 could save 40 water but subject to major yield and profit loss however if water is sufficiently available then 100 irrigation can be practiced for maximizing cotton productivity and net gains on desert oases keywords soil water content desert ecosystem evapotranspiration photosynthesis net income water use efficiency 1 introduction rapidly growing world population and continuously depleting arable land resources due to urbanization are leading to serious food security threats worldwide while affecting more seriously to densely populated developing countries li et al 2017 parallel to food the world fiber demand is also increasing that needs more cultivable land and water resources to meet these challenges cotton gossypium hirsutum l is one of the most important food feed and fiber producing crop that is grown on widespread area in the world howell et al 2004 xinjiang uyghur autonomous region in northwest china is an important agricultural zone and the world leader in cotton production due to its promising climate and plentiful sunshine hours per day during crop season in addition by contributing 35 share in national and about 11 in world s cotton production the region highlights its significance for this crop tang et al 2010 so far due to higher yield per unit area an increasing number of farming communities are engaged with cotton cultivation in the region for higher profit and better livelihood wang et al 2014 as the climate of xinjiang is supportive for cotton the total production of this region can be further enhanced by allocating more area to this crop but limitation of arable land is concerned in this scenario the cultivated area in the region is intensively being expanded by continuous conversion of deserts into desert oases nevertheless the environmental threats to crops including water scarcity high evaporative potential negligible amount of rainfall and persistent drought predominantly remained serious concerns within desert ecosystem guo et al 2009 zeng et al 2006 zhang et al 2017 oases on the southern rim of taklamakan desert northwest china is a new and fragile piece of cultivable land that also has great attraction for cotton cultivation due to suitable climate this terrain can add a valuable contribution in total cotton production of xinjiang but its hyperaridity and an extreme shortage of irrigation water are the serious threats to ecological sustainability zeng et al 2006 which forbid the widespread cultivation of cotton however the use of widely adopted deficit irrigation is the most feasible approach to be used for cotton production under such an extreme and water deficit conditions without disturbing ecosystem s stability fereres and soriano 2007 howell et al 2004 oweis et al 2011 ünlü et al 2011 in deficit irrigation practice cotton is irrigated below 100 of its evapotranspirational requirement that optimizes yield within irrigation limits by limiting subsoil drainage and percolation fereres and soriano 2007 oweis et al 2011 since cotton grows in an indeterminate pattern quisenberry and roark 1976 its growth rate biomass accumulation leaf area and gas exchange activities are adversely affected by deficit irrigation pettigrew 2004 photosynthesis is the most important physiological process that determines crop growth and final yield is highly susceptible to water deficit stress deeba et al 2012 raines 2011 yi et al 2016 despite of that numerous studies have reported the significance of deficit irrigation for cotton under water limited conditions according to zhang et al 1999 a significant quantity of irrigation water can be saved under drought situation by limiting water use with a minimal influence on crop yield later fereres and soriano 2007 also reported that deficit irrigation is potentially an efficient technique not only for enhancing water productivity but also for profitable farm income in xinjiang mulched drip micro irrigation is commonly used on large scale for cotton cultivation as it saves enough water and enhances water productivity ibragimov et al 2007 wang et al 2013 yet in those regions where aridity and water scarcity issues are more challenging there water saving and use efficiency can be further improved by switching from full to the deficit drip scheme in that perspective thind et al 2008 found that deficit drip irrigated cotton ensures 25 more water saving with better yield than normal practices besides dağdelen et al 2009 and ünlü et al 2011 evaluated water use efficiency and yield of cotton using deficit drip irrigation regimes and proposed 75 and 70 levels as optimum for arid and semiarid mediterranean regions respectively singh et al 2010 reported that reduced irrigation is the best alternative under water shortage conditions while 100 water supply gives the maximum net returns if water availability is of no concern later on oweis et al 2011 concluded that though a negligible yield loss has to be sacrificed but deficit drip irrigation proved to be an appropriate technique for cotton in water limited regions even several other similar crop water management studies from xinjiang northwest arid region of china have also reported the improved water use efficiency and profitability of cotton with more water saving under deficit drip irrigation technique guan et al 2013 kang et al 2012 wang et al 2014 wang et al 2013 yang et al 2015 as it is obvious from earlier studies that water limitation in arid regions is a critical issue against profitable cotton production thus in desert ecosystem the situation could be more challenging however it was needed to optimize yield and water use efficiency of cotton on a very important cultivable southern rim of the taklamakan desert through evaluating its growth and physiological based water relations since despite of favorable climate none of the literature has reported cotton cultivation and agricultural water management studies from this terrain the particular objectives were to 1 examine physiological traits including rate of photosynthesis stomatal conductance leaf water potential and growth response such as leaf area index crop growth rate and biomass accumulation and 2 determine seed cotton yield yield response factor ky consumptive water demand etc water use efficiencies wues and yield etc relations of deficit drip irrigated cotton under desert ambiance the outcome of this study would provide necessary information that would help in successful and sustainable cotton production on cultivable terrains of desert ecosystems and in those regions where extreme water scarcity and high evapotranspiration persist due to global climate change 2 materials and methods this field experiment was carried out on cele national station of scientific observation for desert grassland ecosystem 36 51 30 n 80 44 28 e xinjiang institute of ecology and geography chinese academy of sciences during growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 the study area is located on southern rim of the taklamakan desert northwest china which is a warm temperate zone with a continental desert climate its mean annual temperature and the maximum evaporative potential are 11 9 c and 2595 mm respectively while the long term and experimental year s monthly data for climate are provided in table 1 which were obtained from a metrological unit of the cele desert research station the soil type of experimental site was classified as loamy sand aeolian sand and its physical and chemical properties are listed in table 2 2 1 plant material and experimental layout cotton crop was planted on 20th and 15th of april during 2015 and 2016 respectively under super high density planting technique in which the cotton plants are raised in narrow spaces in order to maintain high population density approx 200 000 plants ha 1 to check the sideways seepage losses plastic sheets were installed around each trial unit up to 1 2 m depth plants were grown in 30 and 60 cm alternate row spacing with 10 cm planting distance fig 1 drip lines with inter emitters distance of 10 cm were placed between the narrow rows 30 cm under thin plastic film the quantities of n p k fertilizers used in this trial were 240 120 60 kg ha 1 respectively all phosphorus p2o5 as di ammonium phosphate dap and potassium as k2so4 were mixed in soil just before plantation while nitrogen in the form of urea was dressed at four intervals ¼ at sowing ¼ at first irrigation ¼ at squaring and ¼ at boll formation weeds were controlled manually on three instances during the entire growing seasons 2 2 irrigation treatments and field measurements four drip irrigation levels d100 d80 d60 and d40 were evaluated in this trial based on replenishment of depleted soil water from field capacity dağdelen et al 2009 defined depletion as the difference between soil water content at field capacity and the actual amount of water in rhizosphere at the time of next irrigation usually in normal conditions cotton crop is irrigated when 40 50 of soil water from field capacity has been evapotranspired doorenbos and kassam 1979 in the present experiment when soil water content in control plots reduced to 50 field capacity fc then next irrigation was replenished to each treatment as per set criteria thus at each irrigation event the control plots were irrigated up to 100 field capacity while the stressed plots were replenished with 80 60 and 40 of the volume of water applied in control for that purpose water depletion from root zone was monitored through regular soil sampling from 30 60 and 90 cm soil profile on weekly basis and soil water content was determined by gravimetric method 105 c 24 h fig 2 the volume of irrigation applied to each treatment was quantified using equation of karam et al 2006 with significant modifications 1 v d e p a r where v is the volume of applied irrigation mm dep water depletion mm from trial units which is mainly caused by evapotranspiration a indicates land area of each treatment m2 and r is the fraction of water to be replenished each trial unit received measured amount of water through drip irrigation system equipped with flow measuring gauges water flow meter cumulatively the treatments d100 d80 d60 and d40 received irrigation amounts 1040 832 624 and 416 mm respectively in 2015 and 936 748 561 and 374 mm respectively during 2016 water depletion through evapotranspiration from cotton fields was estimated using soil water balance equation of heerman 1985 2 etc ir p dp δw where etc ir p dp and δw are crop evapotranspiration mm applied irrigation amount mm total amount of precipitation mm amount of deep percolated water mm and the change in moisture content below 1 0 m soil depth respectively the excess amount of water from field capacity in 0 0 9 m soil profile was recorded as deep percolation kanber et al 1993 and it was equal to zero because no change in soil water content below 1 m soil depth was observed before and after irrigation however net change in soil water content δw below 1 0 m depth between the times of plantation to harvesting was considered as ground water contribution it was recorded through moisture analysis from 1 0 m depth prior to sowing and after harvesting of crop 2 3 physiological measurements the response of physiological traits under extreme desert environment was essential to be known to understand their relationships with crop evapotranspiration etc and yield formation for that reason the photosynthetic rate a μmol m 2 s 1 and stomatal conductance gs mmol m 2 s 1 were measured at three critical growth stages squaring peak bloom and boll formation using li cor li 6400 portable photosynthetic system by following the protocol of white and raine 2009 except squaring the other two growth stages arrived at different times in all treatments blooming and boll formation stages arrived 5 and 8 days respectively earlier in d40 plots than control for that reason these physiological parameters were measured separately from each treatment when it reached the specified growth stages the measurements were made on young fully expanded photosynthetically active leaves between 11 00 am to 12 30 pm one day before stress relief irrigation quantum flux for the device was adjusted as per clear sunny conditions and sunlight was used as light source for irga sensor head reference co2 and block temperature were set at 400 μmols mol 1 co2 and 25 c respectively yi et al 2016 pre down leaf water potential mpa at squaring peak bloom and boll forming stages was measured through pressure chamber skpm 1400 skye instruments llandrindod wells uk technique of boyer 1967 as described by argyrokastritis et al 2015 and yi et al 2016 2 4 measurement of growth yield and water use efficiencies for the measurement of periodic changes in growth attributes destructive sampling of cotton plants was initiated at early squaring and continued fortnightly till first picking total dry matter tdm kg m 2 and leaf area index lai m2 m 2 were measured by oven dry method 72 c 72 h and li cor portable leaf area meter respectively later tdm data were subjected to further calculations for crop growth rate cgr g m 2 d 1 measurement the purpose of measuring growth parameters was to evaluate leaf area development and biomass accumulation rates under desert environment and their correlations with etc and final yield length of crop season under d60 and d40 was 13 and 15 days respectively shorter than d100 however two hand pickings were made on september 10 and october 02 from each trial unit to quantify seed cotton yield during both trial years yield response factor ky was calculated using stewart s equation stewart et al 1977 as described by dağdelen et al 2009 3 1 y a y m k y 1 e t a e t m in this model equation ya and ym are the actual and maximum yields while eta and etm are the actual and maximum evapotranspiration respectively whereas 1 ya ym and 1 eta etm as a whole expresses the relative yield reduction and evapotranspiration deficits respectively the water use efficiency wue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue were calculated according to definitions of zhang et al 1999 4 w u e y e t 5 i w u e y i r here y is the total yield kg ha 1 while et and ir are the total seasonal evapotranspiration and applied irrigation amounts respectively 2 5 statistical design and data analysis the treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design rcbd with four replicates the replications data of each treatment were collected and statistically analyzed using windows application statistix v 8 1 tallahassee florida usa the values were expressed as means of four replications with coefficient of variance cv and standard error for difference in means sed following fisher s analysis of variance anova technique subsequently the least significant difference lsd test was applied to treatment means for ranking and comparison at probability p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 crop water use etc yield and stress response factor ky data presented in table 3 summarize the applied irrigation amount consumptive water use etc water use efficiencies and obtained seed cotton yields under deficit irrigation treatments for the years 2015 and 2016 total amount of rainfall during 1st and 2nd season was recorded 34 2 and 57 3 mm respectively tables 1 and 3 the occurrence of comparatively higher rainfall during 2016 was exceptional however it saved one irrigation event consequently the total quantity of irrigation applied in 2016 was lower than the preceding year the total volume of applied irrigation calculated for both trial years varied between 416 to 1040 mm and 374 to 936 mm respectively comparatively the irrigation applied to cotton on desert oases was higher than other regions that can be attributed to extremely dry weather poor water holding capacity of soil and frequent wind storms which facilitated the rapid evaporative loss zeng et al 2006 likewise due to high evaporative potential of desert environment the seasonal crop water use etc was also high that varied from 535 to 1120 mm in the first and 485 to 1037 mm in second season table 3 as it has been already articulated that the occurrence of rainfall in desert oases was negligible and crop mainly depended on supplemented irrigation thus the amount of seasonal irrigation was significantly higher than reported from other regions evidently the irrigation volume and etc for drip irrigated cotton 708 and 753 mm reported by dağdelen et al 2009 790 and 878 mm by oweis et al 2011 and 68 383 and 287 584 mm by ünlü et al 2011 from mediterranean conditions of turkey and 498 and 678 mm by yang et al 2015 from northwest china are significantly lower than the present study however cotton compensated its relatively higher water consumption with justifiable seed cotton yield the maximum yield of 4325 and 4427 kg ha 1 was obtained from full irrigation treatment that was followed by d80 3765 and 3870 kg ha 1 and the lowest 2330 and 2536 kg ha 1 was recorded from d40 in 2015 and 2016 respectively these results were in line with papastylianou and argyrokastritis 2014 4402 kg ha 1 onder et al 2009 4330 kg ha 1 and wang et al 2013 4674 kg ha 1 respectively although 80 irrigated plants received 20 less water but they showed better adaptation and reduced yield by only 13 because they compensated evapotranspirational deficit by effective use of ground water which is obvious from δw values in table 3 on the other hand yield decline under d60 and d40 was recorded up to 30 and 45 respectively that would be due to accelerated shedding of squares and premature bolls due to increasing water deficit stress cetin and bilgel 2002 regression analysis indicated a significant linear relationship between seed cotton yield and etc fig 3 a b at 5 probability with r2 values of 0 99 and 1 00 for both crop seasons respectively in the same way yield was also linearly correlated with applied irrigation amount having coefficient of determinant r2 0 99 for both trial years fig 3a b these interactions provide a clear understanding on relationship between the amounts of produce per unit of water consumed etc and the amount of water applied the straight regression lines showing the maximum seed cotton yield at 100 water replenishment are consistent with regression values of oweis et al 2011 dağdelen et al 2009 and ünlü et al 2011 for deficit drip irrigated cotton hence this relationship proves a famous saying transpiration is a necessary evil which means that for higher yield the plant must transpire more water that would eventually need more irrigation crop yield response to water stress ky indicated a linear increase in relative yield loss 1 ya ym with relative increase in evapotranspiration deficit 1 eta etm fig 4 the slope of regression between relative et and yield determined the value of ky 0 84 average of two years statistically this relationship was found significant at 5 probability according to fao manual no 56 ky is a coefficient that describes relative yield loss due to decline in etc caused by soil water deficit the value of ky obtained in this study was in agreement with 0 86 and 0 87 reported by kanber et al 1996 and singh et al 2010 for sprinkler and deficit drip irrigated cotton respectively on the other hand dağdelen et al 2009 and yang et al 2015 determined comparatively lower values of ky 0 78 and 0 65 for drip irrigated cotton in western turkey and northwest china respectively in the present study relatively higher value of ky could be attributed to hyperaridity and high evaporative potential of desert ambiance that caused more relative yield loss proportional to relative decrease in etc in the line of that it has been formerly reported that ky closer or equal to or greater than unity indicates relative yield reduction proportionately greater than relative decline in crop evapotranspiration kirda 1999 3 2 water use efficiency and irrigation water use efficiency average water use efficiency wue of both years ranged from 0 41 to 0 48 kg m 3 statistically all treatments performed at par during 2015 whereas in the following year deficit water supplies affected wue significantly p 0 05 this difference in response between two years can be attributed to significant difference in amount of precipitation during both study years tables 1 and 3 in 2016 the highest wue 0 52 kg m 3 was recorded for the lowest irrigation d40 while it gradually decreased with increasing irrigation amount so the minimum 0 42 kg m 3 was recorded from fully irrigated d100 plots table 3 wue usually indicates the actual yield of a particular crop with respect to amount of water consumed in etc including irrigation and precipitation singh et al 2010 thus it decreases with increasing irrigation volume which is obvious from table 3 of the present study consistent with these observations rao et al 2016 reported water productivity in the range of 0 38 0 41 kg m 3 for deficit irrigated cotton and ünlü et al 2011 reported 0 59 kg m 3 four years average for well watered cotton crop this increase in wue of deficit drip irrigated cotton would be due to better utilization of ground water by cotton crop under soil water deficit rao et al 2016 similarly irrigation treatments significantly p 0 05 influenced irrigation water use efficiency iwue of cotton during both crop seasons the highest iwue of 0 56 and 0 68 kg m 3 was recorded for d40 and the lowest 0 42 and 0 47 kg m 3 for well watered d100 plots during 1st and 2nd season respectively in the present study the maximum iwue of cotton was substantially lower than 0 98 0 81 and 0 81 kg m 3 of dağdelen et al 2009 singh et al 2010 and kang et al 2012 respectively this could be attributed to mighty evaporative potential and hyperarid conditions of desert due to which the crop irrigation water demand was significantly higher that resulted the consequences table 3 however wang et al 2013 reported quite similar results from deficit irrigated cotton when they applied stress on late flowering stage 3 3 physiological attributes and water stress relations it is clear from fig 5 a and b that deficit drip irrigation supplies significantly affected p 0 05 leaf water potential lwp at each growth stage during the trial years at squaring the value of lwp in d40 treatment was comparatively less negative than respective stages due to high residual soil moisture during that crop stage however at every later growth stage the lwp of highly stressed d40 plants was significantly more negative than relatively more irrigated plants and it reached the minimal values of 2 91 and 3 01 mpa in 2015 and 2016 respectively in recent investigations loka and oosterhuis 2014 and argyrokastritis et al 2015 reported the maximum negative values of leaf water potential 3 23 and 2 41 mpa respectively for drought stressed cotton which are in agreement with these results this reduction in lwp under reduced water supplies can actually be attributed to reduced conductance of xylem due to soil water deficit stress accordingly tang et al 2010 have also reported the reduced xylem flow under soil water deficit and its consequences on lwp and rate of transpiration overall under 80 water replenishment the lwp was moderately reduced that could be due to effective use of groundwater by these plants table 3 to compensate their turgor loss likewise substantial decline p 0 05 in photosynthetic performance of cotton was also observed at three critical stages squiring peak bloom and boll formation with increasing the irrigation deficit stress during 2015 and 2016 fig 6 a b relatively the average rate of carbon assimilation under d80 d60 and d40 treatments reduced by 10 32 and 49 respectively compared with full irrigation these findings are consistent with yi et al 2016 who reported a gradual decline in assimilation by 22 and 40 respectively under mild and moderate water deficit stress besides it was also noticed that photosynthetic rate of d80 plants was statistically at par with control that indicated the suitability of this irrigation level for cotton on water scarce desert oases the physiological adaptation of cotton on this irrigation level can be attributed to its effective osmotic adjustment and comparatively better use of groundwater at 20 water deficit stress δw table 3 under hyperarid environment in addition the results clarified a linear positive correlation between photosynthetic rate and seasonal etc fig 7 a b with r2 0 98 for both trial years the highest mean assimilation rate of 32 32 μmol m 2 s 1 was observed when etc reached the maximum averaging 1079 mm under 100 water replenishment during entire crop season similarly deficit drip irrigation regimes also affected the rate of stomatal conductance gs and resulted in the highest 674 96 and 651 23 mmol m 2 s 1 under zero stress in 2015 and 2016 respectively based on mean values gs decreased by 38 and 50 under d60 and d40 replenishment respectively but its decline in d80 was only 07 that was statistically at par with control fig 6c d these results are supported by deeba et al 2012 who reported 40 50 and 95 decrease in stomatal conductance at 75 50 and 35 relative water content respectively despite of adverse and hyperarid environment of desert this resemblance of physiological response of cotton with other studies revealed its adaptability to extreme conditions that can be attributed to its stress tolerance ability 3 4 growth characteristics and water stress relations data presented in fig 8 a b show that after seedling establishment cotton crop started building up leaf area index lai at different rates under different water supplies and finally diverged after climax due to defoliation of older leaves and development of fruiting bodies similar trends have been reported by tang et al 2010 dağdelen et al 2009 and karam et al 2006 from former deficit drip irrigation studies of cotton about 115 days after sowing lai reached the climax and the maximum 4 76 and 4 79 m2 m 2 and the minimum 2 53 and 2 18 m2 m 2 were recorded for d100 and d40 water replenishments during both trial years respectively these results are quite consistent with ünlü et al 2011 and yang et al 2015 who reported for well watered and drought stressed cotton as in earlier studies it has been reported that lai has direct relationship with amount of irrigation applied dağdelen et al 2009 ünlü et al 2011 so the same response has been observed in current study specifically under the desert environment in addition there existed a significant linear relationship between lai at climax and seed cotton yield with r2 values of 0 99 2015 and 0 98 2016 fig 10a b that indicated direct response of yield towards the dynamics of lai similarly it was also observed that successive increase in lai substantially enhanced the rate of evapotranspiration which is illustrated in a linear correlation fig 10a b formerly ünlü et al 2011 also reported similar relationships of lai with seed cotton yield and etc as have been devised in the present elucidation periodic changes in above ground total dry matter tdm shown in fig 8c d illustrate significant effect of different irrigation levels on this trait the maximum dry biomass was obtained from fully irrigated d100 plots while it significantly p 0 05 reduced under deficit irrigation regimes on an average tdm of d80 d60 and d40 treatments was recorded 17 50 and 73 respectively lower than control d100 the maximum tdm 1 69 and 1 72 kg m 2 was recorded for d100 treatment in the 1st and 2nd season respectively however as expected the lowest 0 52 kg m 2 in 2015 and 0 44 kg m 2 in 2016 were observed from d40 treatment in accordance with that dağdelen et al 2009 reported the same biomass accumulation pattern of deficit drip irrigated cotton in western turkey in addition the maximum and minimum values of tdm were also in line with karam et al 2006 and yang et al 2015 for full and deficit irrigated cotton results also showed that throughout vegetative phase the crop growth rate cgr was significantly p 0 05 lower in highly stressed d40 plots than in control d100 full irrigation accelerated growth rate up to the maximum 21 88 and 25 93 g m 2 day 1 while the least 6 92 and 5 83 g m 2 day 1 were recorded from d40 treatment in the 1st and 2nd season respectively fig 9 a b these findings are well supported by wang et al 2007 who elucidated a substantial decline in cgr with increase in irrigation deficit stress usually the cgr mainly depends on assimilatory activity of plants while the rate of photo assimilation is susceptible to soil moisture dryness thus the observed decline in cgr under deficit irrigation would be due to decreased assimilation rate fig 6a b which has also been confirmed by zhang et al 2016 in addition it can also be attributed to reduced tdm accumulation fig 8c d which is a key determinant of crop s vegetative growth and declines with reducing irrigation supplies dağdelen et al 2009 ünlü et al 2011 the detailed analysis indicated a significant linear relationship between cgr and etc with r2 value of 0 98 fig 7a b under reduced water supplies in the line of that farooq et al 2009 interpreted that plant growth is usually accomplished through various physiological processes and transpiration is amongst the most sufferers of water deficit stress which is responsible for direct relationship of etc with plant s assimilatory activity and eventually with crop growth rate 3 5 economic analysis the profitability of desert grown cotton under deficit drip irrigation regimes was evaluated through economic analysis water cost used in this calculation was us 0 04 m 3 that was subsidized by the local government the total seasonal irrigation cost for each treatment was variable due to difference in quantities of water applied while drip irrigation system and production costs were fixed for all plots the production cost included seedbed preparation sowing fertilizers and all other essential inputs labour cost was also variable because except seeding all other farm activities in xinjiang are hourly paid which are associated with survival of plants boll density and seed cotton yield wang et al 2014 for that reason labour cost in the present study gradually decreased with decreasing irrigation quantity the calculations of all expenses and gross and net incomes on the basis of two years average data are given in table 4 cotton price us 1 3 kg 1 used for calculation was the average of two years xinjiang statistical bureau because it seldom remains same every year since the area was new for cotton therefore no significant pest infestation was found which saved the additional pest management cost thus the total production cost was comparatively lesser than other cotton dominated drip irrigated regions the 100 irrigation replenishment provided the maximum net returns of us 2603 5 which successively decreased with decreasing irrigation amount it can be attributed to higher seed cotton yield under full irrigation which resulted in higher gross income and eventually the net profit these interpretations are in agreement with dağdelen et al 2009 who reported the highest yield and profit under 100 irrigation on the other hands d80 provided a reasonable amount of net profit us 2117 9 ha 1 that was about 18 lower than d100 but it also saved 20 precious water for desert ecosystem this profitability under 80 irrigation was in line with wang et al 2014 who reported for deficit drip irrigated cotton from northern part of xinjiang china contrarily dağdelen et al 2009 reported quite lower net income of 75 drip irrigated cotton from western turkey due to higher water and crop production costs at second level of deficit irrigation d60 the profit ratio was about 50 lesser than d100 due to greater yield loss though 60 irrigation saved 40 water but compared with other cotton dominated territories of xinjiang its profit level would not be acceptable for local farmers to attract them towards desert however based on economic analysis it can be interpreted that if water is abundant then net profit can be maximized by adopting 100 level of drip irrigation while 80 replenishment could be the best alternate optimum drip irrigation level under extreme water scarcity in the desert environments 4 conclusions it is concluded that deficit drip irrigation regimes significantly affected growth physiological and agronomic attributes of cotton the crop showed compatibility with climate and topography of oases on the southern border of taklimakan desert due to high evaporative potential 2595 mm annually of hyperarid desert oases crop water demand etc was higher than reported from other arid and semiarid regions and it reached the maximum averaging 1079 mm under full irrigation the highest average seed cotton yield 4376 kg ha 1 was obtained from d100 using 988 mm irrigation with zero water saving while this yield was linearly correlated with seasonal etc on an average at 80 irrigation replenishment the growth and gas exchange attributes of cotton performed at par with d100 while these traits were more adversely affected by 60 and 40 replenishment rate of photosynthesis lai and cgr depicted linear relationships with yield and etc overall in 20 less irrigated d80 fields seed cotton yield crop growth and assimilation rate reduced by only 9 13 whereas in 60 less irrigated d40 plants this decline was more than 50 no doubt the wue and iwue increased with increasing drought stress but the quantity of produce was concerned the economic analysis indicated maximum profit under full irrigation with zero water saving while d80 saved 20 water and provided a reasonable amount of net profit hence these results suggest the suitability of cotton on desert oases and propose 80 level of drip irrigation for optimum yield and net income without affecting desert ecosystem s sustainability however if water is amply available then 100 replenishment should be considered to maximize net returns acknowledgements the authors feel delighted to acknowledge cas twas president s

11406,critical water shortage and hyperaridity are the principal reasons limiting cotton cultivation on desert oases in northwest china however if water dearth is effectively managed then these terrains can also add significant contribution in regional and country s total cotton production due to favorable climate in that perspective a 2 years 2015 2016 field study was conducted on cultivable southern periphery of taklamakan desert to optimize water productivity of deficit drip irrigated cotton through evaluating its water use etc growth and physiology based water relations treatments included four drip irrigation regimes based on 100 d100 80 d80 60 d60 and 40 d40 replenishment of depleted water from field capacity results revealed that average etc ranged from 510 mm at 40 to 1079 mm at 100 water replenishment crop growth and pre dawn leaf water potential ψpd successively declined with reducing irrigation amount photosynthesis a and stomatal conductance gs of d80 plants decreased by 15 at squaring and by only 8 at later stages while this decline was more vigorous under 60 and 40 water replenishments the 80 irrigated plants resulted in only 13 yield reduction from d100 whereas the average seed cotton yield varied from 2433 kg ha 1 in 40 to 4376 kg ha 1 under 100 water replenishment the maximum irrigation and crop water use efficiencies iwue wue were recorded 0 62 and 0 48 kg m 3 respectively which reduced with increasing irrigation amounts in addition crop growth and physiological attributes showed linear correlations with etc and irrigation regimes during yield formation following economic evaluation these results suggested that irrigating cotton up to 80 field capacity would provide the optimum yield and net income with 20 water saving while d60 could save 40 water but subject to major yield and profit loss however if water is sufficiently available then 100 irrigation can be practiced for maximizing cotton productivity and net gains on desert oases keywords soil water content desert ecosystem evapotranspiration photosynthesis net income water use efficiency 1 introduction rapidly growing world population and continuously depleting arable land resources due to urbanization are leading to serious food security threats worldwide while affecting more seriously to densely populated developing countries li et al 2017 parallel to food the world fiber demand is also increasing that needs more cultivable land and water resources to meet these challenges cotton gossypium hirsutum l is one of the most important food feed and fiber producing crop that is grown on widespread area in the world howell et al 2004 xinjiang uyghur autonomous region in northwest china is an important agricultural zone and the world leader in cotton production due to its promising climate and plentiful sunshine hours per day during crop season in addition by contributing 35 share in national and about 11 in world s cotton production the region highlights its significance for this crop tang et al 2010 so far due to higher yield per unit area an increasing number of farming communities are engaged with cotton cultivation in the region for higher profit and better livelihood wang et al 2014 as the climate of xinjiang is supportive for cotton the total production of this region can be further enhanced by allocating more area to this crop but limitation of arable land is concerned in this scenario the cultivated area in the region is intensively being expanded by continuous conversion of deserts into desert oases nevertheless the environmental threats to crops including water scarcity high evaporative potential negligible amount of rainfall and persistent drought predominantly remained serious concerns within desert ecosystem guo et al 2009 zeng et al 2006 zhang et al 2017 oases on the southern rim of taklamakan desert northwest china is a new and fragile piece of cultivable land that also has great attraction for cotton cultivation due to suitable climate this terrain can add a valuable contribution in total cotton production of xinjiang but its hyperaridity and an extreme shortage of irrigation water are the serious threats to ecological sustainability zeng et al 2006 which forbid the widespread cultivation of cotton however the use of widely adopted deficit irrigation is the most feasible approach to be used for cotton production under such an extreme and water deficit conditions without disturbing ecosystem s stability fereres and soriano 2007 howell et al 2004 oweis et al 2011 ünlü et al 2011 in deficit irrigation practice cotton is irrigated below 100 of its evapotranspirational requirement that optimizes yield within irrigation limits by limiting subsoil drainage and percolation fereres and soriano 2007 oweis et al 2011 since cotton grows in an indeterminate pattern quisenberry and roark 1976 its growth rate biomass accumulation leaf area and gas exchange activities are adversely affected by deficit irrigation pettigrew 2004 photosynthesis is the most important physiological process that determines crop growth and final yield is highly susceptible to water deficit stress deeba et al 2012 raines 2011 yi et al 2016 despite of that numerous studies have reported the significance of deficit irrigation for cotton under water limited conditions according to zhang et al 1999 a significant quantity of irrigation water can be saved under drought situation by limiting water use with a minimal influence on crop yield later fereres and soriano 2007 also reported that deficit irrigation is potentially an efficient technique not only for enhancing water productivity but also for profitable farm income in xinjiang mulched drip micro irrigation is commonly used on large scale for cotton cultivation as it saves enough water and enhances water productivity ibragimov et al 2007 wang et al 2013 yet in those regions where aridity and water scarcity issues are more challenging there water saving and use efficiency can be further improved by switching from full to the deficit drip scheme in that perspective thind et al 2008 found that deficit drip irrigated cotton ensures 25 more water saving with better yield than normal practices besides dağdelen et al 2009 and ünlü et al 2011 evaluated water use efficiency and yield of cotton using deficit drip irrigation regimes and proposed 75 and 70 levels as optimum for arid and semiarid mediterranean regions respectively singh et al 2010 reported that reduced irrigation is the best alternative under water shortage conditions while 100 water supply gives the maximum net returns if water availability is of no concern later on oweis et al 2011 concluded that though a negligible yield loss has to be sacrificed but deficit drip irrigation proved to be an appropriate technique for cotton in water limited regions even several other similar crop water management studies from xinjiang northwest arid region of china have also reported the improved water use efficiency and profitability of cotton with more water saving under deficit drip irrigation technique guan et al 2013 kang et al 2012 wang et al 2014 wang et al 2013 yang et al 2015 as it is obvious from earlier studies that water limitation in arid regions is a critical issue against profitable cotton production thus in desert ecosystem the situation could be more challenging however it was needed to optimize yield and water use efficiency of cotton on a very important cultivable southern rim of the taklamakan desert through evaluating its growth and physiological based water relations since despite of favorable climate none of the literature has reported cotton cultivation and agricultural water management studies from this terrain the particular objectives were to 1 examine physiological traits including rate of photosynthesis stomatal conductance leaf water potential and growth response such as leaf area index crop growth rate and biomass accumulation and 2 determine seed cotton yield yield response factor ky consumptive water demand etc water use efficiencies wues and yield etc relations of deficit drip irrigated cotton under desert ambiance the outcome of this study would provide necessary information that would help in successful and sustainable cotton production on cultivable terrains of desert ecosystems and in those regions where extreme water scarcity and high evapotranspiration persist due to global climate change 2 materials and methods this field experiment was carried out on cele national station of scientific observation for desert grassland ecosystem 36 51 30 n 80 44 28 e xinjiang institute of ecology and geography chinese academy of sciences during growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 the study area is located on southern rim of the taklamakan desert northwest china which is a warm temperate zone with a continental desert climate its mean annual temperature and the maximum evaporative potential are 11 9 c and 2595 mm respectively while the long term and experimental year s monthly data for climate are provided in table 1 which were obtained from a metrological unit of the cele desert research station the soil type of experimental site was classified as loamy sand aeolian sand and its physical and chemical properties are listed in table 2 2 1 plant material and experimental layout cotton crop was planted on 20th and 15th of april during 2015 and 2016 respectively under super high density planting technique in which the cotton plants are raised in narrow spaces in order to maintain high population density approx 200 000 plants ha 1 to check the sideways seepage losses plastic sheets were installed around each trial unit up to 1 2 m depth plants were grown in 30 and 60 cm alternate row spacing with 10 cm planting distance fig 1 drip lines with inter emitters distance of 10 cm were placed between the narrow rows 30 cm under thin plastic film the quantities of n p k fertilizers used in this trial were 240 120 60 kg ha 1 respectively all phosphorus p2o5 as di ammonium phosphate dap and potassium as k2so4 were mixed in soil just before plantation while nitrogen in the form of urea was dressed at four intervals ¼ at sowing ¼ at first irrigation ¼ at squaring and ¼ at boll formation weeds were controlled manually on three instances during the entire growing seasons 2 2 irrigation treatments and field measurements four drip irrigation levels d100 d80 d60 and d40 were evaluated in this trial based on replenishment of depleted soil water from field capacity dağdelen et al 2009 defined depletion as the difference between soil water content at field capacity and the actual amount of water in rhizosphere at the time of next irrigation usually in normal conditions cotton crop is irrigated when 40 50 of soil water from field capacity has been evapotranspired doorenbos and kassam 1979 in the present experiment when soil water content in control plots reduced to 50 field capacity fc then next irrigation was replenished to each treatment as per set criteria thus at each irrigation event the control plots were irrigated up to 100 field capacity while the stressed plots were replenished with 80 60 and 40 of the volume of water applied in control for that purpose water depletion from root zone was monitored through regular soil sampling from 30 60 and 90 cm soil profile on weekly basis and soil water content was determined by gravimetric method 105 c 24 h fig 2 the volume of irrigation applied to each treatment was quantified using equation of karam et al 2006 with significant modifications 1 v d e p a r where v is the volume of applied irrigation mm dep water depletion mm from trial units which is mainly caused by evapotranspiration a indicates land area of each treatment m2 and r is the fraction of water to be replenished each trial unit received measured amount of water through drip irrigation system equipped with flow measuring gauges water flow meter cumulatively the treatments d100 d80 d60 and d40 received irrigation amounts 1040 832 624 and 416 mm respectively in 2015 and 936 748 561 and 374 mm respectively during 2016 water depletion through evapotranspiration from cotton fields was estimated using soil water balance equation of heerman 1985 2 etc ir p dp δw where etc ir p dp and δw are crop evapotranspiration mm applied irrigation amount mm total amount of precipitation mm amount of deep percolated water mm and the change in moisture content below 1 0 m soil depth respectively the excess amount of water from field capacity in 0 0 9 m soil profile was recorded as deep percolation kanber et al 1993 and it was equal to zero because no change in soil water content below 1 m soil depth was observed before and after irrigation however net change in soil water content δw below 1 0 m depth between the times of plantation to harvesting was considered as ground water contribution it was recorded through moisture analysis from 1 0 m depth prior to sowing and after harvesting of crop 2 3 physiological measurements the response of physiological traits under extreme desert environment was essential to be known to understand their relationships with crop evapotranspiration etc and yield formation for that reason the photosynthetic rate a μmol m 2 s 1 and stomatal conductance gs mmol m 2 s 1 were measured at three critical growth stages squaring peak bloom and boll formation using li cor li 6400 portable photosynthetic system by following the protocol of white and raine 2009 except squaring the other two growth stages arrived at different times in all treatments blooming and boll formation stages arrived 5 and 8 days respectively earlier in d40 plots than control for that reason these physiological parameters were measured separately from each treatment when it reached the specified growth stages the measurements were made on young fully expanded photosynthetically active leaves between 11 00 am to 12 30 pm one day before stress relief irrigation quantum flux for the device was adjusted as per clear sunny conditions and sunlight was used as light source for irga sensor head reference co2 and block temperature were set at 400 μmols mol 1 co2 and 25 c respectively yi et al 2016 pre down leaf water potential mpa at squaring peak bloom and boll forming stages was measured through pressure chamber skpm 1400 skye instruments llandrindod wells uk technique of boyer 1967 as described by argyrokastritis et al 2015 and yi et al 2016 2 4 measurement of growth yield and water use efficiencies for the measurement of periodic changes in growth attributes destructive sampling of cotton plants was initiated at early squaring and continued fortnightly till first picking total dry matter tdm kg m 2 and leaf area index lai m2 m 2 were measured by oven dry method 72 c 72 h and li cor portable leaf area meter respectively later tdm data were subjected to further calculations for crop growth rate cgr g m 2 d 1 measurement the purpose of measuring growth parameters was to evaluate leaf area development and biomass accumulation rates under desert environment and their correlations with etc and final yield length of crop season under d60 and d40 was 13 and 15 days respectively shorter than d100 however two hand pickings were made on september 10 and october 02 from each trial unit to quantify seed cotton yield during both trial years yield response factor ky was calculated using stewart s equation stewart et al 1977 as described by dağdelen et al 2009 3 1 y a y m k y 1 e t a e t m in this model equation ya and ym are the actual and maximum yields while eta and etm are the actual and maximum evapotranspiration respectively whereas 1 ya ym and 1 eta etm as a whole expresses the relative yield reduction and evapotranspiration deficits respectively the water use efficiency wue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue were calculated according to definitions of zhang et al 1999 4 w u e y e t 5 i w u e y i r here y is the total yield kg ha 1 while et and ir are the total seasonal evapotranspiration and applied irrigation amounts respectively 2 5 statistical design and data analysis the treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design rcbd with four replicates the replications data of each treatment were collected and statistically analyzed using windows application statistix v 8 1 tallahassee florida usa the values were expressed as means of four replications with coefficient of variance cv and standard error for difference in means sed following fisher s analysis of variance anova technique subsequently the least significant difference lsd test was applied to treatment means for ranking and comparison at probability p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 crop water use etc yield and stress response factor ky data presented in table 3 summarize the applied irrigation amount consumptive water use etc water use efficiencies and obtained seed cotton yields under deficit irrigation treatments for the years 2015 and 2016 total amount of rainfall during 1st and 2nd season was recorded 34 2 and 57 3 mm respectively tables 1 and 3 the occurrence of comparatively higher rainfall during 2016 was exceptional however it saved one irrigation event consequently the total quantity of irrigation applied in 2016 was lower than the preceding year the total volume of applied irrigation calculated for both trial years varied between 416 to 1040 mm and 374 to 936 mm respectively comparatively the irrigation applied to cotton on desert oases was higher than other regions that can be attributed to extremely dry weather poor water holding capacity of soil and frequent wind storms which facilitated the rapid evaporative loss zeng et al 2006 likewise due to high evaporative potential of desert environment the seasonal crop water use etc was also high that varied from 535 to 1120 mm in the first and 485 to 1037 mm in second season table 3 as it has been already articulated that the occurrence of rainfall in desert oases was negligible and crop mainly depended on supplemented irrigation thus the amount of seasonal irrigation was significantly higher than reported from other regions evidently the irrigation volume and etc for drip irrigated cotton 708 and 753 mm reported by dağdelen et al 2009 790 and 878 mm by oweis et al 2011 and 68 383 and 287 584 mm by ünlü et al 2011 from mediterranean conditions of turkey and 498 and 678 mm by yang et al 2015 from northwest china are significantly lower than the present study however cotton compensated its relatively higher water consumption with justifiable seed cotton yield the maximum yield of 4325 and 4427 kg ha 1 was obtained from full irrigation treatment that was followed by d80 3765 and 3870 kg ha 1 and the lowest 2330 and 2536 kg ha 1 was recorded from d40 in 2015 and 2016 respectively these results were in line with papastylianou and argyrokastritis 2014 4402 kg ha 1 onder et al 2009 4330 kg ha 1 and wang et al 2013 4674 kg ha 1 respectively although 80 irrigated plants received 20 less water but they showed better adaptation and reduced yield by only 13 because they compensated evapotranspirational deficit by effective use of ground water which is obvious from δw values in table 3 on the other hand yield decline under d60 and d40 was recorded up to 30 and 45 respectively that would be due to accelerated shedding of squares and premature bolls due to increasing water deficit stress cetin and bilgel 2002 regression analysis indicated a significant linear relationship between seed cotton yield and etc fig 3 a b at 5 probability with r2 values of 0 99 and 1 00 for both crop seasons respectively in the same way yield was also linearly correlated with applied irrigation amount having coefficient of determinant r2 0 99 for both trial years fig 3a b these interactions provide a clear understanding on relationship between the amounts of produce per unit of water consumed etc and the amount of water applied the straight regression lines showing the maximum seed cotton yield at 100 water replenishment are consistent with regression values of oweis et al 2011 dağdelen et al 2009 and ünlü et al 2011 for deficit drip irrigated cotton hence this relationship proves a famous saying transpiration is a necessary evil which means that for higher yield the plant must transpire more water that would eventually need more irrigation crop yield response to water stress ky indicated a linear increase in relative yield loss 1 ya ym with relative increase in evapotranspiration deficit 1 eta etm fig 4 the slope of regression between relative et and yield determined the value of ky 0 84 average of two years statistically this relationship was found significant at 5 probability according to fao manual no 56 ky is a coefficient that describes relative yield loss due to decline in etc caused by soil water deficit the value of ky obtained in this study was in agreement with 0 86 and 0 87 reported by kanber et al 1996 and singh et al 2010 for sprinkler and deficit drip irrigated cotton respectively on the other hand dağdelen et al 2009 and yang et al 2015 determined comparatively lower values of ky 0 78 and 0 65 for drip irrigated cotton in western turkey and northwest china respectively in the present study relatively higher value of ky could be attributed to hyperaridity and high evaporative potential of desert ambiance that caused more relative yield loss proportional to relative decrease in etc in the line of that it has been formerly reported that ky closer or equal to or greater than unity indicates relative yield reduction proportionately greater than relative decline in crop evapotranspiration kirda 1999 3 2 water use efficiency and irrigation water use efficiency average water use efficiency wue of both years ranged from 0 41 to 0 48 kg m 3 statistically all treatments performed at par during 2015 whereas in the following year deficit water supplies affected wue significantly p 0 05 this difference in response between two years can be attributed to significant difference in amount of precipitation during both study years tables 1 and 3 in 2016 the highest wue 0 52 kg m 3 was recorded for the lowest irrigation d40 while it gradually decreased with increasing irrigation amount so the minimum 0 42 kg m 3 was recorded from fully irrigated d100 plots table 3 wue usually indicates the actual yield of a particular crop with respect to amount of water consumed in etc including irrigation and precipitation singh et al 2010 thus it decreases with increasing irrigation volume which is obvious from table 3 of the present study consistent with these observations rao et al 2016 reported water productivity in the range of 0 38 0 41 kg m 3 for deficit irrigated cotton and ünlü et al 2011 reported 0 59 kg m 3 four years average for well watered cotton crop this increase in wue of deficit drip irrigated cotton would be due to better utilization of ground water by cotton crop under soil water deficit rao et al 2016 similarly irrigation treatments significantly p 0 05 influenced irrigation water use efficiency iwue of cotton during both crop seasons the highest iwue of 0 56 and 0 68 kg m 3 was recorded for d40 and the lowest 0 42 and 0 47 kg m 3 for well watered d100 plots during 1st and 2nd season respectively in the present study the maximum iwue of cotton was substantially lower than 0 98 0 81 and 0 81 kg m 3 of dağdelen et al 2009 singh et al 2010 and kang et al 2012 respectively this could be attributed to mighty evaporative potential and hyperarid conditions of desert due to which the crop irrigation water demand was significantly higher that resulted the consequences table 3 however wang et al 2013 reported quite similar results from deficit irrigated cotton when they applied stress on late flowering stage 3 3 physiological attributes and water stress relations it is clear from fig 5 a and b that deficit drip irrigation supplies significantly affected p 0 05 leaf water potential lwp at each growth stage during the trial years at squaring the value of lwp in d40 treatment was comparatively less negative than respective stages due to high residual soil moisture during that crop stage however at every later growth stage the lwp of highly stressed d40 plants was significantly more negative than relatively more irrigated plants and it reached the minimal values of 2 91 and 3 01 mpa in 2015 and 2016 respectively in recent investigations loka and oosterhuis 2014 and argyrokastritis et al 2015 reported the maximum negative values of leaf water potential 3 23 and 2 41 mpa respectively for drought stressed cotton which are in agreement with these results this reduction in lwp under reduced water supplies can actually be attributed to reduced conductance of xylem due to soil water deficit stress accordingly tang et al 2010 have also reported the reduced xylem flow under soil water deficit and its consequences on lwp and rate of transpiration overall under 80 water replenishment the lwp was moderately reduced that could be due to effective use of groundwater by these plants table 3 to compensate their turgor loss likewise substantial decline p 0 05 in photosynthetic performance of cotton was also observed at three critical stages squiring peak bloom and boll formation with increasing the irrigation deficit stress during 2015 and 2016 fig 6 a b relatively the average rate of carbon assimilation under d80 d60 and d40 treatments reduced by 10 32 and 49 respectively compared with full irrigation these findings are consistent with yi et al 2016 who reported a gradual decline in assimilation by 22 and 40 respectively under mild and moderate water deficit stress besides it was also noticed that photosynthetic rate of d80 plants was statistically at par with control that indicated the suitability of this irrigation level for cotton on water scarce desert oases the physiological adaptation of cotton on this irrigation level can be attributed to its effective osmotic adjustment and comparatively better use of groundwater at 20 water deficit stress δw table 3 under hyperarid environment in addition the results clarified a linear positive correlation between photosynthetic rate and seasonal etc fig 7 a b with r2 0 98 for both trial years the highest mean assimilation rate of 32 32 μmol m 2 s 1 was observed when etc reached the maximum averaging 1079 mm under 100 water replenishment during entire crop season similarly deficit drip irrigation regimes also affected the rate of stomatal conductance gs and resulted in the highest 674 96 and 651 23 mmol m 2 s 1 under zero stress in 2015 and 2016 respectively based on mean values gs decreased by 38 and 50 under d60 and d40 replenishment respectively but its decline in d80 was only 07 that was statistically at par with control fig 6c d these results are supported by deeba et al 2012 who reported 40 50 and 95 decrease in stomatal conductance at 75 50 and 35 relative water content respectively despite of adverse and hyperarid environment of desert this resemblance of physiological response of cotton with other studies revealed its adaptability to extreme conditions that can be attributed to its stress tolerance ability 3 4 growth characteristics and water stress relations data presented in fig 8 a b show that after seedling establishment cotton crop started building up leaf area index lai at different rates under different water supplies and finally diverged after climax due to defoliation of older leaves and development of fruiting bodies similar trends have been reported by tang et al 2010 dağdelen et al 2009 and karam et al 2006 from former deficit drip irrigation studies of cotton about 115 days after sowing lai reached the climax and the maximum 4 76 and 4 79 m2 m 2 and the minimum 2 53 and 2 18 m2 m 2 were recorded for d100 and d40 water replenishments during both trial years respectively these results are quite consistent with ünlü et al 2011 and yang et al 2015 who reported for well watered and drought stressed cotton as in earlier studies it has been reported that lai has direct relationship with amount of irrigation applied dağdelen et al 2009 ünlü et al 2011 so the same response has been observed in current study specifically under the desert environment in addition there existed a significant linear relationship between lai at climax and seed cotton yield with r2 values of 0 99 2015 and 0 98 2016 fig 10a b that indicated direct response of yield towards the dynamics of lai similarly it was also observed that successive increase in lai substantially enhanced the rate of evapotranspiration which is illustrated in a linear correlation fig 10a b formerly ünlü et al 2011 also reported similar relationships of lai with seed cotton yield and etc as have been devised in the present elucidation periodic changes in above ground total dry matter tdm shown in fig 8c d illustrate significant effect of different irrigation levels on this trait the maximum dry biomass was obtained from fully irrigated d100 plots while it significantly p 0 05 reduced under deficit irrigation regimes on an average tdm of d80 d60 and d40 treatments was recorded 17 50 and 73 respectively lower than control d100 the maximum tdm 1 69 and 1 72 kg m 2 was recorded for d100 treatment in the 1st and 2nd season respectively however as expected the lowest 0 52 kg m 2 in 2015 and 0 44 kg m 2 in 2016 were observed from d40 treatment in accordance with that dağdelen et al 2009 reported the same biomass accumulation pattern of deficit drip irrigated cotton in western turkey in addition the maximum and minimum values of tdm were also in line with karam et al 2006 and yang et al 2015 for full and deficit irrigated cotton results also showed that throughout vegetative phase the crop growth rate cgr was significantly p 0 05 lower in highly stressed d40 plots than in control d100 full irrigation accelerated growth rate up to the maximum 21 88 and 25 93 g m 2 day 1 while the least 6 92 and 5 83 g m 2 day 1 were recorded from d40 treatment in the 1st and 2nd season respectively fig 9 a b these findings are well supported by wang et al 2007 who elucidated a substantial decline in cgr with increase in irrigation deficit stress usually the cgr mainly depends on assimilatory activity of plants while the rate of photo assimilation is susceptible to soil moisture dryness thus the observed decline in cgr under deficit irrigation would be due to decreased assimilation rate fig 6a b which has also been confirmed by zhang et al 2016 in addition it can also be attributed to reduced tdm accumulation fig 8c d which is a key determinant of crop s vegetative growth and declines with reducing irrigation supplies dağdelen et al 2009 ünlü et al 2011 the detailed analysis indicated a significant linear relationship between cgr and etc with r2 value of 0 98 fig 7a b under reduced water supplies in the line of that farooq et al 2009 interpreted that plant growth is usually accomplished through various physiological processes and transpiration is amongst the most sufferers of water deficit stress which is responsible for direct relationship of etc with plant s assimilatory activity and eventually with crop growth rate 3 5 economic analysis the profitability of desert grown cotton under deficit drip irrigation regimes was evaluated through economic analysis water cost used in this calculation was us 0 04 m 3 that was subsidized by the local government the total seasonal irrigation cost for each treatment was variable due to difference in quantities of water applied while drip irrigation system and production costs were fixed for all plots the production cost included seedbed preparation sowing fertilizers and all other essential inputs labour cost was also variable because except seeding all other farm activities in xinjiang are hourly paid which are associated with survival of plants boll density and seed cotton yield wang et al 2014 for that reason labour cost in the present study gradually decreased with decreasing irrigation quantity the calculations of all expenses and gross and net incomes on the basis of two years average data are given in table 4 cotton price us 1 3 kg 1 used for calculation was the average of two years xinjiang statistical bureau because it seldom remains same every year since the area was new for cotton therefore no significant pest infestation was found which saved the additional pest management cost thus the total production cost was comparatively lesser than other cotton dominated drip irrigated regions the 100 irrigation replenishment provided the maximum net returns of us 2603 5 which successively decreased with decreasing irrigation amount it can be attributed to higher seed cotton yield under full irrigation which resulted in higher gross income and eventually the net profit these interpretations are in agreement with dağdelen et al 2009 who reported the highest yield and profit under 100 irrigation on the other hands d80 provided a reasonable amount of net profit us 2117 9 ha 1 that was about 18 lower than d100 but it also saved 20 precious water for desert ecosystem this profitability under 80 irrigation was in line with wang et al 2014 who reported for deficit drip irrigated cotton from northern part of xinjiang china contrarily dağdelen et al 2009 reported quite lower net income of 75 drip irrigated cotton from western turkey due to higher water and crop production costs at second level of deficit irrigation d60 the profit ratio was about 50 lesser than d100 due to greater yield loss though 60 irrigation saved 40 water but compared with other cotton dominated territories of xinjiang its profit level would not be acceptable for local farmers to attract them towards desert however based on economic analysis it can be interpreted that if water is abundant then net profit can be maximized by adopting 100 level of drip irrigation while 80 replenishment could be the best alternate optimum drip irrigation level under extreme water scarcity in the desert environments 4 conclusions it is concluded that deficit drip irrigation regimes significantly affected growth physiological and agronomic attributes of cotton the crop showed compatibility with climate and topography of oases on the southern border of taklimakan desert due to high evaporative potential 2595 mm annually of hyperarid desert oases crop water demand etc was higher than reported from other arid and semiarid regions and it reached the maximum averaging 1079 mm under full irrigation the highest average seed cotton yield 4376 kg ha 1 was obtained from d100 using 988 mm irrigation with zero water saving while this yield was linearly correlated with seasonal etc on an average at 80 irrigation replenishment the growth and gas exchange attributes of cotton performed at par with d100 while these traits were more adversely affected by 60 and 40 replenishment rate of photosynthesis lai and cgr depicted linear relationships with yield and etc overall in 20 less irrigated d80 fields seed cotton yield crop growth and assimilation rate reduced by only 9 13 whereas in 60 less irrigated d40 plants this decline was more than 50 no doubt the wue and iwue increased with increasing drought stress but the quantity of produce was concerned the economic analysis indicated maximum profit under full irrigation with zero water saving while d80 saved 20 water and provided a reasonable amount of net profit hence these results suggest the suitability of cotton on desert oases and propose 80 level of drip irrigation for optimum yield and net income without affecting desert ecosystem s sustainability however if water is amply available then 100 replenishment should be considered to maximize net returns acknowledgements the authors feel delighted to acknowledge cas twas president s

11407,controlling the denitrification rate could help reduce the losses of applied nitrogen n fertilizer in fields the applicability of microbial fuel cell mfc for controlling denitrification in flooded rice soils was investigated based on mfc theory coupled with redox changes because the soil about 10 20 cm beneath water and the soil near the water surface are anaerobic and aerobic respectively gradients of electric potentials could be generated between them upon connecting them through insulated wires electrons released through the oxidation of organic matter during microbial metabolism can be utilized by this set up generating electricity this can reduce the availability of electrons for reductive half reactions of nitrate to suppress denitrification we studied the n losses in soil using planting pots with gas chamber experiment under three conditions mfc systems mfc systems with an externally applied voltage and non mfc systems as a control each system was set in triplicate supplied with the same n fertilizer amounts and flooded with automatic irrigation soil redox potential n2o flux and inorganic nitrogen concentration in soil pore water were periodically monitored the redox potentials of both mfc systems and mfc systems with externally applied voltage were significantly higher than that of non mfc systems while n2o flux levels were significantly lower than that of non mfc systems the rice reproductive stage was the most effective on suppressing n2o flux with mfc application however the effect of externally applied voltage on suppressing n2o flux remains unclear inorganic nitrogen retention efficiencies in pore water were higher in mfc systems which is consistent with the n2o flux difference while the proportion of denitrified n estimated for mfc systems was 2 3 that of non mfc systems was 6 6 we confirmed the applicability of mfcs to control soil redox potential and thereby suppress the denitrification based on planting pot experiments keywords redox potential nitrous oxide gas nitrogen fertilizer 1 introduction 1 1 problem of nitrogen deficiency the global food industry is highly dependent on fossil fuels energy efficient approaches to agriculture would offer a way to take advantage of the relationships between energy food and agriculture a huge amount of energy is required for the fixation of nitrogen n fertilizer from the unlimited atmospheric nitrogen to manufacture one metric ton of anhydrous ammonia nh3 which consists 82 of n it is estimated that 3500 m3 of natural gas is used olson and halstead 1974 it is also estimated that the field application of 150 kg ha n fertilizer in the form of nh3 involves the consumption of 645 m3 of natural gas olson and halstead 1974 moreover despite the fact that rice is the staple food of half the world s population n fertilizer is not used efficiently keeny and sahrawat 1986 recognizing the fact that n fertilizer is absolutely essential for supporting the growing global population there is an urgent need to explore efficient ways of using fertilizer to compensate for future food shortages as conventional methods to improve n retention efficiency various methods such as leguminous crop production crop rotation and management of irrigation water have been proposed and implemented huang et al 2007 kaewpradit et al 2008 pramanik et al 2014 though these approaches are proven to be effective under specific conditions sometimes these are not effective due to the uncontrollable factors such as climate conditions hence if we can electrochemically control denitrification processes that might be a more universally applicable technology the process of denitrification involving the conversion of soil inorganic n to elemental n gas is one of the main routes behind n deficiency in crop production here denitrification refers to the process in which no3 is converted to gaseous compounds such as no n2o and n2 by microorganisms in submerged soils the denitrifying bacteria use no3 in the absence of oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor in their process of respiration which is reduced to no2 no n2o and finally n2 reddy and patrick 1986 from the viewpoint of saving n fertilizer in agricultural fields denitrification is undesirable in addition paddy fields have been recognized as one of the sources of atmospheric n2o mosier et al 1996 akiyama et al 2005 one of the greenhouse gases causing global warming thus the extent of n loss via denitrification has attracted great interest among researchers as well as farmers iida et al 2007 1 2 theory of microbial fuel cell for the control of soil redox potential according to the definition given by lovley 2006 a microbial fuel cell mfc is a device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy generating power in mfc depends on redox chemistry the redox reaction involves a transfer of electrons between two chemical species oxidization involves losing electrons from one chemical species whereas reduction involves gaining electrons by other chemical species microbes can gain energy through redox reactions between organic compounds and terminal electron acceptors such as o2 this process can be interpreted as involving the oxidation of the organic compound and the reduction of the terminal electron acceptor the principle of mfc involves the utilization of electrons liberated by the decomposition of organic matter by microbes to produce electricity the principle of mfc can also be applied to flooded soils fig 1 illustrates the concept of an mfc applied to flooded soils the electrons produced during the oxidation of organic matter are transferred directly to an anode and the electrons travel through an electrical circuit to a cathode where oxygen is reduced to h2o while the region several centimeters below the flooded soil surface is anaerobic near the soil surface aerobic conditions prevail thus potential gradients could be generated between these regions when connected externally through insulated wires it is therefore possible to generate electricity if anode respiring microbes have self sustained extracellular electron transfer mechanisms lovley 2008 in fact some studies have already shown that electricity can be produced in flooded soils arends et al 2014 kaku et al 2008 kouzuma et al 2014 takenezawa et al 2010 in this context the following question arises how can the denitrification process be related to the principle of mfc in the denitrification process of flooded rice fields the electrons produced from the oxidation of organic matter by microbes are gained by oxygen containing inorganic n species such as no3 and no2 typical redox reactions related to no3 respiration that are performed by microbes in the absence of oxygen are shown in the eqs 1 and 2 1 5 c 6 h 12 o 6 24 no 3 24 h 30 co 2 12 n 2 42 h 2 o 2 c 12 h 22 o 11 9 6 no 3 9 6 h 12 co 2 4 8 n 2 15 8 h 2 o because these are redox reactions between organic carbon c and oxidized forms of n anions the availability of organic c should be one of the factors determining whether denitrification occurs the dynamics of organic c is difficult to control whereas in contrast the electrons resulting from its oxidation through microbial metabolism can be controlled specifically the electrons resulting from the oxidation of organic matter can be circulated in a chain which is referred to as an electric chain when the anaerobic layer is externally connected to the upper aerobic layer of soils it is therefore hypothesized that denitrifying conditions could be controlled by redox potential changes in soils that are invoked by mfc in other words a competition for electrons is expected to invoke the generation of electricity and to outcompete denitrification reactions at the same time thus based on the above hypothesis we studied on the control of denitrification n losses in flooded rice soils by using mfc applications with pot experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 design of planting pots with gas chamber experiment we conducted a planting pot with gas chamber experiment with three different conditions mfc systems mfc systems with an externally applied voltage and non mfc systems as a control each system was set in triplicate the mfc systems with an externally applied voltage were aimed at increasing the efficiency of mfcs because it was expected that the rapid movement of electrons towards the anodic area would be enhanced by the externally applied voltage an external voltage maintained at 25 50 mv was applied by a voltage stabilizer ad 8735a and company ltd throughout rice growth in the rest of this article we refer to the mfc systems as mfcs mfc systems with an externally applied voltage as mfc extvs and non mfc systems as non mfcs the experimental period included the entire period of rice growth after transplantation soil redox potential n2o gas flux c n ratio of soil and nh4 no2 and no3 concentrations in soil pore water were periodically measured based on these measurements the n retention efficiencies and denitrification loss rates were calculated and compared among these systems the designs of the planting pot and the gas chamber are shown in fig 2 for soil particle and pore water samplings each planting pot had three holes diameter of 2 cm closed by rubber stoppers in addition each planting pot had a hole at the bottom to inject acetylene gas in order to inhibit the reaction of nitrous oxide reductase enzymes which further converts n2o to n2 a circular tube which had holes in it at equal distances of 2 5 cm from each other was fit snugly into the bottom hole and then inserted into soil because this tube was connected to a three way stopcock gas could be distributed at equal pressure in each pot gas flow pressure at the outflow valve was adjusted to 1 2 mpa each gas chamber also had three holes diameter of 2 cm closed by a butyl rubber septum for gas sampling the soil for the experiment was collected from the experimental paddy fields of the field science center of gifu university according to the japanese soil inventory it is gleysol https soil inventory dc affrc go jp besides collecting the soil for experiments the soil was also collected to soil samplers 100 cm3 from about 20 cm below soil surface and basic physical properties were measured by oven drying at 110 c for 24 h table 1 shows the basic soil physical properties except for in the non mfcs for an anode a carbon graphite felt mat s 221 osaka gas chemicals co ltd of 20 20 0 5 cm was introduced 10 cm below the soil surface as a cathode a graphite rod c 072591 nilaco corporation with a length of 10 cm and diameter of 0 5 cm was kept floating on the flooded water in contact with air the anode and cathode were linked through insulated wires externally connected with a resister of 330 ω as a basal application ammonium based chemical fertilizer nh4 2so4 was initially applied at a rate of 30 kg nha 1 one day after the application of fertilizer two rice seedlings aged 3 weeks of oriza sativa l cv hatsushimo were transplanted into each pot on june 15th 2016 then soil was kept flooded at a depth of approximately 5 cm by an automatic water supply system by observing the growth of rice plants rice growth was divided into three stages vegetative reproductive and maturation june 24 was considered as the start of the vegetative stage with the tillering of rice plants visibly started on panicle forming of rice plants which was first visibly started on july 16 considered as the start of the reproductive stage heading time which was first visibly started on august 16 considered as the start of the maturation stage 2 2 gas sampling and measurements applying a closed chamber method gas was sampled biweekly and n2o concentration was measured by gas chromatography gc 2014 equipped with an ecd detector shimadzu co ltd the reason why n2o concentration was measured is that the measurement of n2 emissions is impossible due to the high atmospheric background level of 78 groffman and robertson 2015 using an injecting syringe in each sampling hole of the chamber gas was sampled at 11 a m 1 p m and 3 p m at each gas sampling event here the acetylene inhibition method was applied iida et al 2007 forty minutes before the start of gas sampling acetylene gas was injected for 1 min to achieve a state of equilibrium between the soil and the chamber headspace iida et al 2007 proposed that the amount of acetylene in the headspace needs to be higher than 0 1 to ensure that microbial enzymes related to n2o reduction to n2 are inhibited according to this standard the acetylene concentration in the headspace was checked by tube type gas detectors gv100s gastec co ltd before starting the sampling and at the last sampling before each gas sampling event a small fan fixed on the top corner of the chamber was operated for 30 s to ensure the homogeneity of the air inside the chamber the conditions of gas chromatography were as follows oven temperature 60 c detector temperature 340 c and carrier gas argon methane 5 the unit of concentration was converted from volumetric concentration to mass concentration using the ideal gas law considering headspace temperature and assuming gas pressure of 101 325 nm 2 then flux was calculated using the following equation 3 f δ m a δ t v a δ m v δ t h δ m v δ t here f is n2o flux μg m 2 min 1 δt measured time min δm mass change of the n2o gas during δt a surface area of the chamber m2 v volume of headspace m3 and h effective height of headspace m here the headspace is defined as the height of the chamber plus the distance between the flooded water surface and the top of the pot fig 2 2 3 redox potential and chemical measurement redox potential was measured by eh meters prn 41 fujiwara factory co ltd these meters consist of counter electrodes made of pt coated by glass tubes and reference electrodes made of agcl with saturated kcl internal solution while reference electrodes were put near the soil surface counter electrodes were installed at a depth of 20 cm just near the anode and continuously measured eh at 1 h intervals the voltage difference generated by the mfcs and the soil temperature at 10 cm below the soil surface and the temperature inside the chamber were recorded on a data logger cr 1000 campbell scientific inc at 10 min intervals soil pore water was sampled on june 24 the start of the vegetative stage july 22 the start of the reproductive stage and august 9 the start of the maturation stage using pore water samplers rhizon mom 10 cm rhizosphere research products www rhizosphere com sampling depths were 10 20 and 30 cm from the soil surface upon filtering through membrane filter units of 0 45 μm pore size 03cp045an advantec and then through membrane filters of 0 45 μm pore size a045a047a advantec nh4 no2 and no3 concentrations of filtrates were identified by ion chromatography ica 2000 toa dkk co ltd the eluents of ion chromatography were 1 8 mm na2co3 and 1 7 mm naco3 for anions and 6 mm methanesulfonic acid for cations total c and total n contents in soil particles were measured by a chno elemental analyzer jm10 micro corder j science lab co ltd soil sampling was carried out at the same time as gas sampling and pore water sampling so that the soil environment would not be repeatedly disturbed sampled soil was air dried for 48 h and sieved by a 2 mm sieve 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 data treatment and statistical analysis after initiating the experiment mfc output was not stabilized for some period thus the data obtained after june 23 were utilized for analysis in addition the redox potential showed periodical drops due to acetylene injection during the gas sampling events thus redox potential data during the gas measuring events were excluded from the analysis after taking the daily average of redox potential and n2o flux data for each replicate of each treatment repeated measures of one way anova was applied to redox potential data and n2o flux data for the pretreatment of one way anova data were transformed to normal distribution and checked for homogeneity of variances using the levene s tests when significant difference was detected p 0 05 multiple comparisons were performed by using tukey s hsd tests to identify the specific treatment of which mean value is significantly different from others all statistical analyses described in this article were performed using ibm spss statistics version 24 2 4 2 nitrogen retention and denitrification based on the observations of low nh4 nitrogen ions in soil particles in random samples of soil solutions with a 1 2 ratio nh4 nitrogen retention in soil particles was considered negligible in addition we assume that n mineralization and immobilization are slower in flooded conditions due to the low oxygen levels compared with those in upland soils ishii et al 2011 therefore the contributions of mineralization and immobilization to the n budget were considered negligible by calculating the mass change of inorganic nitrogen in the soil pore water the net change of inorganic nitrogen can be estimated because soil sampling depths are 10 20 and 30 cm we divided the pot into three layers with heights of 15 10 and 15 cm respectively as shown in fig 2 it could be considered that the whole soil pore spaces were fully saturated over the period since the soils were continuously flooded thus it can use soil porosity to calculate the volumetric water content of each layer then if the amounts of inorganic nitrogen in the forms of nh4 no2 and no3 of each layer are summed up we can obtain the total inorganic nitrogen amount of soil pore water by using the following eq 4 4 t n i 1 3 c n i v i θ i i 1 2 3 here tn is total inorganic n amount mg i index representing the layer number cn i total inorganic n concentration at the ith layer mg l 1 vi soil volume of the ith layer and ɵ i soil porosity of the ith layer then inorganic n retention efficiencies defined as the ratio of tn of each growth stage to the initially applied amount of nitrogen fertilizer were calculated at the same time measured n2o flux can be used to estimate the denitrification rate of each system the average rate of n flux of each rice growth stage was used to estimate the total denitrified n loss in relation to the specific growth stage using the following equation 5 d n g r o w t h s t a g e 1440 n f l u x g r o w t h s t a g e a d g r o w t h s t a g e here dn growthstage is denitrified n amount in each growth stage mg nflux growthstage average n flux in each growth stage μg m 2 min 1 a surface area m2 and d growthstage number of days of each growth stage by summing up the losses of each growth stage total denitrified n as a percentage of initially applied n amount was estimated for each system 3 results 3 1 redox potential and n2o flux time series of the daily average redox potential of each treatment are shown in fig 3 both mfc and mfc extv treatments showed significantly higher redox potentials than that of non mfcs during the reproductive stage there were distinct differences between mfcs and non mfcs however during the maturation stage redox potential reached between 180 and 200 mv in each system and showed similar values irrespective of the mfc effects because one way anova on daily averaged data indicated a significant difference between each treatment at the 5 significance level a multiple comparison test by tukey s hsd method was applied to clarify differences among the three groups the results of which are shown in fig 4 this figure shows that while redox potentials between mfcs and non mfcs and between mfc extvs and non mfcs were significantly different the difference between mfcs and mfc extvs was not significant this implies that applying an external voltage does not significantly enhance the soil redox status as a whole the time series of n2o flux of each treatment is shown in fig 5 both mfc and mfc extv treatments showed lower flux rates than that of non mfcs the flux rates were clearly distinct between mfcs and non mfcs during the reproductive stage again one way anova on n2o flux data showed a significant difference between each treatment at the 5 significance level a tukey hsd multiple comparison test was applied to compare treatments the results of which are shown in fig 6 while n2o flux showed a significant difference between mfcs and non mfcs there was no statistically significant difference between mfcs and mfc extvs both mean n2o flux and average redox potential with respect to each growth stage are shown in fig 7 there was a common trend of n2o flux in all treatments namely a decrease from the start to the end of rice growth however n2o flux of non mfcs was significantly higher than those of mfcs and mfc extv throughout all stages while n2o flux rates of non mfcs were 0 078 0 044 and 0 025 μg m2 min in the vegetative stage reproductive stage and maturation stage respectively those for mfcs and mfc extvs were as follows for mfcs 0 045 0 017 and 0 002 μg m2 min and for mfc extvs 0 052 0 029 and 0 014 μg m2 min if we consider the redox potentials in all treatments they also showed a decreasing trend from the start to the end of rice growth however this decreasing trend was much more pronounced in non mfcs in addition soil redox status in non mfcs was far more reducing throughout all growth stages namely 164 mv 183 mv and 192 mv in the vegetative stage reproductive stage and maturation stage respectively by contrast the redox conditions of mfcs and mfc extvs were as follows for mfcs 151 mv 165 mv and 179 mv and for mfc extvs 148 mv 163 mv and 175 mv respectively in addition to the examination of redox potential and n2o flux we also examined the c n ratio of soil particles the c n ratios in soil are shown in fig 8 c n ratios showed a tendency to increase over the growth period irrespective of the treatment applied specifically the mfcs were associated with lower c n ratios than the non mfcs during the reproductive stage and maturation stage 3 2 inorganic nitrogen profile inorganic n nh4 no2 no3 profiles for each treatment at the three different times are shown in fig 9 most of the inorganic nitrogen was localized in the upper soils at depths of 10 cm and 20 cm nh4 concentration at a depth of 10 cm was the highest at the start of the vegetative stage june 24 in all treatments with the addition of fertilizer but the size of the decrease was much larger in non mfcs at the start of the maturation stage aug 9 while nh4 concentration at a depth of 30 cm showed no significant difference among the treatments especially the nh4 concentration of mfcs at a depth of 20 cm was clearly higher throughout the growth stages 3 3 nitrogen retention and denitrification the total amount of inorganic n in all soil pore water at the start of each growth stage is shown in fig 10 during each stage total inorganic n in mfcs was higher than that in non mfcs interestingly the availability of inorganic n was specifically higher in mfcs and mfc extvs during the start of the reproductive stage than at other stages according to eq 4 the n retention efficiencies for mfcs mfc extvs and non mfcs relative to the start of the reproductive stage were 98 8 84 2 and 50 5 respectively by the start of the maturation stage nitrogen retention efficiencies were 34 9 34 9 and 19 8 with each system respectively this could be explained by the fact that the retention efficiencies decrease during the period of growth with a diminishing source of nitrogen and also with nitrogen utilization by plants accordingly both mfc conditions showed relatively high efficiencies especially at the reproductive stage of rice growth as shown in table 2 total denitrified n losses as calculated by eq 5 are also shown in table 2 total denitrified n levels by the end of the maturation stage of rice estimated for the systems of mfcs mfc extvs and non mfcs were 2 2 4 0 and 6 1 respectively accordingly both mfcs and mfc extvs showed lower denitrification n losses than non mfcs 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of denitrification rate in other studies groffman 1995 pathak et al 2007 the denitrification rate from paddy soils was estimated to be in the range of 10 50 thus the results of our study show a comparatively low rate although there was a significant difference in denitrification rate between mfcs and non mfcs two possible reasons for this are as follows while our desired inhibition by the acetylene inhibition method involves the suppression of nitrous oxide reductases that further reduce n2o into n2 gas acetylene gas also inhibits the production of no3 via nitrification mosier 1980 groffman 1995 this is undesirable for a denitrification study with nh4 fertilizer because nh4 ions could not be denitrified unless nitrification occurs first therefore there is a possibility that a significant proportion of nh4 ions were not converted to nitrate which led to underestimation of the overall denitrification rate another possible reason is that the amount of n2o gas emitted into the air from flooded rice soils could decrease due to the amount of it dissolved in the flooded water layer as we sometimes observed negative n2o flux as shown in fig 5 this could be another reason for the lower denitrification rates during the initial stage of this experiment the effect of mfc on suppressing denitrification was not clear this may have been attributable to the overlap of several mineral nitrogen transformations at this stage including the autotrophic nitrification process irrespective of mfc application nh4 n the form of nitrogen usually applied as fertilizer is first converted to no2 and then to no3 under aerobic conditions however these nitrification reactions might be partially blocked by frequent acetylene injections which corresponded to the underestimation of denitrification rates in all systems nonetheless total inorganic nitrogen retention efficiencies in soil pore water suggested that best retention occurred in the reproductive stage of rice growth with mfc systems the total denitrified nitrogen percentage by the end of the maturation stage suggested that the denitrification reaction was controlled in the mfc systems 4 2 characteristics of soil nitrogen in all three systems relatively high no2 concentrations appeared for a short time during the start of the reproductive stage in general for all three systems this might have been attributable to the nitrification reactions by nitrifiers under aerobic conditions provided with fertilizer with high levels of nitrogen at the beginning of this experiment this is referred to as a nitrifier denitrification reaction because it is a nitrification pathway involving the oxidation of nh3 to no2 followed by the reduction of no2 to n2o and n2 wrage et al 2001 accordingly subsequent reductions can be expected due to the formation of these no2 ions first and then their conversion into no3 ions according to fig 9 no2 and no3 ions were rarely present in non mfcs during the start of the reproductive stage suggesting that more denitrification reactions were likely with non mfcs specifically during the start of the reproductive stage in both mfcs and mfc extvs no2 concentrations were higher than those of non mfcs this implies that denitrifying conditions had not occurred much in both mfc systems at this stage however starting from rice reproductive stage towards the maturation stage no3 concentrations were lower in non mfcs than in mfcs implying that denitrification reactions are more likely to occur in non mfcs than in mfcs at the same time these results are compatible with the n2o flux changes in mfcs and non mfcs especially with the clear difference between them through the rice reproductive stage and early maturation stage fig 5 4 3 performance of mfc during the rice maturation stage redox potential reached between 180 and 200 mv in each system and showed similar values irrespective of the mfc effects electrode malfunctioning towards the end of experiment period might be one reason at the end of the experiment a degradation of carbon rods was observed in all mfc treatments in addition we observed the same trend of lowering mfc voltage output in all mfc treatments this could be the reason for not lowering the redox potentials in those microbial fuel cell treatments during the stage of rice maturation thus the performance of mfc treatment systems should also be similar to that of non mfc systems during the stage of rice maturation another possible explanation is the maturation of rice plants at which stage the exudation of organic acids from the rhizosphere might be limited quantitative and qualitative differences in the exudation of organic substrates from rice roots would have affected the mfc performance which was also discussed by kaku et al 2008 in fact according to aulakh et al 2001 root exudation rates generally increase with seedling to panicle initiation or flowering but decrease at maturity we thus speculated that the reproductive stage of rice could facilitate root exudation though it cannot be proven due to the lack of data from our study at this moment therefore with the high availability of electrons provided by root exudates i e organic acids the performance of mfc could be higher with the circulation of more electrons released with the consumption of organic exudates due to microbial metabolism this in turn could have a greater effect on controlling the soil redox status during the reproductive stage of rice 5 conclusion we attempted to confirm the applicability of mfc theory for suppressing denitrification in flooded rice soils from the nitrogen behavior studies in soils with planting pots and chamber experiments we obtained the result that n2o flux levels of mfcs and mfc extvs were significantly lower than that of non mfcs both redox potential trends and the c n ratio in mfcs and mfc extvs were also consistent with this result more specifically the results showed that the effect of mfc could be better utilized in the reproductive stage this period is the most critical stage throughout rice growth because better availability of n is required during this period however whether the external application of voltage has distinct effects on redox potential and n2o flux rate was not clarified this might be attributable to the design of the anode therefore additional consideration of anode design should be performed to cover the effect of external voltage through the soil in conclusion we confirmed the applicability of mfc to control soil redox potential and thereby suppress denitrification namely n losses for flooded rice soils with pot experiments this approach could also lower greenhouse gas n2o emissions on the other hand field scale applications would be still challenging due to many possible constraints in deploying mfc device with rice cultivated lands thus further basic studies are required to assess denitrifying conditions by monitoring the activity of denitrifying microbes and their population shifts associated with mfc treatments also it would be a worthy theme to consider the effect of rice growth stage on denitrification levels due to any quantitative and qualitative differences in root exudations when applying mfcs to control denitrification in the field level experiments acknowledgements this work

11407,controlling the denitrification rate could help reduce the losses of applied nitrogen n fertilizer in fields the applicability of microbial fuel cell mfc for controlling denitrification in flooded rice soils was investigated based on mfc theory coupled with redox changes because the soil about 10 20 cm beneath water and the soil near the water surface are anaerobic and aerobic respectively gradients of electric potentials could be generated between them upon connecting them through insulated wires electrons released through the oxidation of organic matter during microbial metabolism can be utilized by this set up generating electricity this can reduce the availability of electrons for reductive half reactions of nitrate to suppress denitrification we studied the n losses in soil using planting pots with gas chamber experiment under three conditions mfc systems mfc systems with an externally applied voltage and non mfc systems as a control each system was set in triplicate supplied with the same n fertilizer amounts and flooded with automatic irrigation soil redox potential n2o flux and inorganic nitrogen concentration in soil pore water were periodically monitored the redox potentials of both mfc systems and mfc systems with externally applied voltage were significantly higher than that of non mfc systems while n2o flux levels were significantly lower than that of non mfc systems the rice reproductive stage was the most effective on suppressing n2o flux with mfc application however the effect of externally applied voltage on suppressing n2o flux remains unclear inorganic nitrogen retention efficiencies in pore water were higher in mfc systems which is consistent with the n2o flux difference while the proportion of denitrified n estimated for mfc systems was 2 3 that of non mfc systems was 6 6 we confirmed the applicability of mfcs to control soil redox potential and thereby suppress the denitrification based on planting pot experiments keywords redox potential nitrous oxide gas nitrogen fertilizer 1 introduction 1 1 problem of nitrogen deficiency the global food industry is highly dependent on fossil fuels energy efficient approaches to agriculture would offer a way to take advantage of the relationships between energy food and agriculture a huge amount of energy is required for the fixation of nitrogen n fertilizer from the unlimited atmospheric nitrogen to manufacture one metric ton of anhydrous ammonia nh3 which consists 82 of n it is estimated that 3500 m3 of natural gas is used olson and halstead 1974 it is also estimated that the field application of 150 kg ha n fertilizer in the form of nh3 involves the consumption of 645 m3 of natural gas olson and halstead 1974 moreover despite the fact that rice is the staple food of half the world s population n fertilizer is not used efficiently keeny and sahrawat 1986 recognizing the fact that n fertilizer is absolutely essential for supporting the growing global population there is an urgent need to explore efficient ways of using fertilizer to compensate for future food shortages as conventional methods to improve n retention efficiency various methods such as leguminous crop production crop rotation and management of irrigation water have been proposed and implemented huang et al 2007 kaewpradit et al 2008 pramanik et al 2014 though these approaches are proven to be effective under specific conditions sometimes these are not effective due to the uncontrollable factors such as climate conditions hence if we can electrochemically control denitrification processes that might be a more universally applicable technology the process of denitrification involving the conversion of soil inorganic n to elemental n gas is one of the main routes behind n deficiency in crop production here denitrification refers to the process in which no3 is converted to gaseous compounds such as no n2o and n2 by microorganisms in submerged soils the denitrifying bacteria use no3 in the absence of oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor in their process of respiration which is reduced to no2 no n2o and finally n2 reddy and patrick 1986 from the viewpoint of saving n fertilizer in agricultural fields denitrification is undesirable in addition paddy fields have been recognized as one of the sources of atmospheric n2o mosier et al 1996 akiyama et al 2005 one of the greenhouse gases causing global warming thus the extent of n loss via denitrification has attracted great interest among researchers as well as farmers iida et al 2007 1 2 theory of microbial fuel cell for the control of soil redox potential according to the definition given by lovley 2006 a microbial fuel cell mfc is a device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy generating power in mfc depends on redox chemistry the redox reaction involves a transfer of electrons between two chemical species oxidization involves losing electrons from one chemical species whereas reduction involves gaining electrons by other chemical species microbes can gain energy through redox reactions between organic compounds and terminal electron acceptors such as o2 this process can be interpreted as involving the oxidation of the organic compound and the reduction of the terminal electron acceptor the principle of mfc involves the utilization of electrons liberated by the decomposition of organic matter by microbes to produce electricity the principle of mfc can also be applied to flooded soils fig 1 illustrates the concept of an mfc applied to flooded soils the electrons produced during the oxidation of organic matter are transferred directly to an anode and the electrons travel through an electrical circuit to a cathode where oxygen is reduced to h2o while the region several centimeters below the flooded soil surface is anaerobic near the soil surface aerobic conditions prevail thus potential gradients could be generated between these regions when connected externally through insulated wires it is therefore possible to generate electricity if anode respiring microbes have self sustained extracellular electron transfer mechanisms lovley 2008 in fact some studies have already shown that electricity can be produced in flooded soils arends et al 2014 kaku et al 2008 kouzuma et al 2014 takenezawa et al 2010 in this context the following question arises how can the denitrification process be related to the principle of mfc in the denitrification process of flooded rice fields the electrons produced from the oxidation of organic matter by microbes are gained by oxygen containing inorganic n species such as no3 and no2 typical redox reactions related to no3 respiration that are performed by microbes in the absence of oxygen are shown in the eqs 1 and 2 1 5 c 6 h 12 o 6 24 no 3 24 h 30 co 2 12 n 2 42 h 2 o 2 c 12 h 22 o 11 9 6 no 3 9 6 h 12 co 2 4 8 n 2 15 8 h 2 o because these are redox reactions between organic carbon c and oxidized forms of n anions the availability of organic c should be one of the factors determining whether denitrification occurs the dynamics of organic c is difficult to control whereas in contrast the electrons resulting from its oxidation through microbial metabolism can be controlled specifically the electrons resulting from the oxidation of organic matter can be circulated in a chain which is referred to as an electric chain when the anaerobic layer is externally connected to the upper aerobic layer of soils it is therefore hypothesized that denitrifying conditions could be controlled by redox potential changes in soils that are invoked by mfc in other words a competition for electrons is expected to invoke the generation of electricity and to outcompete denitrification reactions at the same time thus based on the above hypothesis we studied on the control of denitrification n losses in flooded rice soils by using mfc applications with pot experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 design of planting pots with gas chamber experiment we conducted a planting pot with gas chamber experiment with three different conditions mfc systems mfc systems with an externally applied voltage and non mfc systems as a control each system was set in triplicate the mfc systems with an externally applied voltage were aimed at increasing the efficiency of mfcs because it was expected that the rapid movement of electrons towards the anodic area would be enhanced by the externally applied voltage an external voltage maintained at 25 50 mv was applied by a voltage stabilizer ad 8735a and company ltd throughout rice growth in the rest of this article we refer to the mfc systems as mfcs mfc systems with an externally applied voltage as mfc extvs and non mfc systems as non mfcs the experimental period included the entire period of rice growth after transplantation soil redox potential n2o gas flux c n ratio of soil and nh4 no2 and no3 concentrations in soil pore water were periodically measured based on these measurements the n retention efficiencies and denitrification loss rates were calculated and compared among these systems the designs of the planting pot and the gas chamber are shown in fig 2 for soil particle and pore water samplings each planting pot had three holes diameter of 2 cm closed by rubber stoppers in addition each planting pot had a hole at the bottom to inject acetylene gas in order to inhibit the reaction of nitrous oxide reductase enzymes which further converts n2o to n2 a circular tube which had holes in it at equal distances of 2 5 cm from each other was fit snugly into the bottom hole and then inserted into soil because this tube was connected to a three way stopcock gas could be distributed at equal pressure in each pot gas flow pressure at the outflow valve was adjusted to 1 2 mpa each gas chamber also had three holes diameter of 2 cm closed by a butyl rubber septum for gas sampling the soil for the experiment was collected from the experimental paddy fields of the field science center of gifu university according to the japanese soil inventory it is gleysol https soil inventory dc affrc go jp besides collecting the soil for experiments the soil was also collected to soil samplers 100 cm3 from about 20 cm below soil surface and basic physical properties were measured by oven drying at 110 c for 24 h table 1 shows the basic soil physical properties except for in the non mfcs for an anode a carbon graphite felt mat s 221 osaka gas chemicals co ltd of 20 20 0 5 cm was introduced 10 cm below the soil surface as a cathode a graphite rod c 072591 nilaco corporation with a length of 10 cm and diameter of 0 5 cm was kept floating on the flooded water in contact with air the anode and cathode were linked through insulated wires externally connected with a resister of 330 ω as a basal application ammonium based chemical fertilizer nh4 2so4 was initially applied at a rate of 30 kg nha 1 one day after the application of fertilizer two rice seedlings aged 3 weeks of oriza sativa l cv hatsushimo were transplanted into each pot on june 15th 2016 then soil was kept flooded at a depth of approximately 5 cm by an automatic water supply system by observing the growth of rice plants rice growth was divided into three stages vegetative reproductive and maturation june 24 was considered as the start of the vegetative stage with the tillering of rice plants visibly started on panicle forming of rice plants which was first visibly started on july 16 considered as the start of the reproductive stage heading time which was first visibly started on august 16 considered as the start of the maturation stage 2 2 gas sampling and measurements applying a closed chamber method gas was sampled biweekly and n2o concentration was measured by gas chromatography gc 2014 equipped with an ecd detector shimadzu co ltd the reason why n2o concentration was measured is that the measurement of n2 emissions is impossible due to the high atmospheric background level of 78 groffman and robertson 2015 using an injecting syringe in each sampling hole of the chamber gas was sampled at 11 a m 1 p m and 3 p m at each gas sampling event here the acetylene inhibition method was applied iida et al 2007 forty minutes before the start of gas sampling acetylene gas was injected for 1 min to achieve a state of equilibrium between the soil and the chamber headspace iida et al 2007 proposed that the amount of acetylene in the headspace needs to be higher than 0 1 to ensure that microbial enzymes related to n2o reduction to n2 are inhibited according to this standard the acetylene concentration in the headspace was checked by tube type gas detectors gv100s gastec co ltd before starting the sampling and at the last sampling before each gas sampling event a small fan fixed on the top corner of the chamber was operated for 30 s to ensure the homogeneity of the air inside the chamber the conditions of gas chromatography were as follows oven temperature 60 c detector temperature 340 c and carrier gas argon methane 5 the unit of concentration was converted from volumetric concentration to mass concentration using the ideal gas law considering headspace temperature and assuming gas pressure of 101 325 nm 2 then flux was calculated using the following equation 3 f δ m a δ t v a δ m v δ t h δ

here the headspace is defined as the height of the chamber plus the distance between the flooded water surface and the top of the pot fig 2 2 3 redox potential and chemical measurement redox potential was measured by eh meters prn 41 fujiwara factory co ltd these meters consist of counter electrodes made of pt coated by glass tubes and reference electrodes made of agcl with saturated kcl internal solution while reference electrodes were put near the soil surface counter electrodes were installed at a depth of 20 cm just near the anode and continuously measured eh at 1 h intervals the voltage difference generated by the mfcs and the soil temperature at 10 cm below the soil surface and the temperature inside the chamber were recorded on a data logger cr 1000 campbell scientific inc at 10 min intervals soil pore water was sampled on june 24 the start of the vegetative stage july 22 the start of the reproductive stage and august 9 the start of the maturation stage using pore water samplers rhizon mom 10 cm rhizosphere research products www rhizosphere com sampling depths were 10 20 and 30 cm from the soil surface upon filtering through membrane filter units of 0 45 μm pore size 03cp045an advantec and then through membrane filters of 0 45 μm pore size a045a047a advantec nh4 no2 and no3 concentrations of filtrates were identified by ion chromatography ica 2000 toa dkk co ltd the eluents of ion chromatography were 1 8 mm na2co3 and 1 7 mm naco3 for anions and 6 mm methanesulfonic acid for cations total c and total n contents in soil particles were measured by a chno elemental analyzer jm10 micro corder j science lab co ltd soil sampling was carried out at the same time as gas sampling and pore water sampling so that the soil environment would not be repeatedly disturbed sampled soil was air dried for 48 h and sieved by a 2 mm sieve 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 data treatment and statistical analysis after initiating the experiment mfc output was not stabilized for some period thus the data obtained after june 23 were utilized for analysis in addition the redox potential showed periodical drops due to acetylene injection during the gas sampling events thus redox potential data during the gas measuring events were excluded from the analysis after taking the daily average of redox potential and n2o flux data for each replicate of each treatment repeated measures of one way anova was applied to redox potential data and n2o flux data for the pretreatment of one way anova data were transformed to normal distribution and checked for homogeneity of variances using the levene s tests when significant difference was detected p 0 05 multiple comparisons were performed by using tukey s hsd tests to identify the specific treatment of which mean value is significantly different from others all statistical analyses described in this article were performed using ibm spss statistics version 24 2 4 2 nitrogen retention and denitrification based on the observations of low nh4 nitrogen ions in soil particles in random samples of soil solutions with a 1 2 ratio nh4 nitrogen retention in soil particles was considered negligible in addition we assume that n mineralization and immobilization are slower in flooded conditions due to the low oxygen levels compared with those in upland soils ishii et al 2011 therefore the contributions of mineralization and immobilization to the n budget were considered negligible by calculating the mass change of inorganic nitrogen in the soil pore water the net change of inorganic nitrogen can be estimated because soil sampling depths are 10 20 and 30 cm we divided the pot into three layers with heights of 15 10 and 15 cm respectively as shown in fig 2 it could be considered that the whole soil pore spaces were fully saturated over the period since the soils were continuously flooded thus it can use soil porosity to calculate the volumetric water content of each layer then if the amounts of inorganic nitrogen in the forms of nh4 no2 and no3 of each layer are summed up we can obtain the total inorganic nitrogen amount of soil pore water by using the following eq 4 4 t n i 1 3 c n i v i θ i i 1 2 3 here tn is total inorganic n amount mg i index representing the layer number cn i total inorganic n concentration at the ith layer mg l 1 vi soil volume of the ith layer and ɵ i soil porosity of the ith layer then inorganic n retention efficiencies defined as the ratio of tn of each growth stage to the initially applied amount of nitrogen fertilizer were calculated at the same time measured n2o flux can be used to estimate the denitrification rate of each system the average rate of n flux of each rice growth stage was used to estimate the total denitrified n loss in relation to the specific growth stage using the following equation 5 d n g r o w t h s t a g e 1440 n f l u x g r o w t h s t a g e a d g r o w t h s t a g e here dn growthstage is denitrified n amount in each growth stage mg nflux growthstage average n flux in each growth stage μg m 2 min 1 a surface area m2 and d growthstage number of days of each growth stage by summing up the losses of each growth stage total denitrified n as a percentage of initially applied n amount was estimated for each system 3 results 3 1 redox potential and n2o flux time series of the daily average redox potential of each treatment are shown in fig 3 both mfc and mfc extv treatments showed significantly higher redox potentials than that of non mfcs during the reproductive stage there were distinct differences between mfcs and non mfcs however during the maturation stage redox potential reached between 180 and 200 mv in each system and showed similar values irrespective of the mfc effects because one way anova on daily averaged data indicated a significant difference between each treatment at the 5 significance level a multiple comparison test by tukey s hsd method was applied to clarify differences among the three groups the results of which are shown in fig 4 this figure shows that while redox potentials between mfcs and non mfcs and between mfc extvs and non mfcs were significantly different the difference between mfcs and mfc extvs was not significant this implies that applying an external voltage does not significantly enhance the soil redox status as a whole the time series of n2o flux of each treatment is shown in fig 5 both mfc and mfc extv treatments showed lower flux rates than that of non mfcs the flux rates were clearly distinct between mfcs and non mfcs during the reproductive stage again one way anova on n2o flux data showed a significant difference between each treatment at the 5 significance level a tukey hsd multiple comparison test was applied to compare treatments the results of which are shown in fig 6 while n2o flux showed a significant difference between mfcs and non mfcs there was no statistically significant difference between mfcs and mfc extvs both mean n2o flux and average redox potential with respect to each growth stage are shown in fig 7 there was a common trend of n2o flux in all treatments namely a decrease from the start to the end of rice growth however n2o flux of non mfcs was significantly higher than those of mfcs and mfc extv throughout all stages while n2o flux rates of non mfcs were 0 078 0 044 and 0 025 μg m2 min in the vegetative stage reproductive stage and maturation stage respectively those for mfcs and mfc extvs were as follows for mfcs 0 045 0 017 and 0 002 μg m2 min and for mfc extvs 0 052 0 029 and 0 014 μg m2 min if we consider the redox potentials in all treatments they also showed a decreasing trend from the start to the end of rice growth however this decreasing trend was much more pronounced in non mfcs in addition soil redox status in non mfcs was far more reducing throughout all growth stages namely 164 mv 183 mv and 192 mv in the vegetative stage reproductive stage and maturation stage respectively by contrast the redox conditions of mfcs and mfc extvs were as follows for mfcs 151 mv 165 mv and 179 mv and for mfc extvs 148 mv 163 mv and 175 mv respectively in addition to the examination of redox potential and n2o flux we also examined the c n ratio of soil particles the c n ratios in soil are shown in fig 8 c n ratios showed a tendency to increase over the growth period irrespective of the treatment applied specifically the mfcs were associated with lower c n ratios than the non mfcs during the reproductive stage and maturation stage 3 2 inorganic nitrogen profile inorganic n nh4 no2 no3 profiles for each treatment at the three different times are shown in fig 9 most of the inorganic nitrogen was localized in the upper soils at depths of 10 cm and 20 cm nh4 concentration at a depth of 10 cm was the highest at the start of the vegetative stage june 24 in all treatments with the addition of fertilizer but the size of the decrease was much larger in non mfcs at the start of the maturation stage aug 9 while nh4 concentration at a depth of 30 cm showed no significant difference among the treatments especially the nh4 concentration of mfcs at a depth of 20 cm was clearly higher throughout the growth stages 3 3 nitrogen retention and denitrification the total amount of inorganic n in all soil pore water at the start of each growth stage is shown in fig 10 during each stage total inorganic n in mfcs was higher than that in non mfcs interestingly the availability of inorganic n was specifically higher in mfcs and mfc extvs during the start of the reproductive stage than at other stages according to eq 4 the n retention efficiencies for mfcs mfc extvs and non mfcs relative to the start of the reproductive stage were 98 8 84 2 and 50 5 respectively by the start of the maturation stage nitrogen retention efficiencies were 34 9 34 9 and 19 8 with each system respectively this could be explained by the fact that the retention efficiencies decrease during the period of growth with a diminishing source of nitrogen and also with nitrogen utilization by plants accordingly both mfc conditions showed relatively high efficiencies especially at the reproductive stage of rice growth as shown in table 2 total denitrified n losses as calculated by eq 5 are also shown in table 2 total denitrified n levels by the end of the maturation stage of rice estimated for the systems of mfcs mfc extvs and non mfcs were 2 2 4 0 and 6 1 respectively accordingly both mfcs and mfc extvs showed lower denitrification n losses than non mfcs 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of denitrification rate in other studies groffman 1995 pathak et al 2007 the denitrification rate from paddy soils was estimated to be in the range of 10 50 thus the results of our study show a comparatively low rate although there was a significant difference in denitrification rate between mfcs and non mfcs two possible reasons for this are as follows while our desired inhibition by the acetylene inhibition method involves the suppression of nitrous oxide reductases that further reduce n2o into n2 gas acetylene gas also inhibits the production of no3 via nitrification mosier 1980 groffman 1995 this is undesirable for a denitrification study with nh4 fertilizer because nh4 ions could not be denitrified unless nitrification occurs first therefore there is a possibility that a significant proportion of nh4 ions were not converted to nitrate which led to underestimation of the overall denitrification rate another possible reason is that the amount of n2o gas emitted into the air from flooded rice soils could decrease due to the amount of it dissolved in the flooded water layer as we sometimes observed negative n2o flux as shown in fig 5 this could be another reason for the lower denitrification rates during the initial stage of this experiment the effect of mfc on suppressing denitrification was not clear this may have been attributable to the overlap of several mineral nitrogen transformations at this stage including the autotrophic nitrification process irrespective of mfc application nh4 n the form of nitrogen usually applied as fertilizer is first converted to no2 and then to no3 under aerobic conditions however these nitrification reactions might be partially blocked by frequent acetylene injections which corresponded to the underestimation of denitrification rates in all systems nonetheless total inorganic nitrogen retention efficiencies in soil pore water suggested that best retention occurred in the reproductive stage of rice growth with mfc systems the total denitrified nitrogen percentage by the end of the maturation stage suggested that the denitrification reaction was controlled in the mfc systems 4 2 characteristics of soil nitrogen in all three systems relatively high no2 concentrations appeared for a short time during the start of the reproductive stage in general for all three systems this might have been attributable to the nitrification reactions by nitrifiers under aerobic conditions provided with fertilizer with high levels of nitrogen at the beginning of this experiment this is referred to as a nitrifier denitrification reaction because it is a nitrification pathway involving the oxidation of nh3 to no2 followed by the reduction of no2 to n2o and n2 wrage et al 2001 accordingly subsequent reductions can be expected due to the formation of these no2 ions first and then their conversion into no3 ions according to fig 9 no2 and no3 ions were rarely present in non mfcs during the start of the reproductive stage suggesting that more denitrification reactions were likely with non mfcs specifically during the start of the reproductive stage in both mfcs and mfc extvs no2 concentrations were higher than those of non mfcs this implies that denitrifying conditions had not occurred much in both mfc systems at this stage however starting from rice reproductive stage towards the maturation stage no3 concentrations were lower in non mfcs than in mfcs implying that denitrification reactions are more likely to occur in non mfcs than in mfcs at the same time these results are compatible with the n2o flux changes in mfcs and non mfcs especially with the clear difference between them through the rice reproductive stage and early maturation stage fig 5 4 3 performance of mfc during the rice maturation stage redox potential reached between 180 and 200 mv in each system and showed similar values irrespective of the mfc effects electrode malfunctioning towards the end of experiment period might be one reason at the end of the experiment a degradation of carbon rods was observed in all mfc treatments in addition we observed the same trend of lowering mfc voltage output in all mfc treatments this could be the reason for not lowering the redox potentials in those microbial fuel cell treatments during the stage of rice maturation thus the performance of mfc treatment systems should also be similar to that of non mfc systems during the stage of rice maturation another possible explanation is the maturation of rice plants at which stage the exudation of organic acids from the rhizosphere might be limited quantitative and qualitative differences in the exudation of organic substrates from rice roots would have affected the mfc performance which was also discussed by kaku et al 2008 in fact according to aulakh et al 2001 root exudation rates generally increase with seedling to panicle initiation or flowering but decrease at maturity we thus speculated that the reproductive stage of rice could facilitate root exudation though it cannot be proven due to the lack of data from our study at this moment therefore with the high availability of electrons provided by root exudates i e organic acids the performance of mfc could be higher with the circulation of more electrons released with the consumption of organic exudates due to microbial metabolism this in turn could have a greater effect on controlling the soil redox status during the reproductive stage of rice 5 conclusion we attempted to confirm the applicability of mfc theory for suppressing denitrification in flooded rice soils from the nitrogen behavior studies in soils with planting pots and chamber experiments we obtained the result that n2o flux levels of mfcs and mfc extvs were significantly lower than that of non mfcs both redox potential trends and the c n ratio in mfcs and mfc extvs were also consistent with this result more specifically the results showed that the effect of mfc could be better utilized in the reproductive stage this period is the most critical stage throughout rice growth because better availability of n is required during this period however whether the external application of voltage has distinct effects on redox potential and n2o flux rate was not clarified this might be attributable to the design of the anode therefore additional consideration of anode design should be performed to cover the effect of external voltage through the soil in conclusion we confirmed the applicability of mfc to control soil redox potential and thereby suppress denitrification namely n losses for flooded rice soils with pot experiments this approach could also lower greenhouse gas n2o emissions on the other hand field scale applications would be still challenging due to many possible constraints in deploying mfc device with rice cultivated lands thus further basic studies are required to assess denitrifying conditions by monitoring the activity of denitrifying microbes and their population shifts associated with mfc treatments also it would be a worthy theme to consider the effect of rice growth stage on denitrification levels due to any quantitative and qualitative differences in root exudations when applying mfcs to control denitrification in the field level experiments acknowledgements this work

11408,potato is an important food crop with high yields however when exposed to drought it suffers major yield losses considering its global importance and the increasing incidence of drought due to climate change research toward drought tolerance in potato remains imperative we have studied a set of 103 commercial cultivars representing the genetic diversity in the european potato market the cultivars were grown in different field locations in three subsequent years 2013 2015 our aim was to understand how different field drought regimes affect canopy growth in potato and how these effects translate to tuber yield the field environmental conditions were monitored and pictures of canopy ground cover during the growing season were taken canopy growth parameters were extracted by an iterative method using the beta sigmoid growth function to model canopy growth at harvest tuber yield was scored and tuber size was graded the gge genotype and genotype by environment bi plot and finlay wilkinson s regression were used to investigate genotype x environment interactions we observed that the timing of the drought occurrence differentially affected canopy growth and tuber yield under drought stress fast attainment of exponential growth and maximum canopy cover had negative effects on tuber formation and tuber bulking growth rate maximum canopy cover and area under the canopy curve photosynthetic capacity over the growth season were more important for tuber bulking than they were for tuber formation under drought stress cultivars with high yield were identified as potential material for improvement to drought tolerance these findings will contribute to the breeding for drought tolerant potato amidst the threats of climate change keywords irrigation rainfall stress auc maturity 1 introduction climate change negatively impacts agricultural production especially in marginal regions with limited inputs like fresh water the negative effects of water limitation on crop yield are critical for drought sensitive crops of high importance for food production and security like potato potato is the world s 3rd most important food crop and its production in the developing world has increased in the last two decades demonstrating its important contribution to food security acton 2013 the global production of potato is estimated at 377 million tonnes in about 19 million hectares faostat 2016 when compared to grain producing crops a hectare of potato can yield about two to four fold more calories cip 2013 potato is known for its efficiency in water usage shahnazari et al 2007 vreugdenhil et al 2007 in comparison with other major crops potato produces the highest amount of calories per unit water input and it is seven times more efficient than some cereals like wheat maize etc cip 2013 fao 2008 however potato is generally drought sensitive schafleitner et al 2008 with losses in yield that can reach 79 reduction if water requirements are not met binod et al 2015 the palmer drought severity index predicts a widespread drought in many regions of the globe including europe in the next 30 90 years arising from reduced rainfall and or increased evaporation dai 2013 the drought sensitivity of potato may be attributed to the stress effects on its foliage characteristics deblonde and ledent 2001 schittenhelm et al 2006 soltys kalina et al 2016 romero et al 2017 and its shallow root system van loon 1981 yamaguchi and tanaka 1990 iwama et al 1993 opena and porter 1999 stalham et al 2007 zarzyńska et al 2017 that make water uptake inefficient luisa et al 1997 in comparison with many other crops leaf stomatal closure occurs in potato at relatively low soil moisture deficits perceived by the roots sadras and milroy 1996 this leads to a significant drop in transpiration even before significant reduction in leaf water potential occurs liu et al 2005 stomatal closure at relatively high leaf water potential 0 4 mpa and 0 6 mpa may already limit photosynthesis with reduced production of assimilates and canopy growth and a resultant drop in tuber yield and quality luisa et al 1997 therefore the drought response in potato and possibly tolerance may be closely linked to a bias free quantification of the progress of canopy growth bojacá et al 2011 many techniques have been developed to facilitate the monitoring of canopy growth these include the grid system that measures ground area covered near infrared reflectance which measures interception of solar radiation picture image capture of canopy cover and image analysis and remote sensing using satellite data bojacá et al 2011 bouman et al 1992 korva 1996 prashar and jones 2014 sivarajan 2011 in addition to monitoring canopy growth as described above accurate quantification extraction and interpretation of canopy growth parameters will give deeper insight into the traits of interest for crop improvement chen et al 2014 potato canopy growth has been described by several authors using growth models of good fit to show the progress of canopy from emergence towards senescence khan 2012 ospina et al 2014 under drought conditions several growth measurements in field grown potato have been reported which have enhanced our understanding on how to manage different drought regimes in the field jefferies and mackerron 1993 mackerron et al 1988 ouiam et al 2003 shiri et al 2009 steyn et al 2007 the modelling of potato growth under drought however still requires more research to understand canopy cover dynamics moreover due to the difficulties in managing field experiments potato field drought reports are often based on only a few genotypes this challenges the generalization of conclusions from such field reports percentage ground cover by canopy is known as a good measure of intercepted solar radiation in potato which is also reflected in dry matter production haverkort et al 1991 lemaga and caesar 1990 vreugdenhil et al 2011 interception of solar radiation is reduced under drought conditions depending on the severity of the stress due to reduced leaf expansion and reduction in total number of leaves harris 2012 potato canopy growth has been described in three phases including the build up phase maximum canopy cover phase and decline or senescence phase khan 2012 the build up phase includes the period from emergence till full canopy cover and this often coincides with tuber initiation stage of the plant haverkort and mackerron 1995 the maximum canopy cover and decline phases are periods during which the tubers have to be filled with assimilates bulking the duration of these phases depend on the tuber growth rate and foliage maturity class of the potato genotype haverkort and mackerron 1995 potato genotypes that invest a major part of their life cycle in canopy growth late maturity genotypes can intercept about 700 mj m2 zaag 1992 while early maturity potato genotypes start investing photosynthetic assimilates in their tubers much earlier and thus complete their life cycle early kooman and rabbinge 1996 these differences in genotype and maturity type imply different effects of canopy cover on yield our study is the first to investigate these canopy cover effects on potato yield using an extensive set of genotypes representing different foliage maturity types under field drought conditions in different environments potato yield is the resultant of the number of tubers formed and the volume weight and size of the tubers deblonde and ledent 2001 reported that tuber number was reduced under drought which was compensated by a higher tuber dry weight some reports indicate that drought causes more reduction in tuber weight than tuber number binod et al 2015 but this may be highly dependent on genotypic differences and timing of the drought partitioning of assimilates to tubers for tuber formation as well as bulking and the interaction between these processes may be important for drought tolerance improvement of potato in this study we have evaluated the growth and yield of 103 potato cultivars in three different locations in three years the aim was to investigate the genotypic variation of the drought response in cultivated potato with respect to canopy growth and yield under field conditions our objectives were to understand i how the timing of drought in the growing season affects potato growth and yield in the field ii which canopy growth characteristics are critical for potato tuber yield under drought in the field iii the stability of drought tolerance of potato cultivars across locations and in different years iv which aspects of yield are adversely affected in the field during drought 2 materials and methods 2 1 field location and planting a selection of 103 commercial potato cultivars with different genetic backgrounds and foliage maturity classes early intermediate and late were used in this study supplementary table 1 the cultivars are part of the european potato gene pool used by d hoop et al 2010 for genome wide association studies field trials were conducted in partnership with four potato breeding companies hzpc holland bv c meijer kws potato and averis seeds tubers used for the trials of each year were multiplied in the previous year at a single breeding station ensuring uniformity of seed tuber conditions a split plot design was used for each of the trials in three consecutive years 2013 2014 and 2015 with irrigation levels assigned in the main plots as blocks and genotypes assigned in subplots the fields were located in connantre france 48 7258 n 3 9219 e from 2013 to 2015 and in the netherlands zeeland 51 5667 n 3 7500 e in 2013 and 2014 emmeloord 52 7097 n 5 7508 e in 2013 and grolloo 52 9305 n 6 6943 e in 2014 the field structure in each location and year included two blocks irrigated ir and non irrigated ni treatments in each block the cultivars were randomized as sub plots within the blocks each subplot experimental unit had eight plants of a single cultivar in two rows four plants per row the spacing between plants in a row was 30 cm and 70 cm between rows border plants were planted in between subplots of each row the rows were set on ridges the tubers were planted in april 2013 at connantre zeeland and emmeloord april 2014 at connantre and zeeland and may 2014 at grolloo and april 2015 at connantre the plants remained in the field until harvest at the beginning of fall in the respective locations and years environmental conditions of rainfall temperature aerial and soil radiation relative humidity wind speed and wind direction were monitored at the connantre field in 2014 and 2015 using facilities provided by dacom b v environmental data from nearby weather stations were used for the other trials the control blocks were irrigated weekly during periods of the drought less rainfall e g fig 6d 2 2 phenotyping and data collection potato tubers germinated within three weeks of planting the emergence date was recorded as days after planting when more than half of the plants per plot had germinated canopy ground cover was monitored by taking pictures of each plot weekly with a sony dsc w610 digital camera to infer canopy growth the camera was mounted on a rectangular frame at a specific height from the frame throughout the trial and the frame was positioned just above the canopy the dimension of the rectangular frame was set to capture the inner two plants of each plot plant height was scored within a month from emergence using the highest apex of each plot at harvest various yield traits were measured including tuber fresh weight tbw tuber number tbn underwater weight uww dry matter percentage dmp only in connantre and tuber quality by visual impression a sample of 5 05 kg of harvested tubers per plot was used to measure uww the 5 05 kg was lowered in water and the weight under water measured according to eu direction https webgate ec europa eu agriportal angebleu pdf download docnum 32009r0571 lg en uww is used to infer dry matter and starch content of tubers haase 2003 a smart grader system was employed to grade the tubers into size classes as follows 0 40 mm 40 50 mm 50 60 mm 60 70 mm and 70 mm this enabled us to score tuber number and tuber fresh weight per size class 2 3 data processing we transformed the calendar days after emergence of the plants into thermal days in beta thermal time btt td according to khan 2012 ospina et al 2014 and hurtado lopez et al 2015 to account for differences in the effects of temperature on crop development in various years and locations we accounted for this non linear relationship between temperature t and growth rate g t according to the equation g t t c t t c t o t t b t o t b to tb tc to c t described in yin et al 1995 using base temperature t b 5 5 c optimal temperature t o 23 4 c ceiling temperature t c 34 6 c temperature response curvature coefficient c t 1 6 and daily mean temperature t thus the btt td for a given day is the accumulated g t from emergence up until that day we processed the canopy pictures in matlabr software r2013a version with dipimage toolbox using an algorithm as in ospina et al 2014 the percentage canopy cover output from matlab was used to fit a canopy growth model according to the sigmoid phase of the beta function for determinate growth as described by khan 2012 this model was fitted using the iterative non linear least square regression method implemented in the proc nlin package of the sas software sas institute inc 2015 from the fitted model canopy growth parameters were extracted including exponential growth rate c m1 time to reach exponential growth rate t m1 maximum canopy cover v max time to reach maximum canopy cover t 1 and area under canopy cover a 1 2 4 statistical analysis the data from the yield traits was analysed using genstat 17th edition our aim was to test for the significance of multi factorial effects on drought tolerance in our dataset these factors include genotype location and year effects and their interaction effects we used a threshold level of significance of 0 05 multivariate bi plots were used to observe trait interactions and their contributions to the principal components for this the traits were visualized as vectors showing their respective effects on the variations observed in the dataset furthermore the spearman s correlation coefficients between each of the traits were computed in rstudio 3 2 3 to show specific trait to trait relationships 2 5 performance and stability analysis finlay wilkinson s regression fwr was used to assess the quality of the different environments with respect to drought impact on the plants we used tuber fresh weight tbw also referred to as yield or tuber yield to implement fwr by subtracting the mean tuber weight of each environment from the overall mean tuber weight of all environments to derive environmental indices finlay and wilkinson 1963 for this we used each year location treatment combination as a separate environment summing up to 14 different environments this revealed the relative quality of each environment environmental indices and the level of drought effects in the various locations giving insights on the locations with higher priority for this study quality in this context describes the extent of the effects of drought stress within a location as well as the effect of other environmental differences between locations on the tuber yield the difference between mean yield under non irrigated and irrigated conditions of a location per year is a measure of the drought stress effect in that particular field trial the fwr was also applied to individual cultivars to observe the responsiveness and stability in yield to drought of the various cultivars in the different locations furthermore based on the outcome of the analyses of variance genotype by environment interactions were investigated using gge bi plots gge bi plots display the partitioning of the genotype main effect g plus gxe interaction effect ge with genotypes as entries to be tested in multi environments testers it gives information on which environment is most representative of others mega environment the best test environment and genotypes that are superior to others in terms of high and stable performance in a mega environment yan and tinker 2006 it uses the singular value decomposition svd and partitioning to decompose g ge effects into principal components represented with bi plots gedif and yigzaw 2014 3 results 3 1 drought effects on yield traits in all field locations in the three years of study of 103 commercial cultivars drought had the most severe effect on tuber fresh weight tbw with the strongest reduction 54 in connantre 2015 fig 1 less reduction in tuber number tbn than in tbw was observed the strongest reduction 14 in tbn occurred in connantre 2014 drought stress did not reduce underwater weight uww we analysed the effects of the environment location and year variations on the drought response of the cultivars using tuber fresh weight 3 2 multi environment characteristics 3 2 1 environmental quality and cultivars responsiveness according to the fwr environmental indices the weakest effect of drought stress was observed in emmeloord 2013 and grolloo 2014 fig 2 in fact the weather data indicated that these trials only had few days between successive rainfalls so these were likely to experience no water limitation data not shown locations of intermediate quality were connantre 2013 and zeeland 2013 2014 the highest level of drought stress relative to the irrigated field was observed in the two connantre trials 2014 2015 the fwr also gave information on the responsiveness and stability of the individual cultivars used in this study the regression equation for each genotype was fitted on the fwr the slope and intercept of the regression lines were extracted for each genotype the slope gives information on how stable or responsive with respect to tuber yield a genotype is across all locations responsive and unstable genotypes have a steep slope 1 with high yields in irrigated and less stressed environments but highly reduced yield in more stressed fields a less steep slope is attributed to a more stable genotype that is less responsive to changing conditions the intercept is a measure of the relative performance of the genotype across all environments of irrigated and non irrigated treatments thus the fwr outcome for each genotype presents its tuber yield average across all environments both irrigated and non irrigated a comparison of three genotypes lady lenora mondial and adora with contrasting features is shown in fig 3 a lady lenora had the lowest slope and was therefore the genotype with the most stable tuber yield mondial had the highest intercept with a large difference in tuber yield between irrigated and non irrigated treatments and adora had the lowest relative tuber yield the lowest intercept a scatter plot of all intercepts vs slopes from the fwr of all genotypes shows that there was a positive correlation between intercept relative performance and slope responsiveness across environments towards less stress and instability fig 3b the figure was divided in 4 quadrants and different maturity types were not equally distributed over the quadrants quadrant ι contains 13 genotypes with slope 1 and intercept 0 that were quite stable across all locations both irrigated and non irrigated and higher than overall average in tuber yield the genotypes in this quadrant include five late maturity types 50 of all late maturity types three intermediate maturity types 7 of all intermediate maturity types and five early maturity types 10 of all early maturity types quadrant ιι contains 38 genotypes with slope 1 and intercept 0 that have a low stability across locations but with higher performance than the overall average these include three late maturity types 30 of all late maturity types 27 intermediate maturity types 61 of all intermediate maturity types and eight early maturity types 17 of all early maturity types quadrant ιιι contains 41 genotypes that have slope 1 and intercept 0 and are quite stable across locations but are lower than overall average in yield these include two late maturity types 20 of all late maturity types 13 intermediate maturity types 32 of all intermediate maturity types and 27 early maturity types 57 of all early maturity types quadrant ιv has slope 1 and intercept 0 contains 9 unstable and lower than average yielding genotypes with no late maturity type two intermediate maturity types 4 5 of all intermediate types and seven early maturity types 15 of all early maturity types 3 2 2 genotype by environment interaction in order to incorporate the genotypic effect of drought tolerance as a factor and still account for the contribution of location and year to the variation in our dataset drought tolerance expressed as percentage tuber weight under stress tuber weight under irrigation 100 was used for an anova high percentages imply drought tolerance significant effects of genotype location and year were observed table 1 also we observed significant interactions between location and year and between genotype and location location and genotype by location interaction had the highest contribution to the non random total variation sum of squares 37 92 and 22 41 respectively therefore we further investigated genotype by environment gxe interaction this was done using gge bi plot analysis gedif and yigzaw 2014 yan and tinker 2006 3 2 3 genotypic drought response in mega environments the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 of the gge bi plots using all year location combinations accounted for 42 of the gge variation fig 4 a b the different years of both the connantre and zeeland trials show a similar effect on drought tolerance fig 4a but the level of variation differed between years for each location confirming that year effect was significant table 1 the gge bi plot did not capture most of the variation in the dataset due to the huge differences in environmental quality as seen from the fwr in section 3 2 1 fig 2 therefore we used the mega environment option to structure the dataset into groups of similar drought severity this resulted in five mega environments fig 4b we used the mega environments with highest consensus connantre 2014 2015 and zeeland 2013 2014 to re compute the gge plot yan and tinker 2006 these year location combinations also showed the strongest yield quality difference between drought and irrigated fields in the fwr fig 2 in section 3 2 1 gge bi plot analysis of this subset resulted in 57 15 variation explained between these two locations and years based on pc1 and pc2 fig 4c the selection of genotypes out of our genotype set for cultivation in north western europe and similar climates with respect to yield maintenance under drought can be based on these two mega environments we used the gge ranking bi plot to evaluate the genotype mean drought tolerance and stability for these two mega environments fig 4c in the ranking bi plot fig 4c the average environment axis aea arrow direction indicates higher drought tolerance across environments and genotypes close to aea line are more stable in their drought response across environments genotypes with high drought tolerance in zeeland 2013 2014 and connantre 2014 2015 included musica e73 valiant l98 and karnico l42 fig 4c in the fwr based on yield valiant and karnico clustered in quadrant i fig 3b and were identified as cultivars with stable and high yield the gge bi plots presented karnico as a better choice than valiant with respect to stability in drought tolerance based on its close proximity to the aea line fig 4c therefore with the gge bi plots we were able to better identify stable best performing drought tolerant genotypes among genotypes of high yield performance an example of a genotype that was drought sensitive across environments is adora e2 fig 4c adora was identified as a stable low yielding cultivar clustering in quadrant iii of the fwr fig 3b in summary genotype and environment had a significant contribution to the variation in our dataset and employing both fwr and gge enabled us to explore these 3 3 drought effects on tuber growth tuber fresh weight is the yield trait that was the most drought affected in our trials fig 5 a d shows the differences in tuber number distribution over the different size classes in response to drought particularly in the connantre trials the other location year combinations with only minor or no water limitation had a similar pattern of tuber size distribution under irrigated conditions with no effect of drought fig 5d in connantre each year had a unique pattern of tuber size distribution in 2013 drought caused a small shift to smaller tubers 0 40 mm at the expense of 50 60 mm size class fig 5a in 2014 the 40 50 mm size class was more abundant under stress while the larger size classes had reductions in tuber number fig 5b the 2015 tuber size distributions showed a more severe effect fig 5c the smallest size class was highly represented while the largest size class was absent these differences in drought response between the years are likely caused by different timing and severity of drought in each year similarly in terms of tuber weight per size class there was no reduction in the various size classes in emmeloord reductions in higher size classes were observed in zeeland and even more severe reductions in connantre especially in 2014 and 2015 supplementary fig s1 again indicative of the higher level of drought stress in these years at this location interestingly foliage maturity type differences among the cultivars had little effect on tuber size distribution in our dataset so drought similarly affected tuber number and tuber weight distribution across various tuber size classes with less tubers of large sizes in more severe drought conditions 3 4 drought stress at connantre the yield in connantre in 2014 2015 was strongly reduced by drought but the drought had a differential effect on the tuber number and tuber fresh weight the differences between the two years were further examined using the extensive weather data for these year location combinations this included rainfall temperature relative humidity and radiation supplementary fig s2 the most obvious difference is that the total rainfall and mean relative humidity in 2015 during the potato growing season may august were less than in 2014 supplementary fig s2 with only minor differences in mean temperature and radiation confirming that the drought severity was different between the two years the higher drought stress in 2015 was reflected in more severely reduced tuber fresh weight in 2015 compared to 2014 fig 1 in section 3 1 however total tuber number was affected more in 2014 than in 2015 there were differences in drought timing between the two years in 2015 drought set in later in the growing season and may have affected tuber bulking more than tuber formation while the early drought in 2014 may have delayed formation of new tubers in order to better understand how the rainfall pattern may have affected the eventual yield the canopy data was analysed alongside available rainfall irrigation information fig 6 3 4 1 drought impact on canopy growth two clearly different patterns of canopy growth were observed in 2014 and 2015 at connantre fig 6 canopy cover was reduced at an early stage in 2014 fig 6a coinciding with drought at an early stage of the growth cycle as indicated in the rainfall information for 2014 fig 6c little rain had fallen during early stages of growth from emergence till 30 thermal days after emergence ninety percent of the total amount of rainfall occurred after day 30 this early drought most likely caused the delay in increase of canopy growth rate fig 6a later on in the season when the rainfall became more frequent and water availability increased the canopy growth rate increased until maximum canopy cover fig 6a c the irrigated genotypes reached maximum canopy cover earlier than the stressed genotypes in 2015 canopy cover was reduced at later growth stages under non irrigated conditions fig 6b the rainfall information for 2015 fig 6d showed that 62 6 of rain fell before 32 thermal days as a result of this the canopy growth was not reduced until this stage however after this a drought spell affected the plants from 34 till 58 thermal days the low water availability in this period most likely resulted in reduction in canopy growth reaching a maximum canopy cover that is only about half of the maximum canopy cover under irrigated conditions genotypes in both irrigated and non irrigated treatments of 2015 reached their maximum canopy cover at the same time and began to senesce at about the same time fig 6b the canopy growth of the 103 cultivars was studied to explore the variation among the commercial cultivars for this a canopy growth curve was fitted using the beta function proposed by khan 2012 with emphasis on the sigmoid phase and the maximum canopy cover phase of growth according to available data this iterative estimation approach resulted in a good fit derivation of the following growth parameters exponential growth rate c m1 time to reach exponential growth rate t m1 maximum canopy cover v max time to reach maximum canopy cover t 1 and area under canopy cover curve a 1 drought stress in both 2014 and 2015 at connantre reduced c m1 a 1 and v max however t m1 and t 1 were longer under drought stress in 2014 whereas in 2015 drought stress did not delay t m1 and t 1 fig 7 for each of these growth parameters a higher standard deviation under stress than control showed that there is considerable variation in canopy growth response to drought among the cultivars it took fewer days t 1 to reach maximum cover v max in 2015 than in 2014 however the canopy area a 1 was larger in 2014 which reflects the effect of the difference in timing of the drought in the growing season bi plots of the growth parameters under irrigated conditions showed an even distribution of cultivars without distinctive groupings whereas under non irrigated conditions the maturity groups could be distinguished supplementary fig s3 the bi plot of the irrigated treatment showed c m1 a 1 and v max contributing similarly to the variation in the dataset along the first principal component axis although v max tended to have a slightly higher impact than a 1 and c m1 parameters t m1 and t 1 had similar effects along pc1 supplementary fig s3 in irrigated conditions cultivars that had longer t m1 and t 1 had less c m1 a 1 and v max and vice versa according to the bi plots the biomass factors c m1 a 1 and v max appeared to be more important drivers for the variation of canopy growth along pc1 than the time factors of canopy growth t m1 and t 1 along pc2 under non irrigated conditions t m1 and t 1 were critical in distinguishing early and late maturity classes most late maturity types had longer t m1 and t 1 under drought than early maturity types thus the tolerant and sensitive late maturity types did not differ much in their t m1 and t 1 supplementary fig s2 on the other hand early maturity types responded differentially to t m1 and t 1 and tolerant versus sensitive early maturity types differed significantly in their t m1 and t 1 supplementary fig s2 3 4 2 correlations between canopy growth parameters and yield spearman s correlations were computed between all canopy growth and yield traits from connantre 2014 and 2015 under irrigated and non irrigated conditions fig 8 foliage maturity was negatively correlated with most traits in both years except time to reach exponential growth in 2014 t m114 under irrigated treatment foliage maturity was scored on a scale of 1 very late maturing to 9 very early according to the scoring scheme of cbsg centre for biosystems genomics the netherlands d hoop et al 2010 tuber fresh weight tbw was more positively correlated with the canopy growth parameters under non irrigated conditions than irrigated however in 2015 there was no difference between irrigated and non irrigated treatments in tuber fresh weight correlation with cm1 in this year 2015 both irrigated and non irrigated treatments showed a similar pattern of canopy progress at the exponential phase of canopy growth see also fig 6b in section 3 4 1 the positive correlations of t m1 and t 1 with tuber weight under stress were much stronger in 2015 than 2014 generally reaching maximum growth rate t m1 took much longer time under non irrigated conditions than under well watered conditions this is reflected in the higher positive correlation coefficients between c m1 and t m1 under drought in both years compared to irrigation fig 8 under irrigated conditions negative correlations existed between tuber number and t m1 however under stress this link between canopy and tuber number was not existent anymore both in 2014 and 2015 the underwater weight correlated more positively with v max c m1 and a 1 under stress than in normal conditions only in 2015 in summary the connantre trials 2014 and 2015 provided a platform to investigate early versus late drought effects on canopy development and tuber yield 4 discussion the development of potato canopy growth during drought has not yet been studied in detail logically it can easily be assumed that fast establishment of exponential growth rate and maximum canopy cover are advantageous for productivity our findings however suggest a deviation from this assumption under stress conditions and can justify the statement in struik and wiersema 1999 that fastest overall development is not necessarily associated with the highest yields we discuss these findings and give the practical implications for drought tolerance breeding in potato 4 1 drought effects on canopy growth and yield the field trials at connantre in 2014 and 2015 had the highest yield contrast between irrigated and non irrigated blocks and were used for a comparative analysis of the drought response early drought in the growing season of 2014 reduced the progress of canopy growth and coincided with tuber initiation fig 6a leading to a reduction in tuber number and tuber yield the early drought reduction effects on tuber number in our study is contrary to the report of no effect or increase in tuber number in haverkort et al 1990 the contrast between these two studies may be due to the different sets of genotypes studied but also possible differences in drought severity in 2015 the drought in the connantre trial set in later and reduced maximum canopy cover fig 6b and tuber bulking but also tuber number in martin et al 1992 both early and late drought reduced tuber number in russet burbank and in particular a more severe early drought reduced tuber number more than mild early drought and late drought in our study the late drought in 2015 exposed the potato cultivars to a more severe stress than the early drought in 2014 supplementary fig s2 according to haverkort and goudriaan 1994 late droughts occurring during the tuber bulking phase of plant development have more effect on tuber yield because of increased crop transpiration reduced formation of new leaves and likely premature leaf shedding at this stage the plants in our 2015 experiment may have been penalized for the strong growth with optimal water availability at the early canopy expanding stages before the drought started nevertheless the canopy growth parameters maximum canopy cover v max exponential growth rate c m1 and area under canopy cover curve a 1 were all reduced by drought in both years maximum canopy cover was more severely reduced in 2015 than in 2014 indicating that the late drought was more devastating for maximum light interception fig 7 maximum canopy cover percentage is a determinant factor for the amount of light interception which affects the photosynthetic capacity of plants and tuber bulking in potato barreda et al 1996 li 2012 navarre and pavek 2014 steyn et al 2007 our results in section 3 1 showed that tuber weight was more severely reduced in 2015 than 2014 at connantre fig 1 this may be attributed to reduced tuber bulking resulting from reduced photosynthetic capacity of the canopy in 2015 under drought fig 6b li et al 2016 have demonstrated in potted plants of cv atlantic that limited water resource can reduce potato yield by affecting the net photosynthetic rates of the source canopy tissues in our connantre 2014 trial there was a delay in time to reach exponential growth t m1 and time to reach maximum canopy cover under drought t 1 while in 2015 these were shorter compared to control conditions fig 7 this hastened effect on canopy growth rate and time to establish full canopy cover did however not seem to contribute to tuber bulking as much as the reduced photosynthetic capacity of the canopy in 2015 at the build up phase of canopy growth the critical yield determining parameter is tuber initiation which may be reflected in tuber number at harvest however there were no significant correlations of tuber number with the canopy growth traits under drought stress it should be noted that tuber number was only scored at the end of the growing season tuber formation may have been arrested when the early drought occurred and reinitiated later in the growth season this effect of drought on tuberisation would thus not be reflected in tuber number at the time of harvest the strong correlation of higher tuber weight with delayed attainment of exponential growth and maximum canopy cover t m1 and t 1 under stress in 2015 fig 8d suggests that the maintenance of tuber yield under drought would require the plants to balance investment in exponential growth and maximum canopy cover with tuber bulking previous research has demonstrated that partitioning of assimilates to tubers can influence foliage earliness and longevity kooman and rabbinge 1996 also marcelis 1996 illustrated in a model that when resources are limited the sink organ with a lower km value higher affinity for assimilates attracts more assimilates the delay in attainment of canopy exponential growth as seen in connantre 2014 fig 7 may therefore be a trade off due to an adaptive mechanism under drought to facilitate or resulting from continued formation and bulking of tubers the canopy growth parameters may be categorized into two groups biomass based growth parameters maximum canopy cover v max exponential growth rate c m1 area under the canopy curve a 1 and time based growth parameters time to reach exponential growth rate t m1 and time to reach maximum canopy cover t 1 under irrigated conditions the biomass based growth parameters and the time based growth parameters of the cultivars were differentially affected supplementary fig s3 this indicates that under favourable conditions of growth commercial potato cultivars may have varying capacities for canopy biomass production also the variations in time based growth parameters under normal conditions may reflect the differences in foliage maturity types found in our dataset in fact we observed a negative correlation of maturity with most of the traits in both treatments in the connantre trials fig 8 the correlations suggest that cultivars of the late maturity type tended to have higher canopy growth area a 1 maximum canopy cover v max and yield than early maturity types similarly in another study on cultivated potato nitrogen n use ospina et al 2014 reported that late maturing potato cultivars had higher canopy growth area a uc and tuber yield than early maturing ones though the effect of maturity became weaker when n availability was limited under drought all growth parameters contributed similarly along pc1 to drought response variation among the cultivars supplementary fig s3 in the late drought scenario connantre 2015 the time based growth parameters t m1 and t 1 were significantly higher in late maturing cultivars than the early maturing ones under drought this suggests that the late drought delayed the canopy progress more in late maturing cultivars this delay seemed to be advantageous for yield of the late maturing cultivars according to tuber fresh weight correlations with maturity fig 8c d under low nitrogen availability in the experiments of ospina et al 2014 delayed attainment of maximum canopy growth also correlated positively with an increased area under the canopy curve and tuber yield the late maturity types in that study were delayed in attainment of maximum canopy cover t 1 compared the early maturity types the timing of the stress seems to differentially affect maturity classes because in our early drought trial of 2014 there were no correlations between maturity and time to attain maximum canopy cover fig 8a b the early drought spanned critical points in potato phenology at which the early maturing cultivars already had maximum canopy cover while the canopy of the late cultivars was still expanding zaag 1992 suggested that both foliage maturity type and water availability determine the length of the crop growth cycle our results give insight on how these factors maturity drought length of growth cycle interact in determining tuber yield it should be noted that the lower yield of the early maturity types compared to the late maturity types may also be caused by differences in water use the transpirational demands of the fully expanded canopy in early maturity types may have depleted the limited soil water more quickly with a stronger effect on tuber bulking and thus yield than the late maturing types 4 2 genotype by environment interaction cultivars grown under rain fed conditions comparable to environments in this study would ideally have a combination of high yield potential with yield stability under drought stress across locations we identified high yielding cultivars with relatively higher stability across different environments these include liseta karnico orchestra lady olympia altus labadia lady sara hermes kondor avano valiant fontane and kuras quadrant i of fig 3b cultivars in this quadrant represent the three maturity types used in the study but the late maturity types had a higher relative representation in this quadrant based on the representation of late maturing cultivars in quadrant i of fig 3b and their relative ability to balance drought effects on their canopy growth and tuber yield late maturity may be an advantageous characteristic for cultivation under water limited conditions yet a careful consideration of the timing of drought or drought severity in the location of interest is essential for the choice of selection environments in drought tolerance breeding programs these environmental factors are likely to fluctuate even more in the coming years due to climate change dai 2011 4 3 tuberisation under drought our results clearly show that canopy development is affected by drought and that the reduced light interception assimilate production and transport are likely to affect tuber yield another important factor to consider is the effect of drought on tuberisation reduced tuber formation will have a strong effect on tuber yield as well several studies reported on drought stress effects on tuberisation as inferred from tuber number hirut et al 2017 stalham et al 2007 ouiam et al 2003 schafleitner et al 2007 but there is no agreement on the direction of the effect positive or negative therefore there is need to further understand how drought interferes with tuberisation gong et al 2015 in this study we attempted to address the effect of drought on tuberisation by quantifying the effect on tuber size distribution yield reduction under drought was the result of lower number of tubers as well as a reduced average weight of the tubers produced fig 5 the extent of these effects appeared to be dependent on the drought stress level perceived by the plants and or the timing of the drought among other environmental factors fig 2 the drought stress that reduces tuber bulking may not necessarily affect differentiation of stolons into young tubers in connantre 2015 the number of small tubers increased under drought at the expense of larger sized tubers fig 5c and this was also reflected in the tuber weight distribution over tuber size classes supplementary fig s1 there may be two possible explanations for this observation the bulking of the tubers was affected but tuberisation was not arrested or tuberisation was arrested by the drought early in the season and the higher number of small tubers were formed late in the growing season with little time left for bulking it was previously reported that drought stress limits tuber size due to late stolon and tuber formation struik and van voorst 1986 a separation of the tuber size data into the different maturity classes also shows some slight modifications in response as a result of maturity differences data not shown however our results do not allow clear distinction between effects on tuberisation and tuber bulking a dedicated experiment with intermediate assessments of tuber formation and yield may be more informative and a dedicated molecular investigation is recommended for further understanding of the underlying mechanisms of drought interference with tuberisation 4 4 conclusions field cultivated potato plants are often vulnerable to drought stress during the growing season which heavily impacts canopy development and eventual tuber yield in order to minimize the reductions in tuber yield during drought potato plants need to balance their canopy growth with tuber growth our findings show that one of the ways the plants could do this is by delaying their attainment of fast exponential canopy growth rate and maximum canopy cover generally late maturity genotypes were more capable of moderating their canopy development to favour tuber growth under drought breeding for drought tolerance would benefit from incorporating these findings as further work is required in understanding the genetic basis of canopy growth rate modulation under drought funding this work was supported by the topsector tki of the

11408,potato is an important food crop with high yields however when exposed to drought it suffers major yield losses considering its global importance and the increasing incidence of drought due to climate change research toward drought tolerance in potato remains imperative we have studied a set of 103 commercial cultivars representing the genetic diversity in the european potato market the cultivars were grown in different field locations in three subsequent years 2013 2015 our aim was to understand how different field drought regimes affect canopy growth in potato and how these effects translate to tuber yield the field environmental conditions were monitored and pictures of canopy ground cover during the growing season were taken canopy growth parameters were extracted by an iterative method using the beta sigmoid growth function to model canopy growth at harvest tuber yield was scored and tuber size was graded the gge genotype and genotype by environment bi plot and finlay wilkinson s regression were used to investigate genotype x environment interactions we observed that the timing of the drought occurrence differentially affected canopy growth and tuber yield under drought stress fast attainment of exponential growth and maximum canopy cover had negative effects on tuber formation and tuber bulking growth rate maximum canopy cover and area under the canopy curve photosynthetic capacity over the growth season were more important for tuber bulking than they were for tuber formation under drought stress cultivars with high yield were identified as potential material for improvement to drought tolerance these findings will contribute to the breeding for drought tolerant potato amidst the threats of climate change keywords irrigation rainfall stress auc maturity 1 introduction climate change negatively impacts agricultural production especially in marginal regions with limited inputs like fresh water the negative effects of water limitation on crop yield are critical for drought sensitive crops of high importance for food production and security like potato potato is the world s 3rd most important food crop and its production in the developing world has increased in the last two decades demonstrating its important contribution to food security acton 2013 the global production of potato is estimated at 377 million tonnes in about 19 million hectares faostat 2016 when compared to grain producing crops a hectare of potato can yield about two to four fold more calories cip 2013 potato is known for its efficiency in water usage shahnazari et al 2007 vreugdenhil et al 2007 in comparison with other major crops potato produces the highest amount of calories per unit water input and it is seven times more efficient than some cereals like wheat maize etc cip 2013 fao 2008 however potato is generally drought sensitive schafleitner et al 2008 with losses in yield that can reach 79 reduction if water requirements are not met binod et al 2015 the palmer drought severity index predicts a widespread drought in many regions of the globe including europe in the next 30 90 years arising from reduced rainfall and or increased evaporation dai 2013 the drought sensitivity of potato may be attributed to the stress effects on its foliage characteristics deblonde and ledent 2001 schittenhelm et al 2006 soltys kalina et al 2016 romero et al 2017 and its shallow root system van loon 1981 yamaguchi and tanaka 1990 iwama et al 1993 opena and porter 1999 stalham et al 2007 zarzyńska et al 2017 that make water uptake inefficient luisa et al 1997 in comparison with many other crops leaf stomatal closure occurs in potato at relatively low soil moisture deficits perceived by the roots sadras and milroy 1996 this leads to a significant drop in transpiration even before significant reduction in leaf water potential occurs liu et al 2005 stomatal closure at relatively high leaf water potential 0 4 mpa and 0 6 mpa may already limit photosynthesis with reduced production of assimilates and canopy growth and a resultant drop in tuber yield and quality luisa et al 1997 therefore the drought response in potato and possibly tolerance may be closely linked to a bias free quantification of the progress of canopy growth bojacá et al 2011 many techniques have been developed to facilitate the monitoring of canopy growth these include the grid system that measures ground area covered near infrared reflectance which measures interception of solar radiation picture image capture of canopy cover and image analysis and remote sensing using satellite data bojacá et al 2011 bouman et al 1992 korva 1996 prashar and jones 2014 sivarajan 2011 in addition to monitoring canopy growth as described above accurate quantification extraction and interpretation of canopy growth parameters will give deeper insight into the traits of interest for crop improvement chen et al 2014 potato canopy growth has been described by several authors using growth models of good fit to show the progress of canopy from emergence towards senescence khan 2012 ospina et al 2014 under drought conditions several growth measurements in field grown potato have been reported which have enhanced our understanding on how to manage different drought regimes in the field jefferies and mackerron 1993 mackerron et al 1988 ouiam et al 2003 shiri et al 2009 steyn et al 2007 the modelling of potato growth under drought however still requires more research to understand canopy cover dynamics moreover due to the difficulties in managing field experiments potato field drought reports are often based on only a few genotypes this challenges the generalization of conclusions from such field reports percentage ground cover by canopy is known as a good measure of intercepted solar radiation in potato which is also reflected in dry matter production haverkort et al 1991 lemaga and caesar 1990 vreugdenhil et al 2011 interception of solar radiation is reduced under drought conditions depending on the severity of the stress due to reduced leaf expansion and reduction in total number of leaves harris 2012 potato canopy growth has been described in three phases including the build up phase maximum canopy cover phase and decline or senescence phase khan 2012 the build up phase includes the period from emergence till full canopy cover and this often coincides with tuber initiation stage of the plant haverkort and mackerron 1995 the maximum canopy cover and decline phases are periods during which the tubers have to be filled with assimilates bulking the duration of these phases depend on the tuber growth rate and foliage maturity class of the potato genotype haverkort and mackerron 1995 potato genotypes that invest a major part of their life cycle in canopy growth late maturity genotypes can intercept about 700 mj m2 zaag 1992 while early maturity potato genotypes start investing photosynthetic assimilates in their tubers much earlier and thus complete their life cycle early kooman and rabbinge 1996 these differences in genotype and maturity type imply different effects of canopy cover on yield our study is the first to investigate these canopy cover effects on potato yield using an extensive set of genotypes representing different foliage maturity types under field drought conditions in different environments potato yield is the resultant of the number of tubers formed and the volume weight and size of the tubers deblonde and ledent 2001 reported that tuber number was reduced under drought which was compensated by a higher tuber dry weight some reports indicate that drought causes more reduction in tuber weight than tuber number binod et al 2015 but this may be highly dependent on genotypic differences and timing of the drought partitioning of assimilates to tubers for tuber formation as well as bulking and the interaction between these processes may be important for drought tolerance improvement of potato in this study we have evaluated the growth and yield of 103 potato cultivars in three different locations in three years the aim was to investigate the genotypic variation of the drought response in cultivated potato with respect to canopy growth and yield under field conditions our objectives were to understand i how the timing of drought in the growing season affects potato growth and yield in the field ii which canopy growth characteristics are critical for potato tuber yield under drought in the field iii the stability of drought tolerance of potato cultivars across locations and in different years iv which aspects of yield are adversely affected in the field during drought 2 materials and methods 2 1 field location and planting a selection of 103 commercial potato cultivars with different genetic backgrounds and foliage maturity classes early intermediate and late were used in this study supplementary table 1 the cultivars are part of the european potato gene pool used by d hoop et al 2010 for genome wide association studies field trials were conducted in partnership with four potato breeding companies hzpc holland bv c meijer kws potato and averis seeds tubers used for the trials of each year were multiplied in the previous year at a single breeding station ensuring uniformity of seed tuber conditions a split plot design was used for each of the trials in three consecutive years 2013 2014 and 2015 with irrigation levels assigned in the main plots as blocks and genotypes assigned in subplots the fields were located in connantre france 48 7258 n 3 9219 e from 2013 to 2015 and in the netherlands zeeland 51 5667 n 3 7500 e in 2013 and 2014 emmeloord 52 7097 n 5 7508 e in 2013 and grolloo 52 9305 n 6 6943 e in 2014 the field structure in each location and year included two blocks irrigated ir and non irrigated ni treatments in each block the cultivars were randomized as sub plots within the blocks each subplot experimental unit had eight plants of a single cultivar in two rows four plants per row the spacing between plants in a row was 30 cm and 70 cm between rows border plants were planted in between subplots of each row the rows were set on ridges the tubers were planted in april 2013 at connantre zeeland and emmeloord april 2014 at connantre and zeeland and may 2014 at grolloo and april 2015 at connantre the plants remained in the field until harvest at the beginning of fall in the respective locations and years environmental conditions of rainfall temperature aerial and soil radiation relative humidity wind speed and wind direction were monitored at the connantre field in 2014 and 2015 using facilities provided by dacom b v environmental data from nearby weather stations were used for the other trials the control blocks were irrigated weekly during periods of the drought less rainfall e g fig 6d 2 2 phenotyping and data collection potato tubers germinated within three weeks of planting the emergence date was recorded as days after planting when more than half of the plants per plot had germinated canopy ground cover was monitored by taking pictures of each plot weekly with a sony dsc w610 digital camera to infer canopy growth the camera was mounted on a rectangular frame at a specific height from the frame throughout the trial and the frame was positioned just above the canopy the dimension of the rectangular frame was set to capture the inner two plants of each plot plant height was scored within a month from emergence using the highest apex of each plot at harvest various yield traits were measured including tuber fresh weight tbw tuber number tbn underwater weight uww dry matter percentage dmp only in connantre and tuber quality by visual impression a sample of 5 05 kg of harvested tubers per plot was used to measure uww the 5 05 kg was lowered in water and the weight under water measured according to eu direction https webgate ec europa eu agriportal angebleu pdf download docnum 32009r0571 lg en uww is used to infer dry matter and starch content of tubers haase 2003 a smart grader system was employed to grade the tubers into size classes as follows 0 40 mm 40 50 mm 50 60 mm 60 70 mm and 70 mm this enabled us to score tuber number and tuber fresh weight per size class 2 3 data processing we transformed the calendar days after emergence of the plants into thermal days in beta thermal time btt td according to khan 2012 ospina et al 2014 and hurtado lopez et al 2015 to account for differences in the effects of temperature on crop development in various years and locations we accounted for this non linear relationship between temperature t and growth rate g t according to the equation g t t c t t c t o t t b t o t b to tb tc to c t described in yin et al 1995 using base temperature t b 5 5 c optimal temperature t o 23 4 c ceiling temperature t c 34 6 c temperature response curvature coefficient c t 1 6 and daily mean temperature t thus the btt td for a given day is the accumulated g t from emergence up until that day we processed the canopy pictures in matlabr software r2013a version with dipimage toolbox using an algorithm as in ospina et al 2014 the percentage canopy cover output from matlab was used to fit a canopy growth model according to the sigmoid phase of the beta function for determinate growth as described by khan 2012 this model was fitted using the iterative non linear least square regression method implemented in the proc nlin package of the sas software sas institute inc 2015 from the fitted model canopy growth parameters were extracted including exponential growth rate c m1 time to reach exponential growth rate t m1 maximum canopy cover v max time to reach maximum canopy cover t 1 and area under canopy cover a 1 2 4 statistical analysis the data from the yield traits was analysed using genstat 17th edition our aim was to test for the significance of multi factorial effects on drought tolerance in our dataset these factors include genotype location and year effects and their interaction effects we used a threshold level of significance of 0 05 multivariate bi plots were used to observe trait interactions and their contributions to the principal components for this the traits were visualized as vectors showing their respective effects on the variations observed in the dataset furthermore the spearman s correlation coefficients between each of the traits were computed in rstudio 3 2 3 to show specific trait to trait relationships 2 5 performance and stability analysis finlay wilkinson s regression fwr was used to assess the quality of the different environments with respect to drought impact on the plants we used tuber fresh weight tbw also referred to as yield or tuber yield to implement fwr by subtracting the mean tuber weight of each environment from the overall mean tuber weight of all environments to derive environmental indices finlay and wilkinson 1963 for this we used each year location treatment combination as a separate environment summing up to 14 different environments this revealed the relative quality of each environment environmental indices and the level of drought effects in the various locations giving insights on the locations with higher priority for this study quality in this context describes the extent of the effects of drought stress within a location as well as the effect of other environmental differences between locations on the tuber yield the difference between mean yield under non irrigated and irrigated conditions of a location per year is a measure of the drought stress effect in that particular field trial the fwr was also applied to individual cultivars to observe the responsiveness and stability in yield to drought of the various cultivars in the different locations furthermore based on the outcome of the analyses of variance genotype by environment interactions were investigated using gge bi plots gge bi plots display the partitioning of the genotype main effect g plus gxe interaction effect ge with genotypes as entries to be tested in multi environments testers it gives information on which environment is most representative of others mega environment the best test environment and genotypes that are superior to others in terms of high and stable performance in a mega environment yan and tinker 2006 it uses the singular value decomposition svd and partitioning to decompose g ge effects into principal components represented with bi plots gedif and yigzaw 2014 3 results 3 1 drought effects on yield traits in all field locations in the three years of study of 103 commercial cultivars drought had the most severe effect on tuber fresh weight tbw with the strongest reduction 54 in connantre 2015 fig 1 less reduction in tuber number tbn than in tbw was observed the strongest reduction 14 in tbn occurred in connantre 2014 drought stress did not reduce underwater weight uww we analysed the effects of the environment location and year variations on the drought response of the cultivars using tuber fresh weight 3 2 multi environment characteristics 3 2 1 environmental quality and cultivars responsiveness according to the fwr environmental indices the weakest effect of drought stress was observed in emmeloord 2013 and grolloo 2014 fig 2 in fact the weather data indicated that these trials only had few days between successive rainfalls so these were likely to experience no water limitation data not shown locations of intermediate quality were connantre 2013 and zeeland 2013 2014 the highest level of drought stress relative to the irrigated field was observed in the two connantre trials 2014 2015 the fwr also gave information on the responsiveness and stability of the individual cultivars used in this study the regression equation for each genotype was fitted on the fwr the slope and intercept of the regression lines were extracted for each genotype the slope gives information on how stable or responsive with respect to tuber yield a genotype is across all locations responsive and unstable genotypes have a steep slope 1 with high yields in irrigated and less stressed environments but highly reduced yield in more stressed fields a less steep slope is attributed to a more stable genotype that is less responsive to changing conditions the intercept is a measure of the relative performance of the genotype across all environments of irrigated and non irrigated treatments thus the fwr outcome for each genotype presents its tuber yield average across all environments both irrigated and non irrigated a comparison of three genotypes lady lenora mondial and adora with contrasting features is shown in fig 3 a lady lenora had the lowest slope and was therefore the genotype with the most stable tuber yield mondial had the highest intercept with a large difference in tuber yield between irrigated and non irrigated treatments and adora had the lowest relative tuber yield the lowest intercept a scatter plot of all intercepts vs slopes from the fwr of all genotypes shows that there was a positive correlation between intercept relative performance and slope responsiveness across environments towards less stress and instability fig 3b the figure was divided in 4 quadrants and different maturity types were not equally distributed over the quadrants quadrant ι contains 13 genotypes with slope 1 and intercept 0 that were quite stable across all locations both irrigated and non irrigated and higher than overall average in tuber yield the genotypes in this quadrant include five late maturity types 50 of all late maturity types three intermediate maturity types 7 of all intermediate maturity types and five early maturity types 10 of all early maturity types quadrant ιι contains 38 genotypes with slope 1 and intercept 0 that have a low stability across locations but with higher performance than the overall average these include three late maturity types 30 of all late maturity types 27 intermediate maturity types 61 of all intermediate maturity types and eight early maturity types 17 of all early maturity types quadrant ιιι contains 41 genotypes that have slope 1 and intercept 0 and are quite stable across locations but are lower than overall average in yield these include two late maturity types 20 of all late maturity types 13 intermediate maturity types 32 of all intermediate maturity types and 27 early maturity types 57 of all early maturity types quadrant ιv has slope 1 and intercept 0 contains 9 unstable and lower than average yielding genotypes with no late maturity type two intermediate maturity types 4 5 of all intermediate types and seven early maturity types 15 of all early maturity types 3 2 2 genotype by environment interaction in order to incorporate the genotypic effect of drought tolerance as a factor and still account for the contribution of location and year to the variation in our dataset drought tolerance expressed as percentage tuber weight under stress tuber weight under irrigation 100 was used for an anova high percentages imply drought tolerance significant effects of genotype location and year were observed table 1 also we observed significant interactions between location and year and between genotype and location location and genotype by location interaction had the highest contribution to the non random total variation sum of squares 37 92 and 22 41 respectively therefore we further investigated genotype by environment gxe interaction this was done using gge bi plot analysis gedif and yigzaw 2014 yan and tinker 2006 3 2 3 genotypic drought response in mega environments the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 of the gge bi plots using all year location combinations accounted for 42 of the gge variation fig 4 a b the different years of both the connantre and zeeland trials show a similar effect on drought tolerance fig 4a but the level of variation differed between years for each location confirming that year effect was significant table 1 the gge bi plot did not capture most of the variation in the dataset due to the huge differences in environmental quality as seen from the fwr in section 3 2 1 fig 2 therefore we used the mega environment option to structure the dataset into groups of similar drought severity this resulted in five mega environments fig 4b we used the mega environments with highest consensus connantre 2014 2015 and zeeland 2013 2014 to re compute the gge plot yan and tinker 2006 these year location combinations also showed the strongest yield quality difference between drought and irrigated fields in the fwr fig 2 in section 3 2 1 gge bi plot analysis of this subset resulted in 57 15 variation explained between these two locations and years based on pc1 and pc2 fig 4c the selection of genotypes out of our genotype set for cultivation in north western europe and similar climates with respect to yield maintenance under drought can be based on these two mega environments we used the gge ranking bi plot to evaluate the genotype mean drought tolerance and stability for these two mega environments fig 4c in the ranking bi plot fig 4c the average environment axis aea arrow direction indicates higher drought tolerance across environments and genotypes close to aea line are more stable in their drought response across environments genotypes with high drought tolerance in zeeland 2013 2014 and connantre 2014 2015 included musica e73 valiant l98 and karnico l42 fig 4c in the fwr based on yield valiant and karnico clustered in quadrant i fig 3b and were identified as cultivars with stable and high yield the gge bi plots presented karnico as a better choice than valiant with respect to stability in drought tolerance based on its close proximity to the aea line fig 4c therefore with the gge bi plots we were able to better identify stable best performing drought tolerant genotypes among genotypes of high yield performance an example of a genotype that was drought sensitive across environments is adora e2 fig 4c adora was identified as a stable low yielding cultivar clustering in quadrant iii of the fwr fig 3b in summary genotype and environment had a significant contribution to the variation in our dataset and employing both fwr and gge enabled us to explore these 3 3 drought effects on tuber growth tuber fresh weight is the yield trait that was the most drought affected in our trials fig 5 a d shows the differences in tuber number distribution over the different size classes in response to drought particularly in the connantre trials the other location year combinations with only minor or no water limitation had a similar pattern of tuber size distribution under irrigated conditions with no effect of drought fig 5d in connantre each year had a unique pattern of tuber size distribution in 2013 drought caused a small shift to smaller tubers 0 40 mm at the expense of 50 60 mm size class fig 5a in 2014 the 40 50 mm size class was more abundant under stress while the larger size classes had reductions in tuber number fig 5b the 2015 tuber size distributions showed a more severe effect fig 5c the smallest size class was highly represented while the largest size class was absent these differences in drought response between the years are likely caused by different timing and severity of drought in each year similarly in terms of tuber weight per size class there was no reduction in the various size classes in emmeloord reductions in higher size classes were observed in zeeland and even more severe reductions in connantre especially in 2014 and 2015 supplementary fig s1 again indicative of the higher level of drought stress in these years at this location interestingly foliage maturity type differences among the cultivars had little effect on tuber size distribution in our dataset so drought similarly affected tuber number and tuber weight distribution across various tuber size classes with less tubers of large sizes in more severe drought conditions 3 4 drought stress at connantre the yield in connantre in 2014 2015 was strongly reduced by drought but the drought had a differential effect on the tuber number and tuber fresh weight the differences between the two years were further examined using the extensive weather data for these year location combinations this included rainfall temperature relative humidity and radiation supplementary fig s2 the most obvious difference is that the total rainfall and mean relative humidity in 2015 during the potato growing season may august were less than in 2014 supplementary fig s2 with only minor differences in mean temperature and radiation confirming that the drought severity was different between the two years the higher drought stress in 2015 was reflected in more severely reduced tuber fresh weight in 2015 compared to 2014 fig 1 in section 3 1 however total tuber number was affected more in 2014 than in 2015 there were differences in drought timing between the two years in 2015 drought set in later in the growing season and may have affected tuber bulking more than tuber formation while the early drought in 2014 may have delayed formation of new tubers in order to better understand how the rainfall pattern may have affected the eventual yield the canopy data was analysed alongside available rainfall irrigation information fig 6 3 4 1 drought impact on canopy growth two clearly different patterns of canopy growth were observed in 2014 and 2015 at connantre fig 6 canopy cover was reduced at an early stage in 2014 fig 6a coinciding with drought at an early stage of the growth cycle as indicated in the rainfall information for 2014 fig 6c little rain had fallen during early stages of growth from emergence till 30 thermal days after emergence ninety percent of the total amount of rainfall occurred after day 30 this early drought most likely caused the delay in increase of canopy growth rate fig 6a later on in the season when the rainfall became more frequent and water availability increased the canopy growth rate increased until maximum canopy cover fig 6a c the irrigated genotypes reached maximum canopy cover earlier than the stressed genotypes in 2015 canopy cover was reduced at later growth stages under non irrigated conditions fig 6b the rainfall information for 2015 fig 6d showed that 62 6 of rain fell before 32 thermal days as a result of this the canopy growth was not reduced until this stage however after this a drought spell affected the plants from 34 till 58 thermal days the low water availability in this period most likely resulted in reduction in canopy growth reaching a maximum canopy cover that is only about half of the maximum canopy cover under irrigated conditions genotypes in both irrigated and non irrigated treatments of 2015 reached their maximum canopy cover at the same time and began to senesce at about the same time fig 6b the canopy growth of the 103 cultivars was studied to explore the variation among the commercial cultivars for this a canopy growth curve was fitted using the beta function proposed by khan 2012 with emphasis on the sigmoid phase and the maximum canopy cover phase of growth according to available data this iterative estimation approach resulted in a good fit derivation of the following growth parameters exponential growth rate c m1 time to reach exponential growth rate t m1 maximum canopy cover v max time to reach maximum canopy cover t 1 and area under canopy cover curve a 1 drought stress in both 2014 and 2015 at connantre reduced c m1 a 1 and v max however t m1 and t 1 were longer under drought stress in 2014 whereas in 2015 drought stress did not delay t m1 and t 1 fig 7 for each of these growth parameters a higher standard deviation under stress than control showed that there is considerable variation in canopy growth response to drought among the cultivars it took fewer days t 1 to reach maximum cover v max in 2015 than in 2014 however the canopy area a 1 was larger in 2014 which reflects the effect of the difference in timing of the drought in the growing season bi plots of the growth parameters under irrigated conditions showed an even distribution of cultivars without distinctive groupings whereas under non irrigated conditions the maturity groups could be distinguished supplementary fig s3 the bi plot of the irrigated treatment showed c m1 a 1 and v max contributing similarly to the variation in the dataset along the first principal component axis although v max tended to have a slightly higher impact than a 1 and c m1 parameters t m1 and t 1 had similar effects along pc1 supplementary fig s3 in irrigated conditions cultivars that had longer t m1 and t 1 had less c m1 a 1 and v max and vice versa according to the bi plots the biomass factors c m1 a 1 and v max appeared to be more important drivers for the variation of canopy growth along pc1 than the time factors of canopy growth t m1 and t 1 along pc2 under non irrigated conditions t m1 and t 1 were critical in distinguishing early and late maturity classes most late maturity types had longer t m1 and t 1 under drought than early maturity types thus the tolerant and sensitive late maturity types did not differ much in their t m1 and t 1 supplementary fig s2 on the other hand early maturity types responded differentially to t m1 and t 1 and tolerant versus sensitive early maturity types differed significantly in their t m1 and t 1 supplementary fig s2 3 4 2 correlations between canopy growth parameters and yield spearman s correlations were computed between all canopy growth and yield traits from connantre 2014 and 2015 under irrigated and non irrigated conditions fig 8 foliage maturity was negatively correlated with most traits in both years except time to reach exponential growth in 2014 t m114 under irrigated treatment foliage maturity was scored on a scale of 1 very late maturing to 9 very early according to the scoring scheme of cbsg centre for biosystems genomics the netherlands d hoop et al 2010 tuber fresh weight tbw was more positively correlated with the canopy growth parameters under non irrigated conditions than irrigated however in 2015 there was no difference between irrigated and non irrigated treatments in tuber fresh weight correlation with cm1 in this year 2015 both irrigated and non irrigated treatments showed a similar pattern of canopy progress at the exponential phase of canopy growth see also fig 6b in section 3 4 1 the positive correlations of t m1 and t 1 with tuber weight under stress were much stronger in 2015 than 2014 generally reaching maximum growth rate t m1 took much longer time under non irrigated conditions than under well watered conditions this is reflected in the higher positive correlation coefficients between c m1 and t m1 under drought in both years compared to irrigation fig 8 under irrigated conditions negative correlations existed between tuber number and t m1 however under stress this link between canopy and tuber number was not existent anymore both in 2014 and 2015 the underwater weight correlated more positively with v max c m1 and a 1 under stress than in normal conditions only in 2015 in summary the connantre trials 2014 and 2015 provided a platform to investigate early versus late drought effects on canopy development and tuber yield 4 discussion the development of potato canopy growth during drought has not yet been studied in detail logically it can easily be assumed that fast establishment of exponential growth rate and maximum canopy cover are advantageous for productivity our findings however suggest a deviation from this assumption under stress conditions and can justify the statement in struik and wiersema 1999 that fastest overall development is not necessarily associated with the highest yields we discuss these findings and give the practical implications for drought tolerance breeding in potato 4 1 drought effects on canopy growth and yield the field trials at connantre in 2014 and 2015 had the highest yield contrast between irrigated and non irrigated blocks and were used for a comparative analysis of the drought response early drought in the growing season of 2014 reduced the progress of canopy growth and coincided with tuber initiation fig 6a leading to a reduction in tuber number and tuber yield the early drought reduction effects on tuber number in our study is contrary to the report of no effect or increase in tuber number in haverkort et al 1990 the contrast between these two studies may be due to the different sets of genotypes studied but also possible differences in drought severity in 2015 the drought in the connantre trial set in later and reduced maximum canopy cover fig 6b and tuber bulking but also tuber number in martin et al 1992 both early and late drought reduced tuber number in russet burbank and in particular a more severe early drought reduced tuber number more than mild early drought and late drought in our study the late drought in 2015 exposed the potato cultivars to a more severe stress than the early drought in 2014 supplementary fig s2 according to haverkort and goudriaan 1994 late droughts occurring during the tuber bulking phase of plant development have more effect on tuber yield because of increased crop transpiration reduced formation of new leaves and likely premature leaf shedding at this stage the plants in our 2015 experiment may have been penalized for the strong growth with optimal water availability at the early canopy expanding stages before the drought started nevertheless the canopy growth parameters maximum canopy cover v max exponential growth rate c m1 and area under canopy cover curve a 1 were all reduced by drought in both years maximum canopy cover was more severely reduced in 2015 than in 2014 indicating that the late drought was more devastating for maximum light interception fig 7 maximum canopy cover percentage is a determinant factor for the amount of light interception which affects the photosynthetic capacity of plants and tuber bulking in potato barreda et al 1996 li 2012 navarre and pavek 2014 steyn et al 2007 our results in section 3 1 showed that tuber weight was more severely reduced in 2015 than 2014 at connantre fig 1 this may be attributed to reduced tuber bulking resulting from reduced photosynthetic capacity of the canopy in 2015 under drought fig 6b li et al 2016 have demonstrated in potted plants of cv atlantic that limited water resource can reduce potato yield by affecting the net photosynthetic rates of the source canopy tissues in our connantre 2014 trial there was a delay in time to reach exponential growth t m1 and time to reach maximum canopy cover under drought t 1 while in 2015 these were shorter compared to control conditions fig 7 this hastened effect on canopy growth rate and time to establish full canopy cover did however not seem to contribute to tuber bulking as much as the reduced photosynthetic capacity of the canopy in 2015 at the build up phase of canopy growth the critical yield determining parameter is tuber initiation which may be reflected in tuber number at harvest however there were no significant correlations of tuber number with the canopy growth traits under drought stress it should be noted that tuber number was only scored at the end of the growing season tuber formation may have been arrested when the early drought occurred and reinitiated later in the growth season this effect of drought on tuberisation would thus not be reflected in tuber number at the time of harvest the strong correlation of higher tuber weight with delayed attainment of exponential growth and maximum canopy cover t m1 and t 1 under stress in 2015 fig 8d suggests that the maintenance of tuber yield under drought would require the plants to balance investment in exponential growth and maximum canopy cover with tuber bulking previous research has demonstrated that partitioning of assimilates to tubers can influence foliage earliness and longevity kooman and rabbinge 1996 also marcelis 1996 illustrated in a model that when resources are limited the sink organ with a lower km value higher affinity for assimilates attracts more assimilates the delay in attainment of canopy exponential growth as seen in connantre 2014 fig 7 may therefore be a trade off due to an adaptive mechanism under drought to facilitate or resulting from continued formation and bulking of tubers the canopy growth parameters may be categorized into two groups biomass based growth parameters maximum canopy cover v max exponential growth rate c m1 area under the canopy curve a 1 and time based growth parameters time to reach exponential growth rate t m1 and time to reach maximum canopy cover t 1 under irrigated conditions the biomass based growth parameters and the time based growth parameters of the cultivars were differentially affected supplementary fig s3 this indicates that under favourable conditions of growth commercial potato cultivars may have varying capacities for canopy biomass production also the variations in time based growth parameters under normal conditions may reflect the differences in foliage maturity types found in our dataset in fact we observed a negative correlation of maturity with most of the traits in both treatments in the connantre trials fig 8 the correlations suggest that cultivars of the late maturity type tended to have higher canopy growth area a 1 maximum canopy cover v max and yield than early maturity types similarly in another study on cultivated potato nitrogen n use ospina et al 2014 reported that late maturing potato cultivars had higher canopy growth area a uc and tuber yield than early maturing ones though the effect of maturity became weaker when n availability was limited under drought all growth parameters contributed similarly along pc1 to drought response variation among the cultivars supplementary fig s3 in the late drought scenario connantre 2015 the time based growth parameters t m1 and t 1 were significantly higher in late maturing cultivars than the early maturing ones under drought this suggests that the late drought delayed the canopy progress more in late maturing cultivars this delay seemed to be advantageous for yield of the late maturing cultivars according to tuber fresh weight correlations with maturity fig 8c d under low nitrogen availability in the experiments of ospina et al 2014 delayed attainment of maximum canopy growth also correlated positively with an increased area under the canopy curve and tuber yield the late maturity types in that study were delayed in attainment of maximum canopy cover t 1 compared the early maturity types the timing of the stress seems to differentially affect maturity classes because in our early drought trial of 2014 there were no correlations between maturity and time to attain maximum canopy cover fig 8a b the early drought spanned critical points in potato phenology at which the early maturing cultivars already had maximum canopy cover while the canopy of the late cultivars was still expanding zaag 1992 suggested that both foliage maturity type and water availability determine the length of the crop growth cycle our results give insight on how these factors maturity drought length of growth cycle interact in determining tuber yield it should be noted that the lower yield of the early maturity types compared to the late maturity types may also be caused by differences in water use the transpirational demands of the fully expanded canopy in early maturity types may have depleted the limited soil water more quickly with a stronger effect on tuber bulking and thus yield than the late maturing types 4 2 genotype by environment interaction cultivars grown under rain fed conditions comparable to environments in this study would ideally have a combination of high yield potential with yield stability under drought stress across locations we identified high yielding cultivars with relatively higher stability across different environments these include liseta karnico orchestra lady olympia altus labadia lady sara hermes kondor avano valiant fontane and kuras quadrant i of fig 3b cultivars in this quadrant represent the three maturity types used in the study but the late maturity types had a higher relative representation in this quadrant based on the representation of late maturing cultivars in quadrant i of fig 3b and their relative ability to balance drought effects on their canopy growth and tuber yield late maturity may be an advantageous characteristic for cultivation under water limited conditions yet a careful consideration of the timing of drought or drought severity in the location of interest is essential for the choice of selection environments in drought tolerance breeding programs these environmental factors are likely to fluctuate even more in the coming years due to climate change dai 2011 4 3 tuberisation under drought our results clearly show that canopy development is affected by drought and that the reduced light interception assimilate production and transport are likely to affect tuber yield another important factor to consider is the effect of drought on tuberisation reduced tuber formation will have a strong effect on tuber yield as well several studies reported on drought stress effects on tuberisation as inferred from tuber number hirut et al 2017 stalham et al 2007 ouiam et al 2003 schafleitner et al 2007 but there is no agreement on the direction of the effect positive or negative therefore there is need to further understand how drought interferes with tuberisation gong et al 2015 in this study we attempted to address the effect of drought on tuberisation by quantifying the effect on tuber size distribution yield reduction under drought was the result of lower number of tubers as well as a reduced average weight of the tubers produced fig 5 the extent of these effects appeared to be dependent on the drought stress level perceived by the plants and or the timing of the drought among other environmental factors fig 2 the drought stress that reduces tuber bulking may not necessarily affect differentiation of stolons into young tubers in connantre 2015 the number of small tubers increased under drought at the expense of larger sized tubers fig 5c and this was also reflected in the tuber weight distribution over tuber size classes supplementary fig s1 there may be two possible explanations for this observation the bulking of the tubers was affected but tuberisation was not arrested or tuberisation was arrested by the drought early in the season and the higher number of small tubers were formed late in the growing season with little time left for bulking it was previously reported that drought stress limits tuber size due to late stolon and tuber formation struik and van voorst 1986 a separation of the tuber size data into the different maturity classes also shows some slight modifications in response as a result of maturity differences data not shown however our results do not allow clear distinction between effects on tuberisation and tuber bulking a dedicated experiment with intermediate assessments of tuber formation and yield may be more informative and a dedicated molecular investigation is recommended for further understanding of the underlying mechanisms of drought interference with tuberisation 4 4 conclusions field cultivated potato plants are often vulnerable to drought stress during the growing season which heavily impacts canopy development and eventual tuber yield in order to minimize the reductions in tuber yield during drought potato plants need to balance their canopy growth with tuber growth our findings show that one of the ways the plants could do this is by delaying their attainment of fast exponential canopy growth rate and maximum canopy cover generally late maturity genotypes were more capable of moderating their canopy development to favour tuber growth under drought breeding for drought tolerance would benefit from

methods 2 1 study area field experiments were conducted during two consecutive winter seasons of 2013 14 and 2014 15 at gayeshpur nadia west bengal india situated at 23 26 010 n latitude and 88 22 221 e longitude and 12 0 m above the mean sea level the climate of the region is humid tropic with hot summer and moderately cool winter average weekly maximum and minimum temperature fluctuated between 21 2 39 8 and 6 9 25 2 c during year 1 while 23 1 41 3 and 9 2 26 6 c during year 2 in general there was a gradual drop in temperature from november to january which favoured the growth and development of maize hybrids avearge weekly maximum and minimum relative humidity prevailed between 83 and 98 and 25 68 during year 1 while 80 95 and 35 62 during year 2 the average weekly rainfall during the experimental period november to march was recorded 91 4 and 54 7 mm during year 1 and year 2 respectively fig 1 a and b depicts the meteorological parameters viz weekly temperature t max and t min rainfall relative humidity rh max and rhmin and bright sunshine hours of the experimental period during both the years the soil of the experimental field is characteristically an aeric haplaquept sandy clay loam in texture with good drainage and water holding capacity the pre experimental physico chemical properties and fertility status of the experimental soil are appended in table 1 2 2 experimental details the experiment was laid out in a strip plot design it is a two factor design in which greater precision is allowed in measuring the interaction effect sacrificing the degree of precision on main effects it is accomplished by dividing the experimental area into three plots namely the vertical strip horizontal strip and intersection the vertical and horizontal strips are perpendicular to each other without having any relationship between their sizes however the intersection plot is the smallest in this experiment the design had three irrigation schedules irrigation at 25 50 and 75 available soil moisture deficit or asmd in the vertical strip and four levels of potassium fertilization 0 50 100 and 150 kg k ha 1 in the horizontal strip replicated thrice the plots were 4 m long and 3 m wide with 0 45 m bunds leaving 1 5 m irrigation channel between two strips field capacity and permanent wilting point were first measured with pressure plate apparatus model 1600 soil moisture equipment crop santa barbara ca usa the profile soil water content from soil surface 0 cm to 30 cm depth was measured gravimetrically oven dry basis the change in profile soil water storage s cm was determined from the successive soil water sampling measurements during irrigation scheduling volumetric water content was measured with thetaprobe soil moisture sensor in frequency domain technique when thetaprobe reads 30 50 and 70 depletion of the volumetric water content in 30 cm soil depth irrigation was provided land was ploughed four times with the help of tractor cultivator and two times with tractor rotavator then the clods stones and weeds were removed from the experimental field planking was done to break clods and level the field after final tilling the field was properly levelled and required number of plots and irrigation channels were prepared by manual labour as per the layout plan for the experiment before we start the experiment there was no specific recommended dose of fertilizer rdf for hybrid maize for that location the recommendation from indian institute of maize research iimr was consulted iimr 2017 while fixing the rdf for n and p 200 kg n and 60 kg p2o5 ha 1 for that location the entire amount of phosphorus through single super phosphate potassic fertilizer through muriate of potash as per treatments and 40 of rdf of total nitrogenous fertilizer through urea were applied at final land preparation the rest amount of the nitrogenous fertilizer was applied in two equal splits at 40 days after sowing or das knee high stage and at 85 das pre tasseling stage respectively seeds of maize hybrid cv p 3522 were sown at 25 kg ha 1 during last week of november in both the years of experimentation seeds were dibbled at 3 5 cm depth with 2 seeds at each position spacing of 60 cm 30 cm density of about 55 555 plants ha was maintained by thinning and gap filling the weed control was accomplished by hand weeding twice at 40 and 60 das to control the most dominant weed species identified as chenopodium album besides hand weeding pre emergence treatment with the metribuzin sencor 480 soluble concentrate or sc at 1 kg a i ha 1 in 600 l of waters was done crops in both the years were absolutely free from insect or disease attack crops were harvested during third week of april during both years harvesting was done when husks turned yellow silks got a brownish discoloration and grains became hard then husks were removed from the cobs and dried in sun for 7 8 days after proper sun drying grains were removed from the cobs with local made hand sheller plants from the demarked net plot area were harvested and tied in bundles after removing all the matured cobs from them grains after deshelling dried properly to reduce the moisture content at 14 0 weight of grains was recorded as kg plot and then converted into t ha 1 water use efficiency wue in kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated by dividing plant dry matter yield kg ha 1 to actual evapotranspiration mm scott 2000 2 3 analytical methodologies soil samples both initial and crop growth stage wise were first collected from o and a horizons 0 30 cm to conduct different chemical analyses as depicted in table 1 among the k fractions water soluble k was extracted by shaking soil with distilled water at 1 5 for one hour and potassium in the leachate was measured by flame photometer grewal and kanwar 1996 exchangeable k in soil was determined by subtracting the water soluble k from the 1 n nh4oac extractable available k non exchangeable k was determined following the method of wood and deturk 1941 in a 100 ml conical flask 2 5 g of soil was taken and 25 ml of 1n hno3 solution was added the soil acid suspension was allowed to boil gently on a thick layered sand bath spread uniformly over a hot plate for 10 min the flask was immediately removed from the hot plate cooled and filtered through whatman no 41 filter paper the soil was then washed several times with four 15 ml portion of dilute 0 1n hno3 the leachate was allowed to cool diluted with distilled water to make up the volume to 100 ml and mixed up thoroughly potassium in the extract was estimated by flame photometer non exchangeable k was then computed by subtracting nh4oac k from boiling 1 n hno3 extractable k for total k estimation method suggested by rajashekhar rao et al 2011 was followed a soil sample weighing 1 0 g was taken in a teflon beaker initially the material was digested with 10 ml concentrated hno3 for half an hour and cooled later 10 ml of 70 perchloric acid were added boiled gently for 1 h on a hot plate at about 235 c and cooled then 10 ml of hf 50 were added heated in a fume hood to intense white fumes and taken nearly to dryness after cooling the contents of the beaker 25 ml of 1 n hno3 were added and gently boiled to dissolve any residues present and 2 5 g hbo3 crystals were added to complex any free fluoride ions in solution but also to facilitate dissolution of precipitated fluorides wu et al 2007 finally the volume was made up to 50 ml and used for total k estimation mineral k was estimated by substracting the rest fractions water soluble exchangeable and non exchangeable from total k gallardo lara et al 1995 for total n analysis measured amount of plant samples stem leaf tassel husk deshelled cob grain was digested with concentrated h2so4 accelerated with a digestion mixture for 1 2 h at 420 c until green color was obtained n in the digest was determined by micro kjeldahl steam distillation method aoac 1995 total p and k in grain and straw samples were determined in digests of tri acid mixture hno3 h2so4 hclo4 9 1 4 using uv vis spectrophotometer and flame photometer respectively jackson 1973 then the uptake of nutrients npk was calculated from their respective concentration in plant parts separately using the following formula sharma et al 2012 uptake of n p k kg ha 1 n p k dry matter kg ha 1 100 2 4 statistical analysis data were subjected to analysis of variance anova as strip plot design and the mean values were adjudged by tukey s hsd honest significant difference test method using spss version 21 0 software the variance over years was estimated homogeneously by performing bartlett s chi square test and pooled analyses of observations are presented to draw logical conclusions to quantify the contribution of causal independent variables to the targeted effect dependent variables directly or indirectly through other variables path analysis method was used this method is a natural extension to the regression analysis where the direct contributions of independent variable to the dependent variable and indirect contributions through other variables to the same dependent variable can be quantitatively examined in this experiment different fractions of k water soluble exchangeable non exchangeable and mineral at different irrigation regimes were considered as independent variable whereas grain yield and total k uptake was the dependent variable for performing the path analysis as per dewey and lu 1959 the excel software version 2007 microsoft inc wa usa was used to draw graphs and figures 3 results 3 1 effect of irrigation situations and potassium fertilization on available soil potassium the availability of k in the selected inceptisol under maize has been observed to be significantly influenced by simulated moisture situations and k fertilization across entire growing season of maize in both the experimental years pooled observation table 2 imposition of moisture stress up to 50 available soil moisture deficit asmd significantly increased the k availabilities over the no stress situation while irrigation available at 75 asmd reduced the availabilities significantly k fertilization increased k availability significantly over control peaking at 150 kg ha 1 k which was statistically at par with 100 kg ha 1 k administration irrigation at 50 asmd along with 150 kg ha 1 k fertilizer recovered maximum available k across the entire sampling stages although irrigation fertilizer interaction precisely failed to put forth any significant influence on soil k availabilities in most of the occasions except in sampling at 65 days after maize sowing 3 2 effect of irrigation situations and potassium fertilization on soil k fractions recovered at different growth stages of maize to look into the k dynamics in soil it is necessary to observe the changes in different k fractions in soil under the impact of changing irrigation regimes and k fertilization precisely and their interaction as a whole soil samples were drawn and tested at 40 and 120 days after maize sowing and the pooled observations of both the experimental years table 3 have shown significantly higher recoveries of almost all the k fractions water soluble exchangeable non exchangeable mineral and total with imposition of moisture stress up to 50 asmd following which recoveries reduced significantly when irrigation is available at 75 asmd increasing application of k fertilizers significantly increased total and fractions of k in soil showing maximum recoveries with 100 150 kg ha 1 k application the irrigation k fertilizer interaction failed to exert any significant effect on total and fraction k recoveries from samples drawn at 40 days after sowing das of maize while significant changes in such recoveries were observed during 120 das irrigation at 50 asmd along with 150 kg ha 1 k application supported maximum recoveries of total and all k fractions at both 40 and 120 das samples 3 3 effect of irrigation situations and potassium fertilization on nutrient uptake by and grain yield and water use efficiency of maize changes observed in uptake of major nutrients grain yield and water use efficiency of maize due to simulated irrigation situations and k fertilization have been recorded in table 4 allowing increasing moisture stress before irrigation reduced uptake of major nutrients npk by maize significantly from no stress situation while increasing k fertilization significantly increased such uptake over control the grain yield and wue of maize significantly increased up to 50 asmd before irrigation and decreased when irrigation is available at 75 asmd increasing levels of k fertilization significantly increased grain yield and wue of maize significantly over control which peaked at 150 kg ha 1 k application however effect of 100 kg ha 1 k application on both k uptake and maize grain yield was statistically at par with that obtained with 150 kg ha 1 k the irrigation fertilizer k interaction significantly impacted changes in uptake of n p and wue while such changes in k uptake and grain yield of maize were not significant no moisture stress accompanied by 150 kg ha 1 k application supported maximum uptake of npk and wue of maize as well while maximum grain yield was obtained with 150 kg ha 1 k application at moisture stress allowed up to 50 asmd before irrigation 3 4 effect of irrigation situations and potassium fertilization on relationship among different k pools the k dynamics in soil and its availability depend on the interrelationship of the different coexistent k pools in soil and the effect of irrigation situation and k fertilization thereon the regression relationships drawn in table 5 and pearson s correlation in table 6 summarized such connotations emerged under different irrigation moisture stress situations the relationship among different k pools are predominantly significant where adequate irrigation was available while such relationships are seldom strong significant where soils were exposed to moisture stresses up to 50 75 asmd available k was observed to have strongest correlation with water soluble and exchangeable k in all possible irrigation simulations imposed the exchangeable k has shown strongest correlation with non exchangeable k and the non exchangeable k with mineral k only when adequate irrigation no stress is available the availabilities of k in the experimental inceptisol under different irrigation and k fertilizer regimes have been largely governed by water soluble and exchangeable k table 5 and this was true across the moisture irrigation situations and k fertilization levels employed to maize 3 5 direct and indirect effect of soil k fractions on k uptake and grain yield of maize under different irrigation situations the maize grain yield and k uptake in the present study were supposed to be governed by the availability of soil k influenced by different k pools coexisting in soil and perturbed with different irrigation environment allowed moisture stresses a path analysis was made to describe direct and indirect effects of different k fractions on k uptake and yield and maize grain yield through causal modeling table 7 it was observed that water soluble k exerted highest direct effect on changes in maize grain yield and grain k uptake in all irrigation regimes followed by exchangeable non exchangeable and mineral k except when irrigation was available at 75 asmd the exchangeable k exerted highest direct effect on maize grain yield at 75 asmd the highest direct effects of water soluble k on maize grain yield and k uptake has been observed to be often accompanied by highest indirect effect of exchangeable k it is interesting to note that under increasing moisture stress 50 and 75 asmd the effect of exchangeable and mineral k on maize k uptake were often negative 4 discussion increasing moisture stress reduced k availability in soil solution since available k in soil solutions often reported to increase with the water content haddock 1952 increasing k fertilization quite naturally increased the k availabilities in soil solution and exchange sites as well metwally and pollard 1959 observed the increase in k contents of the soil solution with increase in soil moisture content in conjunction with k fertilizer application higher recoveries of available k in the present study were often associated with optimality of moisture when irrigation was administered at 50 asmd rather than at 25 asmd which is quite in good agreement with findings of bhrighvanshi et al 2014 observing significant interaction between available soil k and irrigation at 40 asmd in mango orchards recoveries of different k pools from the experimental soil were also observed to be influenced significantly by varying availabilities of irrigation and k fertilization such findings were also obtained by previous workers reporting increased water soluble k sparks et al 1980 exchangeable k havlin et al 1984 and non exchangeable k wood and deturk 1941 with k addition such findings in the present study remained same in both the sampling stages 40 and 120 das of maize the mobility of k increased with soil moisture the influence of soil moisture upon soil test k levels has been attributed largely to the release of k from interlayer positions of certain clay minerals termed phyllosilicates rich 1968 adequate moisture facilitates release of not so available fraction to plant available forms as envisaged through the relationship table 6 where changes in available k has been largely governed by water soluble k when adequate optimum irrigation is available at 25 50 asmd and by water soluble and exchangeable k together when exposed to more intense moisture stress 75 asmd table 5 the dynamic equilibrium among k pools have been clearly envisaged in findings of the present initiative when we observed strong correlations among water soluble exchangeable exchangeable non exchangeable and non exchangeable mineral forms of k precisely in situations receiving adequate irrigation at 25 asmd table 6 such relationships remained significant only between available and water soluble k when moisture stresses were allowed up to 50 75 asmd before irrigation readily available potassium is a dissolved form of k water soluble or k held on the outer surface of clay particles exchangeable k memon et al 1998 suggested that initially k uptake by plant is solely from exchangeable sources but once the critical depletion stage had been reached uptake of k was mainly from non exchangeable fraction with only a small further contribution from exchangeable sources thus non exchangeable k has a significant contribution to the plant uptake despite the fact that water soluble and exchangeable k remain the major sources of plant available k walter et al 2011 depth wise distribution of different forms of k as envisaged through figs 2 and 3 has clearly indicated that only non exchangeable k remained stable with increasing depth of soil all other fractions decreased with increasing soil depth from 30 to 90 cm the distribution of k forms differs with the depth and space depending on some overriding environmental and soil factors srinivasa rao et al 2006 conducted experiment in different types of soils found in different regions of india they observed that the k content varies according to parent material particle size distribution degree of weathering and management practices decrease in water soluble and exchangeable k fractions with increasing soil depth has also been reported by sharma et al 2006 and reza et al 2014 irrigation and k fertilization exerted significant impact on nutrient uptake and maize grain yield optimality of the moisture condition emerged through irrigation at 50 asmd supported maximum maize grain yield while increasing k fertilization increased maize grain yield peaking at 150 kg ha 1 increasing moisture stress gradually decreased npk uptake by maize grain while all three macronutrients have shown increasing recoveries with increasing levels of k fertilization earlier workers have also reported the premiere role of soil moisture in facilitating soil availability and crop uptake of nutrients the grain yield and yield components of maize were markedly affected by irrigation treatments rivera hernandez et al 2010 moser et al 2006 variation in the soil water regime may greatly influence the concentrations of mineral nutrients in soil solutions and their uptake by plants wolt 1994 menéndez et al 1995 misra and tyler 1999 soliman 2006 found that change of irrigation levels from 40 to 80 asmd gives significant result for growth yield and yield components with insignificant differences between 60 and 80 of asmd patel et al 1985 obtained higher maize yield with irrigation at 25 rather than 50 or 75 depletion of available soil moisture aslam et al 2013 reported that in maize the interaction of drought and potassium levels was also statistically significant for leaf area the interactive effect of potassium on shoot fresh weight of maize hybrids under drought levels was also found statistically significant kumar and dey 2011 reported that n p and k uptake was positively affected by irrigation amount and method and found that maximum nutrient uptake occurred in an optimum irrigated treatment while the rainfed treatment had the least nutrient uptake in general drought stress induced substantial decreases in k uptake by the maize plant at different stages ge et al 2012 moisture is needed for k to move to plant roots for uptake moisture is needed for root growth through the soil to new supplies of k it is needed for mass flow movement of k to the plant roots with water and for the diffusion of k to the roots to resupply that taken up by the roots drought stress or excess moisture reduces k availability and uptake by crops increasing soil k levels can help overcome the adverse effects ipni 1998 of drought increase in n and p uptake with addition of external of k fertilizer can be explained by the interaction of these nutrients with k in soil in zimbabwe burkersroda 1965 demonstrated striking result that when the rate of nitrogen was increased on a k deficient soil the yield declined to a totally unacceptable level unless k was applied di and cameron 2004 in their study on the effect of nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide dcd on cation leaching in grazed grassland of an udic haplustept of new zealand postulated that the leaching losses of nitrate was positively correlated with the leaching losses of k ion gething 1993 also found large positive n k interactions in long term experiments in nigeria strombergerab et al 1994 examined the interactions of k with n and their effect on both growth and yield in maize and concluded that high k in conjunction with mixed n generally enhanced dry matter accumulation and nutrient uptake both n and k for all hybrids addition of k increased the p uptake in field experiment involving soybean wheat system srinivasa rao and subba rao 1999 di and cameron 2004 opined that at higher level of p fertilization 90 kg ha 1 year 1 k ion leached less compared to that at lower p fertilization 45 kg ha 1 year 1 a more simple p k interaction but perhaps of more widespread importance is their synergistic effect on yield phosphorus requires adequate levels of k for maximum crop response and also reported a potential k p interaction in the uptake vandamme et al 2014 in the present experiment the wue of maize was observed to increased with increasing water availability and k fertilization although usually wue are higher in water scarce situations and optimum irrigation scheduling improves wue wang et al 2002 zhang et al 2004 fang et al 2007 wue shows a high variation in response to irrigation across seasons and regions mainly due to varying annual rainfall soil type and other agronomic practices wang et al 2002 therefore the experimental results are site and season specific and may not be applicable to other growing seasons and other locations with different climate and soil conditions fang et al 2010 in most cases when water supply is fixed any management factor that increases yield will increase wue because evapotranspiration will be little affected by the management ritchie 1983 the nexus among irrigation and potassium in increasing wue have already been studied about four decades ago viets 1972 adequately k fertilized plants show higher drought tolerance lahiri 1980 and increased wue barraclough 1989 heitholt 1989 however andersen et al 1992 observed that water use efficiency for total dry matter production was increased by k application but the same for grain production was unaffected by the level of k application wue varied significantly with the age of the plants and was significantly affected by drought and by different nutrient regimes drought increased wue in all nutrient treatments the effects of differential nutrition were more obvious in drought treatments than in well watered treatments however in our study the effects of different k management treatments were similar whether the plants were well watered or drought affected no significant interaction between fertilization and water regime signifying the additive role of k on moisture availability to plants 5 conclusion yield of and water use by maize was observed to be largely influenced by exposure to moisture stresses in situations where irrigation is not adequate assured k fertilization played a significant role in improving yield wue and nutrient use by maize all recoverable soil k pools greatly influence k availability uptake and yield of maize receiving adequate irrigation while water soluble and exchangeable k emerged as significant factors influencing yield of and k uptake by maize exposed to moisture stresses under inadequate irrigation acknowledgement the authors would like to thank international plant nutrition institute ipni for providing financial and technical assistance during the course of experimentation

methods 2 1 study area field experiments were conducted during two consecutive winter seasons of 2013 14 and 2014 15 at gayeshpur nadia west bengal india situated at 23 26 010 n latitude and 88 22 221 e longitude and 12 0 m above the mean sea level the climate of the region is humid tropic with hot summer and moderately cool winter average weekly maximum and minimum temperature fluctuated between 21 2 39 8 and 6 9 25 2 c during year 1 while 23 1 41 3 and 9 2 26 6 c during year 2 in general there was a gradual drop in temperature from november to january which favoured the growth and development of maize hybrids avearge weekly maximum and minimum relative humidity prevailed between 83 and 98 and 25 68 during year 1 while 80 95 and 35 62 during year 2 the average weekly rainfall during the experimental period november to march was recorded 91 4 and 54 7 mm during year 1 and year 2 respectively fig 1 a and b depicts the meteorological parameters viz weekly temperature t max and t min rainfall relative humidity rh max and rhmin and bright sunshine hours of the experimental period during both the years the soil of the experimental field is characteristically an aeric haplaquept sandy clay loam in texture with good drainage and water holding capacity the pre experimental physico chemical properties and fertility status of the experimental soil are appended in table 1 2 2 experimental details the experiment was laid out in a strip plot design it is a two factor design in which greater precision is allowed in measuring the interaction effect sacrificing the degree of precision on main effects it is accomplished by dividing the experimental area into three plots namely the vertical strip horizontal strip and intersection the vertical and horizontal strips are perpendicular to each other without having any relationship between their sizes however the intersection plot is the smallest in this experiment the design had three irrigation schedules irrigation at 25 50 and 75 available soil moisture deficit or asmd in the vertical strip and four levels of potassium fertilization 0 50 100 and 150 kg k ha 1 in the horizontal strip replicated thrice the plots were 4 m long and 3 m wide with 0 45 m bunds leaving 1 5 m irrigation channel between two strips field capacity and permanent wilting point were first measured with pressure plate apparatus model 1600 soil moisture equipment crop santa barbara ca usa the profile soil water content from soil surface 0 cm to 30 cm depth was measured gravimetrically oven dry basis the change in profile soil water storage s cm was determined from the successive soil water sampling measurements during irrigation scheduling volumetric water content was measured with thetaprobe soil moisture sensor in frequency domain technique when thetaprobe reads 30 50 and 70 depletion of the volumetric water content in 30 cm soil depth irrigation was provided land was ploughed four times with the help of tractor cultivator and two times with tractor rotavator then the clods stones and weeds were removed from the experimental field planking was done to break clods and level the field after final tilling the field was properly levelled and required number of plots and irrigation channels were prepared by manual labour as per the layout plan for the experiment before we start the experiment there was no specific recommended dose of fertilizer rdf for hybrid maize for that location the recommendation from indian institute of maize research iimr was consulted iimr 2017 while fixing the rdf for n and p 200 kg n and 60 kg p2o5 ha 1 for that location the entire amount of phosphorus through single super phosphate potassic fertilizer through muriate of potash as per treatments and 40 of rdf of total nitrogenous fertilizer through urea were applied at final land preparation the rest amount of the nitrogenous fertilizer was applied in two equal splits at 40 days after sowing or das knee high stage and at 85 das pre tasseling stage respectively seeds of maize hybrid cv p 3522 were sown at 25 kg ha 1 during last week of november in both the years of experimentation seeds were dibbled at 3 5 cm depth with 2 seeds at each position spacing of 60 cm 30 cm density of about 55 555 plants ha was maintained by thinning and gap filling the weed control was accomplished by hand weeding twice at 40 and 60 das to control the most dominant weed species identified as chenopodium album besides hand weeding pre emergence treatment with the metribuzin sencor 480 soluble concentrate or sc at 1 kg a i ha 1 in 600 l of waters was done crops in both the years were absolutely free from insect or disease attack crops were harvested during third week of april during both years harvesting was done when husks turned yellow silks got a brownish discoloration and grains became hard then husks were removed from the cobs and dried in sun for 7 8 days after proper sun drying grains were removed from the cobs with local made hand sheller plants from the demarked net plot area were harvested and tied in bundles after removing all the matured cobs from them grains after deshelling dried properly to reduce the moisture content at 14 0 weight of grains was recorded as kg plot and then converted into t ha 1 water use efficiency wue in kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated by dividing plant dry matter yield kg ha 1 to actual evapotranspiration mm scott 2000 2 3 analytical methodologies soil samples both initial and crop growth stage wise were first collected from o and a horizons 0 30 cm to conduct different chemical analyses as depicted in table 1 among the k fractions water soluble k was extracted by shaking soil with distilled water at 1 5 for one hour and potassium in the leachate was measured by flame photometer grewal and kanwar 1996 exchangeable k in soil was determined by subtracting the water soluble k from the 1 n nh4oac extractable available k non exchangeable k was determined following the method of wood and deturk 1941 in a 100 ml conical flask 2 5 g of soil was taken and 25 ml of 1n hno3 solution was added the soil acid suspension was allowed to boil gently on a thick layered sand bath spread uniformly over a hot plate for 10 min the flask was immediately removed from the hot plate cooled and filtered through whatman no 41 filter paper the soil was then washed several times with four 15 ml portion of dilute 0 1n hno3 the leachate was allowed to cool diluted with distilled water to make up the volume to 100 ml and mixed up thoroughly potassium in the extract was estimated by flame photometer non exchangeable k was then computed by subtracting nh4oac k from boiling 1 n hno3 extractable k for total k estimation method suggested by rajashekhar rao et al 2011 was followed a soil sample weighing 1 0 g was taken in a teflon beaker initially the material was digested with 10 ml concentrated hno3 for half an hour and cooled later 10 ml of 70 perchloric acid were added boiled gently for 1 h on a hot plate at about 235 c and cooled then 10 ml of hf 50 were added heated in a fume hood to intense white fumes and taken nearly to dryness after cooling the contents of the beaker 25 ml of 1 n hno3 were added and gently boiled to dissolve any residues present and 2 5 g hbo3 crystals were added to complex any free fluoride ions in solution but also to facilitate dissolution of precipitated fluorides wu et al 2007 finally the volume was made up to 50 ml and used for total k estimation mineral k was estimated by substracting the rest fractions water soluble exchangeable and non exchangeable from total k gallardo lara et al 1995 for total n analysis measured amount of plant samples stem leaf tassel husk deshelled cob grain was digested with concentrated h2so4 accelerated with a digestion mixture for 1 2 h at 420 c until green color was obtained n in the digest was determined by micro kjeldahl steam distillation method aoac 1995 total p and k in grain and straw samples were determined in digests of tri acid mixture hno3 h2so4 hclo4 9 1 4 using uv vis spectrophotometer and flame photometer respectively jackson 1973 then the uptake of nutrients npk was calculated from their respective concentration in plant parts separately using the following formula sharma et al 2012 uptake of n p k kg ha 1 n p k dry matter kg ha 1 100 2 4 statistical analysis data were subjected to analysis of variance anova as strip plot design and the mean values were adjudged by tukey s hsd honest significant difference test method using spss version 21 0 software the variance over years was estimated homogeneously by performing bartlett s chi square test and pooled analyses of observations are presented to draw logical conclusions to quantify the contribution of causal independent variables to the targeted effect dependent variables directly or indirectly through other variables path analysis method was used this method is a natural extension to the regression analysis where the direct contributions of independent variable to the dependent variable and indirect contributions through other variables to the same dependent variable can be quantitatively examined in this experiment different fractions of k water soluble exchangeable non exchangeable and mineral at different irrigation regimes were considered as independent variable whereas grain yield and total k uptake was the dependent variable for performing the path analysis as per dewey and lu 1959 the excel software version 2007 microsoft inc wa usa was used to draw graphs and figures 3 results 3 1 effect of irrigation situations and potassium fertilization on available soil potassium the availability of k in the selected inceptisol under maize has been observed to be significantly influenced by simulated moisture situations and k fertilization across entire growing season of maize in both the experimental years pooled observation table 2 imposition of moisture stress up to 50 available soil moisture deficit asmd significantly increased the k availabilities over the no stress situation while irrigation available at 75 asmd reduced the availabilities significantly k fertilization increased k availability significantly over control peaking at 150 kg ha 1 k which was statistically at par with 100 kg ha 1 k administration irrigation at 50 asmd along with 150 kg ha 1 k fertilizer recovered maximum available k across the entire sampling stages although irrigation fertilizer interaction precisely failed to put forth any significant influence on soil k availabilities in most of the occasions except in sampling at 65 days after maize sowing 3 2 effect of irrigation situations and potassium fertilization on soil k fractions recovered at different growth stages of maize to look into the k dynamics in soil it is necessary to observe the changes in different k fractions in soil under the impact of changing irrigation regimes and k fertilization precisely and their interaction as a whole soil samples were drawn and tested at 40 and 120 days after maize sowing and the pooled observations of both the experimental years table 3 have shown significantly higher recoveries of almost all the k fractions water soluble exchangeable non exchangeable mineral and total with imposition of moisture stress up to 50 asmd following which recoveries reduced significantly when irrigation is available at 75 asmd increasing application of k fertilizers significantly increased total and fractions of k in soil showing maximum recoveries with 100 150 kg ha 1 k application the irrigation k fertilizer interaction failed to exert any significant effect on total and fraction k recoveries from samples drawn at 40 days after sowing das of maize while significant changes in such recoveries were observed during 120 das irrigation at 50 asmd along with 150 kg ha 1 k application supported maximum recoveries of total and all k fractions at both 40 and 120 das samples 3 3 effect of irrigation situations and potassium fertilization on nutrient uptake by and grain yield and water use efficiency of maize changes observed in uptake of major nutrients grain yield and water use efficiency of maize due to simulated irrigation situations and k fertilization have been recorded in table 4 allowing increasing moisture stress before irrigation reduced uptake of major nutrients npk by maize significantly from no stress situation while increasing k fertilization significantly increased such uptake over control the grain yield and wue of maize significantly increased up to 50 asmd before irrigation and decreased when irrigation is available at 75 asmd increasing levels of k fertilization significantly increased grain yield and wue of maize significantly over control which peaked at 150 kg ha 1 k application however effect of 100 kg ha 1 k application on both k uptake and maize grain yield was statistically at par with that obtained with 150 kg ha 1 k the irrigation fertilizer k interaction significantly impacted changes in uptake of n p and wue while such changes in k uptake and grain yield of maize were not significant no moisture stress accompanied by 150 kg ha 1 k application supported maximum uptake of npk and wue of maize as well while maximum grain yield was obtained with 150 kg ha 1 k application at moisture stress allowed up to 50 asmd before irrigation 3 4 effect of irrigation situations and potassium fertilization on relationship among different k pools the k dynamics in soil and its availability depend on the interrelationship of the different coexistent k pools in soil and the effect of irrigation situation and k fertilization thereon the regression relationships drawn in table 5 and pearson s correlation in table 6 summarized such connotations emerged under different irrigation moisture stress situations the relationship among different k pools are predominantly significant where adequate irrigation was available while such relationships are seldom strong significant where soils were exposed to moisture stresses up to 50 75 asmd available k was observed to have strongest correlation with water soluble and exchangeable k in all possible irrigation simulations imposed the exchangeable k has shown strongest correlation with non exchangeable k and the non exchangeable k with mineral k only when adequate irrigation no stress is available the availabilities of k in the experimental inceptisol under different irrigation and k fertilizer regimes have been largely governed by water soluble and exchangeable k table 5 and this was true across the moisture irrigation situations and k fertilization levels employed to maize 3 5 direct and indirect effect of soil k fractions on k uptake and grain yield of maize under different irrigation situations the maize grain yield and k uptake in the present study were supposed to be governed by the availability of soil k influenced by different k pools coexisting in soil and perturbed with different irrigation environment allowed moisture stresses a path analysis was made to describe direct and indirect effects of different k fractions on k uptake and yield and maize grain yield through causal modeling table 7 it was observed that water soluble k exerted highest direct effect on changes in maize grain yield and grain k uptake in all irrigation regimes followed by exchangeable non exchangeable and mineral k except when irrigation was available at 75 asmd the exchangeable k exerted highest direct effect on maize grain yield at 75 asmd the highest direct effects of water soluble k on maize grain yield and k uptake has been observed to be often accompanied by highest indirect effect of exchangeable k it is interesting to note that under increasing moisture stress 50 and 75 asmd the effect of exchangeable and mineral k on maize k uptake were often negative 4 discussion increasing moisture stress reduced k availability in soil solution since available k in soil solutions often reported to increase with the water content haddock 1952 increasing k fertilization quite naturally increased the k availabilities in soil solution and exchange sites as well metwally and pollard 1959 observed the increase in k contents of the soil solution with increase in soil moisture content in conjunction with k fertilizer application higher recoveries of available k in the present study were often associated with optimality of moisture when irrigation was administered at 50 asmd rather than at 25 asmd which is quite in good agreement with findings of bhrighvanshi et al 2014 observing significant interaction between available soil k and irrigation at 40 asmd in mango orchards recoveries of different k pools from the experimental soil were also observed to be influenced significantly by varying availabilities of irrigation and k fertilization such findings were also obtained by previous workers reporting increased water soluble k sparks et al 1980 exchangeable k havlin et al 1984 and non exchangeable k wood and deturk 1941 with k addition such findings in the present study remained same in both the sampling stages 40 and 120 das of maize the mobility of k increased with soil moisture the influence of soil moisture upon soil test k levels has been attributed largely to the release of k from interlayer positions of certain clay minerals termed phyllosilicates rich 1968 adequate moisture facilitates release of not so available fraction to plant available forms as envisaged through the relationship table 6 where changes in available k has been largely governed by water soluble k when adequate optimum irrigation is available at 25 50 asmd and by water soluble and exchangeable k together when exposed to more intense moisture stress 75 asmd table 5 the dynamic equilibrium among k pools have been clearly envisaged in findings of the present initiative when we observed strong correlations among water soluble exchangeable exchangeable non exchangeable and non exchangeable mineral forms of k precisely in situations receiving adequate irrigation at 25 asmd table 6 such relationships remained significant only between available and water soluble k when moisture stresses were allowed up to 50 75 asmd before irrigation readily available potassium is a dissolved form of k water soluble or k held on the outer surface of clay particles exchangeable k memon et al 1998 suggested that initially k uptake by plant is solely from exchangeable sources but once the critical depletion stage had been reached uptake of k was mainly from non exchangeable fraction with only a small further contribution from exchangeable sources thus non exchangeable k has a significant contribution to the plant uptake despite the fact that water soluble and exchangeable k remain the major sources of plant available k walter et al 2011 depth wise distribution of different forms of k as envisaged through figs 2 and 3 has clearly indicated that only non exchangeable k remained stable with increasing depth of soil all other fractions decreased with increasing soil depth from 30 to 90 cm the distribution of k forms differs with the depth and space depending on some overriding environmental and soil factors srinivasa rao et al 2006 conducted experiment in different types of soils found in different regions of india they observed that the k content varies according to parent material particle size distribution degree of weathering and management practices decrease in water soluble and exchangeable k fractions with increasing soil depth has also been reported by sharma et al 2006 and reza et al 2014 irrigation and k fertilization exerted significant impact on nutrient uptake and maize grain yield optimality of the moisture condition emerged through irrigation at 50 asmd supported maximum maize grain yield while increasing k fertilization increased maize grain yield peaking at 150 kg ha 1 increasing moisture stress gradually decreased npk uptake by maize grain while all three macronutrients have shown increasing recoveries with increasing levels of k fertilization earlier workers have also reported the premiere role of soil moisture in facilitating soil availability and crop uptake of nutrients the grain yield and yield components of maize were markedly affected by irrigation treatments rivera hernandez et al 2010 moser et al 2006 variation in the soil water regime may greatly influence the concentrations of mineral nutrients in soil solutions and their uptake by plants wolt 1994 menéndez et al 1995 misra and tyler 1999 soliman 2006 found that change of irrigation levels from 40 to 80 asmd gives significant result for growth yield and yield components with insignificant differences between 60 and 80 of asmd patel et al 1985 obtained higher maize yield with irrigation at 25 rather than 50 or 75 depletion of available soil moisture aslam et al 2013 reported that in maize the interaction of drought and potassium levels was also statistically significant for leaf area the interactive effect of potassium on shoot fresh weight of maize hybrids under drought levels was also found statistically significant kumar and dey 2011 reported that n p and k uptake was positively affected by irrigation amount and method and found that maximum nutrient uptake occurred in an optimum irrigated treatment while the rainfed treatment had the least nutrient uptake in general drought stress induced substantial decreases in k uptake by the maize plant at different stages ge et al 2012 moisture is needed for k to move to plant roots for uptake moisture is needed for root growth through the soil to new supplies of k it is needed for mass flow movement of k to the plant roots with water and for the diffusion of k to the roots to resupply that taken up by the roots drought stress or excess moisture reduces k availability and uptake by crops increasing soil k levels can help overcome the adverse effects ipni 1998 of drought increase in n and p uptake with addition of external of k fertilizer can be explained by the interaction of these nutrients with k in soil in zimbabwe burkersroda 1965 demonstrated striking result that when the rate of nitrogen was increased on a k deficient soil the yield declined to a totally unacceptable level unless k was applied di and cameron 2004 in their study on the effect of nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide dcd on cation leaching in grazed grassland of an udic haplustept of new zealand postulated that the leaching losses of nitrate was positively correlated with the leaching losses of k ion gething 1993 also found large positive n k interactions in long term experiments in nigeria strombergerab et al 1994 examined the interactions of k with n and their effect on both growth and yield in maize and concluded that high k in conjunction with mixed n generally enhanced dry matter accumulation and nutrient uptake both n and k for all hybrids addition of k increased the p uptake in field experiment involving soybean wheat system srinivasa rao and subba rao 1999 di and cameron 2004 opined that at higher level of p fertilization 90 kg ha 1 year 1 k ion leached less compared to that at lower p fertilization 45 kg ha 1 year 1 a more simple p k interaction but perhaps of more widespread importance is their synergistic effect on yield phosphorus requires adequate levels of k for maximum crop response and also reported a potential k p interaction in the uptake vandamme et al 2014 in the present experiment the wue of maize was observed to increased with increasing water availability and k fertilization although usually wue are higher in water scarce situations and optimum irrigation scheduling improves wue wang et al 2002 zhang et al 2004 fang et al 2007 wue shows a high variation in response to irrigation across seasons and regions mainly due to varying annual rainfall soil type and other agronomic practices wang et al 2002 therefore the experimental results are site and season specific and may not be applicable to other growing seasons and other locations with different climate and soil conditions fang et al 2010 in most cases when water supply is fixed any management factor that increases yield will increase wue because evapotranspiration will be little affected by the management ritchie 1983 the nexus among irrigation and potassium in increasing wue have already been studied about four decades ago viets 1972 adequately k fertilized plants show higher drought tolerance lahiri 1980 and increased wue barraclough 1989 heitholt 1989 however andersen et al 1992 observed that water use efficiency for total dry matter production was increased by k application but the same for grain production was unaffected by the level of k application wue varied significantly with the age of the plants and was significantly affected by drought and by different nutrient regimes drought increased wue in all nutrient treatments the effects of differential nutrition were more obvious in drought treatments than in well watered treatments however in our study the effects of different k management treatments were similar whether the plants were well watered or drought affected no significant interaction between fertilization and water regime signifying the additive role of k on moisture availability to plants 5 conclusion yield of and water use by maize was observed to be largely influenced by exposure to moisture stresses in situations where irrigation is not adequate assured k fertilization played a significant role in improving yield wue and nutrient use by maize all recoverable soil k pools greatly influence k availability uptake and yield of maize receiving adequate irrigation while water soluble and exchangeable k emerged as significant factors influencing yield of and k uptake by maize exposed to moisture stresses under inadequate irrigation acknowledgement the authors would like to thank international plant nutrition institute ipni for providing financial and technical assistance during the course of experimentation
