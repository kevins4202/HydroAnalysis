10645,agroforestry of fruit tree crops are widely used in the ecological construction of returning farmland to forestry in the loess plateau area but disagreement persists over the water relationship between fruit tree and crops to explore the rationality of fruit tree and crop intercropping the stable isotopes were used to investigate the water sources of apple trees and corn in apple tree monoculture a corn monoculture c and apple corn combination ac and the wue of vegetation the results indicated that the water source of apple tree was not significantly different between a and ac though the utilization of water sources of corn in c was higher than that of ac the layers of 60 80 cm 20 9 25 9 and 80 100 cm 22 8 24 7 were the major water source of the apple tree while the corn also had two fixed water sources of 20 40 cm 18 8 33 1 and 40 60 cm 20 6 33 7 during the growth period in addition the apple tree mainly absorbed water from 40 60 cm 21 8 24 9 in the early and middle growth stages and from 100 200 cm 19 7 21 1 the in late growth stages the corn predominantly used water from 0 20 cm 20 5 26 4 in the early growth stages and from 60 80 cm 17 2 42 5 in the middle and late growth stages this indicates that there were competitions for water sources at 40 80 cm between apple tree and corn during the growth season the water use efficiency wue indicated that compound planting can improve the wue of apple tree and corn the wue of corn in compound planting was 3 03 5 26 higher than that of monoculture though the wue of apple trees in combination was higher than that of monoculture only when the soil water content was low to achieve better ecological and economic benefits 40 80 cm should be frequently sub irrigated in the compound of apple tree and corn keywords agroforestry water source wue apple tree corn 1 introduction agroforestry is widely used as a traditional and emerging land use method david et al 2013 the agroforestry can resolve the competition between agriculture and forestry for land space improve land use efficiency and create more economic and ecological benefits charbonnier et al 2017 the nutrient water and spatial relationships among species are considered as important interspecific relationships in agroforestry however the water relationship between species is considered to be an significant factor in measuring the stability and productivity of agroforestry iglesias and garrote 2015 fan et al 2018 water availability and interspecific competition for water can restrict the growth of agroforestry probability especially in poor drought or poor standing conditions of soil furthermore agroforestry increased the transpiration of the system causing water shortage in arid areas or seasonal arid zone the unreasonable tree species in the system can have a strong water absorption capacity which could seriously affect the water use of intercropped plants yu et al 2017 in the majority of agroforestry perennial fruit trees are introduced into farmland and intercropped with annual crops to form compound planting wei et al 2016 the agroforestry can effectively improve the microclimate of farmland and the micro environment such as soil water content swc which may have an impact on the water sources and wue of plants stocker et al 2018 a number of crops obtained water from variable water sources and had different water requirement liu et al 2018a b liu et al 2019 demonstrated that arbor with deep roots exhibited considerable plasticity for water uptake and predominantly preferred to uptake water from deep soil layer introduction of a tree with a large amount of transpiration into the single crop farmland ecosystem could lead to greater competition for water therefore choosing a suitable intercropping plant could avoid water competition and improve wue of the plant most past studies investigated the species allocation isaac et al 2014 bargués et al 2016 nutrient wu et al 2017 isaac and borden 2019 and economic benefits of agroforestry mo et al 2018 whereas it is still unclear as to the water relationship of water sources and wue in agroforestry the agroforestry of apple tree and corn is widely used in returning the grain plots to forestry in the loess plateau this agroforestry accounts for more than one third of the formerly cultivated land and creates more economic and ecological benefits in the region however water shortage due to the low annual precipitation and poor irrigation conditions restricts the sustainable development of forestry and agriculture therefore it is critical to investigate the rationality of agroforestry plant intercropping in the context of water source and wue of vegetation the objectives of this study were to i investigate the water sources for apple trees and corn and explore whether there is water competition between them in an agroforestry ii compare the wue of apple trees and corn in monoculture and compound planting and determine whether agroforestry improves the wue of both the outcomes of this study provide fundamental knowledge for the development of efficient and stable agroforestry in this area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the study area is located in mountain orchard in hezhuangping town baota district yan an city in the typical hilly and gully region of the loess plateau and has a temperate continental monsoon climate fig 1 the average elevation of the study area is 380 m with an average annual precipitation of 536 9 mm and about 70 0 of the precipitation occurs in june to september the average annual temperature sunshine hours and the average annual potential evapotranspiration in this area are 9 2 2418 h and 1723 9 mm respectively in this area most of the corn farmlands are converted to forestry through intercropping with apple trees the soil texture of the treatments was similar which was loess soil with thicker soil layer reaching 50 m 2 2 experimental design there were three treatments and each treatment has three repetitions in the open orchards or farmland fig 2 apple tree monoculture a and apple corn combination ac were the two planting patterns used in orchard the corn monoculture was the main crop in farmland c the linear distance between orchard and farmland was 1 7 km the age of apple trees was about 15 years with the average height and diameter at breast height dbh of 3 8 m and 16 4 cm respectively the line spacing for apple tree and corn were 4 m 5 m and 0 5 m 0 6 m respectively three duplicate plots 20 m 20 m were selected for sampling in each treatment of a c and ac in this region april to november was referred to as the growing season for the apple tree and corn may july and september were the flowering stage fruit enlargement stage and maturation stage for the apple trees respectively and were the emergence stage heading stage and mature stage of corn respectively the three growth stages for apple tree and corn were called early middle and late growth stages 2 3 collection of soil and stem samples in each plot of treatment soil and stem samples were collected in the typical sunny days of the early middle and late growth stages in 2017 from the three sampling points fig 2 red dot there were eight times for samplings twice a week in each growth stage three tree stem samples from the apple tree were collected at the average height and dbh at each sampling point whereas three stem samples from corn were collected at randomly selected average heights and base diameters three soil sampling sites were randomly selected near selected plants and soil samples were collected with 120 cm long and 3 5 cm inner diameter drills according to soil depth of 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm 80 100 cm 100 120 cm 120 160 cm 160 200 cm 200 240 cm 240 280 cm and 280 320 cm a portion of the soil samples was placed in an aluminum box to measure swc while the rest was placed in centrifugal tubes sealed with parafilm m and refrigerated in freezer for isotope determination 2 4 determination of hydrogen and oxygen isotope value hydrogen and oxygen isotopes were determined in the ecohydrological process and mechanism laboratory of beijing forestry university firstly the green part of the stems was removed followed by the extraction of water from the stems and soil using low temperature vacuum condensation dry soil samples with insufficient moisture to meet the minimum requirement for testing had undergone another round of sample extraction hydrogen and oxygen isotope values of extracted water samples were determined by the liquid water isotope analyzer dlt 100 lgr inc usa the difference between measured hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios in water samples and the standard mean ocean water smow was in the order of 1000 cm the measurement errors for hydrogen and oxygen isotope values were 0 3 and 0 1 respectively the isotopic ratio was expressed as 1 δ x r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d r s t a n d a r d 1000 0 00 where x represents 2h or 18o and r represents the molar isotopic value 2h h or 18o 16o of the sample or the standard standard mean ocean water 2 5 determination of carbon isotope value there was a good linear relationship between δ13c and wue of the leaf therefore δ13c of leaf isotope can be used to measure the wue of a plant while collecting branch samples three leaves were collected from the canopy of the selected apple tree and corn and were dried in the oven in the laboratory at 105 for 15 min then at 60 to a constant amount each dried leaf was crushed with an agate mortar and an automatic ball mill and the crushed sample was sifted through 80 meshes carbon isotope values of leaves samples were measured by stable carbon isotope analyzer ccia 36d ep los gatos research inc u s a the measurement errors for carbon isotope values were 0 03 the results from the isotope ratio deviations were presented using the common δ notation 2 δ r s a m p l e r r e f e r e n c e 1 1000 0 00 where rsample and sreference were the ratio of the 13c to 12c isotopes in the sample and the reference of the pee dee belemnite standard 2 6 measurement of root length density of apple tree and corn the root samples of apple tree and corn were collected by root drill with an inner diameter of 10 cm in the sampling point in monoculture and compound system respectively since the root growth of apple trees and corn is different the root samples for apple trees were collected at the depth of 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm 80 100 cm 100 120 cm 120 140 cm 140 160 cm 160 180 cm and 180 200 cm in vertical direction and 0 50 cm 50 100 cm 100 150 cm and 150 200 cm in horizontal direction in contrast the root samples for corn were extracted at the depth of 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm 80 100 cm 100 120 cm 120 140 cm in vertical direction and 0 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 45 cm and 45 60 cm in horizontal direction the root length was scanned with the root system analysis winrhizo ec canada and the root density ρl cm cm3 was calculated as follows 1 ρ l l v where l and v were the total length of the root system in soil cm and soil volume cm3 respectively 2 7 data analysis since water in the stem of the plant mainly comes from soil water absorbed by roots the isotope value of water in the stem is a mixture of isotope values of different water sources therefore according to the principle of isotope mass conservation the water utilization of trees can be calculated by multiple linear iso source models according to the similarity of isotope values water sources with no significant differences in isotope values can be merged into the same water source the computational principle of this model can be expressed as 2 δ x c 1 δ s 1 c 2 δ s 2 c 3 δ s 3 c 4 δ s 4 c 5 δ s 5 c 6 δ s 6 c 7 δ s 7 3 c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 c 5 c 6 c 7 1 where δx is the isotopic values of water in the stem while the δs1 δs2 δs3 δs4 δs5 δs6 and δs7 are the isotopic values of soil depth of 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm 80 100 cm 100 200 cm and 200 300 cm respectively c1 c7 are the utilization ratios of trees to potential water sources statistical analyses were performed with spss 16 0 descriptive statistics were used to calculate means and standard deviations for each set of replicates two way anovas were used to test the differences in the swc n 216 oxygen isotopic values n 24 ρl n 3 and water source n 72 with soil depths and treatments as factors similarly one way anovas were used to analyze for differences in the δ13c of the leaf n 216 among the treatments the least significant difference method was used to compare the proportions of feasible water sources and δ13c of the leaf where necessary the data were tested for normal distribution and homogeneity to ensure that the data met the requirements of the variance analysis 3 results 3 1 variation in meteorological characteristics the precipitation and temperature increased first and then decreased with the season fig 3 the total precipitation in 2017 was 400 mm with about 95 occurring in april to october wet season precipitation in april july and september sampling period were 59 8 mm 86 2 mm and 42 4 mm respectively and accounted for 12 38 17 84 and 8 77 of the annual precipitation respectively the annual average temperature was 10 56 the average daily temperature gradually increased with the seasonal variation from january to july and reached a maximum of 28 68 on july 14 then the average daily temperature gradually decreased with the seasonal change and reached its minimum of 11 52 on february 11 the average daily relative humidity during the year was 47 96 the average daily relative humidity showed a significant correlation with precipitation p 0 01 but not with temperature p 0 05 3 2 variation in swc and its isotope value the swc increased with the soil depth fig 4 while δ 18o values of soil water decreased with the soil depth during the study period fig 5 the average swc in the early stage was lower than that in the middle growth stage and higher than that in late growth stages the average swc of a was 14 00 and 13 41 in early and middle growth stages respectively which were 7 58 and 12 91 lower than those of ac respectively the average swc of a was 29 30 and 25 64 higher than those of c in early and middle growth stages respectively in the late growth stage the difference in swc between a and ac was not significant p 0 05 furthermore the swc of a and ac was 13 32 and 12 23 higher than that of c respectively the average δ18o of soil water in early growth stages were higher than those of middle and late growth stages p 0 05 but showed no significant difference between in middle and late growth stages p 0 05 the average δ18o values of soil water in a were 8 53 which were higher than those of ac of 9 56 and lower than those of c of 8 40 during the same period p 0 05 these findings indicate that the isotope fractionation in a was more significant than that in ac but not as significant as c the isotopic values of soil in 0 60 cm were larger than those of deep soil especially in c suggesting that the evaporative fractionation of 0 60 cm in c 8 48 to 2 82 was more visible than that in a 7 80 to 5 52 and ac 8 80 to 6 30 there was no significant difference in δ18o values of soil water in 200 300 cm for the same growth stages p 0 05 3 3 root distribution characteristics of apple tree and corn there was no significant difference in root of vegetation between monoculture and compound planting p 0 05 the root of the apple tree reached 200 cm in the horizontal direction and 200 cm in the vertical direction fig 6 a horizontal distribution was mainly concentrated in 0 50 cm whereas vertical distribution was primarily in between 0 120 cm within 0 50 cm horizontal distance the average root density for 0 120 cm was 0 30 cm cm3 which accounted for 54 21 of the total root distribution and three times higher than the average root length density of 120 200 cm the root between 120 and 200 cm vertical direction was less than 10 in contrast the root of corn can reach 60 cm in the horizontal direction and 130 cm in the vertical direction fig 6b most distributions were concentrated in 0 20 cm in the horizontal direction and 0 60 cm in the vertical direction which accounts for 79 41 of the total root distribution the proportion of root for 60 130 cm in the vertical direction was 7 55 3 4 water sources of apple tree and corn the iso source model results indicated that the water sources for apple tree and corn fluctuated with seasons fig 7 there was no significant difference in water sources of apple tree between a and ac p 0 05 the 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm layers were the major water sources of apple tree during the growth period the utilization ratios of these water sources were 20 9 25 9 and 22 8 24 7 respectively in addition the apple tree also mainly absorbed water from 40 to 60 cm 21 8 24 9 in early and middle growth stages and majorly from 100 to 200 cm 19 7 21 1 in late growth stages similar to the apple tree corn also had two fixed water sources at 20 40 cm 18 8 33 1 and 40 60 cm 20 6 33 7 throughout the growth period meanwhile the corn predominantly used water from 0 to 20 cm 20 5 26 4 in early growth stages and mainly from 60 to 80 cm 17 2 42 5 in middle and late growth stages 3 5 distribution characteristics of δ13c of apple tree and corn the δ13c for apple tree and corn fluctuated during the growth stages fig 8 the δ13c of corn was lower than that of apple tree during the study period p 0 05 indicating that the wue of apple tree was lower than that of corn the δ13c of apple tree between a and ac during the early and middle growth stages was not significantly different p 0 05 the δ13c of the apple tree in a was significantly lower than that of ac in the late growth stages p 0 05 the δ13c of corn in c was significantly lower than that of ac during the study period p 0 05 suggesting that the wue of corn in compound planting was higher than that of monoculture 4 discussion 4 1 water sources of apple tree and corn the iso source model indicated that 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm layers were the major sources of water for apple tree during the growth period fig 8 this water use patterns can be related to its root distribution and swc the root at the depth of 0 120 cm accounts for 54 21 of the total root fig 7 makes the higher absorption of water in these layers by trees cuneo et al 2018 except for two major water sources apple trees also used water from 40 60 cm in early and middle growth stages and uptake water from 100 200 cm in late growth stages fig 6 due to the different swc in the three growing stages this is because most roots can absorb water only when certain water conditions were satisfied maría et al 2019 the swc of corresponding soil layers in early and middle growth stages were significantly higher than that in late growth stages p 0 05 in addition apple tree absorbing shallow water consumed less energy than absorbing deep soil water probability this finding is similar to that of liu et al 2018 who indicated that the arbors preferred to take up water from the shallow layer under the same conditions of shallow and deep soil though the variation of isotopic values and swc showed that the influence of evaporation on shallow soil water was prominent than that on deep soil water figs 5 and 6 apple tree uses water from 40 60 cm to meet its physiological needs and absorbed water from 100 200 cm at this stage this indicates that the apple tree preferred water sources with higher water content liu et al 2017 also found that the broad leaved tree species in arid areas were inclined to use stable water source from deep soil layers with moist conditions the pattern in which apple trees can absorb multiple sources of water is called dimorphic root system the adjusting of water sources according to swc is beneficial for the survival of apple trees in the drought environment in contrast water sources of corn gradually deepened with the growth stages fig 8 corn obtained water from 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm during the study period which were shallower water sources than those of apples the water use pattern of corn could be mainly determined by its root in the early stages most primary root with strong water absorption ability was distributed in the 60 cm layer therefore the corn predominantly used water from 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm during this time in the middle growth stages corn absorbed from deep water sources than that of early growth stages since the primary root went deeper than that during the early growth stages liu et al 2018 also demonstrated that the root system was the determination factor of the water source of immature corn in the late growth stages the corn has no obvious main root system and the fibrous root system of corn can reach up to 130 cm in vertical direction 79 41 of which was concentrated in 0 60 cm fig 7 the water absorbed by corn in the late growth stage was deeper since the deep swc was higher than surface swc indicating that corn also tends to use water sources with high swc without the restriction of the root system the water use strategy of corn was similar to that of the apple tree in this study and is consistent with some perennial tree species reported by zeglin et al 2013 sardans and penuelas 2014 and wang et al 2017 previous studies suggested that the water source of vegetation changes when the swc reaches a certain threshold wu et al 2015 evaristo et al 2016 liu et al 2018a b however no significant difference was observed in the water source of apple tree and corn among a c and ac during the growth stages in this study p 0 05 this is because the difference of swc between the three treatments was not sufficient to change the water source of apple trees and corns this indicates that monoculture and apple corn combination did not have any significant effect on the water source of apple trees and corns the water sources of apple trees and corn suggested that the existence of water competition between apple trees and corns in 40 80 cm of the apple corn combination during the growth stages 4 2 wue of apple tree and corn previous studies have shown that wue is linearly positively related to δ13c of the c3 plants and corn c4 plants amani et al 2016 castagneri et al 2018 the δ13c values in this study indicated that the wue of corn was higher than that of the apple tree p 0 05 fig 8 this is because c4 plants corn have stronger carbon sequestration capacity than c3 plants apple tree past studies demonstrated that the wue of corn was about twice that of apple tree nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 benjamin et al 2015 ehleringer and dawson 2010 reported that wue was negatively correlated with water availability however the results of in this study showed that the correlation between wue and water availability was insignificant p 0 05 the δ13c of apple tree between a and ac was not significantly different in the early and middle growth stages p 0 05 due to the disturbance in different photosynthetic and transpiration at the fruit growth stage and the variation in water sources and competition for water in different seasons the wue of the apple tree in monoculture was significantly lower than that of compound planting in the late growth stages p 0 05 which may be the strategy for apple trees to adapt during drought čater and levanič 2013 also demonstrated that plant can improve wue under water deficit or low swc conditions maintaining high wue was an important strategy for plants to adapt to local habitats in arid areas jürgen et al 2017 in contrast the wue of corn in compound planting was higher than that of monoculture p 0 05 this is because the canopy shading formed by apple trees in the complex system can change the microclimate in the field by effectively reducing the surface water loss and the transpiration rate of corn leaves and thereby increasing the wue of corn abdulai et al 2018 this indicated that the water use strategy of corn was conservative john and hasenstein 2018 demonstrated that such plants can maintain a higher photosynthetic rate by regulating stomata under drought stress during the late growth stages with lower water content the corn with conservative water use strategies can improve wue to enhance water resources competition 5 conclusions in this study stable isotopes were used to identify the water sources and wue of vegetation under three planting patterns of apple tree monoculture corn monoculture and apple corn compounding this study found that difference in water source of apple tree between monoculture and compounding was not significant however the utilization of water sources in corn under compound planting was higher than that of monoculture the layers of 60 100 cm and 20 40 cm were the major water source of apple tree and corn respectively during the growth period the apple tree predominantly absorbed from 40 60 cm in the early and middle growth stages and from 100 200 cm in the late growth stages meanwhile the corn also predominantly used water from 0 20 cm in early growth stages and mainly from 60 80 cm in the middle and late growth stages the wue of corn in compound planting was 3 03 5 26 higher than that of monoculture the wue of apple trees planted in combination was higher than that of monoculture only when swc was low this study results indicated that the compound planting of the apple tree and corn can improve wue though there was a competition for water sources at 40 80 cm between apple tree and corn during the growing season therefore 40 80 cm layer should be regularly and precisely sub

average annual temperature sunshine hours and the average annual potential evapotranspiration in this area are 9 2 2418 h and 1723 9 mm respectively in this area most of the corn farmlands are converted to forestry through intercropping with apple trees the soil texture of the treatments was similar which was loess soil with thicker soil layer reaching 50 m 2 2 experimental design there were three treatments and each treatment has three repetitions in the open orchards or farmland fig 2 apple tree monoculture a and apple corn combination ac were the two planting patterns used in

average height and dbh at each sampling point whereas three stem samples from corn were collected at randomly selected average heights and base diameters three soil sampling sites were randomly selected near selected plants and soil samples were collected with 120 cm long and 3 5 cm inner diameter drills according to soil depth of 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm 80 100 cm 100 120 cm 120 160 cm 160 200 cm 200 240 cm 240 280 cm and 280 320 cm a portion of the soil samples was placed in an aluminum box to measure swc while the rest was placed in centrifugal tubes sealed with parafilm m and refrigerated in freezer for isotope determination 2 4 determination of hydrogen and oxygen isotope value hydrogen and oxygen isotopes were determined in the ecohydrological process and mechanism laboratory of beijing forestry university firstly the green part of the stems was removed followed by the extraction of water from the stems and soil using low temperature vacuum condensation dry soil samples with insufficient moisture to meet the minimum requirement for testing had undergone another round of sample extraction hydrogen and oxygen isotope values of extracted water samples were determined by the liquid water isotope analyzer dlt 100 lgr inc usa the difference between measured hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios in water samples and the standard mean ocean water smow was in the order of 1000 cm the measurement errors for hydrogen and oxygen isotope values were 0 3 and 0 1 respectively the isotopic ratio was expressed as 1 δ x r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d r s t a n d a r d 1000 0 00 where x represents 2h or 18o and r represents the molar isotopic value 2h h or 18o 16o of the sample or the standard standard mean ocean water 2 5 determination of carbon isotope value there was a good linear relationship between δ13c and wue of the leaf therefore δ13c of leaf isotope can be used to measure the wue of a plant while collecting branch samples three leaves were collected from the canopy of the selected apple tree and corn and were dried in the oven in the laboratory at 105 for 15 min then at 60 to a constant amount each dried leaf was crushed with an agate mortar and an automatic ball mill and the crushed sample was sifted through 80 meshes carbon isotope values of leaves samples were measured by stable carbon isotope analyzer ccia 36d ep los gatos research inc u s a the measurement errors for carbon isotope values were 0 03 the results from the isotope ratio deviations were presented using the common δ notation 2 δ r s a m p l e r r e f e r e n c e 1 1000 0 00 where rsample and sreference were the ratio of the 13c to 12c isotopes in the sample and the reference of the pee dee belemnite standard 2 6 measurement of root length density of apple tree and corn the root samples of apple tree and corn were collected by root drill with an inner diameter of 10 cm in the sampling point in monoculture and compound system respectively since the root growth of apple trees and corn is different the root samples for apple trees were collected at the depth of 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm 80 100 cm 100 120 cm 120 140 cm 140 160 cm 160 180 cm and 180 200 cm in vertical direction and 0 50 cm 50 100 cm 100 150 cm and 150 200 cm in horizontal direction in contrast the root samples for corn were extracted at the depth of 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm 80 100 cm 100 120 cm 120 140 cm in vertical direction and 0 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 45 cm and 45 60 cm in horizontal direction the root length was scanned with the root system analysis winrhizo ec canada and the root density ρl cm cm3 was calculated as follows 1 ρ l l v where l and v were the total length of the root system in soil cm and soil volume cm3 respectively 2 7 data analysis since water in the stem of the plant mainly comes from soil water absorbed by roots the isotope value of water in the stem is a mixture of isotope values of different water sources therefore according to the principle of isotope mass conservation the water utilization of trees can be calculated by multiple linear iso source models according to the similarity of isotope values water sources with no significant differences in isotope values can be merged into the same water source the computational principle of this model can be expressed as 2 δ x c 1 δ s 1 c 2 δ s 2 c 3 δ s 3 c 4 δ s 4 c 5 δ s 5 c 6 δ s 6 c 7 δ s 7 3 c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 c 5 c 6 c 7 1 where δx is the isotopic values of water in the stem while the δs1 δs2 δs3 δs4 δs5 δs6 and δs7 are the isotopic values of soil depth of 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm 80 100 cm 100 200 cm and 200 300 cm respectively c1 c7 are the utilization ratios of trees to potential water sources statistical analyses were performed with spss 16 0 descriptive statistics were used to calculate means and standard deviations for each set of replicates two way anovas were used to test the differences in the swc n 216 oxygen isotopic values n 24 ρl n 3 and water source n 72 with soil depths and treatments as factors similarly one way anovas were used to analyze for differences in the δ13c of the leaf n 216 among the treatments the least significant difference method was used to compare the proportions of feasible water sources and δ13c of the leaf where necessary the data were tested for normal distribution and homogeneity to ensure that the data met the requirements of the variance analysis 3 results 3 1 variation in meteorological characteristics the precipitation and temperature increased first and then decreased with the season fig 3 the total precipitation in 2017 was 400 mm with about 95 occurring in april to october wet season precipitation in april july and september sampling period were 59 8 mm 86 2 mm and 42 4 mm respectively and accounted for 12 38 17 84 and 8 77 of the annual precipitation respectively the annual average temperature was 10 56 the average daily temperature gradually increased with the seasonal variation from january to july and reached a maximum of 28 68 on july 14 then the average daily temperature gradually decreased with the seasonal change and reached its minimum of 11 52 on february 11 the average daily relative humidity during the year was 47 96 the average daily relative humidity showed a significant correlation with precipitation p 0 01 but not with temperature p 0 05 3 2 variation in swc and its isotope value the swc increased with the soil depth fig 4 while δ 18o values of soil water decreased with the soil depth during the study period fig 5 the average swc in the early stage was lower than that in the middle growth stage and higher than that in late growth stages the average swc of a was 14 00 and 13 41 in early and middle growth stages respectively which were 7 58 and 12 91 lower than those of ac respectively the average swc of a was 29 30 and 25 64 higher than those of c in early and middle growth stages respectively in the late growth stage the difference in swc between a and ac was not significant p 0 05 furthermore the swc of a and ac was 13 32 and 12 23 higher than that of c respectively the average δ18o of soil water in early growth stages were higher than those of middle and late growth stages p 0 05 but showed no significant difference between in middle and late growth stages p 0 05 the average δ18o values of soil water in a were 8 53 which were higher than those of ac of 9 56 and lower than those of c of 8 40 during the same period p 0 05 these findings indicate that the isotope fractionation in a was more significant than that in ac but not as significant as c the isotopic values of soil in 0 60 cm were larger than those of deep soil especially in c suggesting that the evaporative fractionation of 0 60 cm in c 8 48 to 2 82 was more visible than that in a 7 80 to 5 52 and ac 8 80 to 6 30 there was no significant difference in δ18o values of soil water in 200 300 cm for the same growth stages p 0 05 3 3 root distribution characteristics of apple tree and corn there was no significant difference in root of vegetation between monoculture and compound planting p 0 05 the root of the apple tree reached 200 cm in the horizontal direction and 200 cm in the vertical direction fig 6 a horizontal distribution was mainly concentrated in 0 50 cm whereas vertical distribution was primarily in between 0 120 cm within 0 50 cm horizontal distance the average root density for 0 120 cm was 0 30 cm cm3 which accounted for 54 21 of the total root distribution and three times higher than the average root length density of 120 200 cm the root between 120 and 200 cm vertical direction was less than 10 in contrast the root of corn can reach 60 cm in the horizontal direction and 130 cm in the vertical direction fig 6b most distributions were concentrated in 0 20 cm in the horizontal direction and 0 60 cm in the vertical direction which accounts for 79 41 of the total root distribution the proportion of root for 60 130 cm in the vertical direction was 7 55 3 4 water sources of apple tree and corn the iso source model results indicated that the water sources for apple tree and corn fluctuated with seasons fig 7 there was no significant difference in water sources of apple tree between a and ac p 0 05 the 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm layers were the major water sources of apple tree during the growth period the utilization ratios of these water sources were 20 9 25 9 and 22 8 24 7 respectively in addition the apple tree also mainly absorbed water from 40 to 60 cm 21 8 24 9 in early and middle growth stages and majorly from 100 to 200 cm 19 7 21 1 in late growth stages similar to the apple tree corn also had two fixed water sources at 20 40 cm 18 8 33 1 and 40 60 cm 20 6 33 7 throughout the growth period meanwhile the corn predominantly used water from 0 to 20 cm 20 5 26 4 in early growth stages and mainly from 60 to 80 cm 17 2 42 5 in middle and late growth stages 3 5 distribution characteristics of δ13c of apple tree and corn the δ13c for apple tree and corn fluctuated during the growth stages fig 8 the δ13c of corn was lower than that of apple tree during the study period p 0 05 indicating that the wue of apple tree was lower than that of corn the δ13c of apple tree between a and ac during the early and middle growth stages was not significantly different p 0 05 the δ13c of the apple tree in a was significantly lower than that of ac in the late growth stages p 0 05 the δ13c of corn in c was significantly lower than that of ac during the study period p 0 05 suggesting that the wue of corn in compound planting was higher than that of monoculture 4 discussion 4 1 water sources of apple tree and corn the iso source model indicated that 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm layers were the major sources of water for apple tree during the growth period fig 8 this water use patterns can be related to its root distribution and swc the root at the depth of 0 120 cm accounts for 54 21 of the total root fig 7 makes the higher absorption of water in these layers by trees cuneo et al 2018 except for two major water sources apple trees also used water from 40 60 cm in early and middle growth stages and uptake water from 100 200 cm in late growth stages fig 6 due to the different swc in the three growing stages this is because most roots can absorb water only when certain water conditions were satisfied maría et al 2019 the swc of corresponding soil layers in early and middle growth stages were significantly higher than that in late growth stages p 0 05 in addition apple tree absorbing shallow water consumed less energy than absorbing deep soil water probability this finding is similar to that of liu et al 2018 who indicated that the arbors preferred to take up water from the shallow layer under the same conditions of shallow and deep soil though the variation of isotopic values and swc showed that the influence of evaporation on shallow soil water was prominent than that on deep soil water figs 5 and 6 apple tree uses water from 40 60 cm to meet its physiological needs and absorbed water from 100 200 cm at this stage this indicates that the apple tree preferred water sources with higher water content liu et al 2017 also found that the broad leaved tree species in arid areas were inclined to use stable water source from deep soil layers with moist conditions the pattern in which apple trees can absorb multiple sources of water is called dimorphic root system the adjusting of water sources according to swc is beneficial for the survival of apple trees in the drought environment in contrast water sources of corn gradually deepened with the growth stages fig 8 corn obtained water from 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm during the study period which were shallower water sources than those of apples the water use pattern of corn could be mainly determined by its root in the early stages most primary root with strong water absorption ability was distributed in the 60 cm layer therefore the corn predominantly used water from 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm during this time in the middle growth stages corn absorbed from deep water sources than that of early growth stages since the primary root went deeper than that during the early growth stages liu et al 2018 also demonstrated that the root system was the determination factor of the water source of immature corn in the late growth stages the corn has no obvious main root system and the fibrous root system of corn can reach up to 130 cm in vertical direction 79 41 of which was concentrated in 0 60 cm fig 7 the water absorbed by corn in the late growth stage was deeper since the deep swc was higher than surface swc indicating that corn also tends to use water sources with high swc without the restriction of the root system the water use strategy of corn was similar to that of the apple tree in this study and is consistent with some perennial tree species reported by zeglin et al 2013 sardans and penuelas 2014 and wang et al 2017 previous studies suggested that the water source of vegetation changes when the swc reaches a certain threshold wu et al 2015 evaristo et al 2016 liu et al 2018a b however no significant difference was observed in the water source of apple tree and corn among a c and ac during the growth stages in this study p 0 05 this is because the difference of swc between the three treatments was not sufficient to change the water source of apple trees and corns this indicates that monoculture and apple corn combination did not have any significant effect on the water source of apple trees and corns the water sources of apple trees and corn suggested that the existence of water competition between apple trees and corns in 40 80 cm of the apple corn combination during the growth stages 4 2 wue of apple tree and corn previous studies have shown that wue is linearly positively related to δ13c of the c3 plants and corn c4 plants amani et al 2016 castagneri et al 2018 the δ13c values in this study indicated that the wue of corn was higher than that of the apple tree p 0 05 fig 8 this is because c4 plants corn have stronger carbon sequestration capacity than c3 plants apple tree past studies demonstrated that the wue of corn was about twice that of apple tree nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 benjamin et al 2015 ehleringer and dawson 2010 reported that wue was negatively correlated with water availability however the results of in this study showed that the correlation between wue and water availability was insignificant p 0 05 the δ13c of apple tree between a and ac was not significantly different in the early and middle growth stages p 0 05 due to the disturbance in different photosynthetic and transpiration at the fruit growth stage and the variation in water sources and competition for water in different seasons the wue of the apple tree in monoculture was significantly lower than that of compound planting in the late growth stages p 0 05 which may be the strategy for apple trees to adapt during drought čater and levanič 2013 also demonstrated that plant can improve wue under water deficit or low swc conditions maintaining high wue was an important strategy for plants to adapt to local habitats in arid areas jürgen et al 2017 in contrast the wue of corn in compound planting was higher than that of monoculture p 0 05 this is because the canopy shading formed by apple trees in the complex system can change the microclimate in the field by effectively reducing the surface water loss and the transpiration rate of corn leaves and thereby increasing the wue of corn abdulai et al 2018 this indicated that the water use strategy of corn was conservative john and hasenstein 2018 demonstrated that such plants can maintain a higher photosynthetic rate by regulating stomata under drought stress during the late growth stages with lower water content the corn with conservative water use strategies can improve wue to enhance water resources competition 5 conclusions in this study stable isotopes were used to identify the water sources and wue of vegetation under three planting patterns of apple tree monoculture corn monoculture and apple corn compounding this study found that difference in water source of apple tree between monoculture and compounding was not significant however the utilization of water sources in corn under compound planting was higher than that of monoculture the layers of 60 100 cm and 20 40 cm were the major water source of apple tree and corn respectively during the growth period the apple tree predominantly absorbed from 40 60 cm in the early and middle growth stages and from 100 200 cm in the late growth stages meanwhile the corn also predominantly used water from 0 20 cm in early growth stages and mainly from 60 80 cm in the middle and late growth stages the wue of corn in compound planting was 3 03 5 26 higher than that of monoculture the wue of apple trees planted in combination was higher than that of monoculture only when swc was low this study results indicated that the compound planting of the apple tree and corn can improve wue though there was a competition for water sources at 40 80 cm between apple tree and corn during the growing season therefore 40 80 cm layer should be regularly and precisely sub

10646,the analysis of the electrophysiological activity of plants permits a real time information of the plant status e g light availability and water stress however even though it is clear that the role of the electrical signals in plant is crucial especially in processes involving the propagation of rapid signals a systematic approach for the interpretation of the electrical patterns is still missing in this work a multi electrodes approach has been applied to study the electrical signals in olive trees plants subjected to three different level of water stress in particular by using specific water irrigation regimes a control group a mid mild stressed group and a high stressed group have been monitored and subsequently subjected to a long period of prolonged drought stress physiological parameters and electrical activity have been continuously monitored for the whole experiment to highlight any correlation between the electric signal and the water stress our results showed that it has been possible to differentiate the electric signals related to drought conditions of different intensity i e control mild and high in particular we have found that the average daily relative electrical resistance change the opposite of the electrical conductance is directly related to the drought stress whilst the signal variance increases during the period of main water stress additionally a proposed signal classification system has been successfully able to detect the absence presence of stress and to effectively recognize daily class samples 93 control 76 mild and 80 high the set up could provide a useful tool for monitoring water conditions in plants and has several potential applications for sensor and automatic system in greenhouse or field able to monitor directly the plant water status keywords plant electrical signal stem resistance drought stress olea europaea signal classification 1 introduction 1 1 electrical signaling in plant the propagation of electrical signals in plant is an important system used to transfer information about the environmental stimuli perceived by the sensory system and spread it along different and remote organs fromm and lautner 2007 to date abundant studies have highlighted that the role of the electrical signals in plant is crucial in response to biotic or abiotic stress condition especially in processes involving the propagation of signals such as light stimuli datta and palit 2004 gurovich and hermosilla 2009 chatterjee et al 2014 water accessibility fromm and eschrich 1988 grams et al 2007 oyarce and gurovich 2010 osmo regulation schroeder and hedrich 1989 temperature volkov et al 2012 kai et al 2011 gravity masi et al 2015 mechanical touch damages and insect attack brenner et al 2006 volkov et al 2007 it has already been proved that different environmental stimuli produce typical responses in living cells generating specific electrical signals fromm et al 2005 lautner et al 2005 fromm and fei 2009 for that reason the use of plant as biosensors has been theorized volkov and ranatunga 2006 davies 2004 gurovich 2009 and attempts for the classifications of these signals exist chatterjee et al 2015 moreover whilst the chemical signalling involving compounds are not appropriated to respond rapidly to environmental stress factors because are slower and localized e g hormones electrical signals can be quickly diffused and propagate over long distances throughout different plant organs and their analysis is a promising candidate for the study of early stress responses additional researches by monitoring the electrophysiological activity of plants have already performed successful non destructive methodologies to gather real time information of the plant status e g light availability and water stress for the construction of automatic irrigation systems nadler et al 2008 oyarce and gurovich 2010 ríos rojas et al 2014 or have used plant as sensor for particular stimulus e g light ozone exposure saline stress chatterjee et al 2014 morosi et al 2015 dolfi et al 2015 wang et al 2019 however even though it is clear that the role of the electrical signals in plant is crucial especially in processes involving the propagation of rapid signals a systematic approach for the interpretation of the electrical patterns is still missing the levels of complexity and dynamics of electrical activity both temporal when and spatial where and how the signal propagates make data analysis more complicated for this reason recent researches and findings have been directed to all ionic currents generated at different level of the plant organization that recently have been classified as plant electrome de loof 2016 and souza et al 2017 indeed several mechanism and responses of different nature e g chemical hydraulic electrical etc have been associated with abiotic stress as water stress and it is still very difficult to evaluate the effects derived by different related biochemical and molecular pathways these modifications involve physiological and or morphological factors that affect the electrical properties of the plant tissue and have been subjected to numerous investigations in various cases the measurement of the electrical resistance of the plant tissues has been used to estimate their physiological features for example gora et al 2017 have reported a correlation between the trunk resistance of tree in tropical and temperate climates and the damages derived from lighting strikes these studies clearly reported that the resistance values are linked to morphological and physical characteristics of the plants in particular to the cell dimension and to the presence of water in the tissues nadler et al 2008 and the solutes concentration gora et al 2017 similar principles have been shown in studies that have tried to detect modifications or damages in cells or plant tissues azzarello et al 2012 or in the whole plant ben hamed et al 2016 by measuring the impedance 1 2 water stress in plant water is a fundamental resource for all plants and water shortage is one of the stresses that leads to greater physiological damage and which more compromises the productivity of crops the main stress factors caused during drought stress influence the internal plant water potential causing the closure of the stomata followed by reduced gas exchanges that implies an altered status of limited photosynthetic activity and metabolism all these conditions can be translated later in permanent damages if drought last over time or can culminate in the plant death depending on several elements e g plant species growth stage duration etc jaleel et al 2008 tátrai et al 2016 the stomatal closure is the simplest defense of a plant to limited water availability as it allows to minimize the loss by transpiration plant turgor or leaf water potential have been used in the past as indicators of water status but it has been demonstrated that some plants can have turgor identical or higher than those of well watered and still present a reduced growth but have much lower stomatal conductance for this reason leaf conductance measurement has been suggested as preferable indicator of plant drought stress davies and zhang 1991 thomas et al 1989 several researches have showed a reduced photosynthesis rate in plant subjected to low medium intensity drought stress that are usually caused by stomatal constrictions and non stomatal dependent constriction situations of intense drought stress wang et al 2018 degl innocenti et al 2009 misson et al 2010 but relatively few works have investigated the correlation between electrical activity and stomatal conductance at different drought stress levels the plant hormone abscisic acid aba is considered to be strongly correlated with the decrease in stomatal conductance in drought stress and it is well known that it plays a crucial role in the regulation of the stomatal behaviour of water stressed conditions wilkinson and davies 2002 jiang and hartung 2007 brunetti et al 2018 nevertheless it should be noticed that both short term and long term signaling that occurs during water stress is very complex and aba is not the only signal related to the process which involves the coordination of numerous elements as plants need to react to various environmental conditions to adjust the stomatal aperture based on the surroundings kuromori et al 2018 1 3 objective of the work the study of electrical signals generated by plants subjected to drought stress is a very innovative topic but still clear methodologies for signal interpretation are missing the analysis of the electric properties of different zones of the stem trucks have been used to enhance water utilization and efficiency in open field by their correlation with stomata conductance and plant internal water flux gibert et al 2006 oyarce and gurovich 2010 and could potentially be used for early detection of water stress this study aims to elucidate long term electrical analysis related to water stress the analysis of the physiological status of each plant has been used to correlate different drought stress intensities with specific electrical patterns it is based on a continuous monitoring of several plants in vivo in a non destructive way for a long period through a new set up that consists of a multi electrodes system able to detect the electrical resistance signal and its variance on several plants or in different zones of the same plant thus after storing all data for the whole period days or weeks a statistical analysis based on a systematic approach of intervals analysis have been used for the interpretation of the stem electrical signal patterns in response to different levels of water stress finally the analysis of electric signal resistance and variance in olive trees plants subjected to different level of water stress has been used to simulate an automatic detection of the plant status and evaluate their potential applications in field 2 material and methods 2 1 plant material growing conditions and experimental plan trials have been conducted on rooted plant cuttings of olea europaea l plants cv picholine measuring about 80 120 cm in height the plants have been purchased after being grown on small pot 13 13 18 cm in a mix of 50 peat and 50 pumice added with minced horns and fingernails of animals cornunghia and calcium carbonate lime amendments the plants have been watered and kept a week to adapt to the new growth chamber conditions before starting the experiment the growing conditions have been maintained at day night light cycle of 14 h 10 h par of 200 250 μmol m 2 s 1 and temperature of 20 5 2 c during the day and 18 3 2 c during the night the trial has been kept and monitored for about two months all photosynthesis and conductance measurements have been performed with a portable photosynthesis system for gas exchange li cor 6400xt li cor biosciences usa fig 1 these data have been used for the interpretation of the electrical signal by correlating the plant status to specific electrical patterns during gas exchange measurements the light level inside the leaf chamber was maintained at par of 500 μmol m 2 s 1 and air flow rate of 400 μmol s 1 for the water stress treatments we used a modified methodology used by sinclair and brilli sinclair and ludlow 1986 brilli et al 2007 in details at the start of the experiment all pots have been saturated with water kept about 4 h to drain and weighted to determine the initial saturated hydrated weight of the pot 100 pot water capacity subsequently each pot has been wrapped in a plastic bag that has been bonded around the stem to avoid evaporation from the soil in order to monitor only the amount of water removed by the plant fig 2 three levels of water stress have been tested by unwrapping the plastic bag and adding water at different quantities and periods considering the pot water capacity weight equivalent to 100 as the water saturated weight initial pot weight to determine the exact amount of water in the soil at which the plant was not anymore able to support transpiration without face water stress we have monitored the conductance to determine the minimum fraction of transpirable soil water ftsw defined when value of stomatal conductance comes close to zero final pot weight then the ftsw was calculated for each single pot as ftsw daily pot weight final pot weight initial pot weight final pot weight sinclair and ludlow 1986 brilli et al 2013 following these calculation fifteen plants have been divided in three groups each of 5 plants 1 control plants that have been regularly watered up to reach the weight of about 80 of the ftsw the other two groups have been watered immediately after ftws was declining to almost zero signal of water stress and restored at different ftsw percent respectively 2 a group referred as mild stressed plants that have been re watered at about 40 of the ftsw and 3 the last group of high stressed plants that have been watered at about 20 of the ftsw control plants have not been subjected to any stress prior the two weeks prolonged drought stress therefore their stomatal conductance never reached zero the measure of the whole set of pots was used to estimate the approximate final pot weight of the control group thus the water content at the stress point finally after two re watering regimes described above for the mild and high stress plant all plants have been subjected to a prolonged period of drought stress at day 33 34 for about 3 weeks to evaluate how the different initial water regimes have influenced the adaptation to a prolonged drought stress finally all plants have been fully re watered to recover by keeping each pot for one minute immerged in water whilst pipetting 10 ml of water on the soil surface and then wait fifteen minutes to drain each plant back to about 50 60 of the ftsw 2 2 relative water content the relative water content measurement has been performed at the end of the experiment for each plant in particular leaves have been collected after 3 days following the recovery phase plants abundantly irrigated after the final prolonged drought stress the relative water content rwc of the leaves in each plant has been calculated as the ratio of fresh leaves weight fw measured immediately after harvesting the leaves turgid weight tw obtained by sinking all leaves in demineralized water for 48 h and dry weight obtained by keeping the leaves at 45 c for 48 h the formula used was rwc 100 fw dw tw dw the rwc has been calculated separately for leaves of the upper part and leaves from the lower part of each plant this approach has been used because it has been observed that the bottom leaves of each plant have been the most affected by the water stress in particular four leaves for each plant have been collected and used to calculate the rwc n 4 from the top part collected between the 2nd and 5th node and another group of leaves n 4 from the bottom mid part collected from the 6th and the 10th node of each plant fig 3 relative water content has

photosynthesis system for gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements li cor biosciences usa has been used the measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence have been performed regularly on all plants to obtain additional information about the physiological status of the plant namely to highlight any damage to the photosynthetic apparatus and the ability of plant to restore quickly to their normal physiological status from temporary problems that aroused during the water stress fig 6 all parameters fo fm fs fm and fo from each plant for each day of measurements have been achieved using a leaf chamber fluorometer both in dark 1 h before the start of the day cycle light off and in light condition 1 h after the start of the day cycle light on the li cor by default is able to provide several calculated parameters among them fv fm fv fm φpsii phips2 qp npq and etr basically the maximum fluorescence in dark fm and the minimum level of fluorescence fo were obtained in dark and variable fluorescence fv was calculated as the difference between fm and fo then all other parameters have been calculated by the data obtained in light condition e g fm and fo following the formulas that have been already deeply described see for example maxwell and johnson 2000 oxborough 2004 fig 4 fluorescence analysis has been processed with anova applying a tukey s post test p 0 05 using prism 8 software graphpad software usa 2 4 electrical activity the acquisition of the electrical activity has been performed using stainless steel needle emg like non isolated electrodes length 10 mm which have been connected to a modular data acquisition system daq consisted of a remote controller chassis with a multiplexer terminal block and a digital multimeter respectively model pxi 1033 tb 2605 pxi 4065 national instruments corporation which permits ac dc voltage and 2wires resistance measurements in particular during the data acquisition each pair of electrodes has been maintained at a fixed distance of 0 9 cm using a plastic support and inserted at the base of the stem of each plant fig 5 this distance is chosen based on the electrical signal measure and is influenced by the stem variability and how the electrodes is implanted it needs to be previously calibrated to be in the range of the instruments to maintain enough resolution without go out of scale this set up has been chosen in order to simplify the complexity that arise from measuring the electrical property of a certain material as it is influenced by its length structure and content e g electrolytes solutes etc in this kind of measurements distance between the two electrodes is a key factor and it may be subjected to a change due to the plant stem elongation wang et al 2009 in our case given the plant growth negligible distance can been assumed as constant 2 5 electrical measurements data analysis data analysis of the electrical activity has been performed on the whole dataset that included all data collected one acquisition every 2 min each plant initial resistance signal values were different for this reason to permit a comparison of all the data the relative change respect their initial value has been used in detail for each plant a baseline signal has been extrapolated as the average of 3 days resistance signals registered when the plant was in good health this has been subtracted to the successive data for example if a plant when healthy had a 3 days average signal of 2 ω and it reached 2 5 ω a relative change of 0 5 ω would have been considered therefore the relative changes have been calculated for each plant and the average group signal changes have been reported for each treatment fig 6 for the daily variance analysis the data have been grouped for each day where the initial value was considered the start of the light cycle in particular to evaluate the variability of the signal the daily signal variance has been calculated for every plant and each treatment average has been reported fig 7 for the cluster analysis fig 8 all average daily values have been represented according to their value of signal resistance and variance in particular a threshold limit of 10 ω for the resistance and 1 for the variance has been set therefore all points that were over this threshold have been considered exactly 10 ω for the resistance and 1 for the variance each dataset incorporated the average daily resistance and the average daily variance of each plant the presence or absence of drought stress has been set accordingly to the physiological measurements in particular a plant was considered stressed when the value of the relative stomatal conductance was lower than 30 fig 1 a binary classifier has been employed to discriminate and evaluate the days of water stress the input of the proposed system has been classified into one and only one of two non overlapping classes stress no stress to examine the efficiency of the water stress detection classifier a database of the whole 56 day long recordings of the three dataset groups was employed and processed using the software matlab then the correctness of the electrical signals classification has been evaluated by computing the number of correctly recognized class examples true positives tp the number of correctly recognized examples that do not belong to the class true negatives tn and examples that either were incorrectly assigned to the class false positives fp or that were not recognized as class examples false negatives fn according to sokolova and lapalme 2009 the following performance measures for classification were reported in table 1 and considered as accuracy tp tn tp fn fp tn precision tp tp fp sensitivity tp tp fn specificity tn fp tn 3 results the photosynthesis and stomatal conductance measurements collected regularly during the whole experiment fig 1 have highlighted the three group s plant status during the two months and during the increasing drought stress conditions all plant parameters i e photosynthesis rate and stomatal conductance showed a relatively healthy state of plants up to day 16 then intense decrease of the photosynthesis activity and stomatal openings has been observed for all plants that have not been watered in fact 80 reduction respect the initial values has been observed in few days meanwhile the control group plant that have been well watered periodically showed good values of photosynthesis and conductance as expected between 50 100 of the initial value according to photosynthesis and stomatal conductance data the mild stress group recovered after few days and showed a peak at day 26 whilst the high stress plants peaked early at day 23 and rapidly weakened a similar trend has been observed also for the second watering round at day 34 for the mild and the high stress groups where recovery peaks have been observed respectively at day 40 and 37 but have highlighted lower restored values of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance peaks likely due to the stress faced till then starting from day 33 34 when a prolonged period of about three weeks drought stress has been applied to all groups a decline of all parameters has been observed in all plants from day 42 all plants included the control groups faced a reduction over 60 of the initial value with the high stress group plant being affected the most at the end of the prolonged drought stress after all plants had been recovered the control and mild stress groups showed an increase of the parameters whilst the high stress struggled to recover the water consumption has been also monitored for the whole period and it declined accordingly to the stomatal conductance in fact as soon as the latter approaches to lower values the water consumption was reduced as well fig 2 interestingly after being watered subsequently the prolonged drought period although it was not statistically significant the mild stress group showed the highest values of photosynthesis conductance and water consumption the relative water content rwc following the recovery of the high stress group plant has showed the lowest values with an average of 17 for the upper leaves and 13 for the lower leaves with only one plant able to recover and survive the prolonged drought treatment fig 3 among the other plant the mild stress plants have been all able to recover and showed the highest level of rwc 80 top leaves 71 bottom leaves with only one plant with low value in the bottom part in the control group two plants have also showed very low values and did not recover from the prolonged drought stress plant 1 and 5 fig 3 in general the more intense is the stress condition for a plant the lower number of reaction centers are available thus lowering the fv fm and fv fm ratio our results followed this rule where the high stress group has been the one with the lowest ratio in particular for the day prior the irrigation when the water stress was higher similar results have been shown in other studies see for example sofo 2011 in general all values declined during the period of intense drought stress and recovered after irrigation npq analysis did not showed any statistical difference among the groups and showed a very high standard deviation and a general declining trend at the end of the prolonged period for all groups etr qp and phi ps2 also showed very similar trends respect fv fm and fv fm ratio with the exception that the differences among the group have been greater in the period where the drought stress was more pronounced also at the end of the prolonged drought stress the mild stress plant adapted showed higher values of etr and phi ps2 that were statistically different from the high stress group plants the electrical signal resistance has been reported as average of each plant group and highlighted in three intervals day 19 29 30 39 39 55 fig 6 the average electrical signal of the resistance as reciprocal of electrical conductance of each group highlighted a specific pattern that depends on the day night cycle and the irrigation regimes in general the water stress occurred in each plants has been directly correlated with the average value of each plant groups suggesting that the signal was strongly dependent on the water content in the stem in fact when the stomatal conductance of the mild and the high stress groups was approaching to zero see fig 1 the relative change in the resistance signal of the two groups increased on the contrary no increase in the electrical signal was observed in the control group during the period in which it has been regularly irrigated these patterns appeared also for the second interval 30 39 for the mild and the high stressed group where signal has been increasing proportionally to the water stress finally all treatments have intensely increased their resistance during the prolonged water stress period day 39 55 with a relative signal changes over ten times higher than before furthermore the variance of the resistance of each group has been calculated daily and has highlighted an increment of the electrical signal variability related to the water stress slightly higher at day 20 medium at day 33 and very high during the prolonged period finally by plotting together the daily signal of resistance and its variance it has been possible to observed that the values tend to group in cluster depending on the drought conditions fig 8 in our study an empirical approach was adopted by considering the leaf stomatal conductance of the control dataset to adjust and validate the threshold values that could indicate a stress based on the electrical resistance and electrical signal variance a binary classifier has been implemented to distinguish and identify the phase days of water stress the corresponding decision rule has been chosen by setting a threshold value of 3 8 ω on electrical resistance and 0 01 ω² on signal variance the detection performance evaluation of the proposed classification system is listed in table 1 and reported as percent of success different classification results have been compared when the signals of resistance res and variance var have been considered alone or associated res var the classification system was capable to discriminate the response to drought stress using both signals with an accuracy of 93 for the control group 76 for the mild stressed and 80 for the high stressed ones a good performance is achieved also in terms of precision 88 control 82 mild 83 high and specificity 96 78 mild 75 high and sensitivity 82 control 75 mild 84 high interestingly the comparison of the performances of the various stress detection methods shows that the combined use of both resistance and variance is not always more efficient than the single signal analysis but increased notably the performance measures of the sensitivity the percentage of stressed plants that are correctly identified as unhealthy and accuracy especially in monitoring mild and high stressed plants on the other hand the performance measures of precision and specificity the percentage of healthy plants that are correctly identified as not having the condition have shown higher performances on single signal classifiers in general when both variance and resistance values increase it means that plants are entering in a phase of stress and the use of both signals helped to limit false negative detection 4 discussion the experiment showed the stomatal conductance and photosynthesis activity of three different groups of plant elucidating the effect of repeated mild and high water stress condition on olive tree plants as expected the high stress group has suffered the most and was not able to recover a subsequent long period of water privation instead the mild stress plant group even presenting symptoms of stress condition has been able to face the prolonged period and recover in fact both considering the relative water content and the photosynthetic apparatus status a clear trend suggested that the mild stress group plant has better tolerated and recovered from the prolonged drought treatment this suggests that plants that have been previously subjected to a mild stress are able to adapt and react promptly to the prolonged stress period and recover faster attributable to an acclimation effect this hypothesis is particularly enforced by the rwc values measurements showed in fig 3 it is likely that the drought stress duration had irreversibly damaged the plants of the high stress group by affecting the biochemical activities in fact it has been already observed that severe water stress causes permanent injury to tissue cells in particular the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ros that cause permanent peroxidation damage xu et al 2010 additionally the root apparatus ability to recover weakened with increasing stress stasovski and peterson 1991 furthermore the fluorescence analysis showed how the different plants have managed the surplus of energy trying to limit damage and how the photosynthesis rate has been due to stomatal limitation or how temporary or permanent damage affected the photosystem these results showed that also the photoprotection is dependent on the prolonged drought stress condition and plays an important role during the recovery phase for the photosynthetic productivity the electrical properties measurement i e resistance has been utilized to monitor the water status of each plant and to evaluate the possibility to establish when the plant was facing the stress the timing of the recovery and eventually to differentiate the intensity of the stress control mild and high the comparison between the physiological parameters of the plants and the electrical resistance measurements has highlighted the possibility to use such electrical signal to detect the plant water status in fact by using a multi electrodes system and analyzing the signal of several plants subjected to the same treatment it emerged that electrical resistance signal was strongly related to the water plant status accordingly the stress level was detected as well as it was possible to differentiate between mild and high stress in particular this was particularly clear when considering the average signals of a group of plant subjected to the same conditions indeed the combined use of a multi electrodes approach and of the relative changes of signal respect to the initial value has turned out to be promising this is in accordance with other studies where the electrical resistance has been related to the stem water content at the same time it suggests that stem variability could affect direct comparison of different plant and recommends the analysis of the relative signal changes nadler et al 2008 several studies focus on the analysis of the electrical potentials and all agree that the stress condition increase the complexity of electrical oscillations making harder to find a proper way to interpret and analyze for specific signals de toledo et al 2019 choi et al 2017 in our case it has been possible to obtain information also by observing the daily resistance signal variability and this has been possible by recording the data at high frequency every 2 min an increment in the signal variance has been usually associated with a stress condition as already cited by other authors e g nadler et al 2008 furthermore there are hypothesis that suggest that the signal propagation is a combination of hydraulic and chemical signals oscillations vodeneev et al 2015 and thus it is possible to hypothesize that water stress has affected part of the signaling mechanism the physiological mechanism implied in this phenomenon is still unclear and the increase in the resistance is probably related to the amount of water present in the tissues or due to embolized tissues fig 5 but the meaning of a signal variance deserves a better understanding the electrodes fig 5 are inserted in the stem and are in contact with several different cells and cells compartments that could increase the interactions and complexities of observed phenomena the electric resistance signal variability could be easily influenced by the interruption of the water flow in the xylem caused be phenomena of cavitation or embolism in fact the xylem in olive tree is mainly made of fibers for structure support and vessels for water transport tyree and zimmerman 2002 carlquist 2012 as most angiosperm olive tree is very vulnerable to embolism because vessels easily cavitate nevertheless it has a superior ability to react and repair tissue affected by embolism in particular olive tree responds to water stress by increasing xylem vessel frequency or reducing their diameters bacelar et al 2007 d odorico et al 2006 it can be supposed that these physiological modifications contribute to the variability of the electrical resistance as highlighted in our results in fact although smaller or less xylem vessels can reduce embolism also the hydraulic conductivity decreases d odorico et al 2006 furthermore given that the conducting sieve tubes can be a possible connection between root shoot electronic coupling and could be a site for the sorting and modulation of the electricals signals de toledo et al 2019 then their modification may influence also the tissue resistance signal drought induced accumulation of aba has been reported to cause the decrease of the membrane turgor pressure and induce stomatal closure fromm and fei 1998 du et al 2018 increase of aba in response to stress specific signal has been also linked to ros waves associated with the generation and propagation of electric signals zimmermann et al 2009 oyarce and gurovich 2011 suzuki et al 2013 this observation confirms that several responses involved in water stress are linked together and we can speculate that several overlapping signaling in response to a stress cause an increment of the resistance signal variability in particular in the clusters analysis the values of stomatal conductance have been used to confirm whenever each plant was suffering for the water stress this has allowed to observe the area of the graph where the plant were not subjected to stress green rectangles fig 8 the proposed stress detection system takes advantage of both daily electrical resistance and signal statistical dispersion variability related to water stress in plants the daily variance can be used as additional confirmation about the plant water stress in addition of the resistance increase the implementation of a binary classifier to distinguish and identify the different period of stress has demonstrated that according to each specific case it is possible to refine the algorithm to improve the performances in terms of sensitivity and limit the false negative detection results due to environmental or physiological fluctuations it is often possible that the electrical signal may be affected in terms of measured resistance without an effective water stress affecting the plant in this case the associated analysis of the signal variance can be crucial and exploited to support or disconfirm the hypothesis derived from the analysis of the signal resistance alone these features have been highlighted by the clusters distribution of the daily resistance variance of each plant during the whole experiment fig 8 and can be used as a base to develop more complex detection algorithms and to improve the interpretation of the stem electrical properties related to drought stress 4 1 conclusions concluding the results obtained in this study are promising and the methodology presented has a good potential for empirical applications electrical resistance measurements can be used at early stage to select the most drought tolerant cultivars for increasing productivity in semi arid conditions additionally the multi electrodes approach can be easily applied for monitoring a few plants as biosensor to check the status of a more numerous group of plants subjected to the same irrigation regime future experiments based on this methodology on outdoor mature vegetable or trees are required in particular accompanied with other measurements such as stem water potential and to evaluate their implementation the use of several plants as well as the analysis of both the signal resistance and its variance can be used to avoid false negative or false positive for develop faultless automatic algorithm to establish when the plants are effectively in a stress condition this approach if refined has the advantage of obtaining data directly from the plant instead of an indirect measurement of the soil or the environment and could be possibly applied for the interpretation of the signals of other stress as well the measurement of the change in the signal resistance is much cheaper and easy to perform compared to the impedance methodology and the signal itself has a good reliability the whole system probes and the cable are flexible and relatively economics furthermore the data storage even if collected at high frequency can be pruned by saving only the average at specific interval of signal and variance e g hourly or daily and accomplish for long period thus permitting automatic analysis of the signals with numerous electrodes for a scalable and personalized set up that controls irrigation depending on the real plant needs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

10646,the analysis of the electrophysiological activity of plants permits a real time information of the plant status e g light availability and water stress however even though it is clear that the role of the electrical signals in plant is crucial especially in processes involving the propagation of rapid signals a systematic approach for the interpretation of the electrical patterns is still missing in this work a multi electrodes approach has been applied to study the electrical signals in olive trees plants subjected to three different level of water stress in particular by using specific water irrigation regimes a control group a mid mild stressed group and a high stressed group have been monitored and subsequently subjected to a long period of prolonged drought stress physiological parameters and electrical activity have been continuously monitored for the whole experiment to highlight any correlation between the electric signal and the water stress our results showed that it has been possible to differentiate the electric signals related to drought conditions of different intensity i e control mild and high in particular we have found that the average daily relative electrical resistance change the opposite of the electrical conductance is directly related to the drought stress whilst the signal variance increases during the period of main water stress additionally a proposed signal classification system has been successfully able to detect the absence presence of stress and to effectively recognize daily class samples 93 control 76 mild and 80 high the set up could provide a useful tool for monitoring water conditions in plants and has several potential applications for sensor and automatic system in greenhouse or field able to monitor directly the plant water status keywords plant electrical signal stem resistance drought stress olea europaea signal classification 1 introduction 1 1 electrical signaling in plant the propagation of electrical signals in plant is an important system used to transfer information about the environmental stimuli perceived by the sensory system and spread it along different and remote organs fromm and lautner 2007 to date abundant studies have highlighted that the role of the electrical signals in plant is crucial in response to biotic or abiotic stress condition especially in processes involving the propagation of signals such as light stimuli datta and palit 2004 gurovich and hermosilla 2009 chatterjee et al 2014 water accessibility fromm and eschrich 1988 grams et al 2007 oyarce

et al 2007 it has already been proved that different environmental stimuli produce typical responses in living cells generating specific electrical signals fromm et al 2005 lautner et al 2005 fromm and fei 2009 for that reason the use of plant as biosensors has been theorized volkov and ranatunga 2006 davies 2004 gurovich 2009 and attempts for the classifications of these signals exist chatterjee et al 2015 moreover whilst the chemical signalling involving compounds are not appropriated to respond rapidly to environmental stress factors because are slower and localized e g hormones electrical signals can be quickly diffused and propagate over long distances throughout different plant organs and their analysis is a promising candidate for the study of early stress responses additional researches by monitoring the electrophysiological activity of plants have already performed successful non destructive methodologies to gather real time information of the plant status e g light availability and water stress for the construction of automatic irrigation systems nadler et al 2008 oyarce and gurovich 2010 ríos rojas et al 2014 or have used plant as sensor for particular stimulus e g light ozone exposure saline stress chatterjee et al 2014 morosi et al 2015 dolfi et al 2015 wang et al 2019 however even though it is clear that the role of the electrical signals in plant is crucial especially in processes involving the propagation of rapid signals a systematic approach for the interpretation of the electrical patterns is still missing the levels of complexity and dynamics of electrical activity both temporal when and spatial where and how the signal propagates make data analysis more complicated for this reason recent researches and findings have been directed to all ionic currents generated at different level of the plant organization that recently have been classified as plant electrome de loof 2016 and souza et al 2017 indeed several mechanism and responses of different nature e g chemical hydraulic electrical etc have been associated with abiotic stress as water stress and it is still very difficult to evaluate the effects derived by different related biochemical and molecular pathways these modifications involve physiological and or morphological factors that affect the electrical properties of the plant tissue and have been subjected to numerous investigations in various cases the measurement of the electrical resistance of the plant tissues has been used to estimate their physiological features for example gora et al 2017 have reported a correlation between the trunk resistance of tree in tropical and temperate climates and the damages derived from lighting strikes these studies clearly reported that the resistance values are linked to morphological and physical characteristics of the plants in particular to the cell dimension and to the presence of water in the tissues nadler et al 2008 and the solutes concentration gora et al 2017 similar principles have been shown in studies that have tried to detect modifications or damages in cells or plant tissues azzarello et al 2012 or in the whole plant ben hamed et al 2016 by measuring the impedance 1 2 water stress in plant water is a fundamental resource for all plants and water shortage is one of the stresses that leads to greater physiological damage and which more compromises the productivity of crops the main stress factors caused during drought stress influence the internal plant water potential causing the closure of the stomata followed by reduced gas exchanges that implies an altered status of limited photosynthetic activity and metabolism all these conditions can be translated later in permanent damages if drought last over time or can culminate in the plant death depending on several elements e g plant species growth stage duration etc jaleel et al 2008 tátrai et al 2016 the stomatal closure is the simplest defense of a plant to limited water availability as it allows to minimize the loss by transpiration plant turgor or leaf water potential have been used in the past as indicators of water status but it has been demonstrated that some plants can have turgor identical or higher than those of well watered and still present a reduced growth but have much lower stomatal conductance for this reason leaf conductance measurement has been suggested as preferable indicator of plant drought stress davies and zhang 1991 thomas et al 1989 several researches have showed a reduced photosynthesis rate in plant subjected to low medium intensity drought stress that are usually caused by stomatal constrictions and non stomatal dependent constriction situations of intense drought stress wang et al 2018 degl innocenti et al 2009 misson et al 2010 but relatively few works have investigated the correlation between electrical activity and stomatal conductance at different drought stress levels the plant hormone abscisic acid aba is considered to be strongly correlated with the decrease in stomatal conductance in drought stress and it is well known that it plays a crucial role in the regulation of the stomatal behaviour of water stressed conditions wilkinson and davies 2002 jiang and hartung 2007 brunetti et al 2018 nevertheless it should be noticed that both short term and long term signaling that occurs during water stress is very complex and aba is not the only signal related to the process which involves the coordination of numerous elements as plants need to react to various environmental conditions to adjust the stomatal aperture based on the surroundings kuromori et al 2018 1 3 objective of the work the study of electrical signals generated by plants subjected to drought stress is a very innovative topic but still clear methodologies for signal interpretation are missing the analysis of the electric properties of different zones of the stem trucks have been used to enhance water utilization and efficiency in open field by their correlation with stomata conductance and plant internal water flux gibert et al 2006 oyarce and gurovich 2010 and could potentially be used for early detection of water stress this study aims to elucidate long term electrical analysis related to water stress the analysis of the physiological status of each plant has been used to correlate different drought stress intensities with specific electrical patterns it is based on a continuous monitoring of several plants in vivo in a non destructive way for a long period through a new set up that consists of a multi electrodes system able to detect the electrical resistance signal and its variance on several plants or in different zones of the same plant thus after storing all data for the whole period days or weeks a statistical analysis based on a systematic approach of intervals analysis have been used for the interpretation of the stem electrical signal patterns in response to different levels of water stress finally the analysis of electric signal resistance and variance in olive trees plants subjected to different level of water stress has been used to simulate an automatic detection of the plant status and evaluate their potential applications in field 2 material and methods 2 1 plant material growing conditions and experimental plan trials have been conducted on rooted plant cuttings of olea europaea l plants cv picholine measuring about 80 120 cm in height the plants have been purchased after being grown on small pot 13 13 18 cm in a mix of 50 peat and 50 pumice added with minced horns and fingernails of animals cornunghia and calcium carbonate lime amendments the plants have been watered and kept a week to adapt to the new growth chamber conditions before starting the experiment the growing conditions have been maintained at day night light cycle of 14 h 10 h par of 200 250 μmol m 2 s 1 and temperature of 20 5 2 c during the day and 18 3 2 c during the night the trial has been kept and monitored for about two months all photosynthesis and conductance measurements have been performed with a portable photosynthesis system for gas exchange li cor 6400xt li cor biosciences usa fig 1 these data have been used for the interpretation of the electrical signal by correlating the plant status to specific electrical patterns during gas exchange measurements the light level inside the leaf chamber was maintained at par of 500 μmol m 2 s 1 and air flow rate of 400 μmol s 1 for the water stress treatments we used a modified methodology used by sinclair and brilli sinclair and ludlow 1986 brilli et al 2007 in details at the start of the experiment all pots have been saturated with water kept about 4 h to drain and weighted to determine the initial saturated hydrated weight of the pot 100 pot water capacity subsequently each pot has been wrapped in a plastic bag that has been bonded around the stem to avoid evaporation from the soil in order to monitor only the amount of water removed by the plant fig 2 three levels of water stress have been tested by unwrapping the plastic bag and adding water at different quantities and periods considering the pot water capacity weight equivalent to 100 as the water saturated weight initial pot weight to determine the exact amount of water in the soil at which the plant was not anymore able to support transpiration without face water stress we have monitored the conductance to determine the minimum fraction of transpirable soil water ftsw defined when value of stomatal conductance comes close to zero final pot weight then the ftsw was calculated for each single pot as ftsw daily pot weight final pot weight initial pot weight final pot weight sinclair and ludlow 1986 brilli et al 2013 following these calculation fifteen plants have been divided in three groups each of 5 plants 1 control plants that have been regularly watered up to reach the weight of about 80 of the ftsw the other two groups have been watered immediately after ftws was declining to almost zero signal of water stress and restored at different ftsw percent respectively 2 a group referred as mild stressed plants that have been re watered at about 40 of the ftsw and 3 the last group of high stressed plants that have been watered at about 20 of the ftsw control plants have not been subjected to any stress prior the two weeks prolonged drought stress therefore their stomatal conductance never reached zero the measure of the whole set of pots was used to estimate the approximate final pot weight of the control group thus the water content at the stress point finally after two re watering regimes described above for the mild and high stress plant all plants have been subjected to a prolonged period of drought stress at day 33 34 for about 3 weeks to evaluate how the different initial water regimes have influenced the adaptation to a prolonged drought stress finally all plants have been fully re watered to recover by keeping each pot for one minute immerged in water whilst pipetting 10 ml of water on the soil surface and then wait fifteen minutes to drain each plant back to about 50 60 of the ftsw 2 2 relative water content the relative water content measurement has been performed at the end of the experiment for each plant in particular leaves have been collected after 3 days following the recovery phase plants abundantly irrigated after the final prolonged drought stress the relative water content rwc of the leaves in each plant has been calculated as the ratio of fresh leaves weight fw measured immediately after harvesting the leaves turgid weight tw obtained by sinking all leaves in demineralized water for 48 h and dry weight obtained by keeping the leaves at 45 c for 48 h the formula used was rwc 100 fw dw tw dw the rwc has been calculated separately for leaves of the upper part and leaves from the lower part of each plant this approach has been used because it has been observed that the bottom leaves of each plant have been the most affected by the water stress in particular four leaves for each plant have been collected and used to calculate the rwc n 4 from the top part collected between the 2nd and 5th node and another group of leaves n 4 from the bottom mid part collected from the 6th and the 10th node of each plant fig 3 relative water content has

normal physiological status from temporary problems that aroused during the water stress fig 6 all parameters fo fm fs fm and fo from each plant for each day of measurements have been achieved using a

fixed distance of 0 9 cm using a plastic support and inserted at the base of the stem of each plant fig 5 this distance is chosen based on the electrical signal measure and is influenced by the stem variability and how the electrodes is implanted it needs to be previously calibrated to be in the range of the instruments to maintain enough resolution without go out of scale this set up has been chosen in order to simplify the complexity that arise from measuring the electrical property of a certain material as it is influenced by its length structure and content e g electrolytes solutes etc in this kind of measurements distance between the two electrodes is a key factor and it may be subjected to a change due to the plant stem elongation wang et al 2009 in our case given the plant growth negligible distance can been assumed as constant 2 5 electrical measurements data analysis data analysis of the electrical activity has been performed on the whole dataset that included all data collected one acquisition every 2 min each plant initial resistance signal values were different for this reason to permit a comparison of all the data the relative change respect their initial value has been used in detail for each plant a baseline signal has been extrapolated as the average of 3 days resistance signals registered when the plant was in good health this has been subtracted to the successive data for example if a plant when healthy had a 3 days average signal of 2 ω and it reached 2 5 ω a relative change of 0 5 ω would have been considered therefore the relative changes have been calculated for each plant and the average group signal changes have been reported for each treatment fig 6 for the daily variance analysis the data have been grouped for each day where the initial value was considered the start of the light cycle in particular to evaluate the variability of the signal the daily signal variance has been calculated for every plant and each treatment average has been reported fig 7 for the cluster analysis fig 8 all average daily values have been represented according to their value of signal resistance and variance in particular a threshold limit of 10 ω for the resistance and 1 for the variance has been set therefore all points that were over this threshold have been considered exactly 10 ω for the resistance and 1 for the variance each dataset incorporated the average daily resistance and the average daily variance of each plant the presence or absence of drought stress has been set accordingly to the physiological measurements in particular a plant was considered stressed when the value of the relative stomatal conductance was lower than 30 fig 1 a binary classifier has been employed to discriminate and evaluate the days of water stress the input of the proposed system has been classified into one and only one of two non overlapping classes stress no stress to examine the efficiency of the water stress detection classifier a database of the whole 56 day long recordings of the three dataset groups was employed and processed using the software matlab then the correctness of the electrical signals classification has been evaluated by computing the number of correctly recognized class examples true positives tp the number of correctly recognized examples that do not belong to the class true negatives tn and examples that either were incorrectly assigned to the class false positives fp or that were not recognized as class examples false negatives fn according to sokolova and lapalme 2009 the following

and stomatal conductance measurements collected regularly during the whole experiment fig 1 have highlighted the three group s plant status during the two months and during the increasing drought stress conditions all plant parameters i e photosynthesis rate and stomatal conductance showed a relatively healthy state of plants up to day 16 then intense decrease of the photosynthesis activity and stomatal openings has been observed for all plants that have not been watered in fact 80 reduction respect the initial values has been observed in few days meanwhile the control group plant that have been well watered periodically showed good values of photosynthesis and conductance as expected between 50 100 of the initial value according to photosynthesis and stomatal conductance data the mild stress group recovered after few days and showed a peak at day 26 whilst the high stress plants peaked early at day 23 and rapidly weakened a similar trend has been observed also for the second watering round at day 34 for the mild and the high stress groups where recovery peaks have been observed respectively at day 40 and 37 but have highlighted lower restored values of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance peaks likely due to the stress faced till then starting from day 33 34 when a prolonged period of about three weeks drought stress has been applied to all groups a decline of all parameters has been observed in all plants from day 42 all plants included the control groups faced a reduction over 60 of the initial value with the high stress group plant being affected the most at the end of the prolonged drought stress after all plants had been recovered the control and mild stress groups showed an increase of the parameters whilst the high stress struggled to recover the water consumption has been also monitored for the whole period and it declined accordingly to the stomatal conductance in fact as soon as the latter approaches to lower values the water consumption was reduced as well fig 2 interestingly after being watered subsequently the prolonged drought period although it was not statistically significant the mild stress group showed the highest values of photosynthesis conductance and water consumption the relative water content rwc following the recovery of the high stress group plant has showed the lowest values with an average of 17 for the upper leaves and 13 for the lower leaves with only one plant able to recover and survive the prolonged drought treatment fig 3 among the other plant the mild stress plants have been all able to recover and showed the highest level of rwc 80 top leaves 71 bottom leaves with only one plant with low value in the bottom part in the control group two plants have also showed very low values and did not recover from the prolonged drought stress plant 1 and 5 fig 3 in general the more intense is the stress condition for a plant the lower number of reaction centers are available thus lowering the fv fm and fv fm ratio our results followed this rule where the high stress group has been the one with the lowest ratio in particular for the day prior the irrigation when the water stress was higher similar results have been shown in other studies see for example sofo 2011 in general all values declined during the period of intense drought stress and recovered after irrigation npq analysis did not showed any statistical difference among the groups and showed a very high standard deviation and a general declining trend at the end of the prolonged period for all groups etr qp and phi ps2 also showed very similar trends respect fv fm and fv fm ratio with the exception that the differences among the group have been greater in the period where the drought stress was more pronounced also at the end of the prolonged drought stress the mild stress plant adapted showed higher values of etr and phi ps2 that were statistically different from the high stress group plants the electrical signal resistance has been reported as average of each plant group and highlighted in three intervals day 19 29 30 39 39 55 fig 6 the average electrical signal of the resistance as reciprocal of electrical conductance of each group highlighted a specific pattern that depends on the day night cycle and the irrigation regimes in general the water stress occurred in each plants has been directly correlated with the average value of each plant groups suggesting that the signal was strongly dependent on the water content in the stem in fact when the stomatal conductance of the mild and the high stress groups was approaching to zero see fig 1 the relative change in the resistance signal of the two groups increased on the contrary no increase in the electrical signal was observed in the control group during the period in which it has been regularly irrigated these patterns appeared also for the second interval 30 39 for the mild and the high stressed group where signal has been increasing proportionally to the water stress finally all treatments have intensely increased their resistance during the prolonged water stress period day 39 55 with a relative signal changes over ten times higher than before furthermore the variance of the resistance of each group has been calculated daily and has highlighted an increment of the electrical signal variability related to the water stress slightly higher at day 20 medium at day 33 and very high during the prolonged period finally by plotting together the daily signal of resistance and its variance it has been possible to observed that the values tend to group in cluster depending on the drought conditions fig 8 in our study an empirical approach was adopted by considering the leaf stomatal conductance of the control dataset to adjust and validate the threshold values that could indicate a stress based on the electrical resistance and electrical signal variance a binary classifier has been implemented to distinguish and identify the phase days of water stress the corresponding decision rule has been chosen by setting a threshold value of 3 8 ω on electrical resistance and 0 01 ω² on signal variance the detection performance evaluation of the proposed classification system is listed in table 1 and reported as percent of success different classification results have been compared when the signals of resistance res and variance var have been considered alone or associated res var the classification system was capable to discriminate the response to drought stress using both signals with an accuracy of 93 for the control group 76 for the mild stressed and 80 for the high stressed ones a good performance is achieved also in terms of precision 88 control 82 mild 83 high and specificity 96 78 mild 75 high and sensitivity 82 control 75 mild 84 high interestingly the comparison of the performances of the various stress detection methods shows that the combined use of both resistance and variance is not always more efficient than the single signal analysis but increased notably the performance measures of the sensitivity the percentage of stressed plants that are correctly identified as unhealthy and accuracy especially in monitoring mild and high stressed plants on the other hand the performance measures of precision and specificity the percentage of healthy plants that are correctly identified as not having the condition have shown higher performances on single signal classifiers in general when both variance and resistance values increase it means that plants are entering in a phase of stress and the use of both signals helped to limit false negative detection 4 discussion the experiment showed the stomatal conductance and photosynthesis activity of three different groups of plant elucidating the effect of repeated mild and high water stress condition on olive tree plants as expected the high stress group has suffered the most and was not able to recover a subsequent long period of water privation instead the mild stress plant group even presenting symptoms of stress condition has been able to face the prolonged period and recover in fact both considering the relative water content and the photosynthetic apparatus status a clear trend suggested that the mild stress group plant has better tolerated and recovered from the prolonged drought treatment this suggests that plants that have been previously subjected to a mild stress are able to adapt and react promptly to the prolonged stress period and recover faster attributable to an acclimation effect this hypothesis is particularly enforced by the rwc values measurements showed in fig 3 it is likely that the drought stress duration had irreversibly damaged the plants of the high stress group by affecting the biochemical activities in fact it has been already observed that severe water stress causes permanent injury to tissue cells in particular the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ros that cause permanent peroxidation damage xu et al 2010 additionally the root apparatus ability to recover weakened with increasing stress stasovski and peterson 1991 furthermore the fluorescence analysis showed how the different plants have managed the surplus of energy trying to limit damage and how the photosynthesis rate has been due to stomatal limitation or how temporary or permanent damage affected the photosystem these results showed that also the photoprotection is dependent on the prolonged drought stress condition and plays an important role during the recovery phase for the photosynthetic productivity the electrical properties measurement i e resistance has been utilized to monitor the water status of each plant and to evaluate the possibility to establish when the plant was facing the stress the timing of the recovery and eventually to differentiate the intensity of the stress control mild and high the comparison between the physiological parameters of the plants and the electrical resistance measurements has highlighted the possibility to use such electrical signal to detect the plant water status in fact by using a multi electrodes system and analyzing the signal of several plants subjected to the same treatment it emerged that electrical resistance signal was strongly related to the water plant status accordingly the stress level was detected as well as it was possible to differentiate between mild and high stress in particular this was particularly clear when considering the average signals of a group of plant subjected to the same conditions indeed the combined use of a multi electrodes approach and of the relative changes of signal respect to the initial value has turned out to be promising this is in accordance with other studies where the electrical resistance has been related to the stem water content at the same time it suggests that stem variability could affect direct comparison of different plant and recommends the analysis of the relative signal changes nadler et al 2008 several studies focus on the analysis of the electrical potentials and all agree that the stress condition increase the complexity of electrical oscillations making harder to find a proper way to interpret and analyze for specific signals de toledo et al 2019 choi et al 2017 in our case it has been possible to obtain information also by observing the daily resistance signal variability and this has been possible by recording the data at high frequency every 2 min an increment in the signal variance has been usually associated with a stress condition as already cited by other authors e g nadler et al 2008 furthermore there are hypothesis that suggest that the signal propagation is a combination of hydraulic and chemical signals oscillations vodeneev et al 2015 and thus it is possible to hypothesize that water stress has affected part of the signaling mechanism the physiological mechanism implied in this phenomenon is still unclear and the increase in the resistance is probably related to the amount of water present in the tissues or due to embolized tissues fig 5 but the meaning of a signal variance deserves a better understanding the electrodes fig 5 are inserted in the stem and are in contact with several different cells and cells compartments that could increase the interactions and complexities of observed phenomena the electric resistance signal variability could be easily influenced by the interruption of the water flow in the xylem caused be phenomena of cavitation or embolism in fact the xylem in olive tree is mainly made of fibers for structure support and vessels for water transport tyree and zimmerman 2002 carlquist 2012 as most angiosperm olive tree is very vulnerable to embolism because vessels easily cavitate nevertheless it has a superior ability to react and repair tissue affected by embolism in particular olive tree responds to water stress by increasing xylem vessel frequency or reducing their diameters bacelar et al 2007 d odorico et al 2006 it can be supposed that these physiological modifications contribute to the variability of the electrical resistance as highlighted in our results in fact although smaller or less xylem vessels can reduce embolism also the hydraulic conductivity decreases d odorico et al 2006 furthermore given that the conducting sieve tubes can be a possible connection between root shoot electronic coupling and could be a site for the sorting and modulation of the electricals signals de toledo et al 2019 then their modification may influence also the tissue resistance signal drought induced accumulation of aba has been reported to cause the decrease of the membrane turgor pressure and induce stomatal closure fromm and fei 1998 du et al 2018 increase of aba in response to stress specific signal has been also linked to ros waves associated with the generation and propagation of electric signals zimmermann et al 2009 oyarce and gurovich 2011 suzuki et al 2013 this observation confirms that several responses involved in water stress are linked together and we can speculate that several overlapping signaling in response to a stress cause an increment of the resistance signal variability in particular in the clusters analysis the values of stomatal conductance have been used to confirm whenever each plant was suffering for the water stress this has allowed to observe the area of the graph where the plant were not subjected to stress green rectangles fig 8 the proposed stress detection system takes advantage of both daily electrical resistance and signal statistical dispersion variability related to water stress in plants the daily variance can be used as additional confirmation about the plant water stress in addition of the resistance increase the implementation of a binary classifier to distinguish and identify the different period of stress has demonstrated that according to each specific case it is possible to refine the algorithm to improve the performances in terms of sensitivity and limit the false negative detection results due to environmental or physiological fluctuations it is often possible that the electrical signal may be affected in terms of measured resistance without an effective water stress affecting the plant in this case the associated analysis of the signal variance can be crucial and exploited to support or disconfirm the hypothesis derived from the analysis of the signal resistance alone these features have been highlighted by the clusters distribution of the daily resistance variance of each plant during the whole experiment fig 8 and can be used as a base to develop more complex detection algorithms and to improve the interpretation of the stem electrical properties related to drought stress 4 1 conclusions concluding the results obtained in this study are promising and the methodology presented has a good potential for empirical applications electrical resistance measurements can be used at early stage to select the most drought tolerant cultivars for increasing productivity in semi arid conditions additionally the multi electrodes approach can be easily applied for monitoring a few plants as biosensor to check the status of a more numerous group of plants subjected to the same irrigation regime future experiments based on this methodology on outdoor mature vegetable or trees are required in particular accompanied with other measurements such as stem water potential and to evaluate their implementation the use of several plants as well as the analysis of both the signal resistance and its variance can be used to avoid false negative or false positive for develop faultless automatic algorithm to establish when the plants are effectively in a stress condition this approach if refined has the advantage of obtaining data directly from the plant instead of an indirect measurement of the soil or the environment and could be possibly applied for the interpretation of the signals of other stress as well the measurement of the change in the signal resistance is much cheaper and easy to perform compared to the impedance methodology and the signal itself has a good reliability the whole system probes and the cable are flexible and relatively economics furthermore the data storage even if collected at high frequency can be pruned by saving only the average at specific interval of signal and variance e g hourly or daily and accomplish for long period thus permitting automatic analysis of the signals with numerous electrodes for a scalable and personalized set up that controls irrigation depending on the real plant needs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

10647,agricultural water markets play a crucial role in arid and semi arid regions by reallocating water and transferring it from low value uses to high value uses several markets for surface water and groundwater are functioning all over the world to increase economic well being of farmers and meet environmental flow requirements however there is not a consensus on precisely which market mechanism may be more environmentally and economically beneficial this study presents an agent based groundwater market model to analyze the economic and hydrologic impacts of three market mechanisms designed based on the cap and trade scheme that differ in the price discovery process two of which are uniform price double auction and the third is a discriminatory price double auction this study also analyzes the hydrologic and economic impacts of water buyback programs modeling results applied to rafsanjan plain an arid region in iran show that the discriminatory price double auction is the most hydrologically and economically advantageous mechanism since it reduces the annual water level drawdown by 38 and brings about more profits for farmers in comparison with other market mechanisms furthermore the buyback program effectively reduces the inequality of wealth distribution gini index and increases farmers net benefit while reducing their surplus keywords tradeable groundwater permits agent based modeling uniform price double auction discriminatory price double auction water buyback program 1 introduction the earth s freshwater is limited and scarce so it is difficult and sometimes impossible to efficiently allocate water among competing users wheeler et al 2017 the greatest and most significant water supply for irrigation and therefore for food security is groundwater throughout the arid and semi arid regions of the world groundwater supplies prevent the deleterious consequences of droughts provide the rivers with environmental flow requirements and conserve the vulnerable biodiversity while groundwater utilization has many socially and economically benefits the over extraction of these precious resources can lead to environmentally and economically adverse consequences aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 de graaf et al 2017 marchiori et al 2012 two prominent viewpoints emerge when water demand surpasses water supply policymakers can either adopt supply enhancement policies such as dam construction and desalination or demand side management programs for instance trade of water permits and water conservation plans grafton and wheeler 2018 montilla lópez et al 2018 wheeler et al 2017 one effective and practical demand side management policy is water allocation by market mechanisms which can lead to sustainable water uses and increase economic well being of users many studies have supported the effectiveness of water markets in transferring water from low value uses to high value uses du et al 2017 the consideration of the opportunity cost delorit and block 2018 griffin 2006 howe and goemans 2003 enhancement of irrigation technologies and users awareness of the true value of water alamdarlo et al 2019 alarcón and juana 2016 and environmental protection erfani et al 2015 iftekhar et al 2013 the market based allocation of water resources in a basin is considered a complex system owing to the heterogeneity in water users available resources water delivery systems institutional regulations etc yang et al 2011 moreover water markets comprise various and autonomous agents buyers and sellers with different interests and tastes who are connected through a common resource groundwater or surface water therefore we can consider water markets as complex adaptive systems which entail adaptation processes due to continuous feedbacks between systems elements and are sensitive to initial conditions macal and north 2010 smajgl et al 2009 zhao et al 2013 many of the recently conducted studies used agent based modeling an appropriate method to understand and analyze complex adaptive systems in order to simulate and assess water market institutions in particular smajgl et al 2009 evaluated the environmental and economic impacts of changing the institutional framework of an existing water market iftekhar et al 2013 investigated the farmers behaviors and market competition effects on governments water buyback programs finally du et al 2017 scrutinized the relationships between farmers behavior and water market performance in terms of crop production and volume of traded water it is widely recognized that the water markets efficiency depends substantially on the institutional arrangement in fact there is a risk of rapid depletion of water resources in devoid of efficient institutions in water markets erfani et al 2015 to reduce environmentally negative effects of water markets several studies have evaluated policies that lessen harmful impacts of water markets on the environment such as buyback programs cap and trade scheme and different auction mechanisms erfani et al 2015 grafton and wheeler 2018 marchiori et al 2012 tisdell 2010a wheeler et al 2013 double auction mechanisms are generally considered efficient water market institutions du et al 2017 however economic principles do not provide a unanimously accepted theory in this case as to what double auction structure is more efficacious especially when there is no limitation on trade amount hailu and thoyer 2010 therefore there are enormous uncertainties about selecting an efficient market structure furthermore the heterogeneity in market participants behaviors and marginal values of water add to these uncertainties yang et al 2011 this study presents an agent based model intending to investigate the hydrological and economic differences between three auction structures in order to find an efficient hydrologic and economic auction mechanism while in recent years several studies have assessed water markets based on discriminatory price double auction aghaie et al under revision du et al 2017 and uniform price double auction gonzales and ajami 2019 smajgl et al 2009 analyzing and comparing these two mechanisms with each other and with water market with equilibrium price discovery is rare which is the aim of this paper besides in this paper the hydrological and economic impacts of water buyback programs as a means to benefit farmers as well as the environment are analyzed and evaluated the agents in this agent based model are farmer agents and government agent interacting with each other in the proposed water market trying to transact groundwater permits the farmer agents may want to buy or sell groundwater permits but the government agent tries to buy permits from farmers for environmental purposes the remainder of this paper is structured as follows in section two we explain the methodology including the water market submodel and the groundwater submodel in section three we present the case study area and its water related problems finally in section 4 we discuss the results of the study 2 methodology the agent based model which is simulated to evaluate different water market structures has two main components the first component is the agent based decision making submodel describing the agents and their decision making procedures based on their decisions the pumping rates of the wells are determined and are sent to the second component which is the agent based groundwater submodel as a result the groundwater submodel calculates the wells water tables and send them to the agent based decision making submodel the agent based decision making submodel also obtains the economic and horticultural data some of which are crop sensitivity to soil water deficit crop and electricity prices and both of the submodels receive the weather data from an exterior information provider the decision making submodel comprises 200 farmer agents and one government agent which tries to buy water back from farmer agents for environmental purposes in the decision making submodel there is a market institution which is responsible for capping farmers water entitlements based on water table drawdowns and regulating different market structures the flowchart of the agent based model is depicted in fig 1 as illustrated in fig 1 the model starts running at the beginning of the implementation of the market institution where the farmer agents and the government agent are created and their behavioral parameters are assigned the agents decide on their possible bid amounts and bid prices and send them to the market institution the market institution determines the transaction prices based on the market structure and transfer the groundwater permits from successful sellers to the successful buyers after the first market run agents update their pumping rates and their behaviors based on their success in the market their pumping rates then are transferred to the groundwater submodel which is flowlogo developed by castilla rho et al 2015 and after the groundwater simulation the water tables are updated based on the new water tables calculated by the groundwater flow simulation the market institution caps groundwater permits to facilitate sustainability in the following sections we describe the market institution and procedures for its price discoveries in section 2 1 and groundwater submodel and the agent based decision making submodel in sections 2 2 and 2 3 successively 2 1 market institution water permits are commonly traded either in centralized or decentralized market institutions the centralized markets usually match the participants bids using double auctions which can be performed in either uniform the central institution determines transaction prices or discriminatory the market participants bids determine the price price discoveries du et al 2017 on the other hand in the decentralized markets there are no intermediaries between sellers and buyers so searching and bargaining can have high costs xu et al 2018 the market institution used in this study is a centralized market using a double auction structure which is a common mechanism for water markets to evaluate its possible hydrologic and economic impacts the main roles of this centralized market institution are to discover transaction prices based on the market structure transfer groundwater permits from sellers to buyers and caps permits based on regional drawdowns to facilitate sustainability double auctions for price discovery can be implemented either as uniform price double auction all the goods have the same transaction price or discriminatory price double auction each transaction may occur at a different price du et al 2017 iftekhar et al 2013 smajgl et al 2009 xu et al 2018 the market institution used in this paper compares three different market mechanisms two of which are uniform price double auction with uniform and equilibrium price discoveries and the third mechanism is a discriminatory price double auction in all of the double auction mechanisms the process in which the buyers and sellers send their bids to the market institution are alike however the price discovery procedures are different in each one of the market structures which are explained in the following lines 2 1 1 discriminatory price double auction in this mechanism the central market institution sorts descendingly ascendingly the buyers sellers bid prices and matches the first buyer with the highest bid price with the first seller with the lowest bid price the central institution sets the transaction price to the average of the bid prices and the transaction amount to the minimum of the bid amounts if the buyer seller with the highest lowest bid price transacts all of their bid amounts s he leaves the market and the second buyer seller comes to the priority this procedure continues until no supply remains or all demands are satisfied or no buyers bid a price higher than sellers bid prices du et al 2017 gonzales and ajami 2019 2 1 2 uniform price double auction in the sealed bid uniform price double auction all of the goods are transacted at a uniform price which is set to the lowest bids out of the buyers who can meet their demand totally or to some extent the process in which the central institution determines the uniform price is explained as follows first all of the market participants submit their bid amounts and bid prices simultaneously after receiving all of the bids the central institution closes the market temporarily and sorts the bid prices ascending for sellers and descending for buyers the market institution then matches the bid amounts of sorted agents until the exhaustion of the total supply or nonexistence of buyers with bid price more than their corresponding sellers finally the transaction prices the uniform price is set to the lowest bid prices of the buyers who could meet their demand totally or to some extent 2 1 3 equilibrium price market structure the sealed bid equilibrium price market structure is entirely the same as the uniform price double auction except that the central market institution attempts to set the uniform price approximately equal to equilibrium price the equilibrium price is the price in which total market demand and supply are equal thus the central institution makes a balance between the total market demand t m d and the total market supply t m s in order to estimate the equilibrium price sterman 2000 p e q p r t m d t m s s where the p e q and p r are the equilibrium price and the reference price the reference price is initially set to the mean of market bid prices and s is the sensitivity of price to the demand supply balances the equilibrium price estimation process is as follows at the beginning of the market the central institution receives all of the bid prices and bid amounts the total supply demand of the market is the sum of the supplies demands of the sellers buyers whose bid prices are less more than the first reference price average of all the bid prices therefore the market institution has the reference price p r the market supply t m s and the market demand t m d at the first trial so it can obtain the first equilibrium price after calculating the equilibrium price the market institution sorts all of the bids again and with the calculated equilibrium price obtains new market supply and demand the new supply demand of the market is the sum of bid amount of sellers buyers whose bid price is less more than the obtained equilibrium price if the difference in market supply and market demand at this equilibrium price is negligible the equilibrium price is this obtained price however if the difference between market demand and market supply is considerable the obtained equilibrium price is not the real equilibrium price so it is set to the new reference price and a new equilibrium price will be determined the reference price will be changed until the market demand and supply become roughly equal 2 2 agent based groundwater submodel the agent based groundwater submodel in this study is developed in flowlogo modeling environment the flowlogo facilitates coupling agent based models with finite difference 2d groundwater flows which considerably helps researchers explore and examine the feedbacks between human and natural systems in one platform flowlogo is a flexible interface developed in netlogo by castilla rho et al 2015 which allows researchers to create coupled human and natural systems more quickly the flowlogo interface is capable of modeling various boundary conditions fixed head no flow and constant flux and a variety of groundwater sources and sinks pumping and injection wells rivers and springs as a result it is capable of simulating transient and steady state 2d groundwater flow in confined and unconfined aquifers using the finite difference method castilla rho et al 2015 2 3 agent based decision making submodel the agents in this market model are 200 farmer agents and a governmental agent who attempt to meet environmental demand by buying water permits back from farmer agents on a yearly basis the central market institution caps farmer agents water permits based on the water availability of their region which determines their maximum allowable level of water extraction therefore as a result of capping water permits some farmers may wish to buy water permits for irrigation or vice versa the farmer agents make pumping decisions through two distinct decision making processes irrigation policy and bidding behavior the governmental agent has the bidding behavior in which it tries to buy water back from farmer agents to allocate it to the environment the process in which agents make their decisions are described in the following sections 2 3 1 farmers irrigation policy the stress avoidance irrigation requirement for farmer agents in mega liter per year m l y r can be computed as straton heckbert et al 2009 i d i t r m w i t p c p i t 100 a i where r m w i t m m y r is recommended crop requirement p c p i t m m m 2 is precipitation and a i h a is the area under production many factors may affect farmers irrigation policy such as their sensitivity to soil water deficit rainfall and climate water availability irrigation technologies etc van duinen et al 2016 in this study we assign a behavioral parameter to farmer agents named irrigation strategy s t i t which indicate heterogeneity in farmers irrigation policy decision of s t i t 1 denotes that the farmer is not willing to deficit irrigate in time step t and s t i t 0 is equivalent to rain fed agriculture accordingly the actual irrigation requirement of farmer agent i for the selected s t i t can be estimated as i d i t i d i t s t i t initially the irrigation strategy is a random variable distributed by a uniform distribution ranging from 0 8 to 1 this variable is updated based upon the farmers net benefits history saved in their memory the farmer agents strive for attaining more benefits by adapting their irrigation strategies regarding bounded rationality concept humans rationality and information are limited arthur 1994 farmer agents obtain information in time so they adapt their irrigation strategy to gain higher profits by a simple algorithm which works as follows in this algorithm farmer agents have some mechanisms to produce strategies for irrigation after each year they recorded their strategies and their corresponding profits then they attempt to use the strategies corresponding to the highest profits in their memory they obtain more information regarding strategies and related profits so they can estimate more accurately in time 2 3 2 farmers bidding behavior the majority of concepts and ideas in this section are based on du et al 2017 which simulates a hypothetical water market to provide more insights into the way that farmer agents behave in the market the way the farmers decide on their bid amounts and bid prices is the farmers bidding behavior du et al 2017 which is explained in the following paragraphs in each market run the farmers bidding behavior includes two variables bid price and bid amount the farmer agents estimate their water supply or demand based on the difference between their water permit and their actual irrigation requirement q i t i d i t w p i t where q i t m l y r is supply to or demand from the central institution the negative q i t indicates that farmer i supply water to the market and the positive q i t denotes that the farmer is a buyer many factors affect the farmers bid prices which leads to heterogeneity in their bid prices the bidding prices are mainly affected by two factors first is the profit margin μ i t farmers tendency of rent seeking and second is reservation price η i t the maximum price buyers are willing to buy and the minimum price sellers are willing to sell therefore the farmers bidding prices are calculated as follows du et al 2017 p i t 1 μ i t η i t f o r b u y e r s 0 μ i t 1 1 μ i t η i t f o r s e l l e r s 0 μ i t by employing zero intelligence plus algorithm zip we eliminate complicated structures of memory based adaptation for agents to adapt their bid strategies this algorithm works based upon the

farmers strive to approach the reference trading price is set to the previous transaction price for agents who have made a successful transaction and to the average of the previous market prices for the agents who had an unsuccessful bid in addition β i 0 1 is a dimensionless behavioral parameter representing farmers learning rate the farmer agents are initialized with the uniform distribution of learning rate and profit margin due to lack of available data p i t is farmer i s bid price at time step t and η i t is the reservation price many factors play a role in the determination of reservation price some of which are transaction cost pumping cost crop price etc du et al 2017 in this study reservation prices are calculated as follows η i t m n b i t 1 ω f o r b u y e r s m b i t

and τ i t the transaction cost imposed on farmer i would be ω q i t τ i t buyer and seller agents estimate their marginal value of water differently because they face a different level of water scarcity buyers determine their marginal value of water by calculating the difference between the profit gained by buying their market demand and the profit gained under current water availability which can be computed as smajgl et al 2009 m n b i t π i t o p t i m a l π i t c u r r e n t q i t where π i t o p t i m a l is the buyer i s net benefit when s he irrigates without water stress π i t c u r r e n t is the net benefit of buyer i under current circumstances with its current water permit m n b i t m l is the marginal net benefit of buyer i and q i t m l y r is the market demand of farmer i at year t theoretically the marginal value of sellers whose water permits are greater than their irrigation requirements have a marginal value of water equal to zero however we assume that they can behave strategically and determine their marginal value equal to their minimum production loss m b i t y i t p w y i t a w 1 p r i t where y i t p w k g y r is the potential production level w y i t a w 1 k g y r is the crop production under optimal water use minus 1 unit of water and p r i t t o m a n k g is the seller i s crop price at time t the pumping cost and crop yield which are used to estimate the marginal value of water are calculated as follows castilla rho et al 2017 du et al 2017 p c i t p e g i i t p h w t i t ν 1 y i t a y i t p k y 1 i i t i d i t where p c i t is

efficiency furthermore y i t a y i t p k g h a are actual and potential crop yields k y is a dimensionless parameter representing crop s yield response factor i i t m l is the actual agent i s applied water and i d i t m l is the irrigation demand in fact when estimating the water price by equation 4 buyers and sellers attempt to increase their individual surplus the individual surplus of every one of the market participants is calculated based upon the difference between the transacted price τ i t and farmer s reservation price η i t each of the market producer and consumer surplus is calculated as xu et al 2018 p s t i 1 s q i t τ i t η i t c s t i 1 s q i t η i t τ i t where p s t c s t t o m a n are the market producer and consumer surplus q i t and q i t both in mega liter ml

consumers surpluses in an agricultural water market is social welfare 2 3 3 government bidding behavior there is a wide range of studies that supports the economically and environmentally positive impacts of buyback programs ancev 2015 grafton and wheeler 2018 marchiori et al 2012 tisdell 2010b wheeler et al 2013 the buyback program used in this study aims to reduce the overall permit caps in order to act as a compensation based approach and benefit the farmers as well as the environment we use a cobb douglas utility function in order to estimates the government optimal bid amount u w α z 1 α where u is the utility of the government w is the amount of water needed for environmental protection z is all the whole bunches of other goods and services that the government may need and α 0 1 is the government tendency for acquiring water for the environment which changes based on precipitation in wet years α approaches 1 and vice versa which means that the government attempts to buy more water back from farmers in wet years to store in the aquifer considering the government budget constraint the optimal bid amount can be estimated as hamill and gilbert 2015 w t o p t i m a l α b c t p t where b c t is the government budget constraint and p t is the government s bid price which is determined using the profit margin and reservation price of the government by equation 4 assigning profit margin and learning rate behaviors to the government agent we simulated the government agent s bidding adaptation by zip algorithm the government agent bids using equation 4 and adapts its bidding strategy by equation 5 we assume that the reference trading price is the last transaction price if the government made a successful transaction and it is set to the average of the last market prices if the government failed to make a transaction 3 case study area fig 2 shows the rafsanjan plain located in an arid region in the central part of iran the rafsanjan plain has an area equal to 16 096 square kilometers groundwater is the main supply of freshwater for agricultural industrial and urban water users besides more than 1424 deep wells meet almost 99 percent of the region s water demand the continuous agricultural growth in the region has led to an over extraction of groundwater as a result some unprecedented consequences are arising some of which are severe groundwater depletion and water quality deterioration karamouz et al 2011 mehryar et al 2016 therefore demand side management policies such as water markets draw tremendous attention fig 3 a shows the location of the piezometers and boundary conditions of rafsanjan aquifer the locations of pumping wells are shown in fig 3b the unconfined aquifer of rafsanjan has an area approximately equal to 4100 square kilometers which is simulated using 4215 square grid cells with a dimension equal to 970 59 m in flowlogo fig 3c 4 results and discussion the results of the study are presented in three sections the first section describes the model calibration and the second section explains the economic and hydrologic results of the agent based groundwater market model the last section is a sensitivity analysis on the behavioral parameters of farmer agents in order to find their impacts on the market performance 4 1 calibration because no water market is implemented in the rafsanjan plain case study area we calibrated the status quo condition without any markets being at play we calibrated the groundwater model in two steps steady state and transient groundwater flow based on the available data we observed that the piezometers roughly had constant heads in the spring of 2002 so we assumed that piezometers had no change in their values through spring 2002 which means the only unknown parameter is hydraulic conductivity to be estimated therefore we performed the first step of calibration i e the steady state step by minimizing the differences in the observed and simulated heads in the piezometers using behavior search software tool and thus the unknown parameters of hydraulic conductivity were obtained the root mean square error rmse related to the steady state groundwater flow simulation is approximately 2 5 m after finding the hydraulic conductivity values in the aquifer we performed the second step i e the transient groundwater flow step in this step we estimated the second unknown parameter that is the aquifer s specific yield with an rmse approximately equal to 7 m over the eleven year period of 2002 2012 after these two steps we verified the groundwater submodel in the period of 2012 2017 to assess its credibility 4 2 simulation results in this section the hydrological and economic impacts of the proposed auction mechanisms all of which are based on the cap and trade scheme are assessed in five main scenarios the first scenario is the status quo scenario with no water market implementation nwm the second scenario is the market structure with discriminatory price double auction dpd the third and fourth scenarios are market mechanisms with uniform price double auction upd and equilibrium price discovery epd and the fifth scenario is the dpd scenario in conjunction with the government s buyback program dpdbp the dpdbp scenario analyzes the economic and hydrologic impacts of the governmental buyback program as a compensation based approach benefiting both the farmers by reducing caps on water permits and buying water back from farmers and the environment by storing the bought water in the aquifer in all of the market scenarios the simulation results are the average modeling results after 50 model executions and the 95 confidence band intervals are shown in corresponding graphs fig 4 compares the hydro economic impacts of the four market scenarios regarding their hydrologic impacts average groundwater tables are shown in fig 4a over a 16 year time period it can be noticed that all of the market scenarios have a positive and almost equal hydrologic impact on the aquifer s water table variations where larger water table means less groundwater left in the aquifer and vice versa the hydrologically similar performance of dpd upd and epd scenarios come mostly from similar caps on farmers water extraction without these caps on water extraction water markets would not necessarily result in more groundwater left in the aquifer this is because water markets increase allocative efficiency so water becomes more productive and more water can be consumed resulting in hydrologically unfavorable conditions the aquifer s water table in dpdbp scenario is more than other market scenarios since the buyback program reduces the overall caps on water permits to act as a compensation based approach and benefit farmers economically while the differences between the hydrologic performance of the market without buyback dpd and with buyback program dpdbp are negligible they have discernible differences economically shown in fig 4b 4c where farmers experience a higher net benefit and net present value in dpdbp in comparison with dpd it is worth mentioning that although the dpdbp scenario benefits farmers economically it incurs economic costs on the government for buying water back from the farmers in comparison with no market scenario nwm the upd epd and dpd scenarios reduce farmers net benefit considerably as the water permits are capped and there are no buyback programs but the dpdbp scenario can negate the economically adverse impacts of the caps to a great extent which can be seen in both the net benefit times series fig 4b and net present values fig 4c notwithstanding the decline in farmers net benefit in the market scenarios in comparison with the nwm scenario it seems that in the long run the groundwater market plays a crucial role environmentally and economically as the net benefit in the status quo scenario nwm is declining due to the increasing pumping cost fig 4b furthermore the best scenario in terms of farmers revenue is dpdbp and the worst scenario is upd the difference in farmers net benefit and net present values stems from the difference in the volume of traded water in these scenarios fig 5 b the more the volume of traded water the more are the farmers net benefits fig 4b and net present values fig 4c thus while the hydrological performances of four market scenarios are approximately similar because of similar caps on water permits the economic impacts of the market structures can be different considerably it is worth mentioning that theoretically water markets increase allocative efficiency so water becomes more productive resulting in increasing water consumption however in this study we used the cap and trade scheme as a means to ameliorate the hydrologically unfavorable condition of the rafsanjan aquifer therefore as a result of permit caps and lower water extraction the aquifer s hydrologic condition is more favorable in market scenarios in comparison with the scenario without water market nwm regarding the changes in net benefits through time fig 4b shows that after the first caps on water permits in time step 1 as farmers do not have sufficient information on how much to irrigate and how much to bid they experience less net benefit however they adapt their behaviors through time and gain more information so the net benefits become more stable from time step 3 it can be seen that in wet years in time steps 3 and 14 the net benefits increase in all of the scenarios due to more rainfall resulting in more crop yield which in turn reduces market water demand and increases market water supply however in the driest year time step 9 farmers have to use more of their water permits for irrigation resulting in less water supply and reduction in their net benefits fig 5a shows that the prices in dpd are closer to the equilibrium price than the upd so the volume of traded water in dpd is considerably more than the upd scenario shown in fig 5b the volume weighted average price is used to show dpd prices in comparison with other market scenarios the upd prices have undergone abrupt changes over time and have had more uncertainty suggested by wider confidence bands fig 5a this means that the uniform price double auction may not be the most stable market structure as the bid price of one individual the last buyer who can buy their bid amount totally or to some extent determines the market price this individual buyer is not constant through time which makes the prices change abruptly according to the buyers heterogeneous profit margins the price variations can cause the traded volume of water to change fig 5b and if the bid price of the last individual buyer is not close to the equilibrium price the market cannot function properly this makes the uniform price double auctions highly uncertain in terms of market functionality on the other hand the dpd and epd scenarios benefit from prices that take into account all of the market participants bids rather than one individual so they are more certain resulting in more traded volumes of water and more farmers participating in the market fig 5b c considering the market competition level in terms of volume of traded water fig 5b and the number of market participants fig 5c it is noticeable that the competition level in the dpdbp scenario is at the highest level and the market competition of dpd is at the same level with the epd scenario however the competition level of the upd scenario pales in comparison with the other three market scenarios the difference in market competition in dpd upd and dpdbp stems from their prices that is to say the prices in dpd and dpdbp are closer to equilibrium price in comparison with the upd scenario so the volume of traded water and the market participants are significantly higher in these scenarios this result concurs with the idea that discriminatory double auction is an efficient mechanism in water markets resulting in more market participants and traded volume of water du et al 2017 in theory the transaction amount in the equilibria prices is the potential maximum volume however fig 5b contradicts this theory at some points e g time steps 8 and 11 the reason why dpd has occasionally traded volume more than epd is that the supply and demand except for 2002 in the market mechanisms are not equal in other words since the transaction amounts of the three mechanisms in the first time step differ from each other the groundwater drawdown is not the same as a result the regulator caps farmers in a different amount and therefore the available supply and demand are not equal over time for all of the market mechanisms considering the gini index as an indicator of income distribution among farmers fig 6 a shows that the best and worst scenarios for wealth distribution among farmers are dpdbp and dpd in comparison with no market scenario this means that discriminatory price double auction dpd reduces equality of wealth distribution but the buyback program dpdbp can effectively negate it therefore not only do the buyback program increases farmers income fig 4b c but it reduces inequality distribution of wealth among farmers furthermore the epd scenario moderates the inequality distribution of wealth better than the two other auction mechanisms because in the equilibrium price all of the market supply and demands are transacted so no potential buyer or seller remains this means that all of the farmers are better off economically buyers by their additional crop revenue and sellers by revenue from their sold water and as a result the gini index reduces the gini index represents the distribution of wealth among farmers which relies on many factors like crop yields success in the market profit margin water permits etc however it can be deduced that the abrupt increment in the gini index of time step 9 in the dpd and epd scenarios is because of the traded volume of water and number of market participants that is the number of market participants approaches 100 in these scenarios in this time step fig 5c which means half of the farmers have successful transactions and vice versa resulting in an unequal wealth distribution among 200 farmers that causes an increment in gini index fig 6a fig 6 shows farmers surplus under different auction mechanisms dpd upd epd the farmers surplus is equal to social welfare in upd dpd and epd as the only market participants are the farmer agents the social welfare associated with the equilibrium price market epd is more than the other two auction mechanisms dpd and upd which is in line with the theory that in the equilibrium price the social welfare of the society is at its utmost level griffin 2006 fig 6 shows that the discriminatory price double auction provides a satisfactory degree of market social welfare due to its high traded volume fig 5b and approximate prices to the epd scenario fig 5a furthermore it can be noticed that the buyback programs reduce the farmers surplus due to the higher competition level higher market competition means that the market participants have to reduce their profit margin to be able to transact successfully resulting in a fewer surplus notwithstanding higher volumes of traded water of dpdbp than dpd the upd scenario has the lowest social welfare as the volume of traded water is lesser than the other scenarios despite its higher traded prices all in all the discriminatory price double auction mechanism for water markets which are implemented based on the cap and trade scheme is a satisfactory and efficient auction mechanism as its net present value is more than epd and upd while having the same hydrological impacts and its traded volume market competition and social welfare are as much as epd 4 3 sensitivity analysis this section analyzes the impacts of farmers behavioral parameters profit margin and learning rate on the economic performance of the water market we analyzed the impacts of these behavioral parameters on the discriminatory price double auction as an efficient mechanism in water markets these behavioral parameters are distributed with beta distribution changing their mean in order to perform the sensitivity analysis fig 7 shows the impacts of farmers behavioral parameters on the economic performance of the water market it is noticeable that as long as farmers learning rate is approximately equal to its highest amount β 1 irrespective of farmres profit margin the traded volume of water is at a high level fig 7a this is because farmers adapt their profit margin based on their learning rate and when the learning rates are at a high level they can efficiently adapt their bid prices in order to trade water successfully it also indicates that if farmers profit margin is near zero and their learning rate is near one the maximum amount of water will be traded the volume of traded water approaches its minimum level if the profit margin is high and the learning rate is low this result stems from the ineffective adaptation process that is high profit margin makes buyers bid lower prices and sellers bid higher prices resulting in lower transaction amounts and they cannot change their profit margin efficiently due to their low learning rates fig 7b shows the effects of farmers behavioral parameters on water prices it is evident that when the farmers profit margin is high and their learning rate is low the transaction prices go up resulting in a lower volume of water traded however when the learning rate is approximately at its highest amount no matter what is the farmers profit margin the average prices are at a level resulting in higher volumes of traded water which means the learning rate is an important parameter for the function of water markets finally fig 7c shows that farmers can obtain the highest profit if they have either high learning rates and low profit margins or high learning rates and high profit margins it also indicates that if the learning rates are near to their maximum possible amount farmers profit would be at a high level regardless of their profit margin due to high volumes of traded water the results of the sensitivity analysis revealed that if farmers have higher learning rates the water market functions better as more volume of water is traded and farmers earn more revenue however high profit margins prevent the water market from functioning in terms of traded volumes of water this result is in line with the result of other studies highlighting that water markets would function better if agents profit margin tendency of rent seeking is lower du et al 2017 5 conclusion many countries face challenges associated with drought and water scarcity and therefore strive for coming up with efficient measures to mitigate water scarcity thus this study explores the hydrologic and economic impacts of three different mechanisms of water markets based on the cap and trade scheme and evaluates the buyback program in order to find a structure that is hydrologically and economically efficient four primary market scenarios were analyzed discriminatory price double auction dpd uniform price double auction upd market with equilibrium price epd and government s buyback program in addition to dpd dpdbp the results denote that the discriminatory price double auction is the most hydrologically and economically efficient market mechanism as it brings about more profit for farmers and works hydrologically as well as other scenarios furthermore employing the buyback program can substantially increase the economic performance of water markets it can also reduce the gini index the inequality of wealth distribution and at the same time lowers the groundwater drawdown from 92 to 63 cm per year although all of the market mechanisms reduce the farmers net benefits in the short run because of the need for maintaining the environmental flow requirements caps on water permits the buyback programs can substantially attenuate the decline in farmers net benefit thus buyback programs can act as a compensation based approach for farmers participating in water markets the comparison of the market mechanisms shows that the discriminatory price double auction dpd has the best economic performance between market structures as it generally brings about more social welfare net present value and net benefit for the farmer agents the results particularly show that there are substantial trade offs between the economic and hydrologic performance of the water markets that is to say as we attempt to meet the environmental water demands by caps on water extractions the farmers are worse off economically however policies like buyback programs can effectively reduce the economically adverse impacts of caps on water extraction and act as a compensation based strategy regarding the limitations of this study it is worth mentioning that this study assumes that farmers would not violate their water permits by extracting water more than what is allowed additionally spatially hydro economic impacts of the groundwater market institution are not evaluated spatially heterogeneous impacts of groundwater markets are important as the groundwater flow is affected by topography therefore for future studies the spatial effects of groundwater markets and farmers compliance can be explored finally stochastic nature and volatilities in net benefits over the years are not

10647,agricultural water markets play a crucial role in arid and semi arid regions by reallocating water and transferring it from low value uses to high value uses several markets for surface water and groundwater are functioning all over the world to increase economic well being of farmers and meet environmental flow requirements however there is not a consensus on precisely which market mechanism may be more environmentally and economically beneficial this study presents an agent based groundwater market model to analyze the economic and hydrologic impacts of three market mechanisms designed based on the cap and trade scheme that differ in the price discovery process two of which are uniform price double auction and the third is a discriminatory price double auction this study also analyzes the hydrologic and economic impacts of water buyback programs modeling results applied to rafsanjan plain an arid region in iran show that the discriminatory price double auction is the most hydrologically and economically advantageous mechanism since it reduces the annual water level drawdown by 38 and brings about more profits for farmers in comparison with other market mechanisms furthermore the buyback program effectively reduces the inequality of wealth distribution gini index and increases farmers net benefit while reducing their surplus keywords tradeable groundwater permits agent based modeling uniform price double auction discriminatory price double auction water buyback program 1 introduction the earth s freshwater is limited and scarce so it is difficult and sometimes impossible to efficiently allocate water among competing users wheeler et al 2017 the greatest and most significant water supply for irrigation and therefore for food security is groundwater throughout the arid and semi arid regions of the world groundwater supplies prevent the deleterious consequences of droughts provide the rivers with environmental flow requirements and conserve the vulnerable biodiversity while groundwater utilization has many socially and economically benefits the over extraction of these precious resources can lead to environmentally and economically adverse consequences aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 de graaf et al 2017 marchiori et al 2012 two prominent viewpoints emerge when water demand surpasses water supply policymakers can either adopt supply enhancement policies such as dam construction and desalination or demand side management programs for instance trade of water permits and water conservation plans grafton and wheeler 2018 montilla lópez et al 2018 wheeler et al 2017 one effective and practical demand side management policy is water allocation by market mechanisms which can lead to sustainable water uses and increase economic well being of users many studies have supported the effectiveness of water markets in transferring water from low value uses to high value uses du et al 2017 the consideration of the opportunity cost delorit and block 2018 griffin 2006 howe and goemans 2003 enhancement of irrigation technologies and users awareness of the true value of water alamdarlo et al 2019 alarcón and juana 2016 and environmental protection erfani et al 2015 iftekhar et al 2013 the market based allocation of water resources in a basin is considered a complex system owing to the heterogeneity in water users available resources water delivery systems institutional regulations etc yang et al 2011 moreover water markets comprise various and autonomous agents buyers and sellers with different interests and tastes who are connected through a common resource groundwater or surface water therefore we can consider water markets as complex adaptive systems which entail adaptation processes due to continuous feedbacks between systems elements and are sensitive to initial conditions macal and north 2010 smajgl et al 2009 zhao et al 2013 many of the recently conducted studies used agent based modeling an appropriate method to understand and analyze complex adaptive systems in order to simulate and assess water market institutions in particular smajgl et al 2009 evaluated the environmental and economic impacts of changing the institutional framework of an existing water market iftekhar et al 2013 investigated the farmers behaviors and market competition effects on governments water buyback programs finally du et al 2017 scrutinized the relationships between farmers behavior and water market performance in terms of crop production and volume of traded water it is widely recognized that the water markets efficiency depends substantially on the institutional arrangement in fact there is a risk of rapid depletion of water resources in devoid of efficient institutions in water markets erfani et al 2015 to reduce environmentally negative effects of water markets several studies have evaluated policies that lessen harmful impacts of water markets on the environment such as buyback programs cap and trade scheme and different auction mechanisms erfani et al 2015 grafton and wheeler 2018 marchiori et al 2012 tisdell 2010a wheeler et al 2013 double auction mechanisms are generally considered efficient water market institutions du et al 2017 however economic principles do not provide a unanimously accepted theory in this case as to what double auction structure is more efficacious especially when there is no limitation on trade amount hailu and thoyer 2010 therefore there are enormous uncertainties about selecting an efficient market structure furthermore the heterogeneity in market participants behaviors and marginal values of water add to these uncertainties yang et al 2011 this study presents an agent based model intending to investigate the hydrological and economic differences between three auction structures in order to find an efficient hydrologic and economic auction mechanism while in recent years several studies have assessed water markets based on discriminatory price double auction aghaie et al under revision du et al 2017 and uniform price double auction gonzales and ajami 2019 smajgl et al 2009 analyzing and comparing these two mechanisms with each other and with water market with equilibrium price discovery is rare which is the aim of this paper besides in this paper the hydrological and economic impacts of water buyback programs as a means to benefit farmers as well as the environment are analyzed and evaluated the agents in this agent based model are farmer agents and government agent interacting with each other in the proposed water market trying to transact groundwater permits the farmer agents may want to buy or sell groundwater permits but the government agent tries to buy permits from farmers for environmental purposes the remainder of this paper is structured as follows in section two we explain the methodology including the water market submodel and the groundwater submodel in section three we present the case study area and its water related problems finally in section 4 we discuss the results of the study 2 methodology the agent based model which is simulated to evaluate different water market structures has two main components the first component is the agent based decision making submodel describing the agents and their decision making procedures based on their decisions the pumping rates of the wells are determined and are sent to the second component which is the agent based groundwater submodel as a result the groundwater submodel calculates the wells water tables and send them to the agent based decision making submodel the agent based decision making submodel also obtains the economic and horticultural data some of which are crop sensitivity to soil water deficit crop and electricity prices and both of the submodels receive the weather data from an exterior information provider the decision making submodel comprises 200 farmer agents and one government agent which tries to buy water back from farmer agents for environmental purposes in the decision making submodel there is a market institution which is responsible for capping farmers water entitlements based on water table drawdowns and regulating different market structures the flowchart of the agent based model is depicted in fig 1 as illustrated in fig 1 the model starts running at the beginning of the implementation of the market institution where the farmer agents and the government agent are created and their behavioral parameters are assigned the agents decide on their possible bid amounts and bid prices and send them to the market institution the market institution determines the transaction prices based on the market structure and transfer the groundwater permits from successful sellers to the successful buyers after the first market run agents update their pumping rates and their behaviors based on their success in the market their pumping rates then are transferred to the groundwater submodel which is flowlogo developed by castilla rho et al 2015 and after the groundwater simulation the water tables are updated based on the new water tables calculated by the groundwater flow simulation the market institution caps groundwater permits to facilitate sustainability in the following sections we describe the market institution and procedures for its price discoveries in section 2 1 and groundwater submodel and the agent based decision making submodel in sections 2 2 and 2 3 successively 2 1 market institution water permits are commonly traded either in centralized or decentralized market institutions the centralized markets usually match the participants bids using double auctions which can be performed in either uniform the central institution determines transaction prices or discriminatory the market participants bids determine the price price discoveries du et al 2017 on the other hand in the decentralized markets there are no intermediaries between sellers and buyers so searching and bargaining can have high costs xu et al 2018 the market institution used in this study is a centralized market using a double auction structure which is a common mechanism for water markets to evaluate its possible hydrologic and economic impacts the main roles of this centralized market institution are to discover transaction prices based on the market structure transfer groundwater permits from sellers to buyers and caps permits based on regional drawdowns to facilitate sustainability double auctions for price discovery can be implemented either as uniform price double auction all the goods have the same transaction price or discriminatory price double auction each transaction may occur at a different price du et al 2017 iftekhar et al 2013 smajgl et al 2009 xu et al 2018 the market institution used in this paper compares three different market mechanisms two of which are uniform price double auction with uniform and equilibrium price discoveries and the third mechanism is a discriminatory price double auction in all of the double auction mechanisms the process in which the buyers and sellers send their bids to the market institution are alike however the price discovery procedures are different in each one of the market structures which are explained in the following lines 2 1 1 discriminatory price double auction in this mechanism the central market institution sorts descendingly ascendingly the buyers sellers bid prices and matches the first buyer with the highest bid price with the first seller with the lowest bid price the central institution sets the transaction price to the average of the bid prices and the transaction amount to the minimum of the bid amounts if the buyer seller with the highest lowest bid price transacts all of their bid amounts s he leaves the market and the second buyer seller comes to the priority this procedure continues until no supply remains or all demands are satisfied or no buyers bid a price higher than sellers bid prices du et al 2017 gonzales and ajami 2019 2 1 2 uniform price double auction in the sealed bid uniform price double auction all of the goods are transacted at a uniform price which is set to the lowest bids out of the buyers who can meet their demand totally or to some extent the process in which the central institution determines the uniform price is explained as follows first all of the market participants submit their bid amounts and bid prices simultaneously after receiving all of the bids the central institution closes the market temporarily and sorts the bid prices ascending for sellers and descending for buyers the market institution then matches the bid amounts of sorted agents until the exhaustion of the total supply or nonexistence of buyers with bid price more than their corresponding sellers finally the transaction prices the uniform price is set to the lowest bid prices of the buyers who could meet their demand totally or to some extent 2 1 3 equilibrium price market structure the sealed bid equilibrium price market structure is entirely the same as the uniform price double auction except that the central market institution attempts to set the uniform price approximately equal to equilibrium price the equilibrium price is the price in which total market demand and supply are equal thus the central institution makes a balance between the total market demand t m d and the total market supply t m s in order to estimate the equilibrium price sterman 2000 p e q p r t m d t m s s where the p e q and p r are the equilibrium price and the reference price the reference price is initially set to the mean of market bid prices and s is the sensitivity of price to the demand supply balances the equilibrium price estimation process is as follows at the beginning of the market the central institution receives all of the bid prices and bid amounts the total supply demand of the market is the sum of the supplies demands of the sellers buyers whose bid prices are less more than the first reference price average of all the bid prices therefore the market institution has the reference price p r the market supply t m s and the market demand t m d at the first trial so it can obtain the first equilibrium price after calculating the equilibrium price the market institution sorts all of the bids again and with the calculated equilibrium price obtains new market supply and demand the new supply demand of the market is the sum of bid amount of sellers buyers whose bid price is less more than the obtained equilibrium price if the difference in market supply and market demand at this equilibrium price is negligible the equilibrium price is this obtained price however if the difference between market demand and market supply is considerable the obtained equilibrium price is not the real equilibrium price so it is set to the new reference price and a new equilibrium price will be determined the reference price will be changed until the market demand and supply become roughly equal 2 2 agent based groundwater submodel the agent based groundwater submodel in this study is developed in flowlogo modeling environment the flowlogo facilitates coupling agent based models with finite difference 2d groundwater flows which considerably helps researchers explore and examine the feedbacks between human and natural systems in one platform flowlogo is a flexible interface developed in netlogo by castilla rho et al 2015 which allows researchers to create coupled human and natural systems more quickly the flowlogo interface is capable of modeling various boundary conditions fixed head no flow and constant flux and a variety of groundwater sources and sinks pumping and injection wells rivers and springs as a result it is capable of simulating transient and steady state 2d groundwater flow in confined and unconfined aquifers using the finite difference method castilla rho et al 2015 2 3 agent based decision making submodel the agents in this market model are 200 farmer agents and a governmental agent who attempt to meet environmental demand by buying water permits back from farmer agents on a yearly basis the central market institution caps farmer agents water permits based on the water availability of their region which determines their maximum allowable level of water extraction therefore as a result of capping water permits some farmers may wish to buy water permits for irrigation or vice versa the farmer agents make pumping decisions through two distinct decision making processes irrigation policy and bidding behavior the governmental agent has the bidding behavior in which it tries to buy water back from farmer agents to allocate it to the environment the process in which agents make their decisions are described in the following sections 2 3 1 farmers irrigation policy the stress avoidance irrigation requirement for farmer agents in mega liter per year m l y r can be computed as straton heckbert et al 2009 i d i t r m w i t p c p i t 100 a i where r m w i t m m y r is recommended crop requirement p c p i t m m m 2 is precipitation and a i h a is the area under production many factors may affect farmers irrigation policy such as their sensitivity to soil water deficit rainfall and climate water availability irrigation technologies etc van duinen et al 2016 in this study we assign a behavioral parameter to farmer agents named irrigation strategy s t i t which indicate heterogeneity in farmers irrigation policy decision of s t i t 1 denotes that the farmer is not willing to deficit irrigate in time step t and s t i t 0 is equivalent to rain fed agriculture accordingly the actual irrigation requirement of farmer agent i for the selected s t i t can be estimated as i d i t i d i t s t i t initially the irrigation strategy is a random variable distributed by a uniform distribution ranging from 0 8 to 1 this variable is updated based upon the farmers net benefits history saved in their memory the farmer agents strive for attaining more benefits by adapting their irrigation strategies regarding bounded rationality concept humans rationality and information are limited arthur 1994 farmer agents obtain information in time so they adapt their irrigation strategy to gain higher profits by a simple algorithm which works as follows in this algorithm farmer agents have some mechanisms to produce strategies for irrigation after each year they recorded their strategies and their corresponding profits then they attempt to use the strategies corresponding to the highest profits in their memory they obtain more information regarding strategies and related profits so they can estimate more accurately in time 2 3 2 farmers bidding behavior the majority of concepts and ideas in this section are based on du et al 2017 which simulates a hypothetical water market to provide more insights into the way that farmer agents behave in the market the way the farmers decide on their bid amounts and bid prices is the farmers bidding behavior du et al 2017 which is explained in the following paragraphs in each market run the farmers bidding behavior includes two variables bid price and bid amount the farmer agents estimate their water supply or demand based on the difference between their water permit and their actual irrigation requirement q i t i d i t w p i t where q i t m l y r is supply to or demand from the central institution the negative q i t indicates that farmer i supply water to the market and the positive q i t denotes that the farmer is a buyer many factors affect the farmers bid prices which leads to heterogeneity in their bid prices the bidding prices are mainly affected by two factors first is the profit margin μ i t farmers tendency of rent seeking and second is reservation price η i t the maximum price buyers are willing to buy and the minimum price sellers are willing to sell therefore the farmers bidding prices are calculated as follows du et al 2017 p i t 1 μ i t η i t f o r b u y e r s 0 μ i t 1 1 μ i t η i t f o r s e l l e r s 0 μ i t by employing zero intelligence plus algorithm zip we eliminate complicated structures of memory based adaptation for agents to adapt their bid strategies this algorithm works based upon the agents types of activity in the water market buyer or seller and its success in making a transaction du et al 2017 μ i t 1 μ i t β i τ i t p i t η i t where τ i t is the reference trading price that farmers strive to approach the reference trading price is set to the previous transaction price for agents who have made a successful transaction and to the average of the previous market prices for the agents who had an unsuccessful bid in addition β i 0 1 is a dimensionless behavioral parameter representing farmers learning rate the farmer agents are initialized with the uniform distribution of learning rate and profit margin due to lack of available data p i t is farmer i s bid price at time step t and η i t is the reservation price many factors play a role in the determination of reservation price some of which are transaction cost pumping cost crop price etc du et al 2017 in this study reservation prices are calculated as follows η i t m n b i t 1 ω f o r b u y e r s m b i t 1 ω f o r s e l l e r s where ω 0 1 a dimensionless parameter is transaction cost ratio and is imposed on buyers and sellers equally if farmer i s transaction amount and transaction price are q i t and τ i t the transaction cost imposed on farmer i would be ω q i t τ i t buyer and seller agents estimate their marginal value of water differently because they face a different level of water scarcity buyers determine their marginal value of water by calculating the difference between the profit gained by buying their market demand and the profit gained under current water availability which can be computed as smajgl et al 2009 m n b i t π i t o p t i m a l π i t c u r r e n t q i t where π i t o p t i m a l is the buyer i s net benefit when s he irrigates without water stress π i t c u r r e n t is the net benefit of buyer i under current circumstances with its current water permit m n b i t m l is the marginal net benefit of buyer i and q i t m l y r is the market demand of farmer i at year t theoretically the marginal value of sellers whose water permits are greater than their irrigation requirements have a marginal value of water equal to zero however we assume that they can behave strategically and determine their marginal value equal to their minimum production loss m b i t y i t p w y i t a w 1 p r i t where y i t p w k g y r is the potential production level w y i t a w 1 k g y r is the crop production under optimal water use minus 1 unit of water and p r i t t o m a n k g is the seller i s crop price at time t the pumping cost and crop yield which are used to estimate the marginal value of water are calculated as follows castilla rho et al 2017 du et al 2017 p c i t p e g i i t p h w t i t ν 1 y i t a y i t p k y 1 i i t i d i t where p c i t is the pumping cost in toman per ha p e is the price of electricity in toman per kwh i i t p h m l h a is the actual applied water per ha w t i t is the water table in meter and ν is the overall efficiency furthermore y i t a y i t p k g h a are actual and potential crop yields k y is a dimensionless parameter representing crop s yield response factor i i t m l is the actual agent i s applied water and i d i t m l is the irrigation demand in fact when estimating the water price by equation 4 buyers and sellers attempt to increase their individual surplus the individual surplus of every one of the market participants is calculated based upon the difference between the transacted price τ i t and farmer s reservation price η i t each of the market producer and consumer surplus is calculated as xu et al 2018 p s t i 1 s q i t τ i t η i t c s t i 1 s q i t η i t τ i t where p s t c s t t o m a n are the market producer and consumer surplus q i t and q i t both in mega liter ml are agent i s sold and bought water permit η i t t o m a n m l is the reservation price and τ i t t o m a n m l is the agent i s transaction price finally the sum of the total producers surpluses and consumers surpluses in an agricultural water market is social welfare 2 3 3 government bidding behavior there is a wide range of studies that supports the economically and environmentally positive impacts of buyback programs ancev 2015 grafton and wheeler 2018 marchiori et al 2012 tisdell 2010b wheeler et al 2013 the buyback program used in this study aims to reduce the overall permit caps in order to act as a compensation based approach and benefit the farmers as well as the environment we use a cobb douglas utility function in order to estimates the government optimal bid amount u w α z 1 α where u is the utility of the government w is the amount of water needed for environmental protection z is all the whole bunches of other goods and services that the government may need and α 0 1 is the government tendency for acquiring water for the environment which changes based on precipitation in wet years α approaches 1 and vice versa which means that the government attempts to buy more water back from farmers in wet years to store in the aquifer considering the government budget constraint the optimal bid amount can be estimated as hamill and gilbert 2015 w t o p t i m a l α b c t p t where b c t is the government budget constraint and p t is the government s bid price which is determined using the profit margin and reservation price of the government by equation 4 assigning profit margin and learning rate behaviors to the government agent we simulated the government agent s bidding adaptation by zip algorithm the government agent bids using equation 4 and adapts its bidding strategy by equation 5 we assume that the reference trading price is the last transaction price if the government made a successful transaction and it is set to the average of the last market prices if the government failed to make a transaction 3 case study area fig 2 shows the rafsanjan plain located in an arid region in the central part of iran the rafsanjan plain has an area equal to 16 096 square kilometers groundwater is the main supply of freshwater for agricultural industrial and urban water users besides more than 1424 deep wells meet almost 99 percent of the region s water demand the continuous agricultural growth in the region has led to an over extraction of groundwater as a result some unprecedented consequences are arising some of which are severe groundwater depletion and water quality deterioration karamouz et al 2011 mehryar et al 2016 therefore demand side management policies such as water markets draw tremendous attention fig 3 a shows the location of the piezometers and boundary conditions of rafsanjan aquifer the locations of pumping wells are shown in fig 3b the unconfined aquifer of rafsanjan has an area approximately equal to 4100 square kilometers which is simulated using 4215 square grid cells with a dimension equal to 970 59 m in flowlogo fig 3c 4 results and discussion the results of the study are presented in three sections the first section describes the model calibration and the second section explains the economic and hydrologic results of the agent based groundwater market model the last section is a sensitivity analysis on the behavioral parameters of farmer agents in order to find their impacts on the market performance 4 1 calibration because no water market is implemented in the rafsanjan plain case study area we calibrated the status quo condition without any markets being at play we calibrated the groundwater model in two steps steady state and transient groundwater flow based on the available data we observed that the piezometers roughly had constant heads in the spring of 2002 so we assumed that piezometers had no change in their values through spring 2002 which means the only unknown parameter is hydraulic conductivity to be estimated therefore we performed the first step of calibration i e the steady state step by minimizing the differences in the observed and simulated heads in the piezometers using behavior search software tool and thus the unknown parameters of hydraulic conductivity were obtained the root mean square error rmse related to the steady state groundwater flow simulation is approximately 2 5 m after finding the hydraulic conductivity values in the aquifer we performed the second step i e the transient groundwater flow step in this step we estimated the second unknown parameter that is the aquifer s specific yield with an rmse approximately equal to 7 m over the eleven year period of 2002 2012 after these two steps we verified the groundwater submodel in the period of 2012 2017 to assess its credibility 4 2 simulation results in this section the hydrological and economic impacts of the proposed auction mechanisms all of which are based on the cap and trade scheme are assessed in five main scenarios the first scenario is the status quo scenario with no water market implementation nwm the second scenario is the market structure with discriminatory price double auction dpd the third and fourth scenarios are market mechanisms with uniform price double auction upd and equilibrium price discovery epd and the fifth scenario is the dpd scenario in conjunction with the government s buyback program dpdbp the dpdbp scenario analyzes the economic and hydrologic impacts of the governmental buyback program as a compensation based approach benefiting both the farmers by reducing caps on water permits and buying water back from farmers and the environment by storing the bought water in the aquifer in all of the market scenarios the simulation results are the average modeling results after 50 model executions and the 95 confidence band intervals are shown in corresponding graphs fig 4 compares the hydro economic impacts of the four market scenarios regarding their hydrologic impacts average groundwater tables are shown in fig 4a over a 16 year time period it can be noticed that all of the market scenarios have a positive and almost equal hydrologic impact on the aquifer s water table variations where larger water table means less groundwater left in the aquifer and vice versa the hydrologically similar performance of dpd upd and epd scenarios come mostly from similar caps on farmers water extraction without these caps on water extraction water markets would not necessarily result in more groundwater left in the aquifer this is because water markets increase allocative efficiency so water becomes more productive and more water can be consumed resulting in hydrologically unfavorable conditions the aquifer s water table in dpdbp scenario is more than other market scenarios since the buyback program reduces the overall caps on water permits to act as a compensation based approach and benefit farmers economically while the differences between the hydrologic performance of the market without buyback dpd and with buyback program dpdbp are negligible they have discernible differences economically shown in fig 4b 4c where farmers experience a higher net benefit and net present value in dpdbp in comparison with dpd it is worth mentioning that although the dpdbp scenario benefits farmers economically it incurs economic costs on the government for buying water back from the farmers in comparison with no market scenario nwm the upd epd and dpd scenarios reduce farmers net benefit considerably as the water permits are capped and there are no buyback programs but the dpdbp scenario can negate the economically adverse impacts of the caps to a great extent which can be seen in both the net benefit times series fig 4b and net present values fig 4c notwithstanding the decline in farmers net benefit in the market scenarios in comparison with the nwm scenario it seems that in the long run the groundwater market plays a crucial role environmentally and economically as the net benefit in the status quo scenario nwm is declining due to the increasing pumping cost fig 4b furthermore the best scenario in terms of farmers revenue is dpdbp and the worst scenario is upd the difference in farmers net benefit and net present values stems from the difference in the volume of traded water in these scenarios fig 5 b the more the volume of traded water the more are the farmers net benefits fig 4b and net present values fig 4c thus while the hydrological performances of four market scenarios are approximately similar because of similar caps on water permits the economic impacts of the market structures can be different considerably it is worth mentioning that theoretically water markets increase allocative efficiency so water becomes more productive resulting in increasing water consumption however in this study we used the cap and trade scheme as a means to ameliorate the hydrologically unfavorable condition of the rafsanjan aquifer therefore as a result of permit caps and lower water extraction the aquifer s hydrologic condition is more favorable in market scenarios in comparison with the scenario without water market nwm regarding the changes in net benefits through time fig 4b shows that after the first caps on water permits in time step 1 as farmers do not have sufficient information on how much to irrigate and how much to bid they experience less net benefit however they adapt their behaviors through time and gain more information so the net benefits become more stable from time step 3 it can be seen that in wet years in time steps 3 and 14 the net benefits increase in all of the scenarios due to more rainfall resulting in more crop yield which in turn reduces market water demand and increases market water supply however in the driest year time step 9 farmers have to use more of their water permits for irrigation resulting in less water supply and reduction in their net benefits fig 5a shows that the prices in dpd are closer to the equilibrium price than the upd so the volume of traded water in dpd is considerably more than the upd scenario shown in fig 5b the volume weighted average price is used to show dpd prices in comparison with other market scenarios the upd prices have undergone abrupt changes over time and have had more uncertainty suggested by wider confidence bands fig 5a this means that the uniform price double auction may not be the most stable market structure as the bid price of one individual the last buyer who can buy their bid amount totally or to some extent determines the market price this individual buyer is not constant through time which makes the prices change abruptly according to the buyers heterogeneous profit margins the price variations can cause the traded volume of water to change fig 5b and if the bid price of the last individual buyer is not close to the equilibrium price the market cannot function properly this makes the uniform price double auctions highly uncertain in terms of market functionality on the other hand the dpd and epd scenarios benefit from prices that take into account all of the market participants bids rather than one individual so they are more certain resulting in more traded volumes of water and more farmers participating in the market fig 5b c considering the market competition level in terms of volume of traded water fig 5b and the number of market participants fig 5c it is noticeable that the competition level in the dpdbp scenario is at the highest level and the market competition of dpd is at the same level with the epd scenario however the competition level of the upd scenario pales in comparison with the other three market scenarios the difference in market competition in dpd upd and dpdbp stems from their prices that is to say the prices in dpd and dpdbp are closer to equilibrium price in comparison with the upd scenario so the volume of traded water and the market participants are significantly higher in these scenarios this result concurs with the idea that discriminatory double auction is an efficient mechanism in water markets resulting in more market participants and traded volume of water du et al 2017 in theory the transaction amount in the equilibria prices is the potential maximum volume however fig 5b contradicts this theory at some points e g time steps 8 and 11 the reason why dpd has occasionally traded volume more than epd is that the supply and demand except for 2002 in the market mechanisms are not equal in other words since the transaction amounts of the three mechanisms in the first time step differ from each other the groundwater drawdown is not the same as a result the regulator caps farmers in a different amount and therefore the available supply and demand are not equal over time for all of the market mechanisms considering the gini index as an indicator of income distribution among farmers fig 6 a shows that the best and worst scenarios for wealth distribution among farmers are dpdbp and dpd in comparison with no market scenario this means that discriminatory price double auction dpd reduces equality of wealth distribution but the buyback program dpdbp can effectively negate it therefore not only do the buyback program increases farmers income fig 4b c but it reduces inequality distribution of wealth among farmers furthermore the epd scenario moderates the inequality distribution of wealth better than the two other auction mechanisms because in the equilibrium price all of the market supply and demands are transacted so no potential buyer or seller remains this means that all of the farmers are better off economically buyers by their additional crop revenue and sellers by revenue from their sold water and as a result the gini index reduces the gini index represents the distribution of wealth among farmers which relies on many factors like crop yields success in the market profit margin water permits etc however it can be deduced that the abrupt increment in the gini index of time step 9 in the dpd and epd scenarios is because of the traded volume of water and number of market participants that is the number of market participants approaches 100 in these scenarios in this time step fig 5c which means half of the farmers have successful transactions and vice versa resulting in an unequal wealth distribution among 200 farmers that causes an increment in gini index fig 6a fig 6 shows farmers surplus under different auction mechanisms dpd upd epd the farmers surplus is equal to social welfare in upd dpd and epd as the only market participants are the farmer agents the social welfare associated with the equilibrium price market epd is more than the other two auction mechanisms dpd and upd which is in line with the theory that in the equilibrium price the social welfare of the society is at its utmost level griffin 2006 fig 6 shows that the discriminatory price double auction provides a satisfactory degree of market social welfare due to its high traded volume fig 5b and approximate prices to the epd scenario fig 5a furthermore it can be noticed that the buyback programs reduce the farmers surplus due to the higher competition level higher market competition means that the market participants have to reduce their profit margin to be able to transact successfully resulting in a fewer surplus notwithstanding higher volumes of traded water of dpdbp than dpd the upd scenario has the lowest social welfare as the volume of traded water is lesser than the other scenarios despite its higher traded prices all in all the discriminatory price double auction mechanism for water markets which are implemented based on the cap and trade scheme is a satisfactory and efficient auction mechanism as its net present value is more than epd and upd while having the same hydrological impacts and its traded volume market competition and social welfare are as much as epd 4 3 sensitivity analysis this section analyzes the impacts of farmers behavioral parameters profit margin and learning rate on the economic performance of the water market we analyzed the impacts of these behavioral parameters on the discriminatory price double auction as an efficient mechanism in water markets these behavioral parameters are distributed with beta distribution changing their mean in order to perform the sensitivity analysis fig 7 shows the impacts of farmers behavioral parameters on the economic performance of the water market it is noticeable that as long as farmers learning rate is approximately equal to its highest amount β 1 irrespective of farmres profit margin the traded volume of water is at a high level fig 7a this is because farmers adapt their profit margin based on their learning rate and when the learning rates are at a high level they can efficiently adapt their bid prices in order to trade water successfully it also indicates that if farmers profit margin is near zero and their learning rate is near one the maximum amount of water will be traded the volume of traded water approaches its minimum level if the profit margin is high and the learning rate is low this result stems from the ineffective adaptation process that is high profit margin makes buyers bid lower prices and sellers bid higher prices resulting in lower transaction amounts and they cannot change their profit margin efficiently due to their low learning rates fig 7b shows the effects of farmers behavioral parameters on water prices it is evident that when the farmers profit margin is high and their learning rate is low the transaction prices go up resulting in a lower volume of water traded however when the learning rate is approximately at its highest amount no matter what is the farmers profit margin the average prices are at a level resulting in higher volumes of traded water which means the learning rate is an important parameter for the function of water markets finally fig 7c shows that farmers can obtain the highest profit if they have either high learning rates and low profit margins or high learning rates and high profit margins it also indicates that if the learning rates are near to their maximum possible amount farmers profit would be at a high level regardless of their profit margin due to high volumes of traded water the results of the sensitivity analysis revealed that if farmers have higher learning rates the water market functions better as more volume of water is traded and farmers earn more revenue however high profit margins prevent the water market from functioning in terms of traded volumes of water this result is in line with the result of other studies highlighting that water markets would function better if agents profit margin tendency of rent seeking is lower du et al 2017 5 conclusion many countries face challenges associated with drought and water scarcity and therefore strive for coming up with efficient measures to mitigate water scarcity thus this study explores the hydrologic and economic impacts of three different mechanisms of water markets based on the cap and trade scheme and evaluates the buyback program in order to find a structure that is hydrologically and economically efficient four primary market scenarios were analyzed discriminatory price double auction dpd uniform price double auction upd market with equilibrium price epd and government s buyback program in addition to dpd dpdbp the results denote that the discriminatory price double auction is the most hydrologically and economically efficient market mechanism as it brings about more profit for farmers and works hydrologically as well as other scenarios furthermore employing the buyback program can substantially increase the economic performance of water markets it can also reduce the gini index the inequality of wealth distribution and at the same time lowers the groundwater drawdown from 92 to 63 cm per year although all of the market mechanisms reduce the farmers net benefits in the short run because of the need for maintaining the environmental flow requirements caps on water permits the buyback programs can substantially attenuate the decline in farmers net benefit thus buyback programs can act as a compensation based approach for farmers participating in water markets the comparison of the market mechanisms shows that the discriminatory price double auction dpd has the best economic performance between market structures as it generally brings about more social welfare net present value and net benefit for the farmer agents the results particularly show that there are substantial trade offs between the economic and hydrologic performance of the water markets that is to say as we attempt to meet the environmental water demands by caps on water extractions the farmers are worse off economically however policies like buyback programs can effectively reduce the economically adverse impacts of caps on water extraction and act as a compensation based strategy regarding the limitations of this study it is worth mentioning that this study assumes that farmers would not violate their water permits by extracting water more than what is allowed additionally spatially hydro economic impacts of the groundwater market institution are not evaluated spatially heterogeneous impacts of groundwater markets are important as the groundwater flow is affected by topography therefore for future studies the spatial effects of groundwater markets and farmers compliance can be explored finally stochastic nature and volatilities in net benefits over the years are not

10648,optimizing irrigation scheduling through a decision support system has shown promise to improve crop yield and water productivity in irrigated agriculture in an arid climate the effects of an irrigation scheduling method on cotton gossypium hirsutum l yield and water productivity were investigated in qira oasis china from 2016 2018 the decision support system for irrigation scheduling dssis was based on forecasted rainfall and water stress index simulated by the root zone water quality model rzwqm2 a field experiment was conducted to test the viability of the dssis in 2016 the design of the experiment was a randomized complete that included two factors and two levels for each factor i irrigation scheduling method dssis based dss and soil moisture sensor based sms and ii irrigation level full irrigation fi and deficit irrigation di 75 of fi implementation of the dss led to significant increases in seed cotton yield 1 05 mg ha 1 32 and water productivity 1 64 kg ha 1 mm 1 20 compared to the sms compared to di fi significantly increased cotton yield 0 69 mg ha 1 20 but had no significant effect on water productivity in general the higher water productivity under dss vs sms was attributed to the reduced water stress and increased seed cotton yield while the dss fi treatment provided the greatest seed cotton yield 4 55 mg ha 1 and net income us 3427 ha 1 the highest water productivity 10 09 kg ha 1 mm 1 was achieved under the dss di treatment water use under dss di treatment significantly decreased by 51 mm 10 and 23 mm 5 respectively compared to dss fi and sms fi treatments therefore our results demonstrated that the dss with deficit irrigation could maintain cotton yield and improve water productivity under an arid desert climate keywords dssis rzwqm2 model water use water stress index arid climate 1 introduction increasing demand for food and fiber has put unprecedented stresses upon agriculture and natural resources foley et al 2011 limited surface water and overexploitation of groundwater have proven to pose significant challenges for the agricultural sector in semi arid and arid regions improving water use efficiency wue is an effective way to alleviate water scarcity restricting agricultural crop production in china agricultural production accounts for roughly 70 of water consumption of which 90 is used in farmland

and production are 2 49 106 ha and 5 11 tg y 1 respectively representing 75 and 83 of the nation s acreage and production however higher demands by industrial and urban water consumption have reduced irrigation water availability and water has become an expensive commodity rao et al 2016 increased water demands for ecosystem maintenance have further exacerbated the shortage of agricultural water use in recent years large tracts of sandy soil have been reclaimed into cultivated land in southern xinjiang local farmers have continued to exploit groundwater to meet growing irrigation water needs resulting in a significant and accelerating decline in groundwater table currently planting cotton is an important source of economic income for local farmers in xinjiang half of the province s

2018 oker et al 2018 advances in technology have driven the development of a range of sensors that can continuously monitor soil moisture status in farmland in recent years irrigation management decisions based on soil water matric potential ψ m s o i l thresholds have been widely adopted assessing the effects of different ψ m s o i l thresholds on seed cotton yield under drip irrigation at a saline wasteland reclamation site in xinjiang province wang et al 2015 found that the highest average seed cotton yield 3 2 mg ha 1 was achieved under the ψ m s o i l 5 k p a space at 20 cm depth soil water potential a similar application of ψ m s o i l thresholds to schedule irrigation was reported by thompson et al 2007a liu et al 2012 nolz et al 2016 müller et al 2016 and wang et al 2018 volumetric soil water content θ monitored by time domain reflectometry tdr time domain transmissometry tdt or frequency domain reflectometry fdr has also been used as the upper and lower thresholds for irrigation thompson et al 2007b used the sensor monitored θ to guide irrigation in drying soil similar studies regarding irrigation scheduling based on θ thresholds were reported by vellidis et al 2008 kang et al 2012 and gabriel et al 2017 in greenhouse grown vegetable crops ψ m s o i l based irrigation scheduling method proved to be much more reliable than that based on θ thresholds because θ thresholds were affected by soil depth thompson et al 2007a both ψ m s o i l based and θ based irrigation scheduling methods can be automated and decrease irrigation water use as compared to conventional experience based irrigation scheduling methods however the installation of sensors in the field may affect field operations and their positioning and contact with soil are critical in addition excessive or too little irrigation amount may occur during crop growth season owing to a fixed irrigation threshold for sensor based irrigation method many features of the plant s physiology respond directly to changes in water status in the roots or in other tissues rather than to changes in θ jones 2004 greater precision in the application of irrigation under crop water deficit can potentially be improved by monitoring crop physiological indicators through its relation to transpiration and stomatal conductance canopy temperature is an indirect indicator of the plant s water status jones 1999 irrigation scheduling method based on monitoring crop canopy temperature to assess the crop water stress index cwsi has served in agricultural irrigation management in recent years using canopy temperature to determine signals for irrigation control and investigating the relationship between crop water stress and cotton lint yield wanjura et al 2006 showed the mean seed cotton yield decreased by 0 34 mg ha 1 for each additional hour of stress time on days with water stress during the irrigation period others mahan et al 2005 o shaughnessy and evett 2010 conaty et al 2012 shao et al 2019 have reported the use of continuous canopy temperature measurement for irrigation scheduling since the closure of stomata increases canopy temperature a cwsi based irrigation scheduling method can precisely determine the time and amount of irrigation water however a reference value of crop canopy temperature under full irrigation is required for these irrigation control methods qi et al 2016 overall a common problem with sensor based irrigation scheduling methods is that the instrument installed in the field is not conducive to field operations requires maintenance and provides no forecast of upcoming weather conditions compared to instrumental monitoring approaches the application of models to provide information on irrigation scheduling has the advantage of being low cost not interfering with field operations and considering upcoming weather conditions recently there has been wide implementation of optimization models to address irrigation scheduling problems wen et al 2017 developed a daily scale yield maximizing simulation based optimization model for optimal irrigation scheduling of mulched crops similarly numerical and process based hydrologic models were applied in the decision support systems dsss dang et al 2018 abd el baki et al 2018 lima et al 2018 for instance wei et al 2018 and zhang et al 2018 used the soil and water assessment tool swat model to optimize the irrigation schedule at the watershed scale however these studies did not consider differences in crop water requirements at different growth stages on the other hand an agricultural system model capable of continuously simulating crop growth θ and evapotranspiration et has the potential to aid in optimizing irrigation scheduling for example li et al 2018a b optimized irrigation strategies based on aquacrop model for cotton and spring wheat the agricultural production systems simulator apsim decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat and cropwat

developed an irrigation scheduling software based on the water stress simulated by rzwqm2 studies have increasingly focused on using agricultural system models to simulate water availability parameters employed in optimal irrigation scheduling however studies on the efficacy of an irrigation scheduling method based on an agricultural system model in terms of crop yield water productivity and economic profitability are rare using data collected at an irrigated cotton site liu et al 2017 calibrated and validated rzwqm2 a hybrid model between rzwqm and dssat 4 0 which provided readily available soil and crop parameters for the site cotton was simulated in rzwqm2 using the cropgro cotton module from dssat 4 0 in addition an automated dssis based irrigation control system based on a

also set the irrigation threshold of sms based method at 0 07 cm3 cm 3 in a find sand in southwest florida similar irrigation threshold 0 07 cm3 cm 3 for sms based method was also reported by cardenas lailhacar et al 2010 and mccready et al 2009 for both irrigation scheduling methods dss and sms the time of irrigation for di was the same as that for fi in 2016 owing to a broken sensor for sms fi treatment plot after june no water was applied where the sensors had been installed consequently the plants were irrigated every two weeks to maintain crop growth under the sms based irrigation scheduling method such that the irrigation amount concurred with that in a neighbouring cotton field managed by field technicians the planting and harvesting dates and irrigation events over the three

representative cotton plants collected in each experimental plot heated at 105 c for 30 min then cut into pieces and dried to constant weight in a 75 c oven seed cotton yield was determined by manually picking and weighing the bolls for each experimental plot from late september to early november 2 4 3 fiber quality at harvest cotton fiber samples picked by famers from four plants were taken from the middle row of each plot for the determining fiber quality manually separating fibers from seeds the cotton fiber quality index was determined using a cotton fiber quality detector hvi

simultaneously software and computer cost for dssis based and soil moisture sensor cost for sms based irrigation scheduling method labor cost includes irrigation event seeding and picking cotton labor cost was set at 50 per person for operating each irrigation event the number irrigation events in each year were 7 and 5 for the dssis and sensor based methods respectively owing to the fact that farm activities were hourly paid in this region picking cotton cost was variable which were associated with seed cotton yield basic cost were estimated to be 1500 ha 1 y 1 for each treatment including fertilizers seeds and others in addition no additional pest management cost was calculated because no significant pest infestation was found in this region water and seed cotton prices used for calculation were 0 04 m 3 and 1 30 kg 1 shareef et al 2018 respectively the average of local government pricing and local market pricing in 2016 2018 2 6 data analysis the proc analysis of variance anova procedure in statistical analysis system sas 9 2 software was used to determine the effects of different treatments irrigation scheduling and level on soil water content water use yield wp plant height aboveground biomass and fiber quality of cotton residuals were tested for normality shapiro wilk test and in all cases their distribution did not differ significantly p 0 05 from normality differences amongst means were considered significant at p 0 05 level using duncan test for all parameters the year effect was not significant p 0 05 so parameter values were averaged across years before being subjected to 2 factor anova irrigation scheduling level the irrigation scheduling level interaction was not significant p 0 05 for any measured parameter except for quantity of irrigation water applied which was marginally significant p 0 030 notwithstanding the lack of interaction to distinguish treatment combination differences another anova was run to separate between the four treatment combinations 3 results for all measured parameters the effect of year on cotton production was found to be non significant p 0 05 accordingly the anova was applied to data averaged across the three years unless otherwise stated significant differences reflect p 0 05 3 1 seed cotton yield and water productivity seed cotton yield was significantly 32 greater under the dss 4 29 mg ha 1 than under the sms 3 24 mg ha 1 and significantly 20 greater under fi 4 11 mg ha 1 than under di 3 42 mg ha 1 a significant increase in seed cotton yield was obtained in dss fi treatment compared to other treatments over the three years except for dss di treatment dss fi treatment increased seed cotton yield by 13 2 24 3 and 61 9 compared to dss di sms fi and sms di respectively water productivity wp was significantly 20 greater under the dss 9 77 kg ha 1 mm 1 than under the sms 8 13 kg ha 1 mm 1 but irrigation level had no significant effect on wp table 3 only the dss di 10 09 kg ha 1 mm 1 and sms di 7 68 kg ha 1 mm 1 treatments showed significant differences dss di treatment increased wp by 6 8 17 6 and 31 4 compared to dss fi sms fi and sms di respectively 3 2 soil water content and water use table 4 shows average soil water content variation in the soil profile under different treatments over the whole growth period from planting to harvest during 2016 2018 in all layers above 0 65 m the dssis based irrigation scheduling provided a significantly wetter root zone for crop growth over the growing season than the sms based irrigation scheduling but no difference was observed for the 0 65 1 00 m soil layer table 4 full irrigation provided a wetter soil environment compared to deficit irrigation for the 0 25 0 40 m and 0 40 0 65 m soil layers but no difference was found in other soil depths table 4 the dss fi treatment provided greater moisture at the 0 25 0 40 m 0 40 0 65 m and 0 65 1 00 m soil depths than any other irrigation regime the amount of irrigation applied and water use were affected by irrigation scheduling method table 5 and more irrigation water 25 was applied under fi 355 mm than under di 268 mm and water use was 15 greater under fi 468 mm than under di 400 mm sms significantly decreased irrigation amount and water use by 18 and 11 respectively compared to dss the lowest irrigation amount and water use were found in sms di treatment overall the amount of irrigation water applied and the water use declined in the order of sms di dss di sms fi dss fi 3 3 crop height and aboveground biomass plant was significantly taller 13 under the dss 0 79 m than under the sms 0 70 m and significantly taller 8 under fi 0 77 m than under deficit irrigation 0 71 m table 6 similarly aboveground biomass was significantly higher 33 under the dss 11 28 mg ha 1 than under the sms 8 45 mg ha 1 and significantly higher 21 under full irrigation 10 81 mg ha 1 than under deficit irrigation 8 92 mg ha 1 the maximum values for both plant height and aboveground biomass were obtained under dss fi while the lowest were obtained under sms di table 6 overall both plant height and biomass increased in the order of dss fi dss di sms fi sms di 3 4 cotton fiber quality and economic profitability fiber quality was not affected by either irrigation method or level although some measurements were slightly lower under the sms di than under other treatments table 7 the profitability of cotton production under different irrigation methods and levels particularly the total cost of production and net income achieved over the three years are summarized in table 8 the results illustrated that the dss fi treatment generated the greatest net income due to higher seed cotton yield water cost under dss fi treatment was us 153 ha 1 which was 36 ha 1 31 22 ha 1 17 and 55 ha 1 56 greater than under the dss di sms fi and sms di treatments respectively the dss fi treatment provided a maximum net income of 3427 ha 1 which was 643 ha 1 18 1063 ha 1 31 and 2109 ha 1 62 higher than under the dss di sms fi and sms di treatments respectively compared to the sms di treatment 0 54 m 3 the nwp values under the dss fi 0 9 m 3 dss di 0 96 m 3 and sms fi 0 72 m 3 were 67 78 and 33 higher respectively 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of dss on seed cotton yield and water productivity real time and precise irrigation scheduling could improve or maintain crop yield with less water irrigated the seed cotton yield obtained in the present study under the dss was similar to those obtained in the same region by shareef et al 2018 and kuang et al 2018 the average seed cotton yield under the sms fi treatment in the current study was 3 66 mg ha 1 similar to that reported by wang et al 2015 2018 under soil matric potential smp thresholds of 5 kpa 3 23 3 65 mg ha 1 in general a significant advantage in seed cotton yield was found in dss than sms reflecting the benefit of lesser water stress due to real time irrigation and greater moisture in the soil bearing the cotton root profile table 4 in the present study water productivity for the dss and sms were 9 45 10 09 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 7 68 8 58 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively water productivity under the dss concurred with those reported by tan et al 2018 who showed that wue for cotton ranging from 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 to 12 kg ha 1 mm 1 with drip irrigation controlled by an aquacrop model based irrigation scheduling method wang et al 2014 reported a wue for cotton ranging from 4 05 kg ha 1 mm 1 to 12 67 kg ha 1 mm 1 under an smp based irrigation scheduling however water productivity values in the present study were higher than the 2 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 reported by o shaughnessy and evett 2010 for cotton grown under an irrigation system based on canopy temperature in addition the 4 6 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 increase in water productivity for cotton under dss vs sms in this study compared well with that of the conventional drip irrigation control method employed in this region 4 1 4 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 shareef et al 2018 there was a significant difference in water productivity between dss and sms for the fact that dss increased crop yield with lower water use in addition the dss was more conducive to field management operations compared to the sms 4 2 the effect of dss on soil water content and water use frequent irrigations at higher rates could optimize the root zone for crop growth rawlin and raats 1975 especially for shallow root crops in sandy textured soils compared to sms a greater frequency of irrigation occurred under the dss table 1 the frequency and amount of irrigation under the dss were affected not only by weather conditions but also by the simulated crop growth conditions however only considering current weather conditions may lead to delay the triggering time for the next irrigation event in sms which may fail to irrigate the crop when needed local farmers were accustomed to irrigation intervals of around 20 d whereas in the present study the intervals did not exceed 15 d even under the dss tan et al 2018 reported that cotton growth required more irrigation water or high irrigation frequency in sandy loam due to its lower water holding capacity dss saved irrigation water use and improved wp under a relatively low soil water content without water stress by making full use of soil water and rainfall in contrast sms used a fixed upper and lower threshold to maintain the soil water content in the root zone in fact water stress may occur at different soil water content during crop growth season therefore a longer irrigation interval for sms might be caused by the fixed upper and lower irrigation threshold a dynamic or more precise irrigation threshold needs to be investigated for sms in the future in addition thompson et al 2007a reported that the depth of soil selected for soil moisture calculation might affect irrigation thresholds for sms the seasonal average amount of irrigation applied to cotton with drip irrigation was approximately 500 mm for cotton in southern xinjiang feng et al 2017 dss under fi average decreased water use by 506 mm and 155 mm respectively when compared to the results of shareef et al 2018 and kuang et al 2018 who used conventional et based irrigation scheduling method with drip irrigation in the same region such lower water use values under a dssis based irrigation scheduling method were also noted by tan et al 2018 using the aquacrop model to determine the appropriate irrigation depths for cotton in southern xinjiang 406 462 mm water use under the sms was lower than the irrigation applied 643 mm under smp thresholds of 5 kpa space at 20 cm depth treatment in an arid region of northwest china wang et al 2015 the differences were likely because of different climate cotton cultivars and irrigation trigger thresholds 4 3 cotton fiber quality and economic profitability under different irrigation treatments in general the fiber quality was not affected by either the irrigation scheduling method or level under the sms di treatment cotton fiber length uniformity and spinning consistency index decreased slightly but the percentage of short fiber increased possibly owing to water deficit longer fiber and higher uniformity have been noted under full than under deficit irrigation levels similar to previous studies dagdelen et al 2009 basal et al 2009 attia et al 2015 our observation of no significant differences in fiber strength elongation percentage of lint harvested before frost over total and micronaire parameters concurred with the results of papastylianou and argyrokastritis 2014 who reported that there was no significant difference in fiber strength and micronaire values between irrigation levels a few major genes rather than the growth environment may determine fiber quality parameters in the present study the dss fi treatment produced the maximum net income of 3427 ha 1 this was higher than the 2689 5 ha 1 reported by wang et al 2014 for a method based on an smp threshold of 20 kpa for double centrally located laterals applied in xinjiang province s jungger basin with irrigation amount of 6313 m3 ha 1 dagdelen et al 2009 and shareef et al 2018 also reported that higher irrigation amount led to higher cotton net income in the present paper the net income under dss fi treatment was higher than other treatments due to the fact that higher seed cotton yield resulted from more irrigation water supply and real time irrigation from the point of view of net income alone an increase in irrigation amount to improve cotton yield may be a better choice for local farmers in the present paper the low net income for sms was caused by the lower seed cotton yield although net income was relatively low a lower irrigation water use was occurred in dss di treatment with a relatively high net water productivity compared to dss fi treatment therefore a dss with deficit irrigation may be the best choice for sustainable irrigation management in the region as it conserves more water 4 4 optimization for sms and dss the reason that dssis and sms results in different irrigation schedules was that the cotton under sms treatment was more water stressed due to the low irrigation threshold of 0 06 cm3 cm 3 comparing to the crop under the dssis treatment sms reached the lower irrigation threshold very slowly owing to the fact that there was not much change in swc from 0 07 cm3 cm 3 to 0 06 cm3 cm 3 this might be caused by sensor inaccuracy or weather condition therefore sms triggered an irrigation event with an average of 18 days while dssis triggered an irrigation event with an average of 13 days fig 3 in sms the lower economic benefits might be mainly affected by the irrigation threshold the sensor position and accuracy the irrigation threshold directly determined the irrigation amount in sms the irrigation threshold may be the main factor which led to a low irrigation amount in sms the precise irrigation threshold in sms will be optimized in the future study in addition sensor position and accuracy may also affect the irrigation amount and timing soulis et al 2015 considering the experimental plot size 6 m 10 m and field operations one sensor in each of the 0 1 m and 0 2 m deep soil profile was installed in the sms plot the monitored soil moisture content may be affected by the sensor installation location in the future more sensors will be installed across the diagonal line of each plot with varying distance from the drip irrigation pipe this also indicated that the cost of the sms will increase and more sensors will cause more inconvenience for field operations on the other hand the precision of the model itself and the quality of calibration determine the effectiveness of the irrigation system based on the process based models gu et al 2020 the validation and parameter optimization of rzwqm2 are the critical step in application of the dss initial data soil and crop parameters field management etc needs to be optimized in dss in addition some fixed irrigation thresholds for the swfac parameter need to be used for the dss in the future study 5 conclusions the present study evaluated over a three year period the effect of a new irrigation scheduling method on seed cotton yield water productivity and economic profitability under an arid desert climate the benefit of the dss was that compared to sms seed cotton yield water productivity and economic profitability were simultaneously enhanced in addition the dss showed higher net water productivity compared to the sms maximum crop yield plant height and aboveground biomass of cotton were obtained for the dss fi treatment which may be attributable to better soil water status under the timely and more frequent irrigation events as the dss di treatment can maintain crop yield with low irrigation level for sustainable development in an irrigated agricultural region it may be the best choice for local development owing to its greater water productivity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

10648,optimizing irrigation scheduling through a decision support system has shown promise to improve crop yield and water productivity in irrigated agriculture in an arid climate the effects of an irrigation scheduling method on cotton gossypium hirsutum l yield and water productivity were investigated in qira oasis china from 2016 2018 the decision support system for irrigation scheduling dssis was based on forecasted rainfall and water stress index simulated by the root zone water quality model rzwqm2 a field experiment was conducted to test the viability of the dssis in 2016 the design of the experiment was a randomized complete that included two factors and two levels for each factor i irrigation scheduling method dssis based dss and soil moisture sensor based sms and ii irrigation level full irrigation fi and deficit irrigation di 75 of fi implementation of the dss led to significant increases in seed cotton yield 1 05 mg ha 1 32 and water productivity 1 64 kg ha 1 mm 1 20 compared to the sms compared to di fi significantly increased cotton yield 0 69 mg ha 1 20 but had no significant effect on water productivity in general the higher water productivity under dss vs sms was attributed to the reduced water stress and increased seed cotton yield while the dss fi treatment provided the greatest seed cotton yield 4 55 mg ha 1 and net income us 3427 ha 1 the highest water productivity 10 09 kg ha 1 mm 1 was achieved under the dss di treatment water use under dss di treatment significantly decreased by 51 mm 10 and 23 mm 5 respectively compared to dss fi and sms fi treatments therefore our results demonstrated that the dss with deficit irrigation could maintain cotton yield and improve water productivity under an arid desert climate keywords dssis

limited surface water and overexploitation of groundwater have proven to pose significant challenges for the agricultural sector in semi arid and arid regions improving water use efficiency wue is an effective way to alleviate water scarcity restricting agricultural crop production in china agricultural production accounts for roughly 70 of water consumption of which 90 is used in farmland

and production are 2 49 106 ha and 5 11 tg y 1 respectively representing 75 and 83 of the nation s acreage and production however higher demands by industrial and urban water consumption have reduced irrigation water availability and water has become an expensive commodity rao et al 2016 increased water demands for ecosystem maintenance have further exacerbated the shortage of agricultural water use in recent years large tracts of sandy soil have been reclaimed into cultivated land in southern xinjiang local farmers have continued to exploit groundwater to meet growing irrigation water needs resulting in a significant and accelerating decline in groundwater table currently planting cotton is an important source of economic income for local farmers in xinjiang half of the province s

volumetric soil water content θ monitored by time domain reflectometry tdr time domain transmissometry tdt or frequency domain reflectometry fdr has also been used as the upper and lower thresholds

2008 kang et al 2012 and gabriel et al 2017 in greenhouse grown vegetable crops ψ m s o i l based irrigation scheduling method proved to be much more reliable than that based on θ thresholds because θ thresholds were affected by soil depth thompson et al 2007a both ψ m s o i l based and θ based irrigation scheduling methods can be automated and decrease irrigation water use as compared to conventional experience based irrigation scheduling methods however the installation of sensors in the field may affect field operations and their positioning and contact with soil are critical in addition excessive or too little irrigation amount may occur during crop growth season owing to a fixed irrigation threshold for sensor based irrigation method many features of the plant s physiology respond directly to changes in water status in the roots or in other tissues rather than to changes in θ jones 2004 greater precision in the application of irrigation under crop water deficit can potentially be improved by monitoring crop physiological indicators through its relation to transpiration and stomatal conductance canopy temperature is an indirect indicator of the plant s water status jones 1999 irrigation scheduling method based on monitoring crop canopy temperature to assess the crop water stress index cwsi has served in agricultural irrigation management in recent years using canopy temperature to determine signals for irrigation control and investigating the relationship between crop water stress and cotton lint yield wanjura et al 2006 showed the mean seed cotton yield decreased by 0 34 mg ha 1 for each additional hour of stress time on days with water stress during the irrigation period others mahan et al 2005 o shaughnessy and evett 2010 conaty et al 2012 shao et al 2019 have reported the use of continuous canopy temperature measurement for irrigation scheduling since the closure of stomata increases canopy temperature a cwsi based irrigation scheduling method can precisely determine the time and amount of irrigation water however a reference value of crop canopy temperature under full irrigation is required for these irrigation control methods qi et al 2016 overall a common problem with sensor based irrigation scheduling methods is that the instrument installed in the field is not conducive to field operations requires maintenance and provides no forecast of upcoming weather conditions compared to instrumental monitoring approaches the application of models to provide information on irrigation scheduling has the advantage of being low cost not interfering with field operations and considering upcoming weather conditions recently there has been wide implementation of optimization models to address irrigation scheduling problems wen et al 2017 developed a daily scale yield maximizing simulation based optimization model for optimal irrigation scheduling of mulched crops similarly numerical and process based hydrologic models were applied in the decision support systems dsss dang et al 2018 abd el baki et al 2018 lima et al 2018 for instance wei et al 2018 and zhang et al 2018 used the soil and water assessment tool swat model to optimize the irrigation schedule at the watershed scale however these studies did not consider differences in crop water requirements at different growth stages on the other hand an agricultural system model capable of continuously simulating crop growth θ and evapotranspiration et has the potential to aid in optimizing irrigation scheduling for example li et al 2018a b optimized irrigation strategies based on aquacrop model for cotton and spring wheat the agricultural production systems simulator apsim decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat and cropwat model have also proven to be useful aids to irrigation decision making tools sun et al 2018 li et al 2018c tan 2018 moreover cropping system model csm cropgro cotton model and fao 56 methods have been used to schedule irrigation management in cotton suleiman et al 2007 thorp et al 2017 likewise the rzwqm has been used to optimize irrigation strategies for a wheat maize double cropping system fang et al 2011 and has been proven an effective agro hydrological model for predicting the response of crop yield to the magnitude and timing of water stress ma et al 2012 qi et al 2016 gu et al 2017 developed an irrigation scheduling software based on the water stress simulated by rzwqm2 studies have increasingly focused on using agricultural system models to simulate water availability parameters employed in optimal irrigation scheduling however studies on the efficacy of an irrigation scheduling method based on an agricultural system model in terms of crop yield water productivity and economic profitability are rare using data collected at an irrigated cotton site liu et al 2017 calibrated and validated rzwqm2 a hybrid model between rzwqm and dssat 4 0 which provided readily available soil and crop parameters for the site cotton was simulated in rzwqm2 using the cropgro cotton module from dssat 4 0 in addition an automated dssis based irrigation control system based on a rzwqm2 model predicted water stress index was developed and tested in this region chen et al 2019 the specific objectives of the present study were to i evaluate cotton yield and water productivity response to dss vs sms ii analyze the fiber quality and economic profitability of the cotton produced under the dss vs sms and iii assess the effect of full and deficit irrigation on cotton yield and water productivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 decision support system for irrigation scheduling dssis the newly developed dssis includes the irrigation pipeline system irrigation control software

based on zotarelli et al 2013 who reported that the total amount of water available for plant uptake ranged from 0 14 to 0 03 cm3 cm 3 plant available water paw in sandy soils haley and dukes 2012 also set the irrigation threshold of sms based method at 0 07 cm3 cm 3 in a find sand in southwest florida similar irrigation threshold 0 07 cm3 cm 3 for sms based method was also reported by cardenas lailhacar et al 2010 and mccready et al 2009 for both irrigation scheduling methods dss and sms the time of irrigation for di was the same as that for fi in 2016 owing to a broken sensor for sms fi treatment plot after june no water was applied where the sensors had been installed consequently the plants were irrigated every two weeks to maintain crop growth under the sms based irrigation scheduling method such that the irrigation amount concurred with that in a neighbouring cotton field managed by field technicians the planting and harvesting dates and irrigation events over the three

difference between the soil water storage in soil layers of 0 1 00 m before planting and after harvest y is the seed cotton yield kg ha 1 2 4 2 cotton height aboveground biomass and yield plant height was measured one week prior to harvest using a steel tape measure 3 m from nine representative cotton plants in each experimental plot the aboveground biomass was determined by weighing three representative cotton plants collected in each experimental plot heated at 105 c for 30 min then cut into pieces and dried to constant weight in a 75 c oven seed cotton yield was determined by manually picking and weighing the bolls for each experimental plot from late september to early november 2 4 3 fiber quality at harvest cotton fiber samples picked by famers from four plants were taken from the middle row of each plot for the determining fiber quality manually separating fibers from seeds the cotton fiber quality index was determined using a cotton fiber quality detector hvi

analysis was conducted based on the assumption that the infrastructure for each irrigation scheduling method was applied to a 10 ha cotton field an average size of a drip irrigation farm in this area

simultaneously software and computer cost for dssis based and soil moisture sensor cost for sms based irrigation scheduling method labor cost includes irrigation event seeding and picking cotton labor cost was set at 50 per person for operating each irrigation event the number irrigation events in each year were 7 and 5 for the dssis and sensor based methods respectively owing to the fact that farm activities were hourly paid in this region picking cotton cost was variable which were associated with seed cotton yield basic cost were estimated to be 1500 ha 1 y 1 for each treatment including fertilizers seeds and others in addition no additional pest management cost was calculated because no significant pest infestation was found in this region water and seed cotton prices used for calculation were 0 04 m 3 and 1 30 kg 1 shareef et al 2018 respectively the average of local government pricing and local market pricing in 2016 2018 2 6 data analysis the proc analysis of variance anova procedure in statistical analysis system sas 9 2 software was used to determine the effects of different treatments irrigation scheduling and level on soil water content water use yield wp plant height aboveground biomass and fiber quality of cotton residuals were tested for normality shapiro wilk test and in all cases their distribution did not differ significantly p 0 05 from normality differences amongst means were considered significant at p 0 05 level using duncan test for all parameters the year effect was not significant p 0 05 so parameter values were averaged across years before being subjected to 2 factor anova irrigation scheduling level the irrigation scheduling level interaction was not significant p 0 05 for any measured parameter except for quantity of irrigation water applied which was marginally significant p 0 030 notwithstanding the lack of interaction to distinguish treatment combination differences another anova was run to separate between the four treatment combinations 3 results for all measured parameters the effect of year on cotton production was found to be non significant p 0 05 accordingly the anova was applied to data averaged across the three years unless otherwise stated significant differences reflect p 0 05 3 1 seed cotton yield and water productivity seed cotton yield was significantly 32 greater under the dss 4 29 mg ha 1 than under the sms 3 24 mg ha 1 and significantly 20 greater under fi 4 11 mg ha 1 than under di 3 42 mg ha 1 a significant increase in seed cotton yield was obtained in dss fi treatment compared to other treatments over the three years except for dss di treatment dss fi treatment increased seed cotton yield by 13 2 24 3 and 61 9 compared to dss di sms fi and sms di respectively water productivity wp was significantly 20 greater under the dss 9 77 kg ha 1 mm 1 than under the sms 8 13 kg ha 1 mm 1 but irrigation level had no significant effect on wp table 3 only the dss di 10 09 kg ha 1 mm 1 and sms di 7 68 kg ha 1 mm 1 treatments showed significant differences dss di treatment increased wp by 6 8 17 6 and 31 4 compared to dss fi sms fi and sms di respectively 3 2 soil water content and water use table 4 shows average soil water content variation in the soil profile under different treatments over the whole growth period from planting to harvest during 2016 2018 in all layers above 0 65 m the dssis based irrigation scheduling provided a significantly wetter root zone for crop growth over the growing season than the sms based irrigation scheduling but no difference was observed for the 0 65 1 00 m soil layer table 4 full irrigation provided a wetter soil environment compared to deficit irrigation for the 0 25 0 40 m and 0 40 0 65 m soil layers but no difference was found in other soil depths table 4 the dss fi treatment provided greater moisture at the 0 25 0 40 m 0 40 0 65 m and 0 65 1 00 m soil depths than any other irrigation regime the amount of irrigation applied and water use were affected by irrigation scheduling method table 5 and more irrigation water 25 was applied under fi 355 mm than under di 268 mm and water use was 15 greater under fi 468 mm than under di 400 mm sms significantly decreased irrigation amount and water use by 18 and 11 respectively compared to dss the lowest irrigation amount and water use were found in sms di treatment overall the amount of irrigation water applied and the water use declined in the order of sms di dss di sms fi dss fi 3 3 crop height and aboveground biomass plant was significantly taller 13 under the dss 0 79 m than under the sms 0 70 m and significantly taller 8 under fi 0 77 m than under deficit irrigation 0 71 m table 6 similarly aboveground biomass was significantly higher 33 under the dss 11 28 mg ha 1 than under the sms 8 45 mg ha 1 and significantly higher 21 under full irrigation 10 81 mg ha 1 than under deficit irrigation 8 92 mg ha 1 the maximum values for both plant height and aboveground biomass were obtained under dss fi while the lowest were obtained under sms di table 6 overall both plant height and biomass increased in the order of dss fi dss di sms fi sms di 3 4 cotton fiber quality and economic profitability fiber quality was not affected by either irrigation method or level although some measurements were slightly lower under the sms di than under other treatments table 7 the profitability of cotton production under different irrigation methods and levels particularly the total cost of production and net income achieved over the three years are summarized in table 8 the results illustrated that the dss fi treatment generated the greatest net income due to higher seed cotton yield water cost under dss fi treatment was us 153 ha 1 which was 36 ha 1 31 22 ha 1 17 and 55 ha 1 56 greater than under the dss di sms fi and sms di treatments respectively the dss fi treatment provided a maximum net income of 3427 ha 1 which was 643 ha 1 18 1063 ha 1 31 and 2109 ha 1 62 higher than under the dss di sms fi and sms di treatments respectively compared to the sms di treatment 0 54 m 3 the nwp values under the dss fi 0 9 m 3 dss di 0 96 m 3 and sms fi 0 72 m 3 were 67 78 and 33 higher respectively 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of dss on seed cotton yield and water productivity real time and precise irrigation scheduling could improve or maintain crop yield with less water irrigated the seed cotton yield obtained in the present study under the dss was similar to those obtained in the same region by shareef et al 2018 and kuang et al 2018 the average seed cotton yield under the sms fi treatment in the current study was 3 66 mg ha 1 similar to that reported by wang et al 2015 2018 under soil matric potential smp thresholds of 5 kpa 3 23 3 65 mg ha 1 in general a significant advantage in seed cotton yield was found in dss than sms reflecting the benefit of lesser water stress due to real time irrigation and greater moisture in the soil bearing the cotton root profile table 4 in the present study water productivity for the dss and sms were 9 45 10 09 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 7 68 8 58 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively water productivity under the dss concurred with those reported by tan et al 2018 who showed that wue for cotton ranging from 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 to 12 kg ha 1 mm 1 with drip irrigation controlled by an aquacrop model based irrigation scheduling method wang et al 2014 reported a wue for cotton ranging from 4 05 kg ha 1 mm 1 to 12 67 kg ha 1 mm 1 under an smp based irrigation scheduling however water productivity values in the present study were higher than the 2 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 reported by o shaughnessy and evett 2010 for cotton grown under an irrigation system based on canopy temperature in addition the 4 6 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 increase in water productivity for cotton under dss vs sms in this study compared well with that of the conventional drip irrigation control method employed in this region 4 1 4 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 shareef et al 2018 there was a significant difference in water productivity between dss and sms for the fact that dss increased crop yield with lower water use in addition the dss was more conducive to field management operations compared to the sms 4 2 the effect of dss on soil water content and water use frequent irrigations at higher rates could optimize the root zone for crop growth rawlin and raats 1975 especially for shallow root crops in sandy textured soils compared to sms a greater frequency of irrigation occurred under the dss table 1 the frequency and amount of irrigation under the dss were affected not only by weather conditions but also by the simulated crop growth conditions however only considering current weather conditions may lead to delay the triggering time for the next irrigation event in sms which may fail to irrigate the crop when needed local farmers were accustomed to irrigation intervals of around 20 d whereas in the present study the intervals did not exceed 15 d even under the dss tan et al 2018 reported that cotton growth required more irrigation water or high irrigation frequency in sandy loam due to its lower water holding capacity dss saved irrigation water use and improved wp under a relatively low soil water content without water stress by making full use of soil water and rainfall in contrast sms used a fixed upper and lower threshold to maintain the soil water content in the root zone in fact water stress may occur at different soil water content during crop growth season therefore a longer irrigation interval for sms might be caused by the fixed upper and lower irrigation threshold a dynamic or more precise irrigation threshold needs to be investigated for sms in the future in addition thompson et al 2007a reported that the depth of soil selected for soil moisture calculation might affect irrigation thresholds for sms the seasonal average amount of irrigation applied to cotton with drip irrigation was approximately 500 mm for cotton in southern xinjiang feng et al 2017 dss under fi average decreased water use by 506 mm and 155 mm respectively when compared to the results of shareef et al 2018 and kuang et al 2018 who used conventional et based irrigation scheduling method with drip irrigation in the same region such lower water use values under a dssis based irrigation scheduling method were also noted by tan et al 2018 using the aquacrop model to determine the appropriate irrigation depths for cotton in southern xinjiang 406 462 mm water use under the sms was lower than the irrigation applied 643 mm under smp thresholds of 5 kpa space at 20 cm depth treatment in an arid region of northwest china wang et al 2015 the differences were likely because of different climate cotton cultivars and irrigation trigger thresholds 4 3 cotton fiber quality and economic profitability under different irrigation treatments in general the fiber quality was not affected by either the irrigation scheduling method or level under the sms di treatment cotton fiber length uniformity and spinning consistency index decreased slightly but the percentage of short fiber increased possibly owing to water deficit longer fiber and higher uniformity have been noted under full than under deficit irrigation levels similar to previous studies dagdelen et al 2009 basal et al 2009 attia et al 2015 our observation of no significant differences in fiber strength elongation percentage of lint harvested before frost over total and micronaire parameters concurred with the results of papastylianou and argyrokastritis 2014 who reported that there was no significant difference in fiber strength and micronaire values between irrigation levels a few major genes rather than the growth environment may determine fiber quality parameters in the present study the dss fi treatment produced the maximum net income of 3427 ha 1 this was higher than the 2689 5 ha 1 reported by wang et al 2014 for a method based on an smp threshold of 20 kpa for double centrally located laterals applied in xinjiang province s jungger basin with irrigation amount of 6313 m3 ha 1 dagdelen et al 2009 and shareef et al 2018 also reported that higher irrigation amount led to higher cotton net income in the present paper the net income under dss fi treatment was higher than other treatments due to the fact that higher seed cotton yield resulted from more irrigation water supply and real time irrigation from the point of view of net income alone an increase in irrigation amount to improve cotton yield may be a better choice for local farmers in the present paper the low net income for sms was caused by the lower seed cotton yield although net income was relatively low a lower irrigation water use was occurred in dss di treatment with a relatively high net water productivity compared to dss fi treatment therefore a dss with deficit irrigation may be the best choice for sustainable irrigation management in the region as it conserves more water 4 4 optimization for sms and dss the reason that dssis and sms results in different irrigation schedules was that the cotton under sms treatment was more water stressed due to the low irrigation threshold of 0 06 cm3 cm 3 comparing to the crop under the dssis treatment sms reached the lower irrigation threshold very slowly owing to the fact that there was not much change in swc from 0 07 cm3 cm 3 to 0 06 cm3 cm 3 this might be caused by sensor inaccuracy or weather condition therefore sms triggered an irrigation event with an average of 18 days while dssis triggered an irrigation event with an average of 13 days fig 3 in sms the lower economic benefits might be mainly affected by the irrigation threshold the sensor position and accuracy the irrigation threshold directly determined the irrigation amount in sms the irrigation threshold may be the main factor which led to a low irrigation amount in sms the precise irrigation threshold in sms will be optimized in the future study in addition sensor position and accuracy may also affect the irrigation amount and timing soulis et al 2015 considering the experimental plot size 6 m 10 m and field operations one sensor in each of the 0 1 m and 0 2 m deep soil profile was installed in the sms plot the monitored soil moisture content may be affected by the sensor installation location in the future more sensors will be installed across the diagonal line of each plot with varying distance from the drip irrigation pipe this also indicated that the cost of the sms will increase and more sensors will cause more inconvenience for field operations on the other hand the precision of the model itself and the quality of calibration determine the effectiveness of the irrigation system based on the process based models gu et al 2020 the validation and parameter optimization of rzwqm2 are the critical step in application of the dss initial data soil and crop parameters field management etc needs to be optimized in dss in addition some fixed irrigation thresholds for the swfac parameter need to be used for the dss in the future study 5 conclusions the present study evaluated over a three year period the effect of a new irrigation scheduling method on seed cotton yield water productivity and economic profitability under an arid desert climate the benefit of the dss was that compared to sms seed cotton yield water productivity and economic profitability were simultaneously enhanced in addition the dss showed higher net water productivity compared to the sms maximum crop yield plant height and aboveground biomass of cotton were obtained for the dss fi treatment which may be attributable to better soil water status under the timely and more frequent irrigation events as the dss di treatment can maintain crop yield with low irrigation level for sustainable development in an irrigated agricultural region it may be the best choice for local development owing to its greater water productivity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

revolution starting in 1930 s gardner 2009 potential factors have caused this sharp productivity rise including farm mechanization advances in plant breeding and efficacy of chemical inputs regulatory policy including research support price and farm credit programs advanced agronomic management farm electrification etc rasmussen 1962 clarke 2002 kitchens and fishback 2015 mann 1999 tester and langridge 2010 in addition the advent and adoption of irrigation has had a significant role in contributing towards higher agricultural yields irrigation allows for crop production in arid semi arid regions that do not receive sufficient precipitation to meet crop water demand an ideal example of this is the farmland to the west of the 98th meridian where the annual precipitation received is less than 500 mm prism climate group 2018 and significant portion is not received during the crop growing season nevertheless the western and midwestern states account for more than 80 of the total u s farmland and two thirds of the nation s irrigated land usda 2013 producing substantial proportions of nation s wheat 70 horticultural crops 33 vegetables 50 cotton 40 fruits tree nuts and berries 80 if deprived of irrigation millions of hectares in the western u s would be rendered barren or low value grazing lands with considerably small economic value selby 1949 stubbs 2016 the economic benefits of irrigation also extend to humid and sub humid regions with sufficient precipitation as it acts as a buffer against within season precipitation variability and extremes with increasing precipitation variability svoma and balling 2010 pendergrass et al 2017 drought conditions increased commodity prices in certain periods low cost and relatively easy access to groundwater resources for irrigation vories and evett 2010 schaible and aillery 2012 as well as irrigation s substantial impact on increasing grain yields the irrigated land area in the humid eastern states in the united states has increased by over 3 5 million hectares since 1984 usda 2013 1984 in fact the u s eastern states have increased their irrigated area by 50 since 2003 as opposed to reduction in irrigated area in majority of western states usda 2013 thus irrigation has immense significance for croplands irrespective of aridity regimes at any given location due to increasing trend in water availability as well as challenges in water quality degradation for freshwater resources used for irrigation and uncertainties in terms of impact s of change in climate variables and their variability on agricultural operations and productions and water resources irrigation s role in reducing the inter annual variability in grain yield production may become more important in the future given the fact that irrigated yields on average are 2 7 times greater than rainfed yields rosenzweig and parry 1994 and this advantage of irrigated yields over the rainfed yields irrigation limited yield gap varies across crops space and time kukal and irmak 2019a we anticipate and hypothesize that a similar behavior should be revealed by comparing interannual variability among irrigated and rainfed yields interannual variability in agricultural yields for various crops locations and time periods have been discussed by some studies kucharik and ramankutty 2005 ray et al 2015 ben ari and makowski 2014 iizumi and ramankutty 2016 kukal and irmak 2018a however very limited research has been conducted on quantifying and studying the interannual variability among irrigated and rainfed crop yields distinctly especially at finer scales irrigated and rainfed yield variability for maize soybean and sorghum in the u s great plains were compared and it was found that the interannual variability defined by coefficient of variability in rainfed yields was 77 maize 69 sorghum and 63 soybean greater than that in irrigated yields kukal and irmak 2018a in another study irrigated and rainfed yield residuals for maize in nebraska were compared and found that irrigation reduced maize yield variability by a factor of three i e positive and negative deviations in irrigated yields were 5 6 and 7 4 whereas they were 18 5 and 19 7 in rainfed yields respectively kucharik and ramankutty 2005 while it is a well accepted notion that irrigated crop yields should and do present lower interannual variability than their rainfed counterparts quantitative estimates of this reduction in variability are currently unknown or insufficient for all major u s crops and the regions moreover the spatial and temporal patterns associated with the reduction in variability under irrigated conditions if any are unexplored since irrigation technology and efficiency have evolved and improved over time and has regional differences caswell 1991 green et al 1996 there is a strong likelihood that it could result in spatial and temporal variations in the reduction in variability post irrigation adoption moreover almost all of the studies are limited to addressing the issue of yield variability only for major crops that have significance for national and global agricultural production i e maize soybean wheat and rice in global studies however other crops that although account for relatively lower production nationally globally are of considerable economic significance for specific regions where they are grown furthermore these secondary crops account for a considerable portion of the total national irrigated land area alfalfa cotton sorghum barley and oats production contribute to 12 of the total 2017 production usda 2018 thus a gap exists in our assessments and knowledge on comparative interannual variability among irrigated and rainfed crop yields at finer sub state or county scales especially for crops that are integral part of u s agriculture but have not been discussed sufficiently here we address these issues by quantifying and comparing interannual variability among irrigated and rainfed yields for nine major crops to select these major crops we ranked the crops on the basis of their national production in 2018 which is mostly consistent with the long term mean production as well these crops include maize zea mays l soybean glycine max l merr spring wheat triticum aestivum l winter wheat triticum aestivum l alfalfa medicago sativa l sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench cotton gossypium hirsutum barley hordeum vulgare l and oats avena sativa we aim to quantify comparative differences in interannual variability among irrigated and rainfed yields at county level during the complete usda survey records available moreover we decipher and report spatial and temporal patterns trends in the irrigated vs rainfed yield variability our overall goal in regards to these objectives is to characterize the benefits of irrigation i e stabilization of agricultural crop yields against interannual variability caused by all the external influences such as weather variability extreme weather water availability pests weeds and soil and crop management practices 2 methods and data 2 1 data source and pre processing data for irrigated and non irrigated yields and harvested area for maize soybean spring wheat winter wheat alfalfa sorghum cotton barley and oats were obtained from the national agricultural statistics service united states department of agriculture usda 2018 using the quickstats online tool these crops were selected to include major u s agricultural commodities based on current production statistics account for 80 of the 2017 u s harvested area all the county level yield records for each crop were retrieved from around the year 1950 until the end of records around 2015 when available from the nass records the data were subjected to certain processing steps prior to use firstly raw nass data were assessed for missing records and temporal extents were decided for each crop it has to be noted that nass publishes irrigated and rainfed yield data separately only for states or counties that have substantial cropland under both irrigated and rainfed cultivation only those counties that reported a minimum of 15 data records for both irrigated and non irrigated yields were selected for analyses supplementary table s1 lists the start end and period of analysis as well as the number of counties that met the pre processing criteria and hence qualified for analyses additionally yield data were converted to metric units kg ha 1 from commercial units for each crop to maintain consistency the conversion factors were 1 kg ha 1 0 0159 bu ac 1 for maize sorghum 1 kg ha 1 0 0149 bu ac 1 for wheat soybean 1 kg ha 1 0 0185 bu ac 1 for barley 1 kg ha 1 0 0279 bu ac 1 for oats 1 kg ha 1 0 8922 lb ac 1 for cotton and 1 kg ha 1 0 0004047 t ac 1 for alfalfa 2 2 quantifying irrigated and rainfed crop yield variability the crop yield variability cyv metric represents the magnitude of interannual deviations from the long term linear trajectory of yield growth crop yields are controlled by a variety of factors among which the overall long term increasing trend is caused due to agronomic and technological advances such as improvements in plant breeding and genetics eg development of high yielding herbicide resistant or drought tolerant hybrids fertilizer pesticides farm mechanization as well as weather and climate factors on the other hand the high frequency fluctuations are mainly caused by weather and climate factors in this research we are particularly high frequency year to year variability and thus detrending the crop yield data to remove the trends in non weather factors genetics and technology is critical this technique has been extensively applied in empirical modeling of agricultural systems maltais landry and lobell 2012 lobell and field 2007 kukal and irmak 2018a b the interannual deviations contain signatures for environment induced crop performance fluctuations abiotic stresses and hence should be different under irrigated and non irrigated crop production systems to quantify interannual crop yield variability cyv for a given county a linear function was fit to crop yield individually for irrigated and non irrigated vs time years pairs of observed data residuals from the fitted linear function were calculated a modulus function was applied to the residual and a ratio was computed by dividing it by the predicted value derived from the linear fit this quantity is what we interpret as crop yield variability for a specific county and year supplementary fig s1 graphically represents the computation of cyv for chase county nebraska as an example we conducted the abovementioned series of steps individually for irrigated and non irrigated crop yields in a given county for the purpose of analyzing long term spatial patterns and inter crop differences we averaged the cyv magnitudes for each county over the total number of annual records available 2 3 quantifying overall weighted crop yield variability to estimate a representative value of overall crop yield variability for a county we first calculated long term mean irrigated and rainfed area fractions firr and frf respectively for each county which are dimensionless eqs 1 and 2 these were calculated by dividing the crop harvested area ha under irrigated rainfed production by total harvested land area ha and averaging over the annual records available for each county then firr and frf were used as a weighting factor to compute a weighted mean of irrigated and rainfed yield variability cyvoverall based on the relative prevalence of irrigated rainfed production in each county eq 3 1 f i r r h a r v e s t e d a r e a u n d e r i r r i g a t e d p r o d u c t i o n t o t a l h a r v e s t e d a r e a 2 f r f 1 f i r r 3 c y v o v e r a l l c y v i r r f i r r c y v r f f r f where cyvoverall is the overall crop yield variability for a given county and year in percent cyvirr is the irrigated crop yield variability in percent cyvrf is the rainfed crop yield variability in percent firr is the irrigated area fraction ranged from 0 to 1 and frf is the rainfed area fraction ranged from 0 to 1 2 4 quantifying irrigation induced reduction in crop yield variability iiryv following the computation of irrigated and rainfed crop yield variability individually for each county the difference among cyvrf and cyvirr relative to cyvrf was computed and a modulus function was applied to the term for cases where cyvirr and cyvrf are comparable or the difference is slightly negative if any the denominator of the metric was cyvrf to aid in comparison of iiryv across geographic scales as rainfed yields will be free from influence of irrigation this resulting quantity was termed as irrigation induced reduction in crop yield variability or iiryv as presented in equation 4 since iiryv was calculated as a difference of cyvirr from cyvrf and ratioed with cyvrf the range for iiryv will be 0 1 the methodology used here is partially similar to that adopted by kucharik and ramankutty 2005 4 i i r y v c y v r f c y v i r r c y v r f 2 5 mapping all the spatial data were mapped at county level using arcmap 10 4 1 esri 2017 3 results 3 1 interannual crop yield variability in the u s we start by answering our most fundamental question i e what has been the historical interannual variability in the u s agricultural yields to the best of our knowledge there is no previous knowledge on comparative crop yield variability cyv for the major national and regional crops in the u s in fact not much is known about the cyv of crops such as alfalfa cotton sorghum barley and oats at the regional or even national scale moreover for all of the crop panel distinct estimates of irrigated and rainfed cyv cyvirr and cyvrf respectively are unknown we find that for irrigated crops on a national basis cotton showed the highest interannual variability followed by winter and spring wheat oats barley sorghum alfalfa maize and soybean supplementary fig s2 however rainfed crops compared in a different fashion on the national basis with cotton showing the highest interannual variability due to its momentous sensitivity to both magnitude and timing of water stress smith and cothren 1999 followed by maize oats spring wheat sorghum barley winter wheat soybean and alfalfa supplementary fig s2 each county has a distinct partitioning of irrigated and rainfed crop harvested area where the fraction of irrigated area to total cultivated area follows an increasing pattern similar to the spatial precipitation gradient irrigated fraction is lower in regions with higher precipitation and vice versa although this partitioning of total harvested area into irrigated and rainfed land area can change temporally we can rely on long term mean magnitudes to represent irrigated fraction of total area or firr supplementary figs s3 and s4 we found that on a long term mean basis firr ranged from 0 51 to 0 21 and was highest in alfalfa followed by oats corn soybean barley cotton spring wheat winter wheat and sorghum supplementary fig s3 to quantify county specific overall crop yield variability cyvoverall which is representative of actual proportions of both irrigated and rainfed area in a given county we compute a weighted average of cyvirr and cyvrf by using firr as a weighing factor we found that on a national basis maximum cyvoverall was still observed in cotton followed by sorghum spring and winter wheat oats corn barley soybean and alfalfa supplementary fig s2 the high standard deviation observed in mean national cyv supplementary fig s2 insinuates high variability found in cyv across geographical domains for each crop the degree of spatial variability in cyvirr was 19 greater than that in cyvrf across all the crops and equal to that in cyvoverall supplementary fig s5 both irrigated and rainfed alfalfa demonstrated the highest degree of spatial variation in cyv as compared with the rest of the crops however maize exhibited the highest degree of spatial variability in cyvoverall we find that there are distinct regions of low moderate and high magnitudes of both irrigated and rainfed cyv supplementary figs s6 and s7 respectively cyvrf demonstrates a longitudinal pattern of decreasing cyv from west to east especially discernible in the great plains region because of relatively smoother gradient of increasing precipitation form west to east which is non existent in cyvirr this absence of a geographical pattern in cyvirr is likely due to the varying effectiveness of irrigation practices at different regions which is challenging to address while rainfed yields are a direct consequence of growing season precipitation that follows a geographical pattern in turn translating into geographical patterns in cyvrf on the other hand the application of irrigation water distorts these natural precipitation induced patterns and convey a management induced signal since farm level management and decision making is highly variable even across farms in the same region and on broader scales recognizing these management induced signals is a challenge development of datasets that record spatial and temporal variation in farm level management at reasonable resolutions is a momentous task although continuous high resolution satellite data hold significant promise deines et al 2019 for a given county cyvoverall ranges between cyvirr and cyvrf depending on the firr supplementary fig s4 for instance regions such as central nebraska where maize production is almost entirely irrigated i e firr 1 show overall maize yield variability magnitudes that are equal to that of irrigated maize yield variability and vice versa fig 1 it is evident that among all the crops at all the constituent locations cotton in texas was the most variability prone crop region combination fig 1 f followed by others such as maize in eastern kansas winter wheat in texas panhandle and barley in southern california top performing crop regions in terms of yield stability low cyvoverall were maize in nebraska and southwest kansas soybean in nebraska and alfalfa in nebraska and idaho the underlying reasoning for this behavior is moderately high to high firr in these regions an ideal example being nebraska with the highest irrigated land area in the nation 3 2 national level irrigation induced reduction in crop yield variability iiryv until now we have recognized and established that cyvirr and cyvrf for a given crop are different and when averaged nationally cyvirr is lower than cyvrf this section quantifies and compares as to how does the yield stabilization effect seen in irrigated crops evidenced by lower magnitudes of cyvirr than cyvrf varies across different crops studied overall the u s rainfed crop yields historically showed two fold 1 96 interannual variability than the u s irrigated crop yields when averaged across all crops this long term mean fraction of rainfed to irrigated long term crop yield variability ranged from 2 71 to 1 94 and was the highest in maize 2 71 followed by soybean 2 43 alfalfa 2 13 oats 1 94 sorghum 1 85 barley 1 84 spring wheat 1 78 winter wheat 1 52 and lastly cotton 1 44 the extremes of the standard deviation associated with the mean ratio of rainfed to irrigated variability show that at a minimum the irrigated crop yield variability was equal to rainfed crop yield variability however at a maximum rainfed crop yield variability was as high as 3 6 times the irrigated crop yield variability fig 2 a for all the crops averaged nationally the ratio of cyvrf to cyvirr was greater than 1 which implies that irrigation mitigates interannual crop yield variability stabilizes yields when compared to rainfed production we refer to this stabilization benefit that occurs under irrigated production as irrigation induced reduction in yield variability iiryv simply iiryv can be considered as the reduction in cyv achieved if a producer in a particular county converts from rainfed production to irrigated production we justifiably presume that the reported irrigated and rainfed yields representing a particular county to be comparable because of similarity of growing conditions such as weather soils management practices etc within a county on a national scale we found that irrigation has led to lowering of crop yield variability historically by 41 iiryv 41 than what was shown by rainfed yields averaged across all nine crops studied fig 2 b long term mean iiryv ranged from 57 to 28 and was highest for maize 57 soybean 55 oats 45 alfalfa 43 sorghum 42 barley 39 spring wheat 36 cotton 28 and winter wheat 28 which is slightly different from the magnitudes demonstrated by the ratio of rainfed and irrigated yield variability the extremes of the standard deviation associated with the mean crop specific iiryv imply that we encountered iiryv of as high as 79 and as low as 7 this wide range of iiryv stems from significant spatial variation which was even greater than found in cyvirr and cyvrf we find that the highest spatial variability in iiryv was demonstrated by winter and spring wheat cv 0 65 followed by alfalfa barley cotton maize sorghum oats and soybean supplementary fig s8 the higher spatial variability in wheat is likely due to larger and relatively more geographically distributed growing regions which encompasses greater environmental variability relative to other crops most likely due to its growing season period being different than other crops especially in contrast to soybean which shows least spatial variation due to its smaller growing region 3 3 spatial heterogeneity in irrigation induced reduction in crop yield variability iiryv the national scale assessment of iiryv informed us not only about the national mean magnitudes of iiryv but also the variation associated with the mean iiryv see standard deviation bars in fig 1 b this variation stems from the spatial heterogeneity in iiryv when individual counties are considered rather than averaging them nationally in this section we discuss the patterns of this spatial heterogeneity in iiryv for each crop within their growing regions we find that while national assessments are useful they mask spatial inter county differences in the iiryv pooling all the crops and regions rainfed yield variability varied from being 0 5 5 times the irrigated yield variability supplementary fig s9 and iiryv varied from 0 no reduction in variability to up to 90 fig 3 here we list some insights into the features of spatial heterogeneity of iiryv in various crops maize iiryv ranged from none to 80 and the spatial distribution of iiryv fig 3 shows that the highest magnitudes existed in central nebraska and was generally higher than 50 in nebraska and kansas however it was relatively lower in the dakotas 40 and the easternmost counties in the dakotas demonstrated no reduction in maize yield variability which could be due to limited adoption of irrigation and also due to relatively higher humidity and precipitation and hence lack of water stress soybean iiryv ranged from 4 to 78 and was the highest in central kansas with most of the soybean growing regions showing iiryv 50 with the exception of eastern nebraska and some parts of arkansas again this low iiryv could be due to lack of water stress in these regions spring wheat iiryv ranging from 0 to 81 demonstrated lesser regional coherence as compared with maize and soybean with greater variability even at smaller scales overall eastern wyoming and colorado show reasonably high spring wheat iiryv while the northwestern region of the nation showed lower and inconsistent iiryv magnitudes overall due to higher precipitation and low irrigation adoption in northwestern u s winter wheat being grown on greater land area than spring wheat irrigated classes shows more spatial coherence than that observed in spring wheat the iiryv in winter wheat ranged from 0 to 75 and was generally higher 60 in california utah and idaho while also demonstrating a greater proportion of counties with no reduction in variability in montana and oregon iiryv 0 another interesting feature of the winter wheat iiryv was the west east decreasing gradient found in the great plains with the counties adjoining the eastern boundary of winter wheat growing regions showing very low to no reduction in variability alfalfa showed generally high iiryv values 50 similar to maize and soybean while also showing the maximum iiryv in a county among all crops at 90 similar to winter wheat a west east decreasing gradient was found in nebraska with counties showing very smooth transition from high iiryv in the west to low or no iiryv in the east in addition to eastern nebraska some parts in colorado and idaho showed lower or zero iiryv cotton iiryv ranged from none to 51 which is the lowest among the maximum iiryv for any county among all crops cotton iiryv mostly was low 40 and was quite homogenous across the complete cotton growing areas sorghum demonstrated medium to low iiryv 60 with the extreme values in iiryv ranging from none to 83 central nebraska western and central kansas and panhandle texas showed generally higher iiryv while western nebraska colorado and new mexico showed lower iiryv interestingly for sorghum the regions displaying no iiryv were negligible barley iiryv ranged from no reduction to 78 reduction and was the highest in idaho with the eastern states of the region showing generally moderate to high iiryv the western states had lower iiryv magnitudes with considerable counties in oregon showing no reduction oats was observed to show a iiryv ranging from 14 to 75 with the distinction of showing the highest magnitude of the lower extent of variability reduction 14 and none of the counties showed no reduction a trait similar to what we found in sorghum thus we establish that both geographic location and crop type have a considerable influence on the yield stabilization benefit under irrigated production 3 4 temporal variability and trends in irrigation induced reduction in crop yield variability iryv the long term mean behavior of crop yields to demonstrate lower variability when under irrigated conditions can mask the year to year variation of this stabilization effect of irrigated production this section explores and discusses this temporal variability and trends in this phenomenon for each crop we find that there is substantial variability of the iiryv demonstrated by various crops with time supplementary fig s10 for example maize cyvrf 58 was 630 greater than cyvirr 8 in 2012 which is one of the driest years in u s history supplementary fig s9 while the long term mean is considerably lower on the other hand the former 19 was only 12 greater than the latter 17 in 1995 in fact in one of the wettest years in 1993 the difference between cyvrf and cyvirr was even negative 2 similar observations were true for all other crops it was also found that the degree of year to year variability that exists within the cyvrf was higher than cyvirr visually evident from the higher magnitudes of deviation for the broken line than the solid line in supplementary fig s10 in other words the variability within the variability metric cyv is higher for rainfed than irrigated yields to quantify this difference the coefficient of variation cv of the cyvirr and cyvrf series were computed which revealed that across all crops variability in cyvrf was 38 greater than that in cyvirr except soybean and cotton iiryv also has a temporal characteristic and the data indicated positive linear trends overall fig 4 specifically the iiryv increased at a statistically significant α 0 05 rate for the following crops in the decreasing order of rate of increase cotton 9 decade 1 followed by soybean 7 8 decade 1 alfalfa 5 2 decade 1 barley 2 2 decade 1 and spring wheat 1 7 decade 1 other crops such as maize 1 6 decade 1 and winter wheat 1 3 decade 1 and lastly sorghum 0 02 decade 1 had increasing rates of iiryv but were statistically non significant oats iiryv had a non significant decreasing trend 2 1 decade 1 thus in addition to crop type and location time has been found to be an influencing factor in iiryv assessments 4 discussion we quantified the overall yield variability for the top nine u s agricultural crops production wise at the finest scale possible county by individually computing both cyvirr and cyvrf and consequently the difference between the latter and former which was termed irrigation induced reduction in yield variability or iiryv for each of these variables we focused on differences encountered in them among crops locations and time the outcomes and the information generated through our analyses hold crucial significance for assessing planning forecasting and strategizing the u s water resources diverted from surface water and withdrawn from groundwater resources to irrigation first and foremost we can derive from our analysis fig 2 that some crops such as maize soybean and alfalfa present a higher degree of stabilization in yields at national level when irrigated vs rainfed production are considered this can also be interpreted as a proxy to the higher sensitivity of these crops to available water moreover this advantage of certain crops over others is presented in different spatial and temporal domains figs 3 and 4 maps such as fig 3 present the long term patterns of the stabilization benefit of irrigated agriculture over rainfed agriculture and profoundly aid in identification of regions which are crucial to sustain irrigation eg central nebraska for maize production see fig 3a and the areas that present little or no advantage eg eastern nebraska for alfalfa production see fig 3e it should be noted that a iiryv magnitude of 0 i e no reduction in variability does not mean no benefit of irrigated agriculture over rainfed agriculture because the advantage in terms of producing greater crop yields under irrigated production still prevails which has been referred to as irrigation limited yield gaps by kukal and irmak 2019a in the time domain our findings suggest that iiryv s for major crops have been increasing which justifies the growing need of irrigation as we proceed in time for example crops like cotton soybean and alfalfa which show greatest rates of increase in iiryv need to be given greater focus in terms of irrigation infrastructure and management in the future given the iiryv projections are similar other studies e g iizumi et al 2013 hazell 1985 addressed the dynamics of temporal crop yield variability but none have proposed and quantified difference among irrigated and rainfed production which we quantified analyzed and presented here for a wide variety of agronomic crops there could be several potential causes of iiryv variation in space time and across crop species it is likely that the spatial variation of iiryv is driven by change in precipitation received within the crop growing season primarily because of strong association of rainfed yield variability with precipitation kukal and irmak 2018a the role of precipitation in dictating relative magnitudes of irrigated and rainfed crops has been quantified for maize in nebraska across both spatial and temporal domains kukal and irmak 2019a other plausible factors that could influence spatial differences in iiryv are differential spatial response of irrigated and rainfed yield variability to coupled temperature and precipitation kukal and irmak 2018a crop growing degree days kukal and irmak 2018 kukal and irmak 2019b soil types increased use of inputs and other spatial changes in environmental conditions kucharik and ramankutty 2005 porter and semonov 2005 osborne and wheeler 2013 smith et al 2007 chen et al 2004 isik and devadoss 2006 calderini and slafer 1998 iizumi et al 2014 differential weather climate sensitivity of the same crop under irrigated and rainfed management kukal and irmak 2018a li and troy 2018 troy et al 2015 irrigation method sprinkler vs gravity vs subsurface or surface drip irrigation and consequently irrigation efficiency or any other soil and crop management factors kucharik and ramankutty 2005 smith et al 2007 irmak et al 2019 to which irrigated and rainfed yields could respond differently as an exploratory exercise we used irrigation intensity from mirad us dataset pervez and brown 2010 as it is the best available indicator of prevalence of irrigation across the u we found that cyvirr is an inverse function of irrigation intensity for maize soybean alfalfa cotton and sorghum supplementary fig s11 which are the major crops that potentially govern investment on irrigation infrastructure this implies that higher the intensity of irrigation irrigated lands as a fraction of total land the more stable the crop yields tend to be although the high scatter implies that there are other confounding factors listed above that affect this relationship one of these factors could be that the mirad us dataset was developed for 2002 whereas the cyvirr magnitudes represent long term means temporal variation in iiryv could be driven by changes in sensitivity of crop hybrids cultivars and varieties kucharik and ramankutty 2005 lobell et al 2014 shi et al 2013 to changes in precipitation and other hybrid characteristics that differ among irrigated and rainfed production conversion of gravity irrigation to sprinkler irrigation and weather variability over time kukal and irmak 2018a b the inter crop differences in iiryv may stem from several reasons first these differences as perceived from a national perspective fig 2b are a consequence of distinct crop distribution patterns i e prevalence of different crops in different regions which translates into different growing season lengths environmental conditions kukal and irmak 2018b precipitation regimes kukal and irmak 2016a b and differential nature and rates of weather variability encountered kukal and irmak 2018a these factors ultimately alter the crop irrigation requirements which differ both among different crops as well as the same crop grown at different locations different years and hence most certainly have an impact on iiryv secondly the inter crop iiryv difference is also driven by the balance among the precipitation received by the rainfed crop and its consumptive use evapotranspiration in a given area a given amount of growing season precipitation might be sufficient to meet crop water requirements for some rainfed crops so as to be as productive or approach as their irrigated counterparts but that might not be the case for some crops the relative patterns of iiryv found in this research are roughly directly related to the crops consumptive use howell et al 2006 kukal et al 2017 for example cotton and sorghum have lower consumptive use than maize thus lower iiryv for former than latter finally differences in intrinsic crop characteristics can impact iiryv particularly contrasting drought tolerance characteristics plants differ in their response to water limitation by showing a wide range of adaptations at physiological biochemical and molecular levels xoconostle cazares et al 2010 for example drought tolerant plants can cope with stress by temporarily diminishing their metabolic functions regulation of stomatal closure hygrotropism reduction of foliar area via leaf rolling etc xoconostle cazares et al 2010 however some plants have more developed drought tolerance than others or have received greater focus from the technological advances the photosynthetic pathways c3 vs c4 are one aspect of these crop specific differences sage and kubien 2007 kukal and irmak 2020 that impact water use efficiency thus the comparative productivity of crops under rainfed and irrigated management is dictated by the drought tolerant capacities in these crops and thus governs differences in inter crop differences in iiryv moreover different sensitivities towards biotic stresses such as diseases weed pressure etc also contribute to the inter crop differences in iiryv iiryv can act as a useful tool in applications in the areas of water resources and agricultural commodities planning and decision making firstly iiryv can be a crucial variable when strategizing ground and surface water withdrawal regulations which currently do not account for variable returns from irrigation for certain regions and crops identifying regions of high iiryv where irrigation water is groundwater aquifer based is becoming crucial irmak 2018 the recent policy updations on groundwater withdrawal regulation and water rights transfer from agriculture to urban municipality domains cause conversion of irrigated crop production to rainfed production rangeland or ecosystem conservation wildlife habitat brewer et al 2007 olmstead et al 2016 or irrigating in a deficit limited fashion in these situations referring to iiryv magnitudes in these regions could provide both the user managers and the policy makers to understand the detrimental effects of water rights transfer on crop yields and make necessary short and long term planning to develop research and science based precautions strategies to minimize the impacts for example the regulation can be designed such that the dominant crop in a given region shows low iiryv secondly iiryv can also be used to plan future spatial crop distribution prioritizing water management challenges based on long term historical patterns of crop performance in presence or absence of irrigation for instance crops that consistently show higher iiryv magnitudes than others in a region can imply relative superiority when prioritizing irrigation investments thirdly these findings can inform future efforts in plant breeding and genetics for example technological advancements can be selectively carried out in crop cultivars which consistently show greater iiryv provided that all the regions can be characterized in terms of cultivars that are generally prevalent finally regions and crops with higher iiryv can be identified for moisture conservation programs eg conservation agriculture and other key agronomic practices to increase rainfed productivity overall the information and data presented here can be extremely valuable to enhance overall productivity of the nation s agricultural commodities and aid in sustainability of water resources as well as aiding in meeting the growing demand of rapidly growing population s demand for food fiber feed and fuel in the recent past limited deficit irrigation has been proposed to optimize crop performance by irrigating at critical crop growth stages in limited water conditions although the impacts of limited irrigation on crop yields has been studied extensively yet its impacts on long term crop yield variability due to environmental fluctuations conceptually iiryv are unknown theoretically under deficit irrigation crop yield response will be less optimum than full irrigation and thus iiryv should decrease identifying limitedly irrigated regions and growing seasons on a large spatial and temporal extent as this study is a daunting task and hence these impacts cannot be appropriately quantified currently local research in the field of deficit or limited irrigation impacts on crop yield djaman and irmak 2012 payero et al 2009 2008 payero et al 2006 zhang et al 2004 traore et al 2000 english and raja 1996 nesmith and ritchie 1992 comas et al 2019 howell et al 2007 should be studied in conjunction with iiryv findings this is because in areas with low to moderate regulation producers are more likely to employ deficit irrigation and only in severe cases of regulation the discourse is to convert an irrigated field to rainfed if irrigated crop production becomes economically unviable from an idealistic standpoint it might seem optimal to allocate irrigation resources to crops and regions with high iiryv magnitudes however when socioeconomic variables and the dependence of different regions on certain crops and consequent industrial and economic implications of such an allocation is considered this is an enormously challenging pathway by no means we intend to propose in this study increased adoption of irrigation practices on rainfed area by highlighting the reduced variability in irrigated agriculture in fact increased adoption of irrigation must be weighed carefully against the depleting freshwater resources it is not recommended to achieve a more stable and reliable food supply at the expense of water resource overuse that could be better used elsewhere troy et al 2015 moreover it has to be considered that what the source of irrigation water abstraction is groundwater or surface water and depending on region the current water availability for these sources thus other critical information especially in regards to freshwater availability and its alternate consumers has to be compounded with our findings in fact recent modeling efforts in the ogallala aquifer ecosystems have shown that due to decreasingly sustainable pumping in significant irrigated areas transitioning to pasture or dryland production will be a function of land suitability and economic impacts deines et al 2020 our results should be interpreted as science based analyses and quantitative resources to understand and recognize the contribution of irrigation in a historical framework in stabilizing crop yields in addition to the benefits of increased yield irrigation limited yield gaps kukal and irmak 2019a the manifestation of the historical levels of iiryv in the us especially in the recent past might also be governed by the inter dynamics among 1 economic investment in irrigation 2 returns from increased crop yield and profitability 3 contrasting water availability and water management regimes and 4 crop specific characteristics for example grain sorghum is a water efficient crop with low input costs compared to maize it has lower consumptive water use comparable feed value chen et al 1994 90 95 energy content 120 130 crude protein 5 lower 10 year average price usda however there is a large disparity between irrigated acres among maize and sorghum in the us economic profitability of irrigation investments is what has driven these trends research has shown that net revenue is greater in maize than grain sorghum when irrigation capacity water availability is not limited however in water limited environments crops with lower cost of production and greater water use efficiency like grain sorghum is an economically superior alternative warren et al 2017 further this superiority is further complicated by differences in crop specific genetic advances traits such as pest insect and weed protection in maize are not currently present in sorghum making it challenging to manage although we present the first quantitative evidence of the role of irrigation to alleviate crop yield variability our study possesses certain cautions which mainly stem from incompleteness of the usda nass crop yield dataset firstly our period of analysis was not uniform for across the crop panel for instance we used data from 1947 to 2015 for maize whereas for alfalfa it was from 1960 to 2008 because of varying availability of yield data from nass due to these dissimilar periods of analysis the inter crop comparisons we studied could possibly be examined although this was an unavoidable challenge nevertheless all the crops included in the analyses have at least 45 years up to 71 years of data which is reasonably long to infer long term assessments secondly the county level yield data had missing records within the selected start and end years to avoid inclusion of counties with unacceptable amount of data we decided that a county was to be included only if a minimum of 15 years of yield records exist despite data constraints the study successfully quantifies the yield stabilizing trait of irrigated over rainfed crop production against interannual environmental variability in the entirety of the conterminous us for nine major national crops apart from development of a variable iiryv that is usually referred to but not mathematically quantifiably addressed the strength of the study also lies in its inclusive nature the study addresses iiryv for a large range of crops which accounted for 80 of the total u s crop harvested area 98 5 million hectares in 2017 and hence characterizes almost the entire u s agricultural crop production in fact no study exists that includes the extent of crop variety nine and for some crops is the first and only resource to look into in terms of irrigation availability vs crop yield relationships at large scales the study also comprehensively addresses the substantial changes in the iiryv that have occurred historically in both spatial and temporal domains thus we suggest that the study is a pioneer step to spatially and temporally quantify the impacts of irrigation on u s agriculture on large scales and offers significant contributions not only to the scientific literature but is also an invaluable tool for policy and decision makers for assessing planning and forecasting the irrigation vs productivity relationships to enhance future agricultural productivity while the analyses and findings of this research are limited to us agroecosystems the use of the iiryv metric can be extended in its present form to global irrigated agroecosystems to include a wider range of

10649,irrigation contributes to enhance and sustain agricultural production in the u s across all aridity regimes via mitigation against interannual environmental variability currently a quantitative understanding of the role of irrigation in stabilizing agricultural yields is lacking limiting the realization of irrigation adoption impacts here we use 220 000 historical 1950 2015 county year irrigated and rainfed yield records for the top nine u s crops maize zea mays l soybean glycine max l merr spring wheat triticum aestivum l winter wheat triticum aestivum l alfalfa medicago sativa l sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench cotton gossypium hirsutum barley hordeum vulgare l and oats avena sativa to comprehensively quantify the irrigation induced reduction in crop yield variability iiryv defined as the percent reduction in crop yield variability when irrigated with respect to rainfed yield variability averaged across all crops national level iiryv was 41 which varied from 0 to 90 across various regions and crops iiryv was highly crop specific and maize and cotton crops demonstrated the highest and least magnitudes iiryv substantially varied spatially within the constituent growing regions for each crop and thus national scale assessments masked significant spatial differences iiryv was subject to interannual temporal variability however in general iiryv increased over time 1950 2015 for most crops these findings will help in the evaluation of the contribution of historical irrigation development policy and adoption in the u s in mitigating external shocks variability in u s agricultural productivity the demonstration of spatial and temporal dynamics in iiryv will aid in irrigation water allocations and adoption by prioritizing irrigation development for vulnerable crops and regions keywords irrigation weather crop yields variability rainfed yield irrigated yield 1 introduction agriculture in the united states u s has experienced a productivity revolution starting in 1930 s gardner 2009 potential factors have caused this sharp productivity rise including farm mechanization advances in plant breeding and efficacy of chemical inputs regulatory policy including research support price and farm credit programs advanced agronomic management farm electrification etc rasmussen 1962 clarke 2002 kitchens and fishback 2015 mann 1999 tester and langridge 2010 in addition the advent and adoption of irrigation has had a significant role in contributing towards higher agricultural yields irrigation allows for crop production in arid semi arid regions that do not receive sufficient precipitation to meet crop water demand an ideal example of this is the farmland to the west of the 98th meridian where the annual precipitation received is less than 500 mm prism climate group 2018 and significant portion is not received during the crop growing season nevertheless the western and midwestern states account for more than 80 of the total u s farmland and two thirds of the nation s irrigated land usda 2013 producing substantial proportions of nation s wheat 70 horticultural crops 33 vegetables 50 cotton 40 fruits tree nuts and berries 80 if deprived of irrigation millions of hectares in the western u s would be rendered barren or low value grazing lands with considerably small economic value selby 1949 stubbs 2016 the economic benefits of irrigation also extend to humid and sub humid regions with sufficient precipitation as it acts as a buffer against within season precipitation variability and extremes with increasing precipitation variability svoma and balling 2010 pendergrass et al 2017 drought conditions increased commodity prices in certain periods low cost and relatively easy access to groundwater resources for irrigation vories and evett 2010 schaible and aillery 2012 as well as irrigation s substantial impact on increasing grain yields the irrigated land area in the humid eastern states in the united states has increased by over 3 5 million hectares since 1984 usda 2013 1984 in fact the u s eastern states have increased their irrigated area by 50 since 2003 as opposed to reduction in irrigated area in majority of western states usda 2013 thus irrigation has immense significance for croplands irrespective of aridity regimes at any given location due to increasing trend in water availability as well as challenges in water quality degradation for freshwater resources used for irrigation and uncertainties in terms of impact s of change in climate variables and their variability on agricultural operations and productions and water resources irrigation s role in reducing the inter annual variability in grain yield production may become more important in the future given the fact that irrigated yields on average are 2 7 times greater than rainfed yields rosenzweig and parry 1994 and this advantage of irrigated yields over the rainfed yields irrigation limited yield gap varies across crops space and time kukal and irmak 2019a we anticipate and hypothesize that a similar behavior should be revealed by comparing interannual variability among irrigated and rainfed yields interannual variability in agricultural yields for various crops locations and time periods have been discussed by some studies kucharik and ramankutty 2005 ray et al 2015 ben ari and makowski 2014 iizumi and ramankutty 2016 kukal and irmak 2018a however very limited research has been conducted on quantifying and studying the interannual variability among irrigated and rainfed crop yields distinctly especially at finer scales irrigated and rainfed yield variability for maize soybean and sorghum in the u s great plains were compared and it was found that the interannual variability defined by coefficient of variability in rainfed yields was 77 maize 69 sorghum and 63 soybean greater than that in irrigated yields kukal and irmak 2018a in another study irrigated and rainfed yield residuals for maize in nebraska were compared and found that irrigation reduced maize yield variability by a factor of three i e positive and negative deviations in irrigated yields were 5 6 and 7 4 whereas they were 18 5 and 19 7 in rainfed yields respectively kucharik and ramankutty 2005 while it is a well accepted notion that irrigated crop yields should and do present lower interannual variability than their rainfed counterparts quantitative estimates of this reduction in variability are currently unknown or insufficient for all major u s crops and the regions moreover the spatial and temporal patterns associated with the reduction in variability under irrigated conditions if any are unexplored since irrigation technology and efficiency have evolved and improved over time and has regional differences caswell 1991 green et al 1996 there is a strong likelihood that it could result in spatial and temporal variations in the reduction in variability post irrigation adoption moreover almost all of the studies are limited to addressing the issue of yield variability only for major crops that have significance for national and global agricultural production i e maize soybean wheat and rice in global studies however other crops that although account for relatively lower production nationally globally are of considerable economic significance for specific regions where they are grown furthermore these secondary crops account for a considerable portion of the total national irrigated land area alfalfa cotton sorghum barley and oats production contribute to 12 of the total 2017 production usda 2018 thus a gap exists in our assessments and knowledge on comparative interannual variability among irrigated and rainfed crop yields at finer sub state or county scales especially for crops that are integral part of u s agriculture but have not been discussed sufficiently here we address these issues by quantifying and comparing interannual variability among irrigated and rainfed yields for nine major crops to select these major crops we ranked the crops on the basis of their national production in 2018 which is mostly consistent with the long term mean production as well these crops include maize zea mays l soybean glycine max l merr spring wheat triticum aestivum l winter wheat triticum aestivum l alfalfa medicago sativa l sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench cotton gossypium hirsutum barley hordeum vulgare l and oats avena sativa we aim to quantify comparative differences in interannual variability among irrigated and rainfed yields at county level during the complete usda survey records available moreover we decipher and report spatial and temporal patterns trends in the irrigated vs rainfed yield variability our overall goal in regards to these objectives is to characterize the benefits of irrigation i e stabilization of agricultural crop yields against interannual variability caused by all the external influences such as weather variability extreme weather water availability pests weeds and soil and crop management practices 2 methods and data 2 1 data source and pre processing data for irrigated and non irrigated yields and harvested area for maize soybean spring wheat winter wheat alfalfa sorghum cotton barley and oats were obtained from the national agricultural statistics service united states department of agriculture usda 2018 using the quickstats online tool these crops were selected to include major u s agricultural commodities based on current production statistics account for 80 of the 2017 u s harvested area all the county level yield records for each crop were retrieved from around the year 1950 until the end of records around 2015 when available from the nass records the data were subjected to certain processing steps prior to use firstly raw nass data were assessed for missing records and temporal extents were decided for each crop it has to be noted that nass publishes irrigated and rainfed yield data separately only for states or counties that have substantial cropland under both irrigated and rainfed cultivation only those counties that reported a minimum of 15 data records for both irrigated and non irrigated yields were selected for analyses supplementary table s1 lists the start end and period of analysis as well as the number of counties that met the pre processing criteria and hence qualified for analyses additionally yield data were converted to metric units kg ha 1 from commercial units for each crop to maintain consistency the conversion factors were 1 kg ha 1 0 0159 bu ac 1 for maize sorghum 1 kg ha 1 0 0149 bu ac 1 for wheat soybean 1 kg ha 1 0 0185 bu ac 1 for barley 1 kg ha 1 0 0279 bu ac 1 for oats 1 kg ha 1 0 8922 lb ac 1 for cotton and 1 kg ha 1 0 0004047 t ac 1 for alfalfa 2 2 quantifying irrigated and rainfed crop yield variability the crop yield variability cyv metric represents the magnitude of interannual deviations from the long term linear trajectory of yield growth crop yields are controlled by a variety of factors among which the overall long term increasing trend is caused due to agronomic and technological advances such as improvements in plant breeding and genetics eg development of high yielding herbicide resistant or drought tolerant hybrids fertilizer pesticides farm mechanization as well as weather and climate factors on the other hand the high frequency fluctuations are mainly caused by weather and climate factors in this research we are particularly high frequency year to year variability and thus detrending the crop yield data to remove the trends in non weather factors genetics and technology is critical this technique has been extensively applied in empirical modeling of agricultural systems maltais landry and lobell 2012 lobell and field 2007 kukal and irmak 2018a b the interannual deviations contain signatures for environment induced crop performance fluctuations abiotic stresses and hence should be different under irrigated and non irrigated crop production systems to quantify interannual crop yield variability cyv for a given county a linear function was fit to crop yield individually for irrigated and non irrigated vs time years pairs of observed data residuals from the fitted linear function were calculated a modulus function was applied to the residual and a ratio was computed by dividing it by the predicted value derived from the linear fit this quantity is what we interpret as crop yield variability for a specific county and year supplementary fig s1 graphically represents the computation of cyv for chase county nebraska as an example we conducted the abovementioned series of steps individually for irrigated and non irrigated crop yields in a given county for the purpose of analyzing long term spatial patterns and inter crop differences we averaged the cyv magnitudes for each county over the total number of annual records available 2 3 quantifying overall weighted crop yield variability to estimate a representative value of overall crop yield variability for a county we first calculated long term mean irrigated and rainfed area fractions firr and frf respectively for each county which are dimensionless eqs 1 and 2 these were calculated by dividing the crop harvested area ha under irrigated rainfed production by total harvested land area ha and averaging over the annual records available for each county then firr and frf were used as a weighting factor to compute a weighted mean of irrigated and rainfed yield variability cyvoverall based on the relative prevalence of irrigated rainfed production in each county eq 3 1 f i r r h a r v e s t e d a r e a u n d e r i r r i g a t e d p r o d u c t i o n t o t a l h a r v e s t e d a r e a 2 f r f 1 f i r r 3 c y v o v e r a l l c y v i r r f i r r c y v r f f r f where cyvoverall is the overall crop yield variability for a given county and year in percent cyvirr is the irrigated crop yield variability in percent cyvrf is the rainfed crop yield variability in percent firr is the irrigated area fraction ranged from 0 to 1 and frf is the rainfed area fraction ranged from 0 to 1 2 4 quantifying irrigation induced reduction in crop yield variability iiryv following the computation of irrigated and rainfed crop yield variability individually for each county the difference among cyvrf and cyvirr relative to cyvrf was computed and a modulus function was applied to the term for cases where cyvirr and cyvrf are comparable or the difference is slightly negative if any the denominator of the metric was cyvrf to aid in comparison of iiryv across geographic scales as rainfed yields will be free from influence of irrigation this resulting quantity was termed as irrigation induced reduction in crop yield variability or iiryv as presented in equation 4 since iiryv was calculated as a difference of cyvirr from cyvrf and ratioed with cyvrf the range for iiryv will be 0 1 the methodology used here is partially similar to that adopted by kucharik and ramankutty 2005 4 i i r y v c y v r f c y v i r r c y v r f 2 5 mapping all the spatial data were mapped at county level using arcmap 10 4 1 esri 2017 3 results 3 1 interannual crop yield variability in the u s we start by answering our most fundamental question i e what has been the historical interannual variability in the u s agricultural yields to the best of our knowledge there is no previous knowledge on comparative crop yield variability cyv for the major national and regional crops in the u s in fact not much is known about the cyv of crops such as alfalfa cotton sorghum barley and oats at the regional or even national scale moreover for all of the crop panel distinct estimates of irrigated and rainfed cyv cyvirr and cyvrf respectively are unknown we find that for irrigated crops on a national basis cotton showed the highest interannual variability followed by winter and spring wheat oats barley sorghum alfalfa maize and soybean supplementary fig s2 however rainfed crops compared in a different fashion on the national basis with cotton showing the highest interannual variability due to its momentous sensitivity to both magnitude and timing of water stress smith and cothren 1999 followed by maize oats spring wheat sorghum barley winter wheat soybean and alfalfa supplementary fig s2 each county has a distinct partitioning of irrigated and rainfed crop harvested area where the fraction of irrigated area to total cultivated area follows an increasing pattern similar to the spatial precipitation gradient irrigated fraction is lower in regions with higher precipitation and vice versa although this partitioning of total harvested area into irrigated and rainfed land area can change temporally we can rely on long term mean magnitudes to represent irrigated fraction of total area or firr supplementary figs s3 and s4 we found that on a long term mean basis firr ranged from 0 51 to 0 21 and was highest in alfalfa followed by oats corn soybean barley cotton spring wheat winter wheat and sorghum supplementary fig s3 to quantify county specific overall crop yield variability cyvoverall which is representative of actual proportions of both irrigated and rainfed area in a given county we compute a weighted average of cyvirr and cyvrf by using firr as a weighing factor we found that on a national basis maximum cyvoverall was still observed in cotton followed by sorghum spring and winter wheat oats corn barley soybean and alfalfa supplementary fig s2 the high standard deviation observed in mean national cyv supplementary fig s2 insinuates high variability found in cyv across geographical domains for each crop the degree of spatial variability in cyvirr was 19 greater than that in cyvrf across all the crops and equal to that in cyvoverall supplementary fig s5 both irrigated and rainfed alfalfa demonstrated the highest degree of spatial variation in cyv as compared with the rest of the crops however maize exhibited the highest degree of spatial variability in cyvoverall we find that there are distinct regions of low moderate and high magnitudes of both irrigated and rainfed cyv supplementary figs s6 and s7 respectively cyvrf demonstrates a longitudinal pattern of decreasing cyv from west to east especially discernible in the great plains region because of relatively smoother gradient of increasing precipitation form west to east which is non existent in cyvirr this absence of a geographical pattern in cyvirr is likely due to the varying effectiveness of irrigation practices at different regions which is challenging to address while rainfed yields are a direct consequence of growing season precipitation that follows a geographical pattern in turn translating into geographical patterns in cyvrf on the other hand the application of irrigation water distorts these natural precipitation induced patterns and convey a management induced signal since farm level management and decision making is highly variable even across farms in the same region and on broader scales recognizing these management induced signals is a challenge development of datasets that record spatial and temporal variation in farm level management at reasonable resolutions is a momentous task although continuous high resolution satellite data hold significant promise deines et al 2019 for a given county cyvoverall ranges between cyvirr and cyvrf depending on the firr supplementary fig s4 for instance regions such as central nebraska where maize production is almost entirely irrigated i e firr 1 show overall maize yield variability magnitudes that are equal to that of irrigated maize yield variability and vice versa fig 1 it is evident that among all the crops at all the constituent locations cotton in texas was the most variability prone crop region combination fig 1 f followed by others such as maize in eastern kansas winter wheat in texas panhandle and barley in southern california top performing crop regions in terms of yield stability low cyvoverall were maize in nebraska and southwest kansas soybean in nebraska and alfalfa in nebraska and idaho the underlying reasoning for this behavior is moderately high to high firr in these regions an ideal example being nebraska with the highest irrigated land area in the nation 3 2 national level irrigation induced reduction in crop yield variability iiryv until now we have recognized and established that cyvirr and cyvrf for a given crop are different and when averaged nationally cyvirr is lower than cyvrf this section quantifies and compares as to how does the yield stabilization effect seen in irrigated crops evidenced by lower magnitudes of cyvirr than cyvrf varies across different crops studied overall the u s rainfed crop yields historically showed two fold 1 96 interannual variability than the u s irrigated crop yields when averaged across all crops this long term mean fraction of rainfed to irrigated long term crop yield variability ranged from 2 71 to 1 94 and was the highest in maize 2 71 followed by soybean 2 43 alfalfa 2 13 oats 1 94 sorghum 1 85 barley 1 84 spring wheat 1 78 winter wheat 1 52 and lastly cotton 1 44 the extremes of the standard deviation associated with the mean ratio of rainfed to irrigated variability show that at a minimum the irrigated crop yield variability was equal to rainfed crop yield variability however at a maximum rainfed crop yield variability was as high as 3 6 times the irrigated crop yield variability fig 2 a for all the crops averaged nationally the ratio of cyvrf to cyvirr was greater than 1 which implies that irrigation mitigates interannual crop yield variability stabilizes yields when compared to rainfed production we refer to this stabilization benefit that occurs under irrigated production as irrigation induced reduction in yield variability iiryv simply iiryv can be considered as the reduction in cyv achieved if a producer in a particular county converts from rainfed production to irrigated production we justifiably presume that the reported irrigated and rainfed yields representing a particular county to be comparable because of similarity of growing conditions such as weather soils management practices etc within a county on a national scale we found that irrigation has led to lowering of crop yield variability historically by 41 iiryv 41 than what was shown by rainfed yields averaged across all nine crops studied fig 2 b long term mean iiryv ranged from 57 to 28 and was highest for maize 57 soybean 55 oats 45 alfalfa 43 sorghum 42 barley 39 spring wheat 36 cotton 28 and winter wheat 28 which is slightly different from the magnitudes demonstrated by the ratio of rainfed and irrigated yield variability the extremes of the standard deviation associated with the mean crop specific iiryv imply that we encountered iiryv of as high as 79 and as low as 7 this wide range of iiryv stems from significant spatial variation which was even greater than found in cyvirr and cyvrf we find that the highest spatial variability in iiryv was demonstrated by winter and spring wheat cv 0 65 followed by alfalfa barley cotton maize sorghum oats and soybean supplementary fig s8 the higher spatial variability in wheat is likely due to larger and relatively more geographically distributed growing regions which encompasses greater environmental variability relative to other crops most likely due to its growing season period being different than other crops especially in contrast to soybean which shows least spatial variation due to its smaller growing region 3 3 spatial heterogeneity in irrigation induced reduction in crop yield variability iiryv the national scale assessment of iiryv informed us not only about the national mean magnitudes of iiryv but also the variation associated with the mean iiryv see standard deviation bars in fig 1 b this variation stems from the spatial heterogeneity in iiryv when individual counties are considered rather than averaging them nationally in this section we discuss the patterns of this spatial heterogeneity in iiryv for each crop within their growing regions we find that while national assessments are useful they mask spatial inter county differences in the iiryv pooling all the crops and regions rainfed yield variability varied from being 0 5 5 times the irrigated yield variability supplementary fig s9 and iiryv varied from 0 no reduction in variability to up to 90 fig 3 here we list some insights into the features of spatial heterogeneity of iiryv in various crops maize iiryv ranged from none to 80 and the spatial distribution of iiryv fig 3 shows that the highest magnitudes existed in central nebraska and was generally higher than 50 in nebraska and kansas however it was relatively lower in the dakotas 40 and the easternmost counties in the dakotas demonstrated no reduction in maize yield variability which could be due to limited adoption of irrigation and also due to relatively higher humidity and precipitation and hence lack of water stress soybean iiryv ranged from 4 to 78 and was the highest in central kansas with most of the soybean growing regions showing iiryv 50 with the exception of eastern nebraska and some parts of arkansas again this low iiryv could be due to lack of water stress in these regions spring wheat iiryv ranging from 0 to 81 demonstrated lesser regional coherence as compared with maize and soybean with greater variability even at smaller scales overall eastern wyoming and colorado show reasonably high spring wheat iiryv while the northwestern region of the nation showed lower and inconsistent iiryv magnitudes overall due to higher precipitation and low irrigation adoption in northwestern u s winter wheat being grown on greater land area than spring wheat irrigated classes shows more spatial coherence than that observed in spring wheat the iiryv in winter wheat ranged from 0 to 75 and was generally higher 60 in california utah and idaho while also demonstrating a greater proportion of counties with no reduction in variability in montana and oregon iiryv 0 another interesting feature of the winter wheat iiryv was the west east decreasing gradient found in the great plains with the counties adjoining the eastern boundary of winter wheat growing regions showing very low to no reduction in variability alfalfa showed generally high iiryv values 50 similar to maize and soybean while also showing the maximum iiryv in a county among all crops at 90 similar to winter wheat a west east decreasing gradient was found in nebraska with counties showing very smooth transition from high iiryv in the west to low or no iiryv in the east in addition to eastern nebraska some parts in colorado and idaho showed lower or zero iiryv cotton iiryv ranged from none to 51 which is the lowest among the maximum iiryv for any county among all crops cotton iiryv mostly was low 40 and was quite homogenous across the complete cotton growing areas sorghum demonstrated medium to low iiryv 60 with the extreme values in iiryv ranging from none to 83 central nebraska western and central kansas and panhandle texas showed generally higher iiryv while western nebraska colorado and new mexico showed lower iiryv interestingly for sorghum the regions displaying no iiryv were negligible barley iiryv ranged from no reduction to 78 reduction and was the highest in idaho with the eastern states of the region showing generally moderate to high iiryv the western states had lower iiryv magnitudes with considerable counties in oregon showing no reduction oats was observed to show a iiryv ranging from 14 to 75 with the distinction of showing the highest magnitude of the lower extent of variability reduction 14 and none of the counties showed no reduction a trait similar to what we found in sorghum thus we establish that both geographic location and crop type have a considerable influence on the yield stabilization benefit under irrigated production 3 4 temporal variability and trends in irrigation induced reduction in crop yield variability iryv the long term mean behavior of crop yields to demonstrate lower variability when under irrigated conditions can mask the year to year variation of this stabilization effect of irrigated production this section explores and discusses this temporal variability and trends in this phenomenon for each crop we find that there is substantial variability of the iiryv demonstrated by various crops with time supplementary fig s10 for example maize cyvrf 58 was 630 greater than cyvirr 8 in 2012 which is one of the driest years in u s history supplementary fig s9 while the long term mean is considerably lower on the other hand the former 19 was only 12 greater than the latter 17 in 1995 in fact in one of the wettest years in 1993 the difference between cyvrf and cyvirr was even negative 2 similar observations were true for all other crops it was also found that the degree of year to year variability that exists within the cyvrf was higher than cyvirr visually evident from the higher magnitudes of deviation for the broken line than the solid line in supplementary fig s10 in other words the variability within the variability metric cyv is higher for rainfed than irrigated yields to quantify this difference the coefficient of variation cv of the cyvirr and cyvrf series were computed which revealed that across all crops variability in cyvrf was 38 greater than that in cyvirr except soybean and cotton iiryv also has a temporal characteristic and the data indicated positive linear trends overall fig 4 specifically the iiryv increased at a statistically significant α 0 05 rate for the following crops in the decreasing order of rate of increase cotton 9 decade 1 followed by soybean 7 8 decade 1 alfalfa 5 2 decade 1 barley 2 2 decade 1 and spring wheat 1 7 decade 1 other crops such as maize 1 6 decade 1 and winter wheat 1 3 decade 1 and lastly sorghum 0 02 decade 1 had increasing rates of iiryv but were statistically non significant oats iiryv had a non significant decreasing trend 2 1 decade 1 thus in addition to crop type and location time has been found to be an influencing factor in iiryv assessments 4 discussion we quantified the overall yield variability for the top nine u s agricultural crops production wise at the finest scale possible county by individually computing both cyvirr and cyvrf and consequently the difference between the latter and former which was termed irrigation induced reduction in yield variability or iiryv for each of these variables we focused on differences encountered in them among crops locations and time the outcomes and the information generated through our analyses hold crucial significance for assessing planning forecasting and strategizing the u s water resources diverted from surface water and withdrawn from groundwater resources to irrigation first and foremost we can derive from our analysis fig 2 that some crops such as maize soybean and alfalfa present a higher degree of stabilization in yields at national level when irrigated vs rainfed production are considered this can also be interpreted as a proxy to the higher sensitivity of these crops to available water moreover this advantage of certain crops over others is presented in different spatial and temporal domains figs 3 and 4 maps such as fig 3 present the long term patterns of the stabilization benefit of irrigated agriculture over rainfed agriculture and profoundly aid in identification of regions which are crucial to sustain irrigation eg central nebraska for maize production see fig 3a and the areas that present little or no advantage eg eastern nebraska for alfalfa production see fig 3e it should be noted that a iiryv magnitude of 0 i e no reduction in variability does not mean no benefit of irrigated agriculture over rainfed agriculture because the advantage in terms of producing greater crop yields under irrigated production still prevails which has been referred to as irrigation limited yield gaps by kukal and irmak 2019a in the time domain our findings suggest that iiryv s for major crops have been increasing which justifies the growing need of irrigation as we proceed in time for example crops like cotton soybean and alfalfa which show greatest rates of increase in iiryv need to be given greater focus in terms of irrigation infrastructure and management in the future given the iiryv projections are similar other studies e g iizumi et al 2013 hazell 1985 addressed the dynamics of temporal crop yield variability but none have proposed and quantified difference among irrigated and rainfed production which we quantified analyzed and presented here for a wide variety of agronomic crops there could be several potential causes of iiryv variation in space time and across crop species it is likely that the spatial variation of iiryv is driven by change in precipitation received within the crop growing season primarily because of strong association of rainfed yield variability with precipitation kukal and irmak 2018a the role of precipitation in dictating relative magnitudes of irrigated and rainfed crops has been quantified for maize in nebraska across both spatial and temporal domains kukal and irmak 2019a other plausible factors that could influence spatial differences in iiryv are differential spatial response of irrigated and rainfed yield variability to coupled temperature and precipitation kukal and irmak 2018a crop growing degree days kukal and irmak 2018 kukal and irmak 2019b soil types increased use of inputs and other spatial changes in environmental conditions kucharik and ramankutty 2005 porter and semonov 2005 osborne and wheeler 2013 smith et al 2007 chen et al 2004 isik and devadoss 2006 calderini and slafer 1998 iizumi et al 2014 differential weather climate sensitivity of the same crop under irrigated and rainfed management kukal and irmak 2018a li and troy 2018 troy et al 2015 irrigation method sprinkler vs gravity vs subsurface or surface drip irrigation and consequently irrigation efficiency or any other soil and crop management factors kucharik and ramankutty 2005 smith et al 2007 irmak et al 2019 to which irrigated and rainfed yields could respond differently as an exploratory exercise we used irrigation intensity from mirad us dataset pervez and brown 2010 as it is the best available indicator of prevalence of irrigation across the u we found that cyvirr is an inverse function of irrigation intensity for maize soybean alfalfa cotton and sorghum supplementary fig s11 which are the major crops that potentially govern investment on irrigation infrastructure this implies that higher the intensity of irrigation irrigated lands as a fraction of total land the more stable the crop yields tend to be although the high scatter implies that there are other confounding factors listed above that affect this relationship one of these factors could be that the mirad us dataset was developed for 2002 whereas the cyvirr magnitudes represent long term means temporal variation in iiryv could be driven by changes in sensitivity of crop hybrids cultivars and varieties kucharik and ramankutty 2005 lobell et al 2014 shi et al 2013 to changes in precipitation and other hybrid characteristics that differ among irrigated and rainfed production conversion of gravity irrigation to sprinkler irrigation and weather variability over time kukal and irmak 2018a b the inter crop differences in iiryv may stem from several reasons first these differences as perceived from a national perspective fig 2b are a consequence of distinct crop distribution patterns i e prevalence of different crops in different regions which translates into different growing season lengths environmental conditions kukal and irmak 2018b precipitation regimes kukal and irmak 2016a b and differential nature and rates of weather variability encountered kukal and irmak 2018a these factors ultimately alter the crop irrigation requirements which differ both among different crops as well as the same crop grown at different locations different years and hence most certainly have an impact on iiryv secondly the inter crop iiryv difference is also driven by the balance among the precipitation received by the rainfed crop and its consumptive use evapotranspiration in a given area a given amount of growing season precipitation might be sufficient to meet crop water requirements for some rainfed crops so as to be as productive or approach as their irrigated counterparts but that might not be the case for some crops the relative patterns of iiryv found in this research are roughly directly related to the crops consumptive use howell et al 2006 kukal et al 2017 for example cotton and sorghum have lower consumptive use than maize thus lower iiryv for former than latter finally differences in intrinsic crop characteristics can impact iiryv particularly contrasting drought tolerance characteristics plants differ in their response to water limitation by showing a wide range of adaptations at physiological biochemical and molecular levels xoconostle cazares et al 2010 for example drought tolerant plants can cope with stress by temporarily diminishing their metabolic functions regulation of stomatal closure hygrotropism reduction of foliar area via leaf rolling etc xoconostle cazares et al 2010 however some plants have more developed drought tolerance than others or have received greater focus from the technological advances the photosynthetic pathways c3 vs c4 are one aspect of these crop specific differences sage and kubien 2007 kukal and irmak 2020 that impact water use efficiency thus the comparative productivity of crops under rainfed and irrigated management is dictated by the drought tolerant capacities in these crops and thus governs differences in inter crop differences in iiryv moreover different sensitivities towards biotic stresses such as diseases weed pressure etc also contribute to the inter crop differences in iiryv iiryv can act as a useful tool in applications in the areas of water resources and agricultural commodities planning and decision making firstly iiryv can be a crucial variable when strategizing ground and surface water withdrawal regulations which currently do not account for variable returns from irrigation for certain regions and crops identifying regions of high iiryv where irrigation water is groundwater aquifer based is becoming crucial irmak 2018 the recent policy updations on groundwater withdrawal regulation and water rights transfer from agriculture to urban municipality domains cause conversion of irrigated crop production to rainfed production rangeland or ecosystem conservation wildlife habitat brewer et al 2007 olmstead et al 2016 or irrigating in a deficit limited fashion in these situations referring to iiryv magnitudes in these regions could provide both the user managers and the policy makers to understand the detrimental effects of water rights transfer on crop yields and make necessary short and long term planning to develop research and science based precautions strategies to minimize the impacts for example the regulation can be designed such that the dominant crop in a given region shows low iiryv secondly iiryv can also be used to plan future spatial crop distribution prioritizing water management challenges based on long term historical patterns of crop performance in presence or absence of irrigation for instance crops that consistently show higher iiryv magnitudes than others in a region can imply relative superiority when prioritizing irrigation investments thirdly these findings can inform future efforts in plant breeding and genetics for example technological advancements can be selectively carried out in crop cultivars which consistently show greater iiryv provided that all the regions can be characterized in terms of cultivars that are generally prevalent finally regions and crops with higher iiryv can be identified for moisture conservation programs eg conservation agriculture and other key agronomic practices to increase rainfed productivity overall the information and data presented here can be extremely valuable to enhance overall productivity of the nation s agricultural commodities and aid in sustainability of water resources as well as aiding in meeting the growing demand of rapidly growing population s demand for food fiber feed and fuel in the recent past limited deficit irrigation has been proposed to optimize crop performance by irrigating at critical crop growth stages in limited water conditions although the impacts of limited irrigation on crop yields has been studied extensively yet its impacts on long term crop yield variability due to environmental fluctuations conceptually iiryv are unknown theoretically under deficit irrigation crop yield response will be less optimum than full irrigation and thus iiryv should decrease identifying limitedly irrigated regions and growing seasons on a large spatial and temporal extent as this study is a daunting task and hence these impacts cannot be appropriately quantified currently local research in the field of deficit or limited irrigation impacts on crop yield djaman and irmak 2012 payero et al 2009 2008 payero et al 2006 zhang et al 2004 traore et al 2000 english and raja 1996 nesmith and ritchie 1992 comas et al 2019 howell et al 2007 should be studied in conjunction with iiryv findings this is because in areas with low to moderate regulation producers are more likely to employ deficit irrigation and only in severe cases of regulation the discourse is to convert an irrigated field to rainfed if irrigated crop production becomes economically unviable from an idealistic standpoint it might seem optimal to allocate irrigation resources to crops and regions with high iiryv magnitudes however when socioeconomic variables and the dependence of different regions on certain crops and consequent industrial and economic implications of such an allocation is considered this is an enormously challenging pathway by no means we intend to propose in this study increased adoption of irrigation practices on rainfed area by highlighting the reduced variability in irrigated agriculture in fact increased adoption of irrigation must be weighed carefully against the depleting freshwater resources it is not recommended to achieve a more stable and reliable food supply at the expense of water resource overuse that could be better used elsewhere troy et al 2015 moreover it has to be considered that what the source of irrigation water abstraction is groundwater or surface water and depending on region the current water availability for these sources thus other critical information especially in regards to freshwater availability and its alternate consumers has to be compounded with our findings in fact recent modeling efforts in the ogallala aquifer ecosystems have shown that due to decreasingly sustainable pumping in significant irrigated areas transitioning to pasture or dryland production will be a function of land suitability and economic impacts deines et al 2020 our results should be interpreted as science based analyses and quantitative resources to understand and recognize the contribution of irrigation in a historical framework in stabilizing crop yields in addition to the benefits of increased yield irrigation limited yield gaps kukal and irmak 2019a the manifestation of the historical levels of iiryv in the us especially in the recent past might also be governed by the inter dynamics among 1 economic investment in irrigation 2 returns from increased crop yield and profitability 3 contrasting water availability and water management regimes and 4 crop specific characteristics for example grain sorghum is a water efficient crop with low input costs compared to maize it has lower consumptive water use comparable feed value chen et al 1994 90 95 energy content 120 130 crude protein 5 lower 10 year average price usda however there is a large disparity between irrigated acres among maize and sorghum in the us economic profitability of irrigation investments is what has driven these trends research has shown that net revenue is greater in maize than grain sorghum when irrigation capacity water availability is not limited however in water limited environments crops with lower cost of production and greater water use efficiency like grain sorghum is an economically superior alternative warren et al 2017 further this superiority is further complicated by differences in crop specific genetic advances traits such as pest insect and weed protection in maize are not currently present in sorghum making it challenging to manage although we present the first quantitative evidence of the role of irrigation to alleviate crop yield variability our study possesses certain cautions which mainly stem from incompleteness of the usda nass crop yield dataset firstly our period of analysis was not uniform for across the crop panel for instance we used data from 1947 to 2015 for maize whereas for alfalfa it was from 1960 to 2008 because of varying availability of yield data from nass due to these dissimilar periods of analysis the inter crop comparisons we studied could possibly be examined although this was an unavoidable challenge nevertheless all the crops included in the analyses have at least 45 years up to 71 years of data which is reasonably long to infer long term assessments secondly the county level yield data had missing records within the selected start and end years to avoid inclusion of counties with unacceptable amount of data we decided that a county was to be included only if a minimum of 15 years of yield records exist despite data constraints the study successfully quantifies the yield stabilizing trait of irrigated over rainfed crop production against interannual environmental variability in the entirety of the conterminous us for nine major national crops apart from development of a variable iiryv that is usually referred to but not mathematically quantifiably addressed the strength of the study also lies in its inclusive nature the study addresses iiryv for a large range of crops which accounted for 80 of the total u s crop harvested area 98 5 million hectares in 2017 and hence characterizes almost the entire u s agricultural crop production in fact no study exists that includes the extent of crop variety nine and for some crops is the first and only resource to look into in terms of irrigation availability vs crop yield relationships at large scales the study also comprehensively addresses the substantial changes in the iiryv that have occurred historically in both spatial and temporal domains thus we suggest that the study is a pioneer step to spatially and temporally quantify the impacts of irrigation on u s agriculture on large scales and offers significant contributions not only to the scientific literature but is also an invaluable tool for policy and decision makers for assessing planning and forecasting the irrigation vs productivity relationships to enhance future agricultural productivity while the analyses and findings of this research are limited to us agroecosystems the use of the iiryv metric can be extended in its present form to global irrigated agroecosystems to include a wider range of atmospheric water deficit conditions precipitation vs evaporative demand cropping systems productivity levels achieved and water availability regimes declaration of competing interest the authors
