935,the present study attempted to investigate the impact of wastewater contamination and associated pollution on the provisioning services value psv of wetlands in a well established aquacultural complex the wastewater contamination due to the industrial and municipal pollutant carrying canals influx into the main feeding river of the complex and consequently the entire complex became subjected to pollution ammonia was found at a higher concentration than the permissible limit along with traces of heavy metals in the contaminated river the resulting pollution susceptibility was assessed and spatial mapping was done this mapping exhibited high to extreme pollution susceptibility of the river adjoining bheries embankments for the farming of shrimps and fish direct connectivity and higher accessibility to river water led to this susceptibility as a result of this susceptibility the psv of the adjoining bheries was measured at 55 lesser than the psv of the distant bheries the contamination of wastewater significantly reduced the salinity level of the water almost 50 reduction of salinity was measured in the bheri water which increased salinity s departure from the optimum range required for bagda shrimp penaeus monodon cultivation which is the main cultivated fish of this region pollution levels in the river eliminated the supply chain of pin larvae of fishes to the region which increased the production cost and reduced the psv this study documents the pollution effects on wetland provisioning services since the wetland provisions are directly linked with human well being the findings of this study may help in restoring the wetland habitat keywords wastewater contamination pollution effect salinity reduction shrimp farming and wetland provisions 1 introduction wetland is simultaneously a highly productive and vulnerable component of the environment that exhibit fundamental ecological functions and play a critical role in biodiversity and human well being hong et al 2020 besides composing unique aquatic biodiversity goswami and mukhopadhyay 2022 wetlands are highly important for their precious ecological services xu et al 2020 at the same time the degradation of wetlands through pollution with wastewater contamination is a global concern namaalwa et al 2020 it severely impacts aquatic biodiversity ecosystem service and human welfare gardner and finlayson 2018 among the sources of such pollution untreated wastewater was recognized as the most threatening because of its vast amount of nutrient and organic content collins et al 2018 un water 2021 reported that 44 of the world s household wastewater lacks proper treatment the study by wear et al 2021 showed that extensive areas 10000 km2 from different parts of the world suffer from a high level of sewage contamination the contamination hotspots overlap extensively over highly productive environments like coral reefs salt marshes and fish rich rivers mateo sagasta et al 2017 estimated annual global freshwater extraction as 3928 km3 out of which 56 2212 km3 drained into the environment as wastewater connor et al 2017 in the united nations world water development report 2017 indicated this amount 80 out of which the highest was in the world bank classified world bank 2017 low income countries like chad afghanistan ethiopia burundi etc where only 8 undergoes proper treatment on the contrary in high income countries which include countries like canada germany greece denmark etc this amount is 70 the other two groups namely lower middle income countries like india algeria bolivia cambodia etc and upper middle income countries like argentina russia south africa turkey etc accounted for 28 and 38 of the wastewater treatment though aquatic ecosystems can dilute pollutants contamination to some extent severe contamination leads to the alteration of aquatic floral and faunal species mateo sagasta et al 2017 in highly polluted wetland areas the concentration of wastewater and sewage causes the problem of eutrophication by resulting in an excessive richness of nutrients and allochthonous organic matter in the water body these cause eutrophy algae blooms critical reduction of the oxygen level of water and enhancement of bacterial action in decomposing the organic matter wear et al 2021 the lack of enough oxygen leads to a dead zone that again supplies organic matter bhat et al 2022 consequently the fish and shellfish become under stress with low or almost no oxygen mahanayak and panigrahi 2020 apart from that the algae bloom increases toxin production absorption of which by the fish community causes mass mortality bashir et al 2020 these organisms of wetland habitat are extensively consumed wetland provisions in addition the drainage of industrial and urban wastewater to the water bodies significantly increases the level of heavy metals like chromium cr cadmium cd lead pb zinc zn nickel ni copper cu mercury hg etc barakat et al 2020 these heavy metals are considered severe pollutants because of their high level of toxicity and capability of posing detrimental effects on aquatic organisms bashir et al 2020 in addition wastewater effluent contains the highest abundance of antibiotic resistant coliform bacteria lépesová 2018 that is the potential to alter the microbiome composition of the aquatic environment and increase the vulnerability to disease preuss et al 2020 therefore it can be inferred that the primary target of water pollution in the wetland habitat is aquatic biodiversity which is the primary source of wetland provision especially food provision such conflict between anthropogenic activity and wetland habitat can significantly curtail the provisioning service value psv of wetlands this issue should be studied extensively because wetland provisions are an essential commodity for human well being mea 2005 apart from that several toxic pollutants like microplastics and heavy metals are not entirely removed from water bodies thus accumulating in the reservoir magnifying the food chain and ultimately causing severe damage to human health bashir et al 2020 it insists on the utmost importance of studying the effect of pollution on wetland psv the damage to the wetland habitat and resulting reduction of psv has been a severe problem in the bheri fig 1 complex near calcutta municipal corporation cmc and the kolkata metropolitan agglomeration of eastern india the bheries are shallower ponds of various sizes located in juxtaposition to each other separated by 1 3 m embankments each having a single outlet for water entrance and exit controlled and regulated by humans many such bheries lie closely spaced in an area fed by one or two broad channels and multiple sub channels in the present region the indian part of the mature ganges delta these bheries cover 425 km2 of the area and form a bheri complex the bheri complex is inundated by regular diurnal tidal water brought by the river bidyadhari fig 1 the influx of tidal inundation has promoted the farming of various shrimps in this bheri complex though during the monsoon and post monsoon season when the salinity of tidal water is much lesser freshwater fishes are also cultivated here these bheries are owned by an individual or a group of individuals and maintained by traditionally trained persons according to the food and agricultural organization s fao definition of aquaculture which includes the farming of aquatic organisms including fish crustaceans molluscs and aquatic plants by regular stocking feeding and protecting from predators under the ownership of individual or corporate fao 1992 farming of shrimp and fish in this bheri complex can be categorized under aquaculture the shrimps are marketable goods and due to their popularity and high price the psv of these human regulated wetlands is comparatively higher than the other wetlands in the upstream of the river bidyadhari where the bheri complex is located the wastewater draining canal locally known as khal of cmc meets with the river the river also gets tannery effluents through this canal roy et al 2018 it is well documented that the tannery effluent is affluent of heavy metals yap and al mutairi 2021 several other canals like bhogali khal bhangar kata khal also carry urban sewage to the river the wastewater contamination originated pollution causes severe impact on bheri culture the contaminated water finally drains into indian sundarban part of the world s largest mangrove forest and causes environmental damage several studies rashid et al 2014 bhattacharya et al 2014 bhattacharya et al 2016 akhand et al 2016 roy et al 2018 marked the contamination in this part responsible for habitat degradation and heavy metal accumulation in the indian sundarban region but the ecological degradation of tidal bheries adjoining river bidyadhari has not been addressed so far das and dutta 2004 mentioned the ecological risk of this pollution but further investigation was not carried out the impact of pollution on the bheri complex of this region has become devastating and has recently been covered by national and international news portals mongabay 2020 the wire 2020 the local bheri owners and stakeholders blame this pollution of urban and industrial wastewater for reducing the productivity of the bheri here research gap has remained unexplored how far the pollution causes damage to psv of the human regulated wetland to address the gap the present study set multiple objectives 1 identifying the major pollutants and their effect on water quality it was done by assessing the water quality parameters and toxic substances water samples were directly collected from the wastewater canal and the main contaminated river 2 measuring the pollution susceptibility of the bheries since the bheries are connected through common channels the susceptibility should be measured spatially instead of picking up specific bheri and its spatial pattern should be studied to do so an area of interest aoi was demarcated considering the neighbouring bheries of the contamination points 3 finally investigating the impact of pollution on the psv of the wetlands the original contributions of this study from a broad scientific perspective are entrusted in the last two objectives the approach of studying the pollution susceptibility on a spatial scale especially over the water surface regulated by common channels could be applied to other regions with a similar set of discrete points of pollutants affluence analyzing the spatial pattern of pollution susceptibility may help determine the influence of contaminated parts on spreading the pollution moreover the role of pollution in regional environmental degradation is well documented still the documentation of how such a problem is connected to the economic provisions of the wetlands is presented in the study this documentation in such a region where wetland provision is directly linked to the economic enhancement of the local inhabitance will contribute to knowledge added to the scientific literature especially when the hamper of wetland ecosystem service is a global concern mea 2005 and to keep the benefits of wetlands sustainable for human well being such kind of study is required also 2 study area the bheri complex of this study belongs to the indian part of the mature ganges delta which extends from 23 4 19 n 88 29 27 e to 22 12 23 n 89 3 42 e covering more than 6000 km2 of area fig 1 the area of the bheri complex in this region is about 425 km2 which receives regular tidal inundation and is dominated by saline water since these bheries are used for farming shrimp and fish therefore are manually regulated in terms of water recharge and discharge the primary wetland provision of this complex is cultivated fish which is counted as food provision due to this intensive shrimp and fish farming a few human aided factors like external feeding expenditure etc also influence the psv of the bheri complex this region is prevailed by intense seasonality in terms of precipitation the average rainfall of the pre monsoon season covering march to april is 20 25 cm the monsoon season covering june to september is 120 145 cm the post monsoon season covering october to december is 13 19 cm and the winter season covering january to february is 3 5 cm the aoi fig 1 covers the main contamination zone where bhogali khal bhagar kata khal and cmc canal merge with the river bidyadhari and the neighbouring bheries bhogali khal and bhagar kata khal merge with the river near kulti kulti lock gate and cmc canal merges near ghusighata ghusighata sluice gate 3 methods 3 1 assessing water quality in order to understand the pollution level a water quality assessment of the wastewater bearing canal and the main contaminated river was carried out total three water samples wss one from the cmc canal 22 30 12 n 88 36 55 e ws 1 one from the confluence of cmc canal with the river 22 31 24 30 n 88 41 25 e ws 2 and one from 1 km downstream of confluence point along the contaminated river 22 31 30 n 88 42 7 e ws 3 were collected 1 5 2 l was collected as each sample in the sterilized container preserved in the refrigerator and brought to the testing laboratory within 24 hours 25 parameters of physical properties chemical properties toxicity and bacterial property were tested for each sample all the testing was carried out at the regional water testing laboratory kolkata an iso 9001 2008 certified laboratory under the ministry of micro small and medium enterprises msme of the government of india during the collection of samples all the procedures prescribed by the laboratory were followed 3 2 measuring pollution susceptibility and its spatial pattern 3 2 1 parameter selection and data layer preparation the pollution of the wetland caused by wastewater is mainly determined by its mixing thus mixing probability needed to be assessed spatially to obtain the spatial pollution susceptibility keeping this in mind in the present study six parameters that enhance or hinder this mixing of wastewater were considered the adjacent bheries of the main contaminated river segment or the bheries located in the outer parts are supplied by the river water through a network of feeding channels two parameters of network analysis called connectivity and accessibility were taken into consideration here for connectivity the direct connection of the bheri with the main contaminated channel was investigated if the bheries were getting the water supply directly from the main contaminated channel that was considered directly connected 1 on the other hand the bheries supplied water from any sub channel from the main contaminated channel that was not considered directly connected 0 in this way the connectivity of all the bheries was assigned accessibility referred to how accessible a bheri was from the main contaminated channel it was quantified based on how many sub channels were to be passed in order to reach any particular bheri in this process only those channels were recognized as sub channels that were connected to multiple bheri here accessibility was determined by carrying out manual counting and a number was assigned to each bheri the severity of many pollutants and other suspended solids reduces with their floating time the floating time of these pollutants is determined by the length of the channel that supplies water to the bheri hence the channelized distance of the bheries was measured with the help of google earth after assigning the calculated value of direct connectivity accessibility and channelized distance of all the bheries those were spatially interpolated with the help of the inverse distance weighted idw technique using the spatial analyst tool of arc gis v 10 2 fig 2 a b and c the spreading of the wastewater within the bheri once it reaches the bheri depends on the area of the bheri in the larger bheries pollutants like heavy material and sewage sediment often tend to concentrate nearer to the influx points therefore distance from the influx point fig 2f was taken as a parameter of pollution susceptibility and a distance map was prepared with the help of the euclidian distance tool of arc gis the wastewater supplies considerable freshwater non saline water and other chemicals to the main feeding river this influx of freshwater and other chemicals reduces the salinity of the main feeding river which reduces the salinity of the bheri to incorporate this effect of wastewater decreasing salinity fig 2d was measured by comparing the present salinity with eight years previous salinity measured by biswas 2015 present salinity was measured with a portable water salinity meter smart sensor salinity meter ar8012 during the field investigation the salinity of both times was spatially mapped by measuring salinity at different points and calibrating it with the distance of the river since a decreasing trend of salinity with increasing distance from the main feeding river was observed in field measurement apart from that in floodplain wetlands aquatic vegetation is considered an important indicator of habitat health ndehedehe et al 2020 and plays a vital role in water purification dongsheng et al 2019 in addition in the bheries of this region a submerged floating aquatic weed belonging to the ceratophyllum genus commonly called coontail ceratophyllum demersum locally called jhanjhi grows for a considerable period of the year therefore the live biomass of this aquatic plant along with other plants was considered a parameter for assessing pollution susceptibility this plant biomass was measured with the help of field investigation and laboratory testing debanshi and pal 2022 for presenting this parameter spatially fig 2e the field measured biomass was calibrated with a few landsat satellite images of operational land imager oli series driven vegetation indices these indices were normalized difference vegetation index ndvi townshend and justice 1986 eq 1 soil adjusted vegetation

data layers the selected parameters in the present study do not influence pollution susceptibility in the same direction in such a case the inclusion of spatial data layers in the modelling process in their original form may lead to erroneous results for example higher connectivity allows free entrance of contaminated river water in the adjacent bheries and in this way increases the susceptibility to pollution on the contrary the higher concentration of aquatic vegetation helps stabilize the effect of pollution by promoting water purification dongsheng et al 2019 to avoid this inconsistency the multi directional data layers should be transformed into unidirectional basu and pal 2020 this was performed in this study by categorizing the spatial data layers into ten classes and using a 10 point scale debanshi and pal 2020 the scale points were assigned according to the degree of influence of the category and the highest influencing category was given the highest scale point 3 2 2 2 weight assigning and data layer integration like the direction of influence the degree of influence is also not uniform a weight was therefore assigned to each parameter a knowledge driven modelling approach based on analytic hierarchy process ahp roy and saha 2019 was adapted to fulfil this purpose the ahp of saaty 1980 enables the weight assignment for parameters in a semi quantitative based on the ratio scale derived from the pair wise comparison abay et al 2019 the pair wise comparison was made based on the relative importance of the parameter saaty s 9 point scale 1 9 was involved in pair wise comparison where one signifies equal importance among two parameters and nine indicates extreme importance of one parameter compared to another pal and debanshi 2018 in this way 6 6 matrix of pair wise comparison was developed to obtain the priority of the parameters table 1 from this matrix maximum and minimum index of spatial association were divided by the lowest absolute difference between all pairs of factors to calculate the predictor rating pr of all factors ghosh et al 2011 eq 7 the smallest functional weights were then used to divide all the functional predictor weights to generate an integer weight for each factor consistency ratio cr eq 8 was calculated to examine the matrix of judgments where values 0 1 indicate the limit of inconsistency althuwaynee et al 2016 once the parameter wise weight was derived the data layers were weighted and composited using weighted linear compositing wlc eq 9 technique with the help of the raster calculator tool of arc gis 7 p r a

pollution susceptibility for analyzing the spatial pattern of pollution susceptibility hot and cold spots were detected based on getis ord gi statistics das et al 2021 hot spots indicate high value clusters and cold spots indicate low value spatial clusters in the case of a high value region it was not treated as a hot spot unless it was surrounded by regions that also exhibited high value calculation of the hot spot is formulated in the following eqs 10 12 here the pollution susceptibility of the randomly selected points was considered for detecting the appearance of any part of the region that shows a hot or cold spot the arc gis v 10 3 was employed to perform the analysis here the computed z and p values indicate the statistical significance of the hot or cold spots the z value lies within 1 65 or 1 65 with a p value 0 10 the occurrence of any event becomes due to random chances on the other hand a z value 1 96 with a p value 0 05 indicates the statistical significance of the occurrence of hot or cold spots the spatial autocorrelation and moran s index of the pollution susceptibility of the same points were also calculated using the same software 10 g i j 1 n w i j x j j 1 n w i j x j x j 1 n w i j n j 1 n w i j 2 j 1 n w i j 2 n 1 s where xj is the attribute value for feature j wi j is the spatial weight between feature i and j n is equal to the total number of features 11 x j 1 n x j 12 s j 1 n x j 2 n x 2 3 3 assessing the effect on psv the effect of the pollution susceptibility on the psv of the wetlands was investigated by exploring the psv of the bheries within the aoi and comparing it with the psv of the bheries located outside the aoi and contamination zone this work was performed in two following steps 3 3 1 field survey for measuring provisioning services during the field tour before conducting measurements of wetland provisions six major types of wetland provisions were identified namely agricultural products aquacultural products cultivated fishes non cultivated indigenous fishes leafy vegetables and fuel among these wetland provisions only cultivated fishes are extracted from the bheri complex where the aoi belongs field measurement was carried out in 13 sample bheries from five different sites alongside the main contaminated river within the boundary of aoi onsite accounting of the various types of cultivated fish was done and documented for fulfilling the purpose consultation was done with the owner of the bheri or directly involved persons with the help of a questionnaire survey information regarding expenditure production feeding and medicine application were noted down for accounting in the same way the field measurement was carried out in 17 additional bheries from five different sites outside the aoi for comparison 3 3 2 comparing psv since the wetland provision of the aoi is cultivated fishes which are very much human aided it was not uniform in all bheries in order to compare the psv of the bheries of the most pollution susceptible area with the psv of the outer side bheries the average of multiple samples located nearby sites was considered the average psv of the sample sites was then plotted along with the pollution susceptibility and its parameters using kernel density estimation kde with the help of python programming language mahato and pal 2022 4 results 4 1 water quality of the river the following table table 2 contains the results of the water quality assessment along with the permissible limits of each parameter specified by the central pollution control board cpcb https cpcb nic in of india among the physical properties turbidity was found far beyond the permissible limits and in the case of ws 2 the tss was higher than the permissible limits ammonia and phenolic compounds were detected to be higher than the permissible limits among the chemical properties all the toxic substances were found below the permissible limits the bacterial property like the presence of the coliform organism was found to be 6 8 times higher than the permissible limits in the case of almost all the parameters a decreasing trend was noticed with the increasing distance from the confluence point 4 2 pollution susceptibility the following figure fig 2 portrays the spatial expression of conditioning factors of pollution susceptibility in the present area the connectivity is high in only those bheries which can take water directly from the river that is why only the bheries that lie immediately beside the main river exhibit high connectivity whereas other bheries lack direct connectivity fig 2a similarly the accessibility is high in the adjacent bheries fig 2b contrary to the connectivity here the bheries located remotely from the contaminated river do not show a lack of accessibility but lower accessibility since those bheries are connected with the contaminated river through sub channels the length of those sub channels is shown in fig 2c the map spatially shows the channelized distance of the bheries from the contaminated river as an effect of this high connectivity greater accessibility and lower length of water supplying sub channels a greater reduction of salinity can be seen in the nearer bheries to the contaminated river and this reduction is lesser in the further bheries fig 2d the live biomass of the aquatic plants of the bheries is presented in fig 2e due to the simultaneous practice of paddy cultivation and bheri culture the living plant biomass is much higher in the eastern part of the area finally the distance of different parts of the bheri from the water influx points is mapped in fig 2f the resulting pollution susceptibility of the bheries is presented in fig 3 a the weighted linear compositing score of the susceptibility varies from 1 8 to 9 8 the equal interval classification of this susceptibility reveals extreme susceptibility over 1 7 km2 areas followed by high susceptibility over 2 7 km2 moderate susceptibility was observed over 7 4 km2 fig 3b shows the association of the pollution susceptibility with the water feeding network and the sites for cross profiling the susceptibility it is quite clear from the visual impression that the susceptibility is positively associated with the main contaminated river in the bheries adjoining the river hot spots of pollution susceptibility were also observed fig 3c spatial auto correlation of the susceptibility shows a high correlation among the high value clusters fig 3d and moran s index was calculated at 0 7 here the z score of 53 37 indicates that there is less than 1 likelihood of this clustered pattern being the result of random chance the longitudinal profile of the susceptibility along the river fig 3c exhibits two peaks of susceptibility in the two main contamination points the trend of susceptibility tends to decrease downstream from the contamination zone the cross profile of the susceptibility from the river towards the farther bheries fig 3d also shows quite a similar trend that supports the result regarding the association of the contaminated river with pollution susceptibility all the cross profiles show a hike of susceptibility in the bheries near the river and its gradual falls with increasing distance in the case of profile gh the continuity of the bheri breaks after a distance which does not allow continuing the profile and its decreasing trend cannot be detected in the cases of the contaminated zone of the river and the distance areas the bheries adjacent to the river are more susceptible than the farther bheries as seen in the profile along line kl a similar trend can be seen in the profile along line mn drown over the tributary of the contaminated river 4 3 effects on psv the following kde plot fig 4 shows the variation of psv of the bheries belonging to the most pollution susceptibility zones with the outer side bheries in the bheries of this part and along with the entire complex various kinds of shrimp are cultivated like bagda shrimp tiger shrimp penaeus monodon galda shrimp lobster macrobrachium rosenbergii venami shrimp litopenaeus vannamei and other saltwater fishes like bhetki lates calcarifer bhangan labeo boga parse chelon subviridis etc are cultivated apart from these fishes a few freshwater carp type fishes like tilapia oreochromis mossambicus and seldom rui labeo rohita katla catla catla mrigel cirrhinus cirrhosus are also cultivated mainly when monsoon rainfall reduces the water salinity the production of these shrimps and fish makes the psv of the bheries a sharp decline in this psv was observed with increased susceptibility to pollution which can be witnessed in the kde plot also in most of the cases of other parameters and pollution susceptibility the bheries of the contamination neighboring zone cnz were found to form a cluster while other bheries were scattered the declining trend of psv in the neighbouring area of the contamination zone can also be noticed in the cite specific cases table 3 fig 5 graphically represents the median value quartile deviation maximum minimum whiskers and outlier of the factors of pollution susceptibility pollution susceptibility water quality parameters and psv of the case study sites of the cnz and outer parts the median psv of the bheries of the cnz was 55 lower than the bheries of the outer parts the variability of the psv of the outer parts bheries varied much more than the psv of cnz bheries noticeably the maximum psv of the cnz bheries was lower than the minimum psv of the outer parts on the contrary the median pollution susceptibility in the case of cnz was three times higher than the bheries of outer parts the inter quartile range of pollution in the cnz was also higher compared to the outer parts the factors of susceptibility were influencing water quality also the visibility of the water was higher in the outer side bheries than in neighbouring bheries this visibility was measured by vertically immersing a metal stick with an indication of scale highlighting its end with bright colour how deeper the highlighted end was visible in water was noted as visibility of the water a similar trend can be infrared for salinity also quite an identical range of salinity was observed in both types of bheri but if the distance from the main feeding river is taken into consideration the greater salinity of the outer side bheri like sample sites 9 and 10 is revealed this susceptibility was a severe impact on the salinity of bheri water fig 6 portrays the spatio seasonal distribution of salinity and its departure from the mid value of the optimum range for bagda shrimp i e the main cultivated fish of this region the range of salinity is 8 4 11 6 psu and 3 5 1 psu during pre and post monsoon seasons respectively with an average of 10 5 psu and 4 4 psu this range became 4 5 6 3 psu and 0 9 1 6 psu in pre and post monsoon of 2021 and the average dropped by more than 50 the same trend is reflected in the departure for salinity from the mid value of the optimum range the highest departure in the pre monsoon season was calculated at 11 6 psu in 2014 which presently to 15 2 psu the average of this salinity departure also increased by 60 in pre monsoon which is the principal season for bagda shrimp cultivation 5 discussion the water quality assessments revealed the potential risk of river water to the habitat health of the bheries in this region the toxic heavy metal contents and a few other water quality parameters were below the permissible limits of indian standards unlike the other studies fuentes gandara et al 2021 idrees et al 2017 afzaal et al 2022 that found an alarming concentration of heavy metals in the water bodies originated from industrial sectors however several studies arain et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 shree and nishikant 2019 whitehead et al 2019 expressed anxiety with quite a similar concentration level of heavy metals consequently this contamination driven pollution susceptibility mapping revealed a higher susceptibility in the bheries near the main contaminant channel direct connectivity and higher accessibility generally through a single drain enhance this susceptibility there are several opposite instances where washed out water from the basin area increases the risk of river water pollution ciszewski and grygar 2016 since the regular intake of water in the bheri culture is essential such susceptibility cannot be resisted the spatial mapping exhibited the decreasing trend of susceptibility with increasing distance from the main contamination river eventually in the cross sections of the susceptibility this trend was indicated this spatial distance was influencing the water quality as well for instance the higher channelized distance of the bheri from the contaminated river efficiently stabilized the floating sediment in the bed which improved the visibility to some extent the same was responsible for salinity though the entire area is fed by the same river having quite a consistent level of salinity such spatial variation arises from the height of the tide the bheries located at a higher distance from the river generally get the supply of water during spring tide but the bheries nearer to the river are inundated during neap tide also this higher frequency of tidal inundation eventually increases the river s salinity approaching bheries behind the flourishing of bheri cultivation in this region this particular contribution of the river bidyadhari has been a significant factor but with the growth and increase of urban and industrial activities in kolkata and its surrounding areas the influx of enormous freshwater kept reducing the river s salinity apart from that the bhogali khal and bhangar kata khal name of the canal are used to drain kolkata metropolitan city s stormwater to the river as a result of this mixing salinity kept reducing rapidly since 2014 this rate could be apparently computed as 0 7 psu year in the present study the susceptibility of the bheries was focused on therefore the contaminated river sometime exhibited lesser susceptibility than the adjacent bheri from such findings intaking water from the lesser susceptible parts of the river may seem safer but this is not the actual phenomenon the river is the most polluted and increases the susceptibility of the adjacent bheries with the parameters of assessing the susceptibility of bheries the susceptibility of the river was not measured accurately this susceptibility was categorized based on a relative classification that yielded a higher concentration of the area mainly located in the farther distance from the main contaminated river under lesser susceptibility this finding may seem relaxing regarding the polluting capacity of the wastewater but with the relative scale of this susceptibility the actual risk and impact cannot be predicted accurately obviously the degree of susceptibility was comparatively lesser in the distant bheries but was never safe during the field investigation this problem of wastewater contamination was reported from almost every part of the bheri complex under this hostile condition that is only getting worse each year the provisioning services of the wetland have been affected the most fig 7 presents a few glimpses of this hostility noteworthy that the bheri culture is very much dependent on humanitarian aid the psv of the bheries is determined by the expenditure on fish cultivation and the end production of fish thus the increase in expenditure or decrease in production affects the psv keeping this in mind the effect of pollution susceptibility on psv needs to be analyzed from both perspectives along with human aid the environmental optimal also plays a vital role which is becoming defunct due to the effect of this susceptibility for example the supply chain of pin larvae of the fishes to the bheri complex is significantly distracted due to the high concentration of wastewater in the river compelling the bheri cultivator to seed the artificially produced hybrid pin larvae of fishes in their bheries these pin larvae are highly sensitive to adversity and cannot endure hostile situations as a result the rate of seed failure is high which increases the expenditure on seeding in addition the cultivation of bagda shrimp demands saltwater and a regular water supply previously both demands would be met by tidal inundation but now under the hindrance on intaking the river water due to high pollution concentration both requirements are not fulfilled properly the absence of regular tidal inundation makes the bheri water anoxic very soon which is harmful to shrimp farming iber and kasan 2021 apart from that the lowering of water salinity which was observed very prominently in this study impedes the growth of the shrimp and reduces the productivity of the bheri these adverse effects are enhanced because of the absence of any alternative water source eventually considering the requirement of new tidal water for the shrimp growth bheri owners reluctantly take the river water into their bheries the do level of the river water is relatively marginal oxygen consuming elements like ammonia reduce this level and anoxia does not take long to prevail in addition since the turbidity of river water is immensely high that does not allow the water to retain its do level for a more extended period rabaey et al 2021 under such a lower level of do the higher levels of few water quality properties and toxic materials like turbidity tss ammonia and phenolic compounds than the permissible limits are capable of reducing the psv of the bheries by jeopardizing shrimp and fish cultivation zhao et al 2020 tumwesigye et al 2022 especially the concentration of ammonia a high level of which is considered severely toxic and detrimental to aquatic life zhang et al 2018 the effect of this highly contaminated ammonia rich water is often seen in the bheri culture the cultivator reported the death of many fish shrimps immediately after the contamination of river water in the bheri fig 7e and f the entire bheri complex becomes subjected to this viral disease of the shrimps due to the contagious spacing of the bheries and their interconnections through common channels the higher concentration of ammonia level is capable of enhancing this problem by attenuating the immune response of shrimp zhao et al 2020 the higher ammonia level is also harmful to the tilapia and other carp fishes under the higher ph level of the bheri tumwesigye et al 2022 the concentration limit of ammonia for long term exposure is recommended by the united state environmental protection agency us epa 2 2 mg l levit 2010 but in the present area this concentration was found far beyond that limit in the river water many of the values of other water quality indicators were seen within the permissible limits but these limits are of wastewater standards therefore these standards are not properly appropriate for aquatic biodiversity or aquaculture a healthy and productive aquatic ecosystem or aquaculture demands purer water which can never be subsidized with the contaminated water of the bidyadhari river moreover the presence of coliform in the water of the main supplying river is far more than the permissible limits in such a condition its impact on fish habitat health should be studied in detail since the bheri cultivators blame the contamination of the wastewater behind several other diseases and production fall 6 conclusion the assessment of pollution susceptibility exhibited extreme and high pollution susceptibility of adjoining bheries to the river some water quality parameters were found to be very high over the permissible limit which can cause severe damage to fish cultivation in the region the trace of heavy metals is also a concern the bacterial concentration in the river water was also found to be very high over the standard limit which may have a positive role in the viral diseases of the shrimp this pollution susceptibility was seen to diminish the psv of the bheries significantly due to the influx of wastewater the salinity of the river and the bheries which are highly essential for the cultivation of shrimps has reduced significantly the bheries located within the main contamination reach or in the neighbouring areas are suffering from lower productivity of fish therefore was recorded much lesser psv than the bheries located away from the contaminated zone the findings of this study have a broader perspective regarding wetland ecosystem service studies since the pollution oriented degradation of the wetland is a global concern nowadays the present study documented the impact of such degradation on the provisioning service of wetlands which is linked with the fishermen community in particular and the human well being as a whole hence the study serves as a knowledge addition in this regard the susceptibility mapping of this study was implemented over a smaller area considering the data availability and other such constraints assessing the susceptibility of the entire complex may yield a broader picture of this impact such a study will help to devise a sustainable management strategy for restoring the wetland and enhancing fish production the study approach explored a link between pollution susceptibility and psv in an estuarine environment this study recommends conducting similar

935,the present study attempted to investigate the impact of wastewater contamination and associated pollution on the provisioning services value psv of wetlands in a well established aquacultural complex the wastewater contamination due to the industrial and municipal pollutant carrying canals influx into the main feeding river of the complex and consequently the entire complex became subjected to pollution ammonia was found at a higher concentration than the permissible limit along with traces of heavy metals in the contaminated river the resulting pollution susceptibility was assessed and spatial mapping was done this mapping exhibited high to extreme pollution susceptibility of the river adjoining bheries embankments for the farming of shrimps and fish direct connectivity and higher accessibility to river water led to this susceptibility as a result of this susceptibility the psv of the adjoining bheries was measured at 55 lesser than the psv of the distant bheries the contamination of wastewater significantly reduced the salinity level of the water almost 50 reduction of salinity was measured in the bheri water which increased salinity s departure from the optimum range required for bagda shrimp penaeus monodon cultivation which is the main cultivated fish of this region pollution levels in the river eliminated the supply chain of pin larvae of fishes to the region which increased the production cost and reduced the psv this study documents the pollution effects on wetland provisioning services since the wetland provisions are directly linked with human well being the findings of this study may help in restoring the wetland habitat keywords wastewater contamination pollution effect salinity reduction shrimp farming and wetland provisions 1 introduction wetland is simultaneously a highly productive and vulnerable component of the environment that exhibit fundamental ecological functions and play a critical role in biodiversity and human well being hong et al 2020 besides composing unique aquatic biodiversity goswami and mukhopadhyay 2022 wetlands are highly important for their precious ecological services xu et al 2020 at the same time the degradation of wetlands through pollution with wastewater contamination is a global concern namaalwa et al 2020 it severely impacts aquatic biodiversity ecosystem service and human welfare gardner and finlayson 2018 among the sources of such pollution untreated wastewater was recognized as the most threatening because of its vast amount of nutrient and organic content collins et al 2018 un water 2021 reported that 44 of the world s household wastewater lacks proper treatment the study by wear et al 2021 showed that extensive areas 10000 km2 from different parts of the world suffer from a high level of sewage contamination the contamination hotspots overlap extensively over highly productive environments like coral reefs salt marshes and fish rich rivers mateo sagasta et al 2017 estimated annual global freshwater extraction as 3928 km3 out of which 56 2212 km3 drained into the environment as wastewater connor et al 2017 in the united nations world water development report 2017 indicated this amount 80 out of which the highest was in the world bank classified world bank 2017 low income countries like chad afghanistan ethiopia burundi etc where only 8 undergoes proper treatment on the contrary in high income countries which include countries like canada germany greece denmark etc this amount is 70 the other two groups namely lower middle income countries like india algeria bolivia cambodia etc and upper middle income countries like argentina russia south africa turkey etc accounted for 28 and 38 of the wastewater treatment though aquatic ecosystems can dilute pollutants contamination to some extent severe contamination leads to the alteration of aquatic floral and faunal species mateo sagasta et al 2017 in highly polluted wetland areas the concentration of wastewater and sewage causes the problem of eutrophication by resulting in an excessive richness of nutrients and allochthonous organic matter in the water body these cause eutrophy algae blooms critical reduction of the oxygen level of water and enhancement of bacterial action in decomposing the organic matter wear et al 2021 the lack of enough oxygen leads to a dead zone that again supplies organic matter bhat et al 2022 consequently the fish and shellfish become under stress with low or almost no oxygen mahanayak and panigrahi 2020 apart from that the algae bloom increases toxin production absorption of which by the fish community causes mass mortality bashir et al 2020 these organisms of wetland habitat are extensively consumed wetland provisions in addition the drainage of industrial and urban wastewater to the water bodies significantly increases the level of heavy metals like chromium cr cadmium cd lead pb zinc zn nickel ni copper cu mercury hg etc barakat et al 2020 these heavy metals are considered severe pollutants because of their high level of toxicity and capability of posing detrimental effects on aquatic organisms bashir et al 2020 in addition wastewater effluent contains the highest abundance of antibiotic resistant coliform bacteria lépesová 2018 that is the potential to alter the microbiome composition of the aquatic environment and increase the vulnerability to disease preuss et al 2020 therefore it can be inferred that the primary target of water pollution in the wetland habitat is aquatic biodiversity which is the primary source of wetland provision especially food provision such conflict between anthropogenic activity and wetland habitat can significantly curtail the provisioning service value psv of wetlands this issue should be studied extensively because wetland provisions are an essential commodity for human well being mea 2005 apart from that several toxic pollutants like microplastics and heavy metals are not entirely removed from water bodies thus accumulating in the reservoir magnifying the food chain and ultimately causing severe damage to human health bashir et al 2020 it insists on the utmost importance of studying the effect of pollution on wetland psv the damage to the wetland habitat and resulting reduction of psv has been a severe problem in the bheri fig 1 complex near calcutta municipal corporation cmc and the kolkata metropolitan agglomeration of eastern india the bheries are shallower ponds of various sizes located in juxtaposition to each other separated by 1 3 m embankments each having a single outlet for water entrance and exit controlled and regulated by humans many such bheries lie closely spaced in an area fed by one or two broad channels and multiple sub channels in the present region the indian part of the mature ganges delta these bheries cover 425 km2 of the area and form a bheri complex the bheri complex is inundated by regular diurnal tidal water brought by the river bidyadhari fig 1 the influx of tidal inundation has promoted the farming of various shrimps in this bheri complex though during the monsoon and post monsoon season when the salinity of tidal water is much lesser freshwater fishes are also cultivated here these bheries are owned by an individual or a group of individuals and maintained by traditionally trained persons according to the food and agricultural organization s fao definition of aquaculture which includes the farming of aquatic organisms including fish crustaceans molluscs and aquatic plants by regular stocking feeding and protecting from predators under the ownership of individual or corporate fao 1992 farming of shrimp and fish in this bheri complex can be categorized under aquaculture the shrimps are marketable goods and due to their popularity and high price the psv of these human regulated wetlands is comparatively higher than the other wetlands in the upstream of the river bidyadhari where the bheri complex is located the wastewater draining canal locally known as khal of cmc meets with the river the river also gets tannery effluents through this canal roy et al 2018 it is well documented that the tannery effluent is affluent of heavy metals yap and al mutairi 2021 several other canals like bhogali khal bhangar kata khal also carry urban sewage to the river the wastewater contamination originated pollution causes severe impact on bheri culture the contaminated water finally drains into indian sundarban part of the world s largest mangrove forest and causes environmental damage several studies rashid et al 2014 bhattacharya et al 2014 bhattacharya et al 2016 akhand et al 2016 roy et al 2018 marked the contamination in this part responsible for habitat degradation and heavy metal accumulation in the indian sundarban region but the ecological degradation of tidal bheries adjoining river bidyadhari has not been addressed so far das and dutta 2004 mentioned the ecological risk of this pollution but further investigation was not carried out the impact of pollution on the bheri complex of this region has become devastating and has recently been covered by national and international news portals mongabay 2020 the wire 2020 the local bheri owners and stakeholders blame this pollution of urban and industrial wastewater for reducing the productivity of the bheri here research gap has remained unexplored how far the pollution causes damage to psv of the human regulated wetland to address the gap the present study set multiple objectives 1 identifying the major pollutants and their effect on water quality it was done by assessing the water quality parameters and toxic substances water samples were directly collected from the wastewater canal and the main contaminated river 2 measuring the pollution susceptibility of the bheries since the bheries are connected through common channels the susceptibility should be measured spatially instead of picking up specific bheri and its spatial pattern should be studied to do so an area of interest aoi was demarcated considering the neighbouring bheries of the contamination points 3 finally investigating the impact of pollution on the psv of the wetlands the original contributions of this study from a broad scientific perspective are entrusted in the last two objectives the approach of studying the pollution susceptibility on a spatial scale especially over the water surface regulated by common channels could be applied to other regions with a similar set of discrete points of pollutants affluence analyzing the spatial pattern of pollution susceptibility may help determine the influence of contaminated parts on spreading the pollution moreover the role of pollution in regional environmental degradation is well documented still the documentation of how such a problem is connected to the economic provisions of the wetlands is presented in the study this documentation in such a region where wetland provision is directly linked to the economic enhancement of the local inhabitance will contribute to knowledge added to the scientific literature especially when the hamper of wetland ecosystem service is a global concern mea 2005 and to keep the benefits of wetlands sustainable for human well being such kind of study is required also 2 study area the bheri complex of this study belongs to the indian part of the mature ganges delta which extends from 23 4 19 n 88 29 27 e to 22 12 23 n 89 3 42 e covering more than 6000 km2 of area fig 1 the area of the bheri complex in this region is about 425 km2 which receives regular tidal inundation and is dominated by saline water since these bheries are used for farming shrimp and fish therefore are manually regulated in terms of water recharge and discharge the primary wetland provision of this complex is cultivated fish which is counted as food provision due to this intensive shrimp and fish farming a few human aided factors like external feeding expenditure etc also influence the psv of the bheri complex this region is prevailed by intense seasonality in terms of precipitation the average rainfall of the pre monsoon season covering march to april is 20 25 cm the monsoon season covering june to september is 120 145 cm the post monsoon season covering october to december is 13 19 cm and the winter season covering january to february is 3 5 cm the aoi fig 1 covers the main contamination zone where bhogali khal bhagar kata khal and cmc canal merge with the river bidyadhari and the neighbouring bheries bhogali khal and bhagar kata khal merge with the river near kulti kulti lock gate and cmc canal merges near ghusighata ghusighata sluice gate 3 methods 3 1 assessing water quality in order to understand the pollution level a water quality assessment of the wastewater bearing canal and the main contaminated river was carried out total three water samples wss one from the cmc canal 22 30 12 n 88 36 55 e ws 1 one from the confluence of cmc canal with the river 22 31 24 30 n 88 41 25 e ws 2 and one from 1 km downstream of confluence point along the contaminated river 22 31 30 n 88 42 7 e ws 3 were collected 1 5 2 l was collected as each sample in the sterilized container preserved in the refrigerator and brought to the testing laboratory within 24 hours 25 parameters of physical properties chemical properties toxicity and bacterial property were tested for each sample all the testing was carried out at the regional water testing laboratory kolkata an iso 9001 2008 certified laboratory under the ministry of micro small and medium enterprises msme of the government of india during the collection of samples all the procedures prescribed by the laboratory were followed 3 2 measuring pollution susceptibility and its spatial pattern 3 2 1 parameter selection and data layer preparation the pollution of the wetland caused by wastewater is mainly determined by its mixing thus mixing probability needed to be assessed spatially to obtain the spatial pollution susceptibility keeping this in mind in the present study six parameters that enhance or hinder this mixing of wastewater were considered the adjacent bheries of the main contaminated river segment or the bheries located in the outer parts are supplied by the river water through a network of feeding channels two parameters of network analysis called connectivity and accessibility were taken into consideration here for connectivity the direct connection of the bheri with the main contaminated channel was investigated if the bheries were getting the water supply directly from the main contaminated channel that was considered directly connected 1 on the other hand the bheries supplied water from any sub channel from the main contaminated channel that was not considered directly connected 0 in this way the connectivity of all the bheries was assigned accessibility referred to how accessible a bheri was from the main contaminated channel it was quantified based on how many sub channels were to be passed in order to reach any particular bheri in this process only those channels were recognized as sub channels that were connected to multiple bheri here accessibility was determined by carrying out manual counting and a number was assigned to each bheri the severity of many pollutants and other suspended solids reduces with their floating time the floating time of these pollutants is determined by the length of the channel that supplies water to the bheri hence the channelized distance of the bheries was measured with the help of google earth after assigning the calculated value of direct connectivity accessibility and channelized distance of all the bheries those were spatially interpolated with the help of the inverse distance weighted idw technique using the spatial analyst tool of arc gis v 10 2 fig 2 a b and c the spreading of the wastewater within the bheri once it reaches the bheri depends on the area of the bheri in the larger bheries pollutants like heavy material and sewage sediment often tend to concentrate nearer to the influx points therefore distance from the influx point fig 2f was taken as a parameter of pollution susceptibility and a distance map was prepared with the help of the euclidian distance tool of arc gis the wastewater supplies considerable freshwater non saline water and other chemicals to the main feeding river this influx of freshwater and other chemicals reduces the salinity of the main feeding river which reduces the salinity of the bheri to incorporate this effect of wastewater decreasing salinity fig 2d was measured by comparing the present salinity with eight years previous salinity measured by biswas 2015 present salinity was measured with a portable water salinity meter smart sensor salinity meter ar8012 during the field investigation the salinity of both times was spatially mapped by measuring salinity at different points and calibrating it with the distance of the river since a decreasing trend of salinity with increasing distance from the main feeding river was observed in field measurement apart from that in floodplain wetlands aquatic vegetation is considered an important indicator of habitat health ndehedehe et al 2020 and plays a vital role in water purification dongsheng et al 2019 in addition in the bheries of this region a submerged floating aquatic weed belonging to the ceratophyllum genus commonly called coontail ceratophyllum demersum locally called jhanjhi grows for a considerable period of the year therefore the live biomass of this aquatic plant along with other plants was considered a parameter for assessing pollution susceptibility this plant biomass was measured with the help of field investigation and laboratory testing debanshi and pal 2022 for presenting this parameter spatially fig 2e the field measured biomass was calibrated with a few landsat satellite images of operational land imager oli series driven vegetation indices these indices were normalized difference vegetation index ndvi townshend and justice 1986 eq 1 soil adjusted vegetation

data layers the selected parameters in the present study do not influence pollution susceptibility in the same direction in such a case the inclusion of spatial data layers in the modelling process in their original form may lead to erroneous results for example higher connectivity allows free entrance of contaminated river water in the adjacent bheries and in this way increases the susceptibility to pollution on the contrary the higher concentration of aquatic vegetation helps stabilize the effect of pollution by promoting water purification dongsheng et al 2019 to avoid this inconsistency the multi directional data layers should be transformed into unidirectional basu and pal 2020 this was performed in this study by categorizing the spatial data layers into ten classes and using a 10 point scale debanshi and pal 2020 the scale points were assigned according to the degree of influence of the category and the highest influencing category was given the highest scale point 3 2 2 2 weight assigning and data layer integration like the direction of influence the degree of influence is also not uniform a weight was therefore assigned to each parameter a knowledge driven modelling approach based on analytic hierarchy process ahp roy and saha 2019 was adapted to fulfil this purpose the ahp of saaty 1980 enables the weight assignment for parameters in a semi quantitative based on the ratio scale derived from the pair wise comparison abay et al 2019 the pair wise comparison was made based on the relative importance of the parameter saaty s 9 point scale 1 9 was involved in pair wise comparison where one signifies equal importance among two parameters and nine indicates extreme importance of one parameter compared to another pal and debanshi 2018 in this way 6 6 matrix of pair wise comparison was developed to obtain the priority of the parameters table 1 from this matrix maximum and minimum index of spatial association were divided by the lowest absolute difference between all pairs of factors to calculate the predictor rating pr of all factors ghosh et al 2011 eq 7 the smallest functional weights were then used to divide all the functional predictor weights to generate an integer weight for each factor consistency ratio cr eq 8 was calculated to examine the matrix of judgments where values 0 1 indicate the limit of inconsistency althuwaynee et al 2016 once the parameter wise weight was derived the data layers were weighted and composited using weighted linear compositing wlc eq 9 technique with the help of the raster calculator tool of arc gis 7 p r a

pollution susceptibility for analyzing the spatial pattern of pollution susceptibility hot and cold spots were detected based on getis ord gi statistics das et al 2021 hot spots indicate high value clusters and cold spots indicate low value spatial clusters in the case of a high value region it was not treated as a hot spot unless it was surrounded by regions that also exhibited high value calculation of the hot spot is formulated in the following eqs 10 12 here the pollution susceptibility of the randomly selected points was considered for detecting the appearance of any part of the region that shows a hot or cold spot the arc gis v 10 3 was employed to perform the analysis here the computed z and p values indicate the statistical significance of the hot or cold spots the z value lies within 1 65 or 1 65 with a p value 0 10 the occurrence of any event becomes due to random chances on the other hand a z value 1 96 with a p value 0 05 indicates the statistical significance of the occurrence of hot or cold spots the spatial autocorrelation and moran s index of the pollution susceptibility of the same points were also calculated using the same software 10 g i j 1 n w i j x j j 1 n w i j x j x j 1 n w i j n j 1 n w i j 2 j 1 n w i j 2 n 1 s where xj is the attribute value for feature j wi j is the spatial weight between feature i and j n is equal to the total number of features 11 x j 1 n x j 12 s j 1 n x j 2 n x 2 3 3 assessing the effect on psv the effect of the pollution susceptibility on the psv of the wetlands was investigated by exploring the psv of the bheries within the aoi and comparing it with the psv of the bheries located outside the aoi and contamination zone this work was performed in two following steps 3 3 1 field survey for measuring provisioning services during the field tour before conducting measurements of wetland provisions six major types of wetland provisions were identified namely agricultural products aquacultural products cultivated fishes non cultivated indigenous fishes leafy vegetables and fuel among these wetland provisions only cultivated fishes are extracted from the bheri complex where the aoi belongs field measurement was carried out in 13 sample bheries from five different sites alongside the main contaminated river within the boundary of aoi onsite accounting of the various types of cultivated fish was done and documented for fulfilling the purpose consultation was done with the owner of the bheri or directly involved persons with the help of a questionnaire survey information regarding expenditure production feeding and medicine application were noted down for accounting in the same way the field measurement was carried out in 17 additional bheries from five different sites outside the aoi for comparison 3 3 2 comparing psv since the wetland provision of the aoi is cultivated fishes which are very much human aided it was not uniform in all bheries in order to compare the psv of the bheries of the most pollution susceptible area with the psv of the outer side bheries the average of multiple samples located nearby sites was considered the average psv of the sample sites was then plotted along with the pollution susceptibility and its parameters using kernel density estimation kde with the help of python programming language mahato and pal 2022 4 results 4 1 water quality of the river the following table table 2 contains the results of the water quality assessment along with the permissible limits of each parameter specified by the central pollution control board cpcb https cpcb nic in of india among the physical properties turbidity was found far beyond the permissible limits and in the case of ws 2 the tss was higher than the permissible limits ammonia and phenolic compounds were detected to be higher than the permissible limits among the chemical properties all the toxic substances were found below the permissible limits the bacterial property like the presence of the coliform organism was found to be 6 8 times higher than the permissible limits in the case of almost all the parameters a decreasing trend was noticed with the increasing distance from the confluence point 4 2 pollution susceptibility the following figure fig 2 portrays the spatial expression of conditioning factors of pollution susceptibility in the present area the connectivity is high in only those bheries which can take water directly from the river that is why only the bheries that lie immediately beside the main river exhibit high connectivity whereas other bheries lack direct connectivity fig 2a similarly the accessibility is high in the adjacent bheries fig 2b contrary to the connectivity here the bheries located remotely from the contaminated river do not show a lack of accessibility but lower accessibility since those bheries are connected with the contaminated river through sub channels the length of those sub channels is shown in fig 2c the map spatially shows the channelized distance of the bheries from the contaminated river as an effect of this high connectivity greater accessibility and lower length of water supplying sub channels a greater reduction of salinity can be seen in the nearer bheries to the contaminated river and this reduction is lesser in the further bheries fig 2d the live biomass of the aquatic plants of the bheries is presented in fig 2e due to the simultaneous practice of paddy cultivation and bheri culture the living plant biomass is much higher in the eastern part of the area finally the distance of different parts of the bheri from the water influx points is mapped in fig 2f the resulting pollution susceptibility of the bheries is presented in fig 3 a the weighted linear compositing score of the susceptibility varies from 1 8 to 9 8 the equal interval classification of this susceptibility reveals extreme susceptibility over 1 7 km2 areas followed by high susceptibility over 2 7 km2 moderate susceptibility was observed over 7 4 km2 fig 3b shows the association of the pollution susceptibility with the water feeding network and the sites for cross profiling the susceptibility it is quite clear from the visual impression that the susceptibility is positively associated with the main contaminated river in the bheries adjoining the river hot spots of pollution susceptibility were also observed fig 3c spatial auto correlation of the susceptibility shows a high correlation among the high value clusters fig 3d and moran s index was calculated at 0 7 here the z score of 53 37 indicates that there is less than 1 likelihood of this clustered pattern being the result of random chance the longitudinal profile of the susceptibility along the river fig 3c exhibits two peaks of susceptibility in the two main contamination points the trend of susceptibility tends to decrease downstream from the contamination zone the cross profile of the susceptibility from the river towards the farther bheries fig 3d also shows quite a similar trend that supports the result regarding the association of the contaminated river with pollution susceptibility all the cross profiles show a hike of susceptibility in the bheries near the river and its gradual falls with increasing distance in the case of profile gh the continuity of the bheri breaks after a distance which does not allow continuing the profile and its decreasing trend cannot be detected in the cases of the contaminated zone of the river and the distance areas the bheries adjacent to the river are more susceptible than the farther bheries as seen in the profile along line kl a similar trend can be seen in the profile along line mn drown over the tributary of the contaminated river 4 3 effects on psv the following kde plot fig 4 shows the variation of psv of the bheries belonging to the most pollution susceptibility zones with the outer side bheries in the bheries of this part and along with the entire complex various kinds of shrimp are cultivated like bagda shrimp tiger shrimp penaeus monodon galda shrimp lobster macrobrachium rosenbergii venami shrimp litopenaeus vannamei and other saltwater fishes like bhetki lates calcarifer bhangan labeo boga parse chelon subviridis etc are cultivated apart from these fishes a few freshwater carp type fishes like tilapia oreochromis mossambicus and seldom rui labeo rohita katla catla catla mrigel cirrhinus cirrhosus are also cultivated mainly when monsoon rainfall reduces the water salinity the production of these shrimps and fish makes the psv of the bheries a sharp decline in this psv was observed with increased susceptibility to pollution which can be witnessed in the kde plot also in most of the cases of other parameters and pollution susceptibility the bheries of the contamination neighboring zone cnz were found to form a cluster while other bheries were scattered the declining trend of psv in the neighbouring area of the contamination zone can also be noticed in the cite specific cases table 3 fig 5 graphically represents the median value quartile deviation maximum minimum whiskers and outlier of the factors of pollution susceptibility pollution susceptibility water quality parameters and psv of the case study sites of the cnz and outer parts the median psv of the bheries of the cnz was 55 lower than the bheries of the outer parts the variability of the psv of the outer parts bheries varied much more than the psv of cnz bheries noticeably the maximum psv of the cnz bheries was lower than the minimum psv of the outer parts on the contrary the median pollution susceptibility in the case of cnz was three times higher than the bheries of outer parts the inter quartile range of pollution in the cnz was also higher compared to the outer parts the factors of susceptibility were influencing water quality also the visibility of the water was higher in the outer side bheries than in neighbouring bheries this visibility was measured by vertically immersing a metal stick with an indication of scale highlighting its end with bright colour how deeper the highlighted end was visible in water was noted as visibility of the water a similar trend can be infrared for salinity also quite an identical range of salinity was observed in both types of bheri but if the distance from the main feeding river is taken into consideration the greater salinity of the outer side bheri like sample sites 9 and 10 is revealed this susceptibility was a severe impact on the salinity of bheri water fig 6 portrays the spatio seasonal distribution of salinity and its departure from the mid value of the optimum range for bagda shrimp i e the main cultivated fish of this region the range of salinity is 8 4 11 6 psu and 3 5 1 psu during pre and post monsoon seasons respectively with an average of 10 5 psu and 4 4 psu this range became 4 5 6 3 psu and 0 9 1 6 psu in pre and post monsoon of 2021 and the average dropped by more than 50 the same trend is reflected in the departure for salinity from the mid value of the optimum range the highest departure in the pre monsoon season was calculated at 11 6 psu in 2014 which presently to 15 2 psu the average of this salinity departure also increased by 60 in pre monsoon which is the principal season for bagda shrimp cultivation 5 discussion the water quality assessments revealed the potential risk of river water to the habitat health of the bheries in this region the toxic heavy metal contents and a few other water quality parameters were below the permissible limits of indian standards unlike the other studies fuentes gandara et al 2021 idrees et al 2017 afzaal et al 2022 that found an alarming concentration of heavy metals in the water bodies originated from industrial sectors however several studies arain et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 shree and nishikant 2019 whitehead et al 2019 expressed anxiety with quite a similar concentration level of heavy metals consequently this contamination driven pollution susceptibility mapping revealed a higher susceptibility in the bheries near the main contaminant channel direct connectivity and higher accessibility generally through a single drain enhance this susceptibility there are several opposite instances where washed out water from the basin area increases the risk of river water pollution ciszewski and grygar 2016 since the regular intake of water in the bheri culture is essential such susceptibility cannot be resisted the spatial mapping exhibited the decreasing trend of susceptibility with increasing distance from the main contamination river eventually in the cross sections of the susceptibility this trend was indicated this spatial distance was influencing the water quality as well for instance the higher channelized distance of the bheri from the contaminated river efficiently stabilized the floating sediment in the bed which improved the visibility to some extent the same was responsible for salinity though the entire area is fed by the same river having quite a consistent level of salinity such spatial variation arises from the height of the tide the bheries located at a higher distance from the river generally get the supply of water during spring tide but the bheries nearer to the river are inundated during neap tide also this higher frequency of tidal inundation eventually increases the river s salinity approaching bheries behind the flourishing of bheri cultivation in this region this particular contribution of the river bidyadhari has been a significant factor but with the growth and increase of urban and industrial activities in kolkata and its surrounding areas the influx of enormous freshwater kept reducing the river s salinity apart from that the bhogali khal and bhangar kata khal name of the canal are used to drain kolkata metropolitan city s stormwater to the river as a result of this mixing salinity kept reducing rapidly since 2014 this rate could be apparently computed as 0 7 psu year in the present study the susceptibility of the bheries was focused on therefore the contaminated river sometime exhibited lesser susceptibility than the adjacent bheri from such findings intaking water from the lesser susceptible parts of the river may seem safer but this is not the actual phenomenon the river is the most polluted and increases the susceptibility of the adjacent bheries with the parameters of assessing the susceptibility of bheries the susceptibility of the river was not measured accurately this susceptibility was categorized based on a relative classification that yielded a higher concentration of the area mainly located in the farther distance from the main contaminated river under lesser susceptibility this finding may seem relaxing regarding the polluting capacity of the wastewater but with the relative scale of this susceptibility the actual risk and impact cannot be predicted accurately obviously the degree of susceptibility was comparatively lesser in the distant bheries but was never safe during the field investigation this problem of wastewater contamination was reported from almost every part of the bheri complex under this hostile condition that is only getting worse each year the provisioning services of the wetland have been affected the most fig 7 presents a few glimpses of this hostility noteworthy that the bheri culture is very much dependent on humanitarian aid the psv of the bheries is determined by the expenditure on fish cultivation and the end production of fish thus the increase in expenditure or decrease in production affects the psv keeping this in mind the effect of pollution susceptibility on psv needs to be analyzed from both perspectives along with human aid the environmental optimal also plays a vital role which is becoming defunct due to the effect of this susceptibility for example the supply chain of pin larvae of the fishes to the bheri complex is significantly distracted due to the high concentration of wastewater in the river compelling the bheri cultivator to seed the artificially produced hybrid pin larvae of fishes in their bheries these pin larvae are highly sensitive to adversity and cannot endure hostile situations as a result the rate of seed failure is high which increases the expenditure on seeding in addition the cultivation of bagda shrimp demands saltwater and a regular water supply previously both demands would be met by tidal inundation but now under the hindrance on intaking the river water due to high pollution concentration both requirements are not fulfilled properly the absence of regular tidal inundation makes the bheri water anoxic very soon which is harmful to shrimp farming iber and kasan 2021 apart from that the lowering of water salinity which was observed very prominently in this study impedes the growth of the shrimp and reduces the productivity of the bheri these adverse effects are enhanced because of the absence of any alternative water source eventually considering the requirement of new tidal water for the shrimp growth bheri owners reluctantly take the river water into their bheries the do level of the river water is relatively marginal oxygen consuming elements like ammonia reduce this level and anoxia does not take long to prevail in addition since the turbidity of river water is immensely high that does not allow the water to retain its do level for a more extended period rabaey et al 2021 under such a lower level of do the higher levels of few water quality properties and toxic materials like turbidity tss ammonia and phenolic compounds than the permissible limits are capable of reducing the psv of the bheries by jeopardizing shrimp and fish cultivation zhao et al 2020 tumwesigye et al 2022 especially the concentration of ammonia a high level of which is considered severely toxic and detrimental to aquatic life zhang et al 2018 the effect of this highly contaminated ammonia rich water is often seen in the bheri culture the cultivator reported the death of many fish shrimps immediately after the contamination of river water in the bheri fig 7e and f the entire bheri complex becomes subjected to this viral disease of the shrimps due to the contagious spacing of the bheries and their interconnections through common channels the higher concentration of ammonia level is capable of enhancing this problem by attenuating the immune response of shrimp zhao et al 2020 the higher ammonia level is also harmful to the tilapia and other carp fishes under the higher ph level of the bheri tumwesigye et al 2022 the concentration limit of ammonia for long term exposure is recommended by the united state environmental protection agency us epa 2 2 mg l levit 2010 but in the present area this concentration was found far beyond that limit in the river water many of the values of other water quality indicators were seen within the permissible limits but these limits are of wastewater standards therefore these standards are not properly appropriate for aquatic biodiversity or aquaculture a healthy and productive aquatic ecosystem or aquaculture demands purer water which can never be subsidized with the contaminated water of the bidyadhari river moreover the presence of coliform in the water of the main supplying river is far more than the permissible limits in such a condition its impact on fish habitat health should be studied in detail since the bheri cultivators blame the contamination of the wastewater behind several other diseases and production fall 6 conclusion the assessment of pollution susceptibility exhibited extreme and high pollution susceptibility of adjoining bheries to the river some water quality parameters were found to be very high over the permissible limit which can cause severe damage to fish cultivation in the region the trace of heavy metals is also a concern the bacterial concentration in the river water was also found to be very high over the standard limit which may have a positive role in the viral diseases of the shrimp this pollution susceptibility was seen to diminish the psv of the bheries significantly due to the influx of wastewater the salinity of the river and the bheries which are highly essential for the cultivation of shrimps has reduced significantly the bheries located within the main contamination reach or in the neighbouring areas are suffering from lower productivity of fish therefore was recorded much lesser psv than the bheries located away from the contaminated zone the findings of this study have a broader perspective regarding wetland ecosystem service studies since the pollution oriented degradation of the wetland is a global concern nowadays the present study documented the impact of such degradation on the provisioning service of wetlands which is linked with the fishermen community in particular and the human well being as a whole hence the study serves as a knowledge addition in this regard the susceptibility mapping of this study was implemented over a smaller area considering the data availability and other such constraints assessing the susceptibility of the entire complex may yield a broader picture of this impact such a study will help to devise a sustainable management strategy for restoring the wetland and enhancing fish production the study approach explored a link between pollution susceptibility and psv in an estuarine environment this study recommends conducting similar

936,coarse particulate organic matter cpom and large instream wood lw belong to elements transported by stream flows but their pattern of storage in nonperennial streams remains unclear especially in the relationship with living trees and shrubs living in the active channels this study evaluates the role of woody plants that occupy relatively wide active channels of nonperennial streams on the storage of cpom and lw all cpom lw and woody plants were inventoried along 18 transects in three mutually distinct reaches of intermittent streams in peloponnese greece we observed high variations of the cpom 4 85 m3 ha 15 65 m3 ha and lw volumes 1 95 m3 ha 13 35 m3 ha deposited in the studied reaches with their highest abundance in the confined reach upstream of a landslide related knickpoint woody plants were recognised as an important trapping element for cpom in the case of a sufficient frequency of shrubs and trees in the active channel which was not the case for the lowland reach with the far lowest measured basal area of the stems 1 84 m2 ha in contrast to the other reaches 9 80 m2 ha and 6 32 m2 ha a positive association was found between the basal area of the stems and the volume of cpom deposits however the importance of woody plants in lw storage was confirmed only for the transects with abundant large trees with diameters greater than 0 1 m occupying the channel the function of trees and shrubs not only as sources but also as retention elements should be carefully considered in the establishment of cpom and lw budgets in nonperennial fluvial systems keywords coarse particulate organic matter large wood channel storage semiarid nonperennial stream 1 introduction coarse particulate organic matter cpom leaves needles twigs and other organic particles larger than 1 mm in size together with large instream wood lw dead trees or their fragments with 1 m length and 0 1 m diameter belong to the elements transported by stream flows along with sediments and nutrients shumilova et al 2019 wohl et al 2019 both cpom and lw are crucial and dynamic components of healthy freshwater ecosystems surrounded by tree riparian vegetation which support biodiversity of invertebrates and fish species by providing habitats shelters or food dolloff and warren 2003 enefalk and bergman 2016 harmon et al 1986 richardson 1992 shumilova et al 2019 in particular stable lw pieces and log jams increase flow resistance and act as flow obstacles which in turn influences final channel morphology and its stability gurnell et al 2002 wilcox et al 2011 wohl and scott 2017 however small wood pieces and cpom can also have at least a temporaly effect on channel morphology and hydraulic processes mainly by decreasing the porosity of log jams or boulder steps in mountain headwater channels haga et al 2017 přibyla et al 2016 despite the existence of a direct relationship between the transport rate of cpom and discharge cpom can be mobilized even during ordinal flow conditions due to its relatively small size bunte et al 2016 iroumé et al 2020 richardson et al 2009 turowski et al 2013 on the contrary lw transport is usually strictly episodical in dependence on the dimensions of the channel the size and shape of the lw and the flow magnitude kramer and wohl 2017 ruiz villanueva et al 2016a storage and retention of cpom have been frequently investigated during the past decades primarily by field experiments based on the release of material typically leaves or small twigs into stream channels these experiments documented that during low flow conditions in channel macro roughness elements such as boulders or individual lw pieces are preferential sites of cpom storage in single thread channels while riparian vegetation or adjacent floodplain surface in general plays an important role in cpom retention during overbank flows brookshire and dwire 2003 lininger et al 2021 oelbermann and gordon 2001 small et al 2008 speaker et al 1988 for nonperennial reaches also pool habitats were identified as sinks for temporary storage of cpom and its later decomposition abril et al 2016 dieter et al 2011 the retention of lw in fluvial systems is usually related to specific sites of high roughness or the presence of flow obstacles field observations together with physical and numerical modelling demonstrated preferential deposition of mobilized lw on irregular channel banks elevated bar deposits and floodplain surface or stacking of lw by trees living in riparian corridors gurnell et al 2000 haga et al 2002 ruiz villanueva et al 2016b swanson et al 1998 this suggests a direct relation between the stream transport capacity or hydrological regime in general geomorphic structure of the channel and adjacent floodplain presence of living vegetation and the final pattern of cpom and lw storage at a reach scale however such relationships have not been complexly investigated so far in the case of dynamic single or multithread nonperennial channels despite the fact that these fluvial systems including ephemeral and intermittent watercourses occupy a large portion of the global fluvial network and act as highly vulnerable hotspots of biodiversity especially in semi arid landscapes bonada and resh 2013 borg galea et al 2019 datry et al 2014 skoulikidis et al 2017 tooth 2000 nonperennial streams are different from perennial ones by their i high annual flow variations from complete drying up to high magnitude flash flooding and ii frequent succession of herbal and tree vegetation in the active channel due to local moisture availability in contrast to surrounding landscape under semi arid climatic conditions busch et al 2020 hooke 2016 merritt 2013 tichavský et al 2020 in the context of possible biogeomorphic interactions woody plants that occupy the active channel have the potential to act as sources of organic material and at the same time as flow obstacles that trap transported cpom and lw during high flow events contributing to overall channel heterogeneity and related biodiversity in nonperennial streams dunkerley 2014 galia et al 2018 pettit et al 2006 the increasing spatial and temporal extent of regularly drying reaches is documented due to water abstraction by rising water demand for agricultural industrial urban and touristic development datry et al 2014 skoulikidis et al 2017 together with climate changes these interventions lead to alterations in cpom and lw transport storage and decomposition processes in nonperennial watercourses abril et al 2016 arroita et al 2015 as well as extension of riparian vegetation at the expense of bare surfaces within the active channels garófano gómez et al 2013 martínez fernández et al 2018 this underlines the importance of understanding complex interactions among the lw cpom and living vegetation in nonperennial fluvial systems this study aims to investigate the possible impact of living trees and shrubs in the active channel on the storage of cpom and lw under semiarid climatic conditions in the european mediterranean because of the frequent occurrence of woody plants in the active channel of nonperennial streams we hypothesise that trees and shrubs will play an important role in organic matter retention this retention pattern may differ from typical perennial streams where woody species usually occupy riparian stands i e out of channel units or eventually stable in channel landforms as islands in the case of relatively wide river channels to fulfil this task detailed field inventories were performed in three reaches of intermittent streams at different positions of the fluvial continuum namely in a steep confined reach with signs of debris flow processes in a relatively wide but still confined reach upstream of a landslide related knickpoint and in a lowland reach close to the estuary 2 methods 2 1 study area three studied reaches krathis up krathis dw and kerinitis were located in the intermittent krathis and kerinitis streams which drain the helmos mountains up to 2500 m above sea level occupying the northern part of the peloponnese peninsula greece figs 1 and 2 table 1 this area is characterised by steep slopes and deep v shaped antecedent valleys with frequent occurrence of landslides when this natural hazard is predisposed by local tectonics lithology presence of non cohesive post alpine sediments and limestone high seismicity and intensive rainfalls during winter season backert et al 2010 koukis et al 2009 zygouri and koukouvelas 2019 krathis up reach was a confined high gradient channel bed slope 12 with a relatively wide valley floor 30 m the presence of lobate morphology indicated the occurrence of occasional debris flows which are likely the main agents of sediment transport and shaping of the valley floor morphology on the basis of freely available googleearth images there has been no high magnitude debris flow event since 2003 however the frequent presence of relatively fresh nondecayed cpom deposits in the active channel suggested regular fluvial transport of organic matter during winter high flow events krathis dw reach was located upstream of a knickpoint related to the depositional area of the large tsivlos landslide a catastrophic slope collapse that dammed the whole krathis valley in 1913 zygouri and koukouvelas 2019 however based on its channel geometry and grain size parameters this relatively low energy reach bed slope 2 5 can be a representative of the channels which occasionally occur in intermountain relatively flat valleys and plateaus between mountains in this region e g stamatopoulos et al 2018 finally kerinitis reach was located in the transition zone between confined valley settings and the fan delta ca 5 km upstream of the estuary of the stream to the gulf of corinth the studied reaches had low surface flows during the field inventory early september 2021 in their main channel but both krathis and kerinitis have an intermittent flow regime with some parts completely drying in warm period owing to lacks of precipitations high evaporation rates and water abstraction for irrigation this hydrological regime is typical for the semiarid climate of the european mediterranean region characterised by dry hot summers and wet mild winters skoulikidis et al 2017 the annual average precipitation for the krathis catchment is 845 mm and the potential evapotranspiration is 850 mm tzoraki et al 2007 the closest regularly operating rainfall gauge is located in kalavryta 781 m asl ca 10 km from krathis up and krathis dw and 20 km from kerinitis see fig 1 for the location of the town kalavryta and the studied reaches annual precipitations varied between 388 1039 mm during 2017 2020 and we assume that the majority of the cpom deposits investigated in all studied reaches were the product of high runoff in january 2021 monthly precipitation exceeded 200 mm fig 3 owing to an overall low degree of decomposition of the stored leaf litter there are no regular discharge measurements in the studied streams or neighbouring catchments but a one year monitoring period close to the estuary of krathis pointed to the high ratio of maximum to minimum discharge 1 260 indicating the flashy nature of the catchment tzoraki et al 2007 this also suggests that both streams are prone to flash flood events of high magnitudes similar to other neighbouring mountain catchments in peloponnese peninsula diakakis et al 2012 the species composition of woody plants in the studied fluvial corridors as sources of lw and cpom reflected the altitude and related hydroclimatic conditions krathis up reach with the highest altitude approx 1200 m asl indicated a higher abundance of conifer trees black pine pinus nigra and greek fir abies cephalonica at the expense of broadleaf trees predominantly willow species such as salix elaeagnos and salix purpurea in the active channel willows together with the oriental plane platanus orientalis prevailed in the active channel and riparian corridor of krathis dw 730 m asl and kerinitis 90 m asl when conifers black pine were quite rare especially in the reach with the lowest altitude in addition oleanders nerium oleander spanish broom spartium junceum and african tamarisk tamarix africana with their typical multi stem shrub habitats occurred in these two reaches 2 2 field inventory in each studied reach six cross sectional transects spanning the whole active channel width i e the part of a relatively flat and regularly flooded valley floor including the main channel bare deposits and possible occurrence of secondary avulsion channels and laterally limited by slopes of adjacent hillslopes terraces or continual riparian forest were established the length of the transects varied between 20 84 m and the spacing between the subsequent transects was 35 90 m to fully cover variations in the channel geometry and vegetation canopy in the studied reaches fig 1 furthermore the positions of the transects covered gradual downstream widening of the active channel from relative confined to less confined valley settings up to the maximal channel width the lengths of the studied reaches were variable 170 450 m owing to the presence of human impact downstream of the last transect signs of gravel extraction in krathis dw and the presence of a check dam in kerinitis or by re narrowing of the active channel krathis up basic morphological units that is main channel secondary channel unvegetated sediment deposits vegetated islands and dominant surface grain size fractions sand gravel cobble boulder were mapped along each transect a ten meters wide band was established along each transect and cpom deposits lw pieces and living woody plants were inventoried within this band for the purpose of this study the cpom deposit was defined as an accumulation of transported organic material consisting of leaves needles grasses or small fragments of wood with minimal dimensions of the deposit equal to 0 1 0 1 0 05 m length x width x height see figs 2c and 2d for examples these dimensions were chosen as a compromise between the time required for data collection and the accuracy of the estimate of material deposited in the active channel we measured all three dimensions of a cpom deposit following a methodology of thevenet et al 1998 developed for wood jams then we visually estimated the porosity of the material to quantify the proportion of air with 5 accuracy and finally we calculated an approximate volume of cpom mass as its portion of the measured combination of air and wood within a deposit the minimal thresholds used for lw accounted for in this study dead tree or its fragment 0 3 m long and 0 01 m in diameter were considerably smaller than the commonly used criteria 1 m length and 0 1 m in diameter máčka et al 2011 wohl et al 2010 because we aimed to precisely quantify as much woody material as possible due to the generally limited conditions of lw supply of mediterranean nonperennial streams galia et al 2019 the length of the lw and the midlength diameter were measured to calculate the volume of the lw piece in the case of the occurrence of a complex jam consisting of lw and cpom we attempted to measure all lw pieces individually we summed the volumes of all lw pieces if more than a single lw piece is stored at a site and we assessed the total volume of lw deposit per site this implies that the lw deposit can be a representative of more clustered lw pieces as well as a single piece in the last step the total volume of cpom and lw per band area normalised as m3 ha of each cross sectional transect was calculated all stems of living woody plants i e trees and shrubs in each band with diameter 0 01 m at 0 1 m height above the ground were counted and assigned to six classes 0 01 diameter 0 02 m 0 02 diameter 0 05 m 0 05 diameter 0 1 m 0 1 diameter 0 2 m 0 2 diameter 0 3 m and 0 3 diameter 0 5 m due to the non linearity between the increasing diameter and the basal area of the stem the basal area of the representative stem was assigned for each class as the average of the basal areas covering related intervals of diameters e g for the class 0 02 0 05 m the resulting value of 0 009 m2 was obtained as the arithmetic mean of the basal areas of diameters 0 02 0 025 0 03 0 035 0 04 0 045 and 0 05 m multi stem habitats were frequent in the studied reaches due to the common occurrence of willow species oleanders or spanish broom these woody clusters were later entered into statistical analysis as the sum of basal areas of the stem obtained for all individual stems per site finally the total stem basal area per band area of each cross sectional transect normalised as m2 ha was calculated 2 3 data processing with respect to nonnormal distributions of the obtained datasets spearman rank correlation coefficients were analysed between individual cpom and lw deposits and independent environmental variables supporting their retention namely i the stem basal area ii the number of stems of living woody plants and iii the cross sectional distance from the main channel as a proxy for decrease in flow velocity and flow depth during a transport effective event by increasing distance from the main channel this analysis was performed for the entire dataset and for individual reaches separately further we applied ancova to account for variation due to reach as a random factor when we tested the environmental predictors the stem basal area and the cross sectional distance from the main channel of cpom and lw storage finally we sought differences between the volume of cpom and lw deposits trapped by living woody plants and the loose deposits spread on the bare surfaces by using the mann whitney u test the significance level was set to p 0 05 for all pairwise relationships and mutual comparisons tested 3 results 3 1 reach characteristics of cpom deposits lw and woody plants we found variations in the storage of cpom lw and the measured stem basal areas of living trees and shrubs in the studied reaches in total we measured 231 accumulations of cpom 50 in krathis up 142 in krathis dw and 39 in kerinitis and 183 lw pieces included in 125 lw deposits 13 in krathis up 60 in krathis dw and 52 in kerinitis in the surveyed 10 m wide bands covering six cross sections per reach the largest volume of cpom 15 65 m3 ha and lw 13 35 m3 ha together with the highest stem basal area 9 80 m2 ha were observed in the active channel of krathis dw figs 4a b c the headwater steep reach krathis up had the lowest volume of lw 1 95 m3 ha but the volume of cpom 5 44 m3 ha was comparable with the cpom volume measured in the lowland kerinitis reach 4 85 m3 ha kerinitis indicated the lowest stem basal area 1 84 m2 ha when compared to krathis up 6 32 m2 ha and krathis dw the volumes of individual cpom deposits were smaller in krathis up when confronted with other reaches but no notable differences among the reaches were observed in the case of the volumes of lw deposits fig 5 note the different structure of stem diameters among the reaches which directly affected the calculated stem basal areas fig 6 a higher frequency of trees with diameters greater than 0 1 m was observed in krathis dw 67 proportion of the total stem basal area when compared to other reaches 38 in kerinitis and 35 in krathis up respectively fig 6 proportions of stem basal areas by individual diameter classes in the studied reaches 4 2 storage patterns of cpom and lw in relation to living trees and shrubs the living trees and shrubs were recognised as important trapping elements of cpom in krathis dw when 87 97 of the measured cpom volume was deposited by the woody plants in local cross sections fig 7a in general trees and shrubs trapped much of cpom also in krathis up where four cross sections indicated higher than 95 cpom volume stored by woody plants the much lower importance of trees and shrubs for the storage of cpom was evident in kerinitis where half of the investigated cross sections had zero to negligible cpom storage caused by woody plants the trapping efficiency of living trees and shrubs for lw was markedly lower living woody plants acted as depositional sites for lw mainly in krathis dw when five of six cross sections indicated more than 50 of the total lw volume trapped by woody plants fig 7b low trapping efficiency was evident especially in lowland kerinitis where we found no racked lw by living trees or shrubs in four cross sections no clear conclusion can be expressed for krathis up where we found lw only in four cross sections with a high variation of trapping efficiency of living trees and shrubs in these cross sections 0 45 8 of the lw volume was stored by woody plants the overall assessment of individual cpom deposits collected in reaches indicated their significant relationships with the tested environmental factors namely the basal area of tree stems the number of stems in tree shrub clusters and the longitudinal distance from the main channel increases on the contrary we found no significant relationships between environmental variables and lw deposits volumes fig 8 the basal area of individual or clustered tree stems was positively correlated with the volume of stored cpom rsp 0 44 p 0 001 n 175 and also the number of stems in the tree shrub clusters was in direct relationship with the volume of stored cpom rsp 0 17 p 0 028 n 175 we also found a positive correlation between the distance from the main channel and the volume of cpom when this set was extended by loose deposits not trapped by woody plants rsp 0 25 p 0 0001 n 231 this implies the presence of larger deposits of cpom as the distance from the main channel increases note that the basal areas of the stems were positively correlated by the increasing distance from the main channel rsp 0 16 p 0 013 n 393 but such a positive link did not exist for the number of stems rsp 0 08 p 0 11 n 393 there was no significant relationship between the volume of lw deposits and the basal area of the stems rsp 0 15 p 0 40 n 36 or the number of stems in the clusters of woody plants rsp 0 13 p 0 44 n 36 and in the same way the distance from the main channel was not a factor controlling the volume of lw deposits rsp 0 03 p 0 74 n 125 except the pairwise spearman correlations we used ancova model to account for variation due to reach as a random factor for both cpom and lw volume none of the tested predictors the basal area of the stems and the cross sectional distance from the main channel were significant at 0 05 significance level table 2 due to the different characteristics of the studied reaches in terms of channel width and the presence of tree species we further attempted to evaluate the relationships between cpom and lw volume and environmental factors separately for individual reaches a positive significant correlation was found between the volume of cpom deposits and the stem basal area in all reaches supplementary table 1 nevertheless the number of stems was a significant driving factor of cpom storage only in the krathis up reach whereas the cross sectional distance from the main channel was not recognised as a significant factor for cpom storage in any of the studied reaches according to the compiled dataset the volume of lw deposits was not in relation to any of the environmental variables tested on the reach scale the negative relationship between the number of stems and the cross sectional distance from the main channel was found in krathis dw which pointed to the decrease of multistem habitats mainly willows oleanders and spanish broom by increasing distance from the main channel increases finally the volumes of lw deposits trapped by living woody plants were significantly larger than the loose lw deposits dispersed on the bars or in the wetted channel p 0 027 fig 9 however there was no significant difference in the volume of the cpom deposits when compared with the sizes of the deposits trapped by living woody plants and the loose deposits 4 discussion this study investigated the role of living woody plants in the storage of cpom and lw in the active channels of intermittent streams that drain semi arid mediterranean mountain landscape we confirmed the hypothesis that trees and shrubs living in the active channel are important as cpom storage elements in all three studied reach settings but lw was effectively trapped exclusively in the reach with a notably higher frequency of living trees with diameters greater than 10 cm the observed pattern of organic material storage in this fluvial system should be put in the context of the recent but most likely common hydrological situation in the case of the possible occurrence of a high magnitude hydrogeomorphic event cpom and lw can be flushed out of the channel or exported outside the channel margins wohl et al 2018 which will lead to significant decrease in the storage of cpom and lw in the channel partially this can be the case of the krathis up reach and the observed very low lw abundance in the context of mountain nonperennial streams of european mediterranean galia et al 2019 the last high magnitude debris flow process may be responsible for the breakage and possible evacuation of lw downstream from this reach although we found no evidence of such high magnitude events during the past 18 years based on googleearth images 2003 present the recovery of lw loads after the scour of debris flow can take more than 100 years may and gresswell 2003 furthermore common flood events without the participation of debris flows are usually not sufficient to transport considerable amounts of lw in headwater channels kramer and wohl 2017 which explains probable low incoming rates of lw from adjacent upstream reaches since 2003 however ordinary high flows during the winter seasons were able to transport cpom in this reach as indicated by the frequent occurrence of fresh although relatively small cpom deposits compared to the other two reaches the woody plants that occupy the active channel were responsible for the storage of the majority of cpom except kerinitis with its very low stem basal area 2 m2 ha on average typically for the channels of mediterranean environment abiotic conditions such as moisture availability and flood disturbances with usually high bedload transport rates control the specie composition frequency and characteristics of riparian assemblages garófano gómez et al 2013 stella et al 2013 these environmental factors predict the potential occurrence of vegetation in the channel and its ability to act as trapping elements for transported organic debris both cpom and lw in the studied reaches but likely do not control the overall abundance of cpom and lw in the active channel of kerinitis in this reach riparian vegetation that grows outside the channel margins or in the upstream reaches should be perceived as the most important sources of recruitment of cpom and lw stored in this reach in contrast in the other two studied reaches we found a very high proportion of cpom volume trapped by the abundant trees and shrubs in the channel this suggests some minimal critical stem basal area normalised per channel area as a threshold blockage ratio of living woody plants which can act as an effective obstruction during high flow pulses for downstream transport of cpom moreover in the case of krathis dw the frequent presence of mature trees with diameters exceeding 10 cm was important for lw storage when we found considerable volumes of lw trapped by living woody plants this underlines previous field inventories and physical models when clusters of stable trees occupying in channel elevations bars islands and channel margins act as important retention elements for lw in wide active channels of both perennial and nonperennial fluvial systems bertoldi et al 2015 galia et al 2018 jacobson et al 1999 lininger et al 2021 mao et al 2020 swanson et al 1998 furthermore we observed significantly larger volumes of lw racked by living trees and shrubs compared to the volumes of loose lw deposits by plotting the entire dataset this also pointed to the importance of woody plants on lw retention the datasets from individual reaches did not confirm that the presence of multiple stem habitats increased the trapping efficiency for cpom at the reach scale instead the basal area of the stem was significantly related to the volume of cpom deposit in all studied reaches when this variable was not always in correlation with the number of clustered stems these observations imply that trees with larger diameters are likely more important blockage elements for downstream cpom transport than flexible multistem shrub habitats which are more easily bended or even toppled during the peaks of high flow events politti et al 2018 however one should consider the spatial configuration of shrubs and trees in the active channel and the magnitude of the transport effective event for example pioneering woody plants with thinner stems occupying the positions close to the main channel can act as trapping elements for cpom during ordinal high flows whereas resistant mature trees dispersed along the entire cross section of the active channel can have greater significance during major flood events except for the magnitude of the event local geomorphic settings and long term hydroclimatic conditions dictate the storage pattern of cpom and lw in relation to living vegetation in this manner the wide valley floor of krathis dw with relatively low bed gradient 2 5 acted as a low energy system within this geomorphologically active catchment which allowed mature trees mainly oriental planes to survey in the active channel in turn these large trees controlled the frequent deposition not only of cpom but also of lw by contrast the investigated cross sections of the kerinitis reach were likely more frequently disturbed by intensive bedload transport owing to relatively higher gradient 4 and moreover lower precipitation amounts were expected due to much lower altitude this moisture gradient is quite typical of the most mountainous areas in the eastern european mediterranean where a varied distribution of precipitation from orographic enhancement was observed in the neighbouring island of crete koutroulis et al 2010 or in cyprus camera et al 2017 as suggested above these abiotic conditions dictated a significantly lower frequency of living trees and shrubs in the active channel and thus their lower relevance for the storage of organic matter in the channel the observed pattern of storage of organic material by woody plants in the active channel has strong implications for cpom and lw budgeting in widespread nonperennial fluvial systems which are typical by their spatial and temporal hydrological disconnectivities and interrupted fluxes of organic matter costigan et al 2017 skoulikidis et al 2017 as a consequence previous work documented the importance of the first flood event during a season for the increased intensity of organic material transport that had previously accumulated in the channel during a dry period brintrup et al 2019 rosado et al 2015 in this context trees and shrubs that occupy the active channel can act as damping components in nonperennial streams which have the potential to reduce downstream export of cpom and lw in the same way these living woody plants in the active channel can be perceived as temporal carbon sinks by their role as trapping elements for cpom and lw this means that the role of vegetation not only as a source but also as a retention element should be carefully considered in calculations of carbon export at the catchment scale under semiarid climatic conditions 5 conclusions nonperennial streams belong to the principal surface water bodies in semi arid regions and one of their typical features is the occurrence of living woody plants in their active channels owing to moisture availability these trees and shrubs cannot be perceived exclusively as cpom and lw recruitment sources but they also act as important retention elements for floating matter which is transported in the wet season during high flow pulses based on our detailed field inventory of intermittent streams we can conclude that living vegetation is an important trapping element for cpom in the case of a sufficient frequency of shrub and tree stems in the active channel we found a direct positive link between the basal area of the stem and the volume of cpom deposits pointing particularly to the importance of large trees in the storage of cpom at the reach scale in contrast the importance of woody plants in lw storage was confirmed only for the low energy reach with abundant large trees with diameters greater than 10 cm we call for further field monitoring of cpom and lw export and storage in nonperennial fluvial systems in relation to living vegetation as recruitment and retention agents of organic matter because the filling of this gap is crucial to particularize carbon budgets in these widespread and still extending freshwater ecosystems credit authorship contribution statement tomáš

936,coarse particulate organic matter cpom and large instream wood lw belong to elements transported by stream flows but their pattern of storage in nonperennial streams remains unclear especially in the relationship with living trees and shrubs living in the active channels this study evaluates the role of woody plants that occupy relatively wide active channels of nonperennial streams on the storage of cpom and lw all cpom lw and woody plants were inventoried along 18 transects in three mutually distinct reaches of intermittent streams in peloponnese greece we observed high variations of the cpom 4 85 m3 ha 15 65 m3 ha and lw volumes 1 95 m3 ha 13 35 m3 ha deposited in the studied reaches with their highest abundance in the confined reach upstream of a landslide related knickpoint woody plants were recognised as an important trapping element for cpom in the case of a sufficient frequency of shrubs and trees in the active channel which was not the case for the lowland reach with the far lowest measured basal area of the stems 1 84 m2 ha in contrast to the other reaches 9 80 m2 ha and 6 32 m2 ha a positive association was found between the basal area of the stems and the volume of cpom deposits however the importance of woody plants in lw storage was confirmed only for the transects with abundant large trees with diameters greater than 0 1 m occupying the channel the function of trees and shrubs not only as sources but also as retention elements should be carefully considered in the establishment of cpom and lw budgets in nonperennial fluvial systems keywords coarse particulate organic matter large wood channel storage semiarid nonperennial stream 1 introduction coarse particulate organic matter cpom leaves needles twigs and other organic particles larger than 1 mm in size together with large instream wood lw dead trees or their fragments with 1 m length and 0 1 m diameter belong to the elements transported by stream flows along with sediments and nutrients shumilova et al 2019 wohl et al 2019 both cpom and lw are crucial and dynamic components of healthy freshwater ecosystems surrounded by tree riparian vegetation which support biodiversity of invertebrates and fish species by providing habitats shelters or food dolloff and warren 2003 enefalk and bergman 2016 harmon et al 1986 richardson 1992 shumilova et al 2019 in particular stable lw pieces and log jams increase flow resistance and act as flow obstacles which in turn influences final channel morphology and its stability gurnell et al 2002 wilcox et al 2011 wohl and scott 2017 however small wood pieces and cpom can also have at least a temporaly effect on channel morphology and hydraulic processes mainly by decreasing the porosity of log jams or boulder steps in mountain headwater channels haga et al 2017 přibyla et al 2016 despite the existence of a direct relationship between the transport rate of cpom and discharge cpom can be mobilized even during ordinal flow conditions due to its relatively small size bunte et al 2016 iroumé et al 2020 richardson et al 2009 turowski et al 2013 on the contrary lw transport is usually strictly episodical in dependence on the dimensions of the channel the size and shape of the lw and the flow magnitude kramer and wohl 2017 ruiz villanueva et al 2016a storage and retention of cpom have been frequently investigated during the past decades primarily by field experiments based on the release of material typically leaves or small twigs into stream channels these experiments documented that during low flow conditions in channel macro roughness elements such as boulders or individual lw pieces are preferential sites of cpom storage in single thread channels while riparian vegetation or adjacent floodplain surface in general plays an important role in cpom retention during overbank flows brookshire and dwire 2003 lininger et al 2021 oelbermann and gordon 2001 small et al 2008 speaker et al 1988 for nonperennial reaches also pool habitats were identified as sinks for temporary storage of cpom and its later decomposition abril et al 2016 dieter et al 2011 the retention of lw in fluvial systems is usually related to specific sites of high roughness or the presence of flow obstacles field observations together with physical and numerical modelling demonstrated preferential deposition of mobilized lw on irregular channel banks elevated bar deposits and floodplain surface or stacking of lw by trees living in riparian corridors gurnell et al 2000 haga et al 2002 ruiz villanueva et al 2016b swanson et al 1998 this suggests a direct relation between the stream transport capacity or hydrological regime in general geomorphic structure of the channel and adjacent floodplain presence of living vegetation and the final pattern of cpom and lw storage at a reach scale however such relationships have not been complexly investigated so far in the case of dynamic single or multithread nonperennial channels despite the fact that these fluvial systems including ephemeral and intermittent watercourses occupy a large portion of the global fluvial network and act as highly vulnerable hotspots of biodiversity especially in semi arid landscapes bonada and resh 2013 borg galea et al 2019 datry et al 2014 skoulikidis et al 2017 tooth 2000 nonperennial streams are different from perennial ones by their i high annual flow variations from complete drying up to high magnitude flash flooding and ii frequent succession of herbal and tree vegetation in the active channel due to local moisture availability in contrast to surrounding landscape under semi arid climatic conditions busch et al 2020 hooke 2016 merritt 2013 tichavský et al 2020 in the context of possible biogeomorphic interactions woody plants that occupy the active channel have the potential to act as sources of organic material and at the same time as flow obstacles that trap transported cpom and lw during high flow events contributing to overall channel heterogeneity and related biodiversity in nonperennial streams dunkerley 2014 galia et al 2018 pettit et al 2006 the increasing spatial and temporal extent of regularly drying reaches is documented due to water abstraction by rising water demand for agricultural industrial urban and touristic development datry et al 2014 skoulikidis et al 2017 together with climate changes these interventions lead to alterations in cpom and lw transport storage and decomposition processes in nonperennial watercourses abril et al 2016 arroita et al 2015 as well as extension of riparian vegetation at the expense of bare surfaces within the active channels garófano gómez et al 2013 martínez fernández et al 2018 this underlines the importance of understanding complex interactions among the lw cpom and living vegetation in nonperennial fluvial systems this study aims to investigate the possible impact of living trees and shrubs in the active channel on the storage of cpom and lw under semiarid climatic conditions in the european mediterranean because of the frequent occurrence of woody plants in the active channel of nonperennial streams we hypothesise that trees and shrubs will play an important role in organic matter retention this retention pattern may differ from typical perennial streams where woody species usually occupy riparian stands i e out of channel units or eventually stable in channel landforms as islands in the case of relatively wide river channels to fulfil this task detailed field inventories were performed in three reaches of intermittent streams at different positions of the fluvial continuum namely in a steep confined reach with signs of debris flow processes in a relatively wide but still confined reach upstream of a landslide related knickpoint and in a lowland reach close to the estuary 2 methods 2 1 study area three studied reaches krathis up krathis dw and kerinitis were located in the intermittent krathis and kerinitis streams which drain the helmos mountains up to 2500 m above sea level occupying the northern part of the peloponnese peninsula greece figs 1 and 2 table 1 this area is characterised by steep slopes and deep v shaped antecedent valleys with frequent occurrence of landslides when this natural hazard is predisposed by local tectonics lithology presence of non cohesive post alpine sediments and limestone high seismicity and intensive rainfalls during winter season backert et al 2010 koukis et al 2009 zygouri and koukouvelas 2019 krathis up reach was a confined high gradient channel bed slope 12 with a relatively wide valley floor 30 m the presence of lobate morphology indicated the occurrence of occasional debris flows which are likely the main agents of sediment transport and shaping of the valley floor morphology on the basis of freely available googleearth images there has been no high magnitude debris flow event since 2003 however the frequent presence of relatively fresh nondecayed cpom deposits in the active channel suggested regular fluvial transport of organic matter during winter high flow events krathis dw reach was located upstream of a knickpoint related to the depositional area of the large tsivlos landslide a catastrophic slope collapse that dammed the whole krathis valley in 1913 zygouri and koukouvelas 2019 however based on its channel geometry and grain size parameters this relatively low energy reach bed slope 2 5 can be a representative of the channels which occasionally occur in intermountain relatively flat valleys and plateaus between mountains in this region e g stamatopoulos et al 2018 finally kerinitis reach was located in the transition zone between confined valley settings and the fan delta ca 5 km upstream of the estuary of the stream to the gulf of corinth the studied reaches had low surface flows during the field inventory early september 2021 in their main channel but both krathis and kerinitis have an intermittent flow regime with some parts completely drying in warm period owing to lacks of precipitations high evaporation rates and water abstraction for irrigation this hydrological regime is typical for the semiarid climate of the european mediterranean region characterised by dry hot summers and wet mild winters skoulikidis et al 2017 the annual average precipitation for the krathis catchment is 845 mm and the potential evapotranspiration is 850 mm tzoraki et al 2007 the closest regularly operating rainfall gauge is located in kalavryta 781 m asl ca 10 km from krathis up and krathis dw and 20 km from kerinitis see fig 1 for the location of the town kalavryta and the studied reaches annual precipitations varied between 388 1039 mm during 2017 2020 and we assume that the majority of the cpom deposits investigated in all studied reaches were the product of high runoff in january 2021 monthly precipitation exceeded 200 mm fig 3 owing to an overall low degree of decomposition of the stored leaf litter there are no regular discharge measurements in the studied streams or neighbouring catchments but a one year monitoring period close to the estuary of krathis pointed to the high ratio of maximum to minimum discharge 1 260 indicating the flashy nature of the catchment tzoraki et al 2007 this also suggests that both streams are prone to flash flood events of high magnitudes similar to other neighbouring mountain catchments in peloponnese peninsula diakakis et al 2012 the species composition of woody plants in the studied fluvial corridors as sources of lw and cpom reflected the altitude and related hydroclimatic conditions krathis up reach with the highest altitude approx 1200 m asl indicated a higher abundance of conifer trees black pine pinus nigra and greek fir abies cephalonica at the expense of broadleaf trees predominantly willow species such as salix elaeagnos and salix purpurea in the active channel willows together with the oriental plane platanus orientalis prevailed in the active channel and riparian corridor of krathis dw 730 m asl and kerinitis 90 m asl when conifers black pine were quite rare especially in the reach with the lowest altitude in addition oleanders nerium oleander spanish broom spartium junceum and african tamarisk tamarix africana with their typical multi stem shrub habitats occurred in these two reaches 2 2 field inventory in each studied reach six cross sectional transects spanning the whole active channel width i e the part of a relatively flat and regularly flooded valley floor including the main channel bare deposits and possible occurrence of secondary avulsion channels and laterally limited by slopes of adjacent hillslopes terraces or continual riparian forest were established the length of the transects varied between 20 84 m and the spacing between the subsequent transects was 35 90 m to fully cover variations in the channel geometry and vegetation canopy in the studied reaches fig 1 furthermore the positions of the transects covered gradual downstream widening of the active channel from relative confined to less confined valley settings up to the maximal channel width the lengths of the studied reaches were variable 170 450 m owing to the presence of human impact downstream of the last transect signs of gravel extraction in krathis dw and the presence of a check dam in kerinitis or by re narrowing of the active channel krathis up basic morphological units that is main channel secondary channel unvegetated sediment deposits vegetated islands and dominant surface grain size fractions sand gravel cobble boulder were mapped along each transect a ten meters wide band was established along each transect and cpom deposits lw pieces and living woody plants were inventoried within this band for the purpose of this study the cpom deposit was defined as an accumulation of transported organic material consisting of leaves needles grasses or small fragments of wood with minimal dimensions of the deposit equal to 0 1 0 1 0 05 m length x width x height see figs 2c and 2d for examples these dimensions were chosen as a compromise between the time required for data collection and the accuracy of the estimate of material deposited in the active channel we measured all three dimensions of a cpom deposit following a methodology of thevenet et al 1998 developed for wood jams then we visually estimated the porosity of the material to quantify the proportion of air with 5 accuracy and finally we calculated an approximate volume of cpom mass as its portion of the measured combination of air and wood within a deposit the minimal thresholds used for lw accounted for in this study dead tree or its fragment 0 3 m long and 0 01 m in diameter were considerably smaller than the commonly used criteria 1 m length and 0 1 m in diameter máčka et al 2011 wohl et al 2010 because we aimed to precisely quantify as much woody material as possible due to the generally limited conditions of lw supply of mediterranean nonperennial streams galia et al 2019 the length of the lw and the midlength diameter were measured to calculate the volume of the lw piece in the case of the occurrence of a complex jam consisting of lw and cpom we attempted to measure all lw pieces individually we summed the volumes of all lw pieces if more than a single lw piece is stored at a site and we assessed the total volume of lw deposit per site this implies that the lw deposit can be a representative of more clustered lw pieces as well as a single piece in the last step the total volume of cpom and lw per band area normalised as m3 ha of each cross sectional transect was calculated all stems of living woody plants i e trees and shrubs in each band with diameter 0 01 m at 0 1 m height above the ground were counted and assigned to six classes 0 01 diameter 0 02 m 0 02 diameter 0 05 m 0 05 diameter 0 1 m 0 1 diameter 0 2 m 0 2 diameter 0 3 m and 0 3 diameter 0 5 m due to the non linearity between the increasing diameter and the basal area of the stem the basal area of the representative stem was assigned for each class as the average of the basal areas covering related intervals of diameters e g for the class 0 02 0 05 m the resulting value of 0 009 m2 was obtained as the arithmetic mean of the basal areas of diameters 0 02 0 025 0 03 0 035 0 04 0 045 and 0 05 m multi stem habitats were frequent in the studied reaches due to the common occurrence of willow species oleanders or spanish broom these woody clusters were later entered into statistical analysis as the sum of basal areas of the stem obtained for all individual stems per site finally the total stem basal area per band area of each cross sectional transect normalised as m2 ha was calculated 2 3 data processing with respect to nonnormal distributions of the obtained datasets spearman rank correlation coefficients were analysed between individual cpom and lw deposits and independent environmental variables supporting their retention namely i the stem basal area ii the number of stems of living woody plants and iii the cross sectional distance from the main channel as a proxy for decrease in flow velocity and flow depth during a transport effective event by increasing distance from the main channel this analysis was performed for the entire dataset and for individual reaches separately further we applied ancova to account for variation due to reach as a random factor when we tested the environmental predictors the stem basal area and the cross sectional distance from the main channel of cpom and lw storage finally we sought differences between the volume of cpom and lw deposits trapped by living woody plants and the loose deposits spread on the bare surfaces by using the mann whitney u test the significance level was set to p 0 05 for all pairwise relationships and mutual comparisons tested 3 results 3 1 reach characteristics of cpom deposits lw and woody plants we found variations in the storage of cpom lw and the measured stem basal areas of living trees and shrubs in the studied reaches in total we measured 231 accumulations of cpom 50 in krathis up 142 in krathis dw and 39 in kerinitis and 183 lw pieces included in 125 lw deposits 13 in krathis up 60 in krathis dw and 52 in kerinitis in the surveyed 10 m wide bands covering six cross sections per reach the largest volume of cpom 15 65 m3 ha and lw 13 35 m3 ha together with the highest stem basal area 9 80 m2 ha were observed in the active channel of krathis dw figs 4a b c the headwater steep reach krathis up had the lowest volume of lw 1 95 m3 ha but the volume of cpom 5 44 m3 ha was comparable with the cpom volume measured in the lowland kerinitis reach 4 85 m3 ha kerinitis indicated the lowest stem basal area 1 84 m2 ha when compared to krathis up 6 32 m2 ha and krathis dw the volumes of individual cpom deposits were smaller in krathis up when confronted with other reaches but no notable differences among the reaches were observed in the case of the volumes of lw deposits fig 5 note the different structure of stem diameters among the reaches which directly affected the calculated stem basal areas fig 6 a higher frequency of trees with diameters greater than 0 1 m was observed in krathis dw 67 proportion of the total stem basal area when compared to other reaches 38 in kerinitis and 35 in krathis up respectively fig 6 proportions of stem basal areas by individual diameter classes in the studied reaches 4 2 storage patterns of cpom and lw in relation to living trees and shrubs the living trees and shrubs were recognised as important trapping elements of cpom in krathis dw when 87 97 of the measured cpom volume was deposited by the woody plants in local cross sections fig 7a in general trees and shrubs trapped much of cpom also in krathis up where four cross sections indicated higher than 95 cpom volume stored by woody plants the much lower importance of trees and shrubs for the storage of cpom was evident in kerinitis where half of the investigated cross sections had zero to negligible cpom storage caused by woody plants the trapping efficiency of living trees and shrubs for lw was markedly lower living woody plants acted as depositional sites for lw mainly in krathis dw when five of six cross sections indicated more than 50 of the total lw volume trapped by woody plants fig 7b low trapping efficiency was evident especially in lowland kerinitis where we found no racked lw by living trees or shrubs in four cross sections no clear conclusion can be expressed for krathis up where we found lw only in four cross sections with a high variation of trapping efficiency of living trees and shrubs in these cross sections 0 45 8 of the lw volume was stored by woody plants the overall assessment of individual cpom deposits collected in reaches indicated their significant relationships with the tested environmental factors namely the basal area of tree stems the number of stems in tree shrub clusters and the longitudinal distance from the main channel increases on the contrary we found no significant relationships between environmental variables and lw deposits volumes fig 8 the basal area of individual or clustered tree stems was positively correlated with the volume of stored cpom rsp 0 44 p 0 001 n 175 and also the number of stems in the tree shrub clusters was in direct relationship with the volume of stored cpom rsp 0 17 p 0 028 n 175 we also found a positive correlation between the distance from the main channel and the volume of cpom when this set was extended by loose deposits not trapped by woody plants rsp 0 25 p 0 0001 n 231 this implies the presence of larger deposits of cpom as the distance from the main channel increases note that the basal areas of the stems were positively correlated by the increasing distance from the main channel rsp 0 16 p 0 013 n 393 but such a positive link did not exist for the number of stems rsp 0 08 p 0 11 n 393 there was no significant relationship between the volume of lw deposits and the basal area of the stems rsp 0 15 p 0 40 n 36 or the number of stems in the clusters of woody plants rsp 0 13 p 0 44 n 36 and in the same way the distance from the main channel was not a factor controlling the volume of lw deposits rsp 0 03 p 0 74 n 125 except the pairwise spearman correlations we used ancova model to account for variation due to reach as a random factor for both cpom and lw volume none of the tested predictors the basal area of the stems and the cross sectional distance from the main channel were significant at 0 05 significance level table 2 due to the different characteristics of the studied reaches in terms of channel width and the presence of tree species we further attempted to evaluate the relationships between cpom and lw volume and environmental factors separately for individual reaches a positive significant correlation was found between the volume of cpom deposits and the stem basal area in all reaches supplementary table 1 nevertheless the number of stems was a significant driving factor of cpom storage only in the krathis up reach whereas the cross sectional distance from the main channel was not recognised as a significant factor for cpom storage in any of the studied reaches according to the compiled dataset the volume of lw deposits was not in relation to any of the environmental variables tested on the reach scale the negative relationship between the number of stems and the cross sectional distance from the main channel was found in krathis dw which pointed to the decrease of multistem habitats mainly willows oleanders and spanish broom by increasing distance from the main channel increases finally the volumes of lw deposits trapped by living woody plants were significantly larger than the loose lw deposits dispersed on the bars or in the wetted channel p 0 027 fig 9 however there was no significant difference in the volume of the cpom deposits when compared with the sizes of the deposits trapped by living woody plants and the loose deposits 4 discussion this study investigated the role of living woody plants in the storage of cpom and lw in the active channels of intermittent streams that drain semi arid mediterranean mountain landscape we confirmed the hypothesis that trees and shrubs living in the active channel are important as cpom storage elements in all three studied reach settings but lw was effectively trapped exclusively in the reach with a notably higher frequency of living trees with diameters greater than 10 cm the observed pattern of organic material storage in this fluvial system should be put in the context of the recent but most likely common hydrological situation in the case of the possible occurrence of a high magnitude hydrogeomorphic event cpom and lw can be flushed out of the channel or exported outside the channel margins wohl et al 2018 which will lead to significant decrease in the storage of cpom and lw in the channel partially this can be the case of the krathis up reach and the observed very low lw abundance in the context of mountain nonperennial streams of european mediterranean galia et al 2019 the last high magnitude debris flow process may be responsible for the breakage and possible evacuation of lw downstream from this reach although we found no evidence of such high magnitude events during the past 18 years based on googleearth images 2003 present the recovery of lw loads after the scour of debris flow can take more than 100 years may and gresswell 2003 furthermore common flood events without the participation of debris flows are usually not sufficient to transport considerable amounts of lw in headwater channels kramer and wohl 2017 which explains probable low incoming rates of lw from adjacent upstream reaches since 2003 however ordinary high flows during the winter seasons were able to transport cpom in this reach as indicated by the frequent occurrence of fresh although relatively small cpom deposits compared to the other two reaches the woody plants that occupy the active channel were responsible for the storage of the majority of cpom except kerinitis with its very low stem basal area 2 m2 ha on average typically for the channels of mediterranean environment abiotic conditions such as moisture availability and flood disturbances with usually high bedload transport rates control the specie composition frequency and characteristics of riparian assemblages garófano gómez et al 2013 stella et al 2013 these environmental factors predict the potential occurrence of vegetation in the channel and its ability to act as trapping elements for transported organic debris both cpom and lw in the studied reaches but likely do not control the overall abundance of cpom and lw in the active channel of kerinitis in this reach riparian vegetation that grows outside the channel margins or in the upstream reaches should be perceived as the most important sources of recruitment of cpom and lw stored in this reach in contrast in the other two studied reaches we found a very high proportion of cpom volume trapped by the abundant trees and shrubs in the channel this suggests some minimal critical stem basal area normalised per channel area as a threshold blockage ratio of living woody plants which can act as an effective obstruction during high flow pulses for downstream transport of cpom moreover in the case of krathis dw the frequent presence of mature trees with diameters exceeding 10 cm was important for lw storage when we found considerable volumes of lw trapped by living woody plants this underlines previous field inventories and physical models when clusters of stable trees occupying in channel elevations bars islands and channel margins act as important retention elements for lw in wide active channels of both perennial and nonperennial fluvial systems bertoldi et al 2015 galia et al 2018 jacobson et al 1999 lininger et al 2021 mao et al 2020 swanson et al 1998 furthermore we observed significantly larger volumes of lw racked by living trees and shrubs compared to the volumes of loose lw deposits by plotting the entire dataset this also pointed to the importance of woody plants on lw retention the datasets from individual reaches did not confirm that the presence of multiple stem habitats increased the trapping efficiency for cpom at the reach scale instead the basal area of the stem was significantly related to the volume of cpom deposit in all studied reaches when this variable was not always in correlation with the number of clustered stems these observations imply that trees with larger diameters are likely more important blockage elements for downstream cpom transport than flexible multistem shrub habitats which are more easily bended or even toppled during the peaks of high flow events politti et al 2018 however one should consider the spatial configuration of shrubs and trees in the active channel and the magnitude of the transport effective event for example pioneering woody plants with thinner stems occupying the positions close to the main channel can act as trapping elements for cpom during ordinal high flows whereas resistant mature trees dispersed along the entire cross section of the active channel can have greater significance during major flood events except for the magnitude of the event local geomorphic settings and long term hydroclimatic conditions dictate the storage pattern of cpom and lw in relation to living vegetation in this manner the wide valley floor of krathis dw with relatively low bed gradient 2 5 acted as a low energy system within this geomorphologically active catchment which allowed mature trees mainly oriental planes to survey in the active channel in turn these large trees controlled the frequent deposition not only of cpom but also of lw by contrast the investigated cross sections of the kerinitis reach were likely more frequently disturbed by intensive bedload transport owing to relatively higher gradient 4 and moreover lower precipitation amounts were expected due to much lower altitude this moisture gradient is quite typical of the most mountainous areas in the eastern european mediterranean where a varied distribution of precipitation from orographic enhancement was observed in the neighbouring island of crete koutroulis et al 2010 or in cyprus camera et al 2017 as suggested above these abiotic conditions dictated a significantly lower frequency of living trees and shrubs in the active channel and thus their lower relevance for the storage of organic matter in the channel the observed pattern of storage of organic material by woody plants in the active channel has strong implications for cpom and lw budgeting in widespread nonperennial fluvial systems which are typical by their spatial and temporal hydrological disconnectivities and interrupted fluxes of organic matter costigan et al 2017 skoulikidis et al 2017 as a consequence previous work documented the importance of the first flood event during a season for the increased intensity of organic material transport that had previously accumulated in the channel during a dry period brintrup et al 2019 rosado et al 2015 in this context trees and shrubs that occupy the active channel can act as damping components in nonperennial streams which have the potential to reduce downstream export of cpom and lw in the same way these living woody plants in the active channel can be perceived as temporal carbon sinks by their role as trapping elements for cpom and lw this means that the role of vegetation not only as a source but also as a retention element should be carefully considered in calculations of carbon export at the catchment scale under semiarid climatic conditions 5 conclusions nonperennial streams belong to the principal surface water bodies in semi arid regions and one of their typical features is the occurrence of living woody plants in their active channels owing to moisture availability these trees and shrubs cannot be perceived exclusively as cpom and lw recruitment sources but they also act as important retention elements for floating matter which is transported in the wet season during high flow pulses based on our detailed field inventory of intermittent streams we can conclude that living vegetation is an important trapping element for cpom in the case of a sufficient frequency of shrub and tree stems in the active channel we found a direct positive link between the basal area of the stem and the volume of cpom deposits pointing particularly to the importance of large trees in the storage of cpom at the reach scale in contrast the importance of woody plants in lw storage was confirmed only for the low energy reach with abundant large trees with diameters greater than 10 cm we call for further field monitoring of cpom and lw export and storage in nonperennial fluvial systems in relation to living vegetation as recruitment and retention agents of organic matter because the filling of this gap is crucial to particularize carbon budgets in these widespread and still extending freshwater ecosystems credit authorship contribution statement tomáš

937,as the inlet river of poyang lake it is important to master the source of nitrogen and phosphorus concentration in water body of le an river for the water environment safety management in poyang lake therefore this study aimed to quantify the weight of nutrient loss contribution from each sub catchment to the inlet estuary cross section a swat model was constructed to simulate total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp loss of le an river watershed in 1995 2020 a key parameter c i was proposed to quantify the contribution values and weights of the nutrient load from the sub catchment to the inlet estuary cross section and identify the crucial contribution areas the results showed that 1 the emission intensity of the tn and tp at the confluence section the le an river watershed in the past 30 years is 16 54 gg yr and 3 69 gg yr 2 nutrient losses in the watershed exhibited clear spatial variability the average intensity of tn and tp loss in the middle and downstream plains was 1 38 and 1 12 times higher than in the upstream hilly areas 3 the weight of nutrient contribution in sub catchments varied significantly in space and the tn and tp from the highest contributive sub catchment was 11 52 and 25 91 times of the lowest respectively through the analysis of contribution values sub catchments of no 15 20 and 22 were identified as the nutrient crucial areas keywords mixed hilly plain watershed non point source pollution swat contribution weights water quality management 1 introduction a series of pollution problems caused by nutrient overload is posing a serious threat to the global aquatic ecosystem albiac 2009 amin et al 2017 nie et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 zheng and liu 2013 in recent decades anthropogenic activities such as urban construction hou et al 2020 industrial and agricultural development tan et al 2011 and mineral resource exploitation leppanen et al 2017 along with rapid economic development have led to increasingly serious water environment pollution problems bachetti et al 2021 kumar et al 2021 shao et al 2006 zhao et al 2021 water pollution can be divided into point source and non point source nps pollution categorized into the way of pollution discharge zhang et al 2020a with the improvement of point source pollution control the nps pollution occupies a more dominant impact on water environment quality bai et al 2020 cai et al 2018 carkovic et al 2015 wu et al 2020 globally 30 50 of surface water bodies are polluted by nps corwin et al 1998 for example 81 and 93 of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in chinese waters originated from nps ongley et al 2010 contributing significantly to the eutrophication and subsequent deterioration of water quality in lakes such as taihu chaohu and dianchi back in the 1970s and 1980s the great lakes were already affected by nps pollution especially from agricultural surface sources epa 2003 therefore it is extremely important and relevant to determine how to effectively control nps the formation of nps pollution closely linked to processes such as rainfall water flow and sediment movement chen et al 2019 jiang et al 2018 ramos et al 2019 surface runoff formed by rainfall scouring carries pollutants into water bodies in the form of nps mijin et al 2021 ruan et al 2020 due to global climate change the frequency of terrestrial extreme weather events is gradually increasing gray 2007 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2017 which greatly expands the risk of non point source pollution current research generally shows nps pollution is mainly governed by rainfall patterns land use type and distribution and agricultural farming styles ouyang et al 2012 zhang et al 2020a among the many influencing factors spatial and temporal variability of rainfall is the main factor impacting runoff and nps pollution wang et al 2020 changes in climatic conditions such as rainfall and temperature indirectly regulated nps emission patterns by influencing species richness vegetation cover and soil erodibility garcia fayos and bochet 2009 researches indicated that climate change significantly enhanced the spatial distribution of total nitrogen and phosphorus in the basin feng and shen 2021 lee et al 2010 however the uncontrollable climate conditions make the impact of land use on nutrient loss in watershed particularly significant in investigating the impacts of different land use scenarios on nutrient loss in the watershed it was found that agricultural land contributed mainly to nps pollution wang et al 2019 it was effective in reducing nps nutrient loss to convert cropland to woodland grassland or shrubland as well as establish riparian vegetation buffers on sloping cropland chen et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 as the largest freshwater lake in china poyang lake plays an essential role in flood storage fresh water supply and global biodiversity protection gao et al 2014 jiang et al 2014 wu et al 2017 in the past few decades the eutrophication of poyang lake has gradually improved from mesotrophic to mild eutrophic wang et al 2021 as an important part of nps pollution assessment the nps load from soil erosion directly affects the water ecological safety of poyang lake jinxiang et al 2011 in the simulation of nps pollution in the agroforestry system of poyang lake the macro and micro characteristics of forest landscape vegetation are considered one of the key influencing factors lai et al 2020 compared with land use and rural domestic pollution livestock is a major source of nps nutrient loss in poyang lake area fu and kang 2012 the findings have all provided scientific support for the study of nps pollution in poyang lake basin however large scale watershed studies suffered from low precision insufficient parameters and data most studies including poyang lake focused on the impact factors of nps pollution and lacked the investigation of geomorphological factors and sensitive area classification in the watershed therefore the le an river which is more seriously polluted into poyang lake was selected as the research object to carry out the study of sensitive area of nps nutrient loss contribution the swat model was used to simulate the nps nutrient loss in le an river watershed from 1995 to 2020 the spatio temporal heterogeneity of nutrient loss was analyzed by combining the regional rainfall land use and topography in different periods based on the water quality control of the inlet estuary cross section of le an river watershed sensitive areas were identified by nutrient loss contribution values and weights the results of this study would provide a practical reference for the identification of pollution sensitive areas in the watershed and the management of water environment safety in poyang lake 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the le an river watershed lrw is located in the northeastern part of jiangxi province china between 116 50 118 25 longitude and 28 57 29 60 latitude fig 1 being located in the humid subtropical monsoon zone the watershed is continuously influenced by the east asian monsoon the watershed elevation ranges from 109 m to 1500 m and the topography is high northeast and low southwest the total length of the river is 279 km from dayu mountain of wuyuan county to yao gongdu of poyang county and the watershed area is 8376 km2 the average annual temperature is 17 c and the average annual precipitation is 1772 3 mm in the past 30 years nearly 46 of the annual total precipitation occurs from april to june during the rainy season xia et al 2014 flood peaks usually happen during the rainy season with severe flooding the watershed is mainly dominated by plains and hills with elevation below 50m the marginal part has lateritic sloping land with relative height of 20 30m and a small amount of mountainous land the major land use in the watershed is agriculture 23 and forest 69 red soil is the commonest soil type accounting for about 80 of the watershed area lan and liu 2015 the le an river watershed includes the five counties of wuyuan dexing leping wannian and poyang with a population density of about 222 people km² and a primary industry output value of 6730 million yuan per year the majority of wuyuan dexing and leping counties are agricultural areas and mostly small agricultural towns with an average population density of approximately 226 people km² wannian county is relatively well developed in terms of industry and agriculture there are both small agricultural and mining towns with a population density of about 313 people km² poyang county is a typical agricultural area with a population density of about 281 people km² there are about 94 327 hectares of arable land in the watershed including rice dominated paddy land of 76 547 hectares and wheat dominated dry land of 17 780 hectares as an essential water quality monitoring section entering poyang lake the average monthly tn in leanhekou is 2 79 mg l during 2012 2019 the monthly tn reached a maximum of 12 06 mg l in october 2013 and a minimum concentration of 0 46 mg l in august 2012 the average monthly tp from 2012 to 2019 was 0 16 mg l peaking at 1 04 mg l in october 2013 the evaluation of the watershed tp found that the percentage of water quality was equal to or worse than class vi approximately 20 overall it makes sense to quantify nps pollution in sub catchments due to the poor water quality high nutrient content and uncertainty of pollution sources 2 2 data acquisition table 1 illuminated the acquisition sources of the data used in this study monthly runoff data and monthly tn and tp data were obtained from the jiangxi provincial bureau of hydrology these data would be used to calibrate and validate the swat model the specific time range of the water quality data were shown in table 1 the china meteorological data service center and national scientific data centre of tibetan plateau provided meteorological data at 21 stations in and around the study area including daily maximum and minimum temperatures precipitation relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation which were used to build the swat weather generator database the geospatial data used for the study included digital elevation models dem the actual river network information soil types and land use patterns 90 90 m srtm shuttle radar topography mission dem in raster format sourced from the geospatial data cloud the dem was combined with the actual river network information to construct the watershed and delineate the sub catchments the 1 km resolution land use raster data were obtained from the resource and environment science and data centre of the chinese academy of sciences and classified into the standard swat land use categories soil data at a scale of 1 1 million were downloaded from the national scientific data centre of tibetan plateau which was built from the harmonized world soil database hwsd constructed by the international institute of applied systems analysis iiasa for more information on the soil database see the references fao et al 2012 hydrological data for each soil type were calculated by using the soil plant atmosphere water spaw model software and relevant empirical formulae 2 3 numerical experiment 2 3 1 swat model swat is a semi distributed continuous watershed simulator for assessing the impact of management practices and climate on watershed flows soil erosion and nutrient loss dile et al 2016 hann and williams 1978 neitsch et al 2011 the watershed is divided into sub catchments which are further classified into hydrological response units hrus in this study based on the software of arcgis10 2 and arcswat 2012 version the le an river watershed was constructed using dem and actual river network shapefile the threshold value of watershed contribution area was set to 200 km2 based on the deterministic eight neighbor algorithm we divide the le an river watershed into 27 sub catchments the sub catchments were further subdivided into 184 hydrologic research unit hru in accordance with the reclassified land use soil type and slope thresholds set at 15 15 and 20 respectively fig 2 the rainfall ground temperature wind speed and relative humidity were obtained from daily measurements at 21 meteorological stations table s1 while the solar radiation is simulated by the weather generator the above meteorological data were input into swat to complete the final model construction the hydrological processes simulated by swat is divided into the hydrological cycle and the confluence process the hydrological cycle process is based on the water balance equation osei et al 2019 1 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw where s w t mm is the final soil water content at time t day s w 0 mm is the initial soil water content on day i and r day mm q surf mm e a mm w seep mm and q gw mm are the amount of precipitation surface runoff evapotranspiration percolation and return flow or base flow on day i respectively the soil conservation service scs model provided a consistent basis for estimating the volumes of runoff under various land uses and soil types therefore in swat the scs curve number method was applied to estimate surface runoff eqs 2 2 q s u r f r day i a 2 r day i a s where i a mm is the initial loss i e the rainfall loss before surface runoff is generated and s mm is the potential maximum retention in the watershed the cn value reflects the precipitation watershed characteristics and is the combination of factors such as soil moisture slope land use practices and soil type status 3 s 25 4 1000 cn 10 the determination coefficient r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient e n s and the relative error r e are chosen as the criteria for the accuracy evaluation of the swat model the calculation formulas are as follows eqs 4 5 and 6 freer et al 1996 4 r 2 i 1 n o i o m i m i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n m i m 2 2 5 e n s 1 i 1 n o i m i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 6 r e

2 3 2 numerical calculation scheme the process of watershed yield and sink was simulated for the period 1990 2020 with inputs of dem land use soil type and meteorological data the warm up time was 5 years and the scale of the simulation was monthly the outputs file swatoutput was obtained after the model has been run the hru sub and rch in swatoutput were the main outputs that contain the nutrient rainfall and soil loss data for the research due to the review of the draft regulation of poyang lake eco economic zone environmental protection in 2011 and its subsequent implementation this is the time point to explore the characteristics of nps nutrient loss changes before and after the implementation of the regulation 2 3 3 weighting calculation to quantify the contribution of each sub catchments to the tn and tp fluxes at the export section we defined the parameter c i to calculate the corresponding contribution weights 7 c i t i s i a i r i where c i is the contribution of sub catchment to the nutrient flux at the export section t i is pollution load per unit area for tn or tp in the sub catchment pre 2011 or post 2011 s i is the area of the sub catchment a i is the area covered by agricultural land in the sub catchment r i is the effective transport distance of the pollutant which is defined by eq 8 8 r i l i k c i where l i is the river length from each sub catchment to the export section k c i is the pollutant transfer coefficient of the sub catchment the pollutant transfer coefficient k c i of each sub catchment is the multiple of the pollutant transfer coefficient k c in every sub catchment that it flows through 9 k c r i c h o u t r i c h i n where r i c h o u t is the nutrient output from the river section and r i c h i n is the nutrient input from the river section 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation of the model a warm up period of 5 years 1990 1994 and a simulation period of 1995 2020 were set for the model monthly streamflow data from three stations shizhenjie calibration period 1995 2004 validation period 2005 2012 leanhekou calibration period 2002 2006 validation period 2007 2012 and hushan calibration period 2012 2016 validation period 2017 2019 were used to calibrate and validate the runoff volumes monthly tn and tp data from the leanhekou were taken for water quality calibration and validation when r 2 0 6 and e n s 0 5 indicates acceptably results together with satisfactory simulation results if r e 25 for runoff and r e 40 for pollutants niraula et al 2012 fig 3 and fig s1 showed the calibration and validation results of these three stations during the calibration and verification of the model r 2 and e n s for runoff were 0 75 at all three stations although the validation results were poorer at leanhekou with r e of 32 during calibration and validation of nutrients r 2 and e n s were both 0 65 and r e 40 the calibration and validation results of this study were similar to previous findings in the meijiang river basin lai et al 2020 consequently the calibration model was considered acceptable and suitable for further use in this study 3 2 dynamics of nutrient fluxes at the export section based on the numerical simulation the total nutrient discharge from the le an river watershed to the inlet estuary cross section the target cross section of the rao river during 1995 2020 was calculated and the results were shown in fig 4 the annual average values of tn and tp transported by the le an river watershed to the inlet estuary cross section from 1995 to 2020 were 16 54 gg and 3 69 gg which were consistent with the value in some previous studies hong et al 2012 liu et al 2012 peng et al 2018 the tn flood season load was about 10 43 gg yr an increase of 70 9 over the dry season with a mean rtn of 2 18 the average annual fluxes of tp in flood and dry seasons were 2 21 gg and 1 48 gg respectively with a mean rtp of 1 91 this indicated that seasonal variability in precipitation led to significant seasonal changes in nutrient losses in the watershed yang et al 2012 zhang et al 2020b from 1995 2010 the 16 year tn and tp fluxes were 16 68 gg yr and 3 75 gg yr respectively in 2011 2020 the tn and tp entering the inlet estuary cross section stood at 16 30 gg a and 3 60 gg a respectively decreasing by an average of 0 38 gg a and 0 15 gg a from 1995 2010 this may be the result of the growth in the arable land area caused by the population expansion of the watershed during 1995 2010 led to the increase in fertilizer application meanwhile the imperfect sewage system also caused the nps of rural domestic sewage and livestock breeding wastewater with the drafting and implementation of the regulations of poyang lake eco economic zone environmental protection in 2011 the strict pollutant control measurements and the implementation of soil testing technology reduced the amount of fertilizer applied and thus decreased nps pollution at the source compared to 1995 2010 tn and tp fluxes in the 2011 2020 flood season decreased by 18 9 gg and 0 39 gg and reduced 11 compared to the average annual nutrient load of 26 years the mean values of tn and tp in the dry season were 7 04 gg yr and 1 63 gg yr respectively which were 1 27 and 1 18 times higher than those in 1995 2010 this further indicated the seasonal variation in nutrient loss of the watershed overall tn and tp fluxes decreased by an average of 2 3 and 4 0 after 2011 which indicated that pollution control measures may have a positive effect on the reduction of nutrient loss in the watershed from the pre 2011 to the post 2011 period nutrient fluxes decreased appreciably in the flood season and increased slightly in the dry season the reason for this difference may be that the average annual flood season precipitation after 2011 was 3 6 higher than the pre 2011 period although the increase in precipitation exacerbated soil nutrient loss from surface runoff the sudden influx of water enhanced the dilution and self purification of pollutants by the water body in addition more precise agricultural management practices such as tillage and fertilizer application after 2011 in turn decreased the nutrient load of the soil at the source despite low farming activities during the dry season increased precipitation in 2011 2020 dry season may allow for slightly higher nutrient fluxes 3 3 spatial distribution of nutrient loads in watershed nps pollution exhibits strong spatial differentiation due to the rainfall distribution land use patterns soil type and topography of the catchment shu et al 2021 in this research we defined the topographic uniformity t i 0 5 p s p s h s and the plains coverage θ i p s p s h s to quantify watershed topographic discrepancies where p s and h s denote the area of the plains and hills in the sub catchment respectively as shown in fig 2 e the topographic landscape of the sub catchments differed greatly and the percentage of sub catchments dominated by plains or hills was as high as 67 the hilly areas were primarily located in the upper and middle parts of the watershed and on the edges while the plain areas were closer to the downstream part of the watershed in 1995 2020 the average annual loss intensity of tn and tp in the watershed was 17 7 kg ha and 2 8 kg ha which was comparable to the results of liu et al in the danjiangkou watershed where the tn and tp loss intensity was 16 2 kg ha and 1 6 kg ha respectively liu et al 2012 simulation of the spatial distribution of nutrient losses is important for watershed water environment management as shown in fig 5 c d there existed spatial heterogeneity in the loss intensity of tn and tp in the catchments the tn loss in the upstream area of the watershed sub catchments 1 10 was approximately 0 58 folds higher than that in the middle and downstream areas with loss intensity ranging from 320 50 kg ha to 558 86 kg ha the highest tn loss intensity in the middle and downstream regions was in sub catchments 15 20 21 22 and 23 ranging from 731 34 kg ha to 766 47 kg ha due to the chemical inactivity and easy adsorption on the soil surface of phosphorus the distribution of tp loss intensity coincided with that of soil loss fig 5 the regions with high intensity of tp loss were the middle and downstream sub catchments 13 15 20 21 23 and 27 with intensity ranging from 97 32 kg ha to 104 81 kg ha and the intensity of tp loss in the upstream was 0 51 times that in the middle and downstream regions and the loss distribution was similar to that of tn the areas with high nutrient losses were mainly concentrated in the cultivated land and urban construction land in the middle and downstream of the watershed where the slope is low frequent farming activities rural livelihood and livestock exacerbate nps nutrient loss hua et al 2019 this illustrated that the type of land use soil type and topography were the dominant factors in the spatial variation of nutrient loss the sub catchments 15 20 21 and 22 have slopes mostly less than 15 and are dominated by arable land in terms of land use cover type besides rice soil is the dominant soil type in these sub catchments where the clay composition characteristic of 29 makes it less capable of retaining nutrients compared to red soil and more susceptible to nps nutrient loss due to soil erosion on the other hand the high cover of forest and percentage of clay soil composition effectively prevent soil erosion in upstream areas where slopes are mainly greater than 15 that aggravated the spatial variability of nutrient loss in the watershed 3 4 nutrient loads contribution of sub catchments to export section influenced by multiple factors such as topography water retention and channel length there was a clear spatial variability in the nutrient contribution of tn and tp loss from sub catchments to the inlet estuary cross section to quantify this contribution the weight of nutrient loss in the sub catchment was calculated by the parameter c i as shown in fig 6 c sub catchment 22 had the highest contribution weights for both tn and tp from 1995 to 2020 with 10 71 and 11 92 respectively the tn and tp contribution weights were 11 52 and 25 91 times higher than the minimum respectively in 1995 2011 the tn contribution sever was sub catchments 15 22 and 23 with weights of 11 07 9 68 and 9 24 respectively the tp contributions sever were sub catchments 15 19 20 22 and 23 with weights of 11 81 8 73 7 85 11 32 and 8 50 respectively this showed that the sub catchments with high contribution were mainly concentrated in the middle and downstream regions of the watershed and the closer to the outlet of the watershed the higher weight of contribution it has been studied that the farther the nps pollutant from receiving water body the lower the final discharge to the water shi et al 2020 moreover agricultural cultivation and fertilization activities in the middle and downstream plains superimposed on natural conditions such as precipitation and slope led to a higher degree of nps nutrient loss than in the upstream area therefore it can be concluded that the distance index and quantity of nutrient loss were the major factors affecting the sub catchments contribution to the nutrient load of the target cross section of the rao river similar findings were observed on the bahe river basin nie et al 2019 they found that the closer to the downstream urban area of the river the larger the area of high risk nps from 2011 to 2020 the tn contribution sever was sub catchment 22 with a reduced contribution value of 6 49 compared to pre 2011 and the weight was 12 08 comparing fig 6 a1 and a2 it can be seen that the degree of tn contribution in sub catchments 15 and 23 changed from sever to very high and the contribution values were 0 58 times and 0 66 times of the 1995 2010 period respectively in comparison with 1995 2010 the sub catchments of tp contribution sever changed from 15 19 20 22 and 23 to 15 20 and 22 the contribution weights of sub catchments 15 20 and 22 were 8 62 9 42 and 12 08 with the contribution values reducing by 44 50 17 07 and 20 66 respectively the tp contribution values of sub catchments 19 and 23 were decreased by 31 46 and 39 85 respectively and the contribution level changed from sever to very high comparing the nutrient contribution of the sub catchments to the inlet estuary cross section between the two periods all 26 sub catchments showed different degrees of reduction except for the growth of sub catchment 12 this indicated that the implementation of the policy and pollutant control may positively decrease the amount of nps nutrient loss to the river as the dexing copper mine and the other pb zn mines are located in sub catchment 12 the gradual release of high soil background values resulting from mine contamination under rainfall washout led to a slight increase in the contribution value in addition it is not surprising that the region s unique topography climatic conditions agricultural cultivation practices and urbanization rates caused different levels of contribution decreases in sub catchments 4 conclusion in this study the dynamic processes of nutrient pollution production in the le an river watershed a typical mixed hilly plain watershed over the last 30 years were inversely simulated by the swat further nutrient load contribution values and weights of sub catchments to the inlet estuary cross section was quantify the results showed that there were significant annual fluctuations in the contribution of nutrients from the le an river watershed to the inlet estuary cross section during 1995 2020 with contribution loads of 16 54 gg a and 3 69 gg a for tn and tp the average loss intensity of tn and tp in the sub catchment near the downstream plain area of the watershed was 1 38 and 1 12 times higher than that in the upstream hilly area due to topography and distance the nutrient contribution of sub catchments to the inlet estuary cross section differed in space in 1995 2020 the highest contribution weight of tn and tp sub catchment 22 was 11 52 and 25 91 times of the lowest by comparing the contribution between the two periods it can be identified that sub catchments 15 20 and 22 were sensitive areas for nutrient loss to the inlet estuary cross section and follow up measures should be taken to curtail the pollutants the results of this study provided a methodological system for the delineation of key areas of nutrient loss control identification in the le an river watershed and its sub catchment a theoretical reference framework was provided to future researchers conducting quantitative traceability studies of nutrient loads in such small watersheds management issues such as fertilizer use and vegetation interception should be considered in the subsequent model optimization in addition the influence of climatic conditions and land use on nutrient loss in the watershed will be an enhanced target in subsequent studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

937,as the inlet river of poyang lake it is important to master the source of nitrogen and phosphorus concentration in water body of le an river for the water environment safety management in poyang lake therefore this study aimed to quantify the weight of nutrient loss contribution from each sub catchment to the inlet estuary cross section a swat model was constructed to simulate total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp loss of le an river watershed in 1995 2020 a key parameter c i was proposed to quantify the contribution values and weights of the nutrient load from the sub catchment to the inlet estuary cross section and identify the crucial contribution areas the results showed that 1 the emission intensity of the tn and tp at the confluence section the le an river watershed in the past 30 years is 16 54 gg yr and 3 69 gg yr 2 nutrient losses in the watershed exhibited clear spatial variability the average intensity of tn and tp loss in the middle and downstream plains was 1 38 and 1 12 times higher than in the upstream hilly areas 3 the weight of nutrient contribution in sub catchments varied significantly in space and the tn and tp from the highest contributive sub catchment was 11 52 and 25 91 times of the lowest respectively through the analysis of contribution values sub catchments of no 15 20 and 22 were identified as the nutrient crucial areas keywords

cai et al 2018 carkovic et al 2015 wu et al 2020 globally 30 50 of surface water bodies are polluted by nps corwin et al 1998 for example 81 and 93 of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in chinese waters originated from nps ongley et al 2010 contributing significantly to the eutrophication and subsequent deterioration of water quality in lakes such as taihu chaohu and dianchi back in the 1970s

increasing gray 2007 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2017 which greatly expands the risk of non point source pollution current research generally shows nps pollution is mainly governed by rainfall patterns land use type and distribution and agricultural farming styles ouyang et al 2012 zhang et al 2020a among the many influencing factors spatial and temporal variability of rainfall is the main factor impacting runoff and nps pollution wang et al 2020 changes in climatic conditions such as rainfall and temperature indirectly regulated nps emission patterns by influencing species richness vegetation cover and soil erodibility garcia fayos and bochet 2009 researches indicated that climate change significantly enhanced the spatial distribution of total nitrogen and phosphorus in the basin feng and shen 2021 lee et al 2010 however the uncontrollable climate conditions make the impact of land use on nutrient loss in watershed particularly significant in investigating the impacts of different land use scenarios on nutrient loss in the watershed it was found that agricultural land contributed mainly to nps pollution wang et al 2019 it was effective in reducing nps nutrient loss to convert cropland to woodland grassland or shrubland as well as establish riparian vegetation buffers on sloping cropland chen et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 as the largest freshwater lake in china poyang lake plays an essential role in flood storage fresh water supply and global biodiversity protection gao et al 2014 jiang et al 2014 wu et al 2017 in the past few decades the eutrophication of poyang lake has gradually improved from mesotrophic to mild eutrophic wang et al 2021 as an important part of nps pollution assessment the nps load from soil erosion directly affects the water ecological safety of poyang lake jinxiang et al 2011 in the simulation of nps pollution in the agroforestry system of poyang lake the macro and micro characteristics of forest landscape vegetation are considered one of the key influencing factors lai et al 2020 compared with land use and rural domestic pollution livestock is a major source of nps nutrient loss in poyang lake area fu and kang 2012 the findings have all provided scientific support for the study of nps pollution in poyang lake basin however large scale watershed studies suffered from low precision insufficient parameters and data most studies including poyang lake focused on the impact factors of nps pollution and lacked the investigation of geomorphological factors and sensitive area classification in the watershed therefore the le an river which is more seriously polluted into poyang lake was selected as the research object to carry out the study of sensitive area of nps nutrient loss contribution the swat model was used to simulate the nps nutrient loss in le an river watershed from 1995 to 2020 the spatio temporal heterogeneity of nutrient loss was analyzed by combining the regional rainfall land use and topography in different periods based on the water quality control of the inlet estuary cross section of le an river watershed sensitive areas were identified by nutrient loss contribution values and weights the results of this study would provide a practical reference for the identification of pollution sensitive areas in the watershed and the management of water environment safety in poyang lake 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the le an river watershed lrw is located in the northeastern part of jiangxi province china between 116 50 118 25 longitude and 28 57 29 60 latitude fig 1 being located in the humid subtropical monsoon zone the watershed is continuously influenced by the east asian monsoon the watershed elevation ranges from 109 m to 1500 m and the topography is high northeast and low southwest the total length of the river is 279 km from dayu mountain of wuyuan county to yao gongdu of poyang county and the watershed area is 8376 km2 the average annual temperature is 17 c and the average annual precipitation is 1772 3 mm in the past 30 years nearly 46 of the annual total precipitation occurs from april to june during the rainy season xia et al 2014 flood peaks usually happen during the rainy season with severe flooding the watershed is mainly dominated by plains and hills with elevation below 50m the marginal part has lateritic sloping land with relative height of 20 30m and a small amount of mountainous land the major land use in the watershed is agriculture 23 and forest 69 red soil is the commonest soil type accounting for about 80 of the watershed area lan and liu 2015 the le an river watershed includes the five counties of wuyuan dexing leping wannian and poyang with a population density of about 222 people km² and a primary industry output value of 6730 million yuan per year the majority of wuyuan dexing and leping counties are agricultural areas and mostly small agricultural towns with an average population density of approximately 226 people km² wannian county is relatively well developed in terms of industry and agriculture there are both small agricultural and mining towns with a population density of about 313 people km² poyang county is a typical agricultural area with a population density of about 281 people km² there are about 94 327 hectares of arable land in the watershed including rice dominated paddy land of 76 547 hectares and wheat dominated dry land of 17 780 hectares as an essential water quality monitoring section entering poyang lake the average monthly tn in leanhekou is 2 79 mg l during 2012 2019 the monthly tn reached a maximum of 12 06 mg l in october 2013 and a minimum concentration of 0 46 mg l in august 2012 the average monthly tp from 2012 to 2019 was 0 16 mg l peaking at 1 04 mg l in october 2013 the evaluation of the watershed tp found that the percentage of water quality was equal to or worse than class vi approximately 20 overall it makes sense to quantify nps pollution in sub catchments due to the poor water quality high nutrient content and uncertainty of pollution sources 2 2 data acquisition table 1 illuminated the acquisition sources of the data used in this study monthly runoff data and monthly tn and tp data were obtained from the jiangxi provincial bureau of hydrology these data would be used to calibrate and validate the swat model the specific time range of the water quality data were shown in table 1 the china meteorological data service center and national scientific data centre of tibetan plateau provided meteorological data at 21 stations in and around the study area including daily maximum and minimum temperatures precipitation relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation which were used to build the swat weather generator database the geospatial data used for the study included digital elevation models dem the actual river network information soil types and land use patterns 90 90 m srtm shuttle radar topography mission dem in raster format sourced from the geospatial data cloud the dem was combined with the actual river network information to construct the watershed and delineate the sub catchments the 1 km resolution land use raster data were obtained from the resource and environment science and data centre of the chinese academy of sciences and classified into the standard swat land use categories soil data at a scale of 1 1 million were downloaded from the national scientific data centre of tibetan plateau which was built from the harmonized world soil database hwsd constructed by the international institute of applied systems analysis iiasa for more information on the soil database see the references fao et al 2012 hydrological data for each soil type were calculated by using the soil plant atmosphere water spaw model software and relevant empirical formulae 2 3 numerical experiment 2 3 1 swat model swat is a semi distributed continuous watershed simulator for assessing the impact of management practices and climate on watershed flows soil erosion and nutrient loss dile et al 2016 hann and williams 1978 neitsch et al 2011 the watershed is divided into sub catchments which are further classified into hydrological response units hrus in this study based on the software of arcgis10 2 and arcswat 2012 version the le an river watershed was constructed using dem and actual river network shapefile the threshold value of watershed contribution area was set to 200 km2 based on the deterministic eight neighbor algorithm we divide the le an river watershed into 27 sub catchments the sub catchments were further subdivided into 184 hydrologic research unit hru in accordance with the reclassified land use soil type and slope thresholds set at 15 15 and 20 respectively fig 2 the rainfall ground temperature wind speed and relative humidity were obtained from daily measurements at 21 meteorological stations table s1 while the solar radiation is simulated by the weather generator the above meteorological data were input into swat to complete the final model construction the hydrological processes simulated by swat is divided into the hydrological cycle and the confluence process the hydrological cycle process is based on the water balance equation osei et al 2019 1 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw where s w t mm is the final soil water content at time t day s w 0 mm is the initial soil water content on day i and r day mm q surf mm e a mm w seep mm and q gw mm are the amount of precipitation surface runoff evapotranspiration percolation and return flow or base flow on day i respectively the soil conservation service scs model provided a consistent basis for estimating the volumes of runoff under various land uses and soil types therefore in swat the scs curve number method was applied to estimate surface runoff eqs 2 2 q s u r f r day i a 2 r day i a s where i a mm is the initial loss i e the rainfall loss before surface runoff is generated and s mm is the potential maximum retention in the watershed the cn value reflects the precipitation watershed characteristics and is the combination of factors such as soil moisture slope land use practices and soil type status 3 s 25 4 1000 cn 10 the determination coefficient r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient e n s and the relative error r e are chosen as the criteria for the accuracy evaluation of the swat model the calculation formulas are as follows eqs 4 5 and 6 freer et al 1996 4 r 2 i 1 n o i o m i m i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n m i m 2 2 5 e n s 1 i 1 n o i m i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 6 r e

2 3 2 numerical calculation scheme the process of watershed yield and sink was simulated for the period 1990 2020 with inputs of dem land use soil type and meteorological data the warm up time was 5 years and the scale of the simulation was monthly the outputs file swatoutput was obtained after the model has been run the hru sub and rch in swatoutput were the main outputs that contain the nutrient rainfall and soil loss data for the research due to the review of the draft regulation of poyang lake eco economic zone environmental protection in 2011 and its subsequent implementation this is the time point to explore the characteristics of nps nutrient loss changes before and after the implementation of the regulation 2 3 3 weighting calculation to quantify the contribution of each sub catchments to the tn and tp fluxes at the export section we defined the parameter c i to calculate the corresponding contribution weights 7 c i t i s i a i r i where c i is the contribution of sub catchment to the nutrient flux at the export section t i is pollution load per unit area for tn or tp in the sub catchment pre 2011 or post 2011 s i is the area of the sub catchment a i is the area covered by agricultural land in the sub catchment r i is the effective transport distance of the pollutant which is defined by eq 8 8 r i l i k c i where l i is the river length from each sub catchment to the export section k c i is the pollutant transfer coefficient of the sub catchment the pollutant transfer coefficient k c i of each sub catchment is the multiple of the pollutant transfer coefficient k c in every sub catchment that it flows through 9 k c r i c h o u t r i c h i n where r i c h o u t is the nutrient output from the river section and r i c h i n is the nutrient input from the river section 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation of the model a warm up period of 5 years 1990 1994 and a simulation period of 1995 2020 were set for the model monthly streamflow data from three stations shizhenjie calibration period 1995 2004 validation period 2005 2012 leanhekou calibration period 2002 2006 validation period 2007 2012 and hushan calibration period 2012 2016 validation period 2017 2019 were used to calibrate and validate the runoff volumes monthly tn and tp data from the leanhekou were taken for water quality calibration and validation when r 2 0 6 and e n s 0 5 indicates acceptably results together with satisfactory simulation results if r e 25 for runoff and r e 40 for pollutants niraula et al 2012 fig 3 and fig s1 showed the calibration and validation results of these three stations during the calibration and verification of the model r 2 and e n s for runoff were 0 75 at all three stations although the validation results were poorer at leanhekou with r e of 32 during calibration and validation of nutrients r 2 and e n s were both 0 65 and r e 40 the calibration and validation results of this study were similar to previous findings in the meijiang river basin lai et al 2020 consequently the calibration model was considered acceptable and suitable for further use in this study 3 2 dynamics of nutrient fluxes at the export section based on the numerical simulation the total nutrient discharge from the le an river watershed to the inlet estuary cross section the target cross section of the rao river during 1995 2020 was calculated and the results were shown in fig 4 the annual average values of tn and tp transported by the le an river watershed to the inlet estuary cross section from 1995 to 2020 were 16 54 gg and 3 69 gg which were consistent with the value in some previous studies hong et al 2012 liu et al 2012 peng et al 2018 the tn flood season load was about 10 43 gg yr an increase of 70 9 over the dry season with a mean rtn of 2 18 the average annual fluxes of tp in flood and dry seasons were 2 21 gg and 1 48 gg respectively with a mean rtp of 1 91 this indicated that seasonal variability in precipitation led to significant seasonal changes in nutrient losses in the watershed yang et al 2012 zhang et al 2020b from 1995 2010 the 16 year tn and tp fluxes were 16 68 gg yr and 3 75 gg yr respectively in 2011 2020 the tn and tp entering the inlet estuary cross section stood at 16 30 gg a and 3 60 gg a respectively decreasing by an average of 0 38 gg a and 0 15 gg a from 1995 2010 this may be the result of the growth in the arable land area caused by the population expansion of the watershed during 1995 2010 led to the increase in fertilizer application meanwhile the imperfect sewage system also caused the nps of rural domestic sewage and livestock breeding wastewater with the drafting and implementation of the regulations of poyang lake eco economic zone environmental protection in 2011 the strict pollutant control measurements and the implementation of soil testing technology reduced the amount of fertilizer applied and thus decreased nps pollution at the source compared to 1995 2010 tn and tp fluxes in the 2011 2020 flood season decreased by 18 9 gg and 0 39 gg and reduced 11 compared to the average annual nutrient load of 26 years the mean values of tn and tp in the dry season were 7 04 gg yr and 1 63 gg yr respectively which were 1 27 and 1 18 times higher than those in 1995 2010 this further indicated the seasonal variation in nutrient loss of the watershed overall tn and tp fluxes decreased by an average of 2 3 and 4 0 after 2011 which indicated that pollution control measures may have a positive effect on the reduction of nutrient loss in the watershed from the pre 2011 to the post 2011 period nutrient fluxes decreased appreciably in the flood season and increased slightly in the dry season the reason for this difference may be that the average annual flood season precipitation after 2011 was 3 6 higher than the pre 2011 period although the increase in precipitation exacerbated soil nutrient loss from surface runoff the sudden influx of water enhanced the dilution and self purification of pollutants by the water body in addition more precise agricultural management practices such as tillage and fertilizer application after 2011 in turn decreased the nutrient load of the soil at the source despite low farming activities during the dry season increased precipitation in 2011 2020 dry season may allow for slightly higher nutrient fluxes 3 3 spatial distribution of nutrient loads in watershed nps pollution exhibits strong spatial differentiation due to the rainfall distribution land use patterns soil type and topography of the catchment shu et al 2021 in this research we defined the topographic uniformity t i 0 5 p s p s h s and the plains coverage θ i p s p s h s to quantify watershed topographic discrepancies where p s and h s denote the area of the plains and hills in the sub catchment respectively as shown in fig 2 e the topographic landscape of the sub catchments differed greatly and the percentage of sub catchments dominated by plains or hills was as high as 67 the hilly areas were primarily located in the upper and middle parts of the watershed and on the edges while the plain areas were closer to the downstream part of the watershed in 1995 2020 the average annual loss intensity of tn and tp in the watershed was 17 7 kg ha and 2 8 kg ha which was comparable to the results of liu et al in the danjiangkou watershed where the tn and tp loss intensity was 16 2 kg ha and 1 6 kg ha respectively liu et al 2012 simulation of the spatial distribution of nutrient losses is important for watershed water environment management as shown in fig 5 c d there existed spatial heterogeneity in the loss intensity of tn and tp in the catchments the tn loss in the upstream area of the watershed sub catchments 1 10 was approximately 0 58 folds higher than that in the middle and downstream areas with loss intensity ranging from 320 50 kg ha to 558 86 kg ha the highest tn loss intensity in the middle and downstream regions was in sub catchments 15 20 21 22 and 23 ranging from 731 34 kg ha to 766 47 kg ha due to the chemical inactivity and easy adsorption on the soil surface of phosphorus the distribution of tp loss intensity coincided with that of soil loss fig 5 the regions with high intensity of tp loss were the middle and downstream sub catchments 13 15 20 21 23 and 27 with intensity ranging from 97 32 kg ha to 104 81 kg ha and the intensity of tp loss in the upstream was 0 51 times that in the middle and downstream regions and the loss distribution was similar to that of tn the areas with high nutrient losses were mainly concentrated in the cultivated land and urban construction land in the middle and downstream of the watershed where the slope is low frequent farming activities rural livelihood and livestock exacerbate nps nutrient loss hua et al 2019 this illustrated that the type of land use soil type and topography were the dominant factors in the spatial variation of nutrient loss the sub catchments 15 20 21 and 22 have slopes mostly less than 15 and are dominated by arable land in terms of land use cover type besides rice soil is the dominant soil type in these sub catchments where the clay composition characteristic of 29 makes it less capable of retaining nutrients compared to red soil and more susceptible to nps nutrient loss due to soil erosion on the other hand the high cover of forest and percentage of clay soil composition effectively prevent soil erosion in upstream areas where slopes are mainly greater than 15 that aggravated the spatial variability of nutrient loss in the watershed 3 4 nutrient loads contribution of sub catchments to export section influenced by multiple factors such as topography water retention and channel length there was a clear spatial variability in the nutrient contribution of tn and tp loss from sub catchments to the inlet estuary cross section to quantify this contribution the weight of nutrient loss in the sub catchment was calculated by the parameter c i as shown in fig 6 c sub catchment 22 had the highest contribution weights for both tn and tp from 1995 to 2020 with 10 71 and 11 92 respectively the tn and tp contribution weights were 11 52 and 25 91 times higher than the minimum respectively in 1995 2011 the tn contribution sever was sub catchments 15 22 and 23 with weights of 11 07 9 68 and 9 24 respectively the tp contributions sever were sub catchments 15 19 20 22 and 23 with weights of 11 81 8 73 7 85 11 32 and 8 50 respectively this showed that the sub catchments with high contribution were mainly concentrated in the middle and downstream regions of the watershed and the closer to the outlet of the watershed the higher weight of contribution it has been studied that the farther the nps pollutant from receiving water body the lower the final discharge to the water shi et al 2020 moreover agricultural cultivation and fertilization activities in the middle and downstream plains superimposed on natural conditions such as precipitation and slope led to a higher degree of nps nutrient loss than in the upstream area therefore it can be concluded that the distance index and quantity of nutrient loss were the major factors affecting the sub catchments contribution to the nutrient load of the target cross section of the rao river similar findings were observed on the bahe river basin nie et al 2019 they found that the closer to the downstream urban area of the river the larger the area of high risk nps from 2011 to 2020 the tn contribution sever was sub catchment 22 with a reduced contribution value of 6 49 compared to pre 2011 and the weight was 12 08 comparing fig 6 a1 and a2 it can be seen that the degree of tn contribution in sub catchments 15 and 23 changed from sever to very high and the contribution values were 0 58 times and 0 66 times of the 1995 2010 period respectively in comparison with 1995 2010 the sub catchments of tp contribution sever changed from 15 19 20 22 and 23 to 15 20 and 22 the contribution weights of sub catchments 15 20 and 22 were 8 62 9 42 and 12 08 with the contribution values reducing by 44 50 17 07 and 20 66 respectively the tp contribution values of sub catchments 19 and 23 were decreased by 31 46 and 39 85 respectively and the contribution level changed from sever to very high comparing the nutrient contribution of the sub catchments to the inlet estuary cross section between the two periods all 26 sub catchments showed different degrees of reduction except for the growth of sub catchment 12 this indicated that the implementation of the policy and pollutant control may positively decrease the amount of nps nutrient loss to the river as the dexing copper mine and the other pb zn mines are located in sub catchment 12 the gradual release of high soil background values resulting from mine contamination under rainfall washout led to a slight increase in the contribution value in addition it is not surprising that the region s unique topography climatic conditions agricultural cultivation practices and urbanization rates caused different levels of contribution decreases in sub catchments 4 conclusion in this study the dynamic processes of nutrient pollution production in the le an river watershed a typical mixed hilly plain watershed over the last 30 years were inversely simulated by the swat further nutrient load contribution values and weights of sub catchments to the inlet estuary cross section was quantify the results showed that there were significant annual fluctuations in the contribution of nutrients from the le an river watershed to the inlet estuary cross section during 1995 2020 with contribution loads of 16 54 gg a and 3 69 gg a for tn and tp the average loss intensity of tn and tp in the sub catchment near the downstream plain area of the watershed was 1 38 and 1 12 times higher than that in the upstream hilly area due to topography and distance the nutrient contribution of sub catchments to the inlet estuary cross section differed in space in 1995 2020 the highest contribution weight of tn and tp sub catchment 22 was 11 52 and 25 91 times of the lowest by comparing the contribution between the two periods it can be identified that sub catchments 15 20 and 22 were sensitive areas for nutrient loss to the inlet estuary cross section and follow up measures should be taken to curtail the pollutants the results of this study provided a methodological system for the delineation of key areas of nutrient loss control identification in the le an river watershed and its sub catchment a theoretical reference framework was provided to future researchers conducting quantitative traceability studies of nutrient loads in such small watersheds management issues such as fertilizer use and vegetation interception should be considered in the subsequent model optimization in

938,the ilha river is one of the main tributaries of the sinos river consequently contributing to its ecological impact the present study aimed to associate the use of different biomarkers in vitro and in vivo to assess the water quality of three points along the ilha river during 2019 for this purpose water samples were collected at the source and mouth of the river and in an intermediate section in the laboratory samples were used for in vitro toxicity tests with the v79 cell line in which we evaluated the protein content and mitochondrial activity through the mtt assay the results indicated a possible disruption in cellular mitochondrial activity acute toxicity tests were also carried out in danio rerio and daphnia magna and a chronic toxicity test was performed in c elegans no significant differences were observed in the antioxidant defense enzymes sod cat and gpx however the point of greatest agricultural impact inhibited the activity of muscle ache in zebrafish all samples delayed the development of c elegans characterizing toxicity phosphorus was above the limit established by brazilian legislation at the three sampling points in two of the three collections indicating the probable presence of agricultural components in the water the results alert to the need for the association of different bioindicators and whenever possible the use of chronic toxicity tests for the best environmental diagnosis keywords daphnia magna zebrafish cell culture environmental monitoring 1 introductin environmental pollution especially water contamination has been one of the most relevant concerns for world development and quality of life gursoy and atun 2019 complex mixtures from anthropogenic activities such as industrial agricultural and domestic wastes released into surface waters have become an environmental issue because of its potential toxic effects on aquatic ecosystems in this scenario these pollutants can cause lethal and sub lethal effects on organisms besides affecting the health of human populations exposed to drinking water nunes et al 2011a musoke et al 2018 currently a variety of analytical methods bioassays and biomarkers is used with both in vitro and in vivo techniques thus identifying possible evidence of adverse effects on exposed organisms bianchi et al 2019 rodrigues et al 2020a liu et al 2021 hahn nascimento and linden 2021 the physicochemical parameters of water commonly approach to assess the water pollution impact however several published studies have been demonstrated that these parameters alone are not capable of efficiently evaluate toxic effects caused by polluting agents nunes et al 2011b dalzochio et al 2017 garcia et al 2017 bianchi et al 2019 for this reason bioindicators of environmental quality were introduced which in turn include biological processes species or communities used to assess the quality of the environment and how it changes over time holt and miller 2010 it is important to highlight that the use of a bioindicator requires the choice of one or more biomarkers associated that answer the questions of the study in order to obtain a more adequate response it is determined that a good bioindicator should have a well defined and easily recognized taxonomy low ecologic and genetic variability and may be suitable for laboratory assays johnson et al 1993 aiming to further refine and ensure the results obtained in an environmental toxicological assessment the combination of different bioindicators emerge as a frequent tool among the studies of this research area nunes et al 2011a bianchi et al 2019 various organisms are routinely recommended as bioindicators of environmental quality among the tests used for ecotoxicological analyses danio rerio fish daphnia magna microcrustacean and caenorhabditis elegans nematode representatives of the aquatic and terrestrial environment are well described as acceptable and sensitive organisms to detect pollutants from complex mixtures hoss et al 2012 martínez sales and espinós 2015 fajardo et al 2020 sackey and koci 2020 danio rerio and daphnia magna present high sensitivity martins et al 2007 and are indicated by the international recommendations for ecotoxicological studies oecd 2012 oecd 2013 besides that numerous alternative methods to the use of animals have been used to complement in vivo studies the use of cell culture like the chinese hamster lung fibroblasts v79 cell line is an example of recommended and standardized assay to detect cytotoxic effects of environmental samples boeira et al 2001 garcia et al 2017 oecd 2018 caenorhabditis elegans is a promising alternative model for environmental chemical mixture effect assessment wittkowski et al 2019 southern brazil specifically the state of rio grande do sul has one of the most polluted rivers in the country sinos river the importance that this water resource has in the state s economy is irrefutable given all the agricultural and livestock activities that are developed on its riverside therefore studies evaluating the quality of these waters are numerous jacociunas et al 2010 dalzochio et al 2018 bianchi et al 2019 simões et al 2019 and have relevance not only for the environmental aspect but also for socioeconomic aspects consequently evaluating the hydrographic basin in which the river is inserted as well as its main tributaries can assist in tracing the sources of the main polluting contributions ilha river one of the main tributaries of the sinos river is located in taquara city in the middle of sinos river basin a low population density characterizes the region where the economy is predominantly agricultural ilha river drains an area of 318 km2 of the basin representing 8 6 of the total volume rodrigues et al 2016 some authors have demonstrated the low quality of the waters through studies using fish and the allium cepa bioassay at different exposure times rodrigues et al 2016 dalzochio et al 2017 therefore this study aimed at evaluating the toxicity and cytotoxicity of surface water from the ilha river collected in 2019 in the state of rio grande do sul brazil using three bioindicators in vivo and one in vitro assay with v79 cell line biomarkers such as enzymes superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat glutathione peroxidase gpx and acetylcholinesterase ache were analyzed in zebrafish analysis

wallis test the medians and percentile were considered 25 and 75 for the comparison between groups and control for the assay with daphnia magna the effective concentration for 10 of the organisms ce10 is usually calculated using linear interpolation but was not necessary in the c elegans tests the statistical analysis was performed by one way anova followed by the tukey post test due to the normality of the variables analyzed for the statistical analysis was using the graphpad prism 5 0 program differences were considered significant when p 0 05 3 results 3 1 water parameters and rainfall data the physicochemical parameters and caffeine determination were examined at all water collection points showing results below the limits specified by the brazilian legislation for surface water brasil 2005 except phosphorus in all collections carried out in january and april table 1 3 2 cell cytotoxicity assays the data referring to cytotoxicity tests performed on the cell line can be seen in fig s 2 and 3 where we can also see that changes in cell mitochondrial activity were more frequent than changes in protein content the response profile presented for the mtt assay fig 2 was similar between the sampling points and throughout the collections with an increase in mitochondrial activity especially in the crude samples and 75 both after 24 hours and 96 hours of exposure regarding protein content the major changes were observed in the 24 hour cell exposure assay fig 3a 3c there were predominantly small increases in the protein content especially in the crude samples and 75 but also less frequently 50 in the 96 hour trial virtually all samples were similar to the control group 3 3 toxicity in daphnia magna and c elegans for the immobility test using daphnia magna no toxicity occurred in any of the samples collected the results for the toxicity tests of c elegans table 2 showed a significant reduction in the body length of nematodes in relation to the control group for all points in all collections 3 4 enzymatic activity in danio rerio for the activity of the antioxidant enzymes sod cat and gpx determined in danio rerio liver homogenate the results obtained showed no statistical difference when comparing with the controls and comparing the same point between the different collections fig 4 for the ache assay only in the january collection was observed a reduction in s3 when compared to the control group p 0 013 4 discussion the main aim of this study was to evaluate and monitor the water quality of ilha river one of the main tributaries of sinos river through the association of different indicators firstly the water samples tested did not show any major changes in the physicochemical parameters evaluated except for the increase in phosphorus in the first two collections although phosphorus is essential for aquatic biota it can also accelerate eutrophication when present in excess chislock et al 2013 this nutrient is a common constituent of agricultural fertilizers manure and organic waste however as the levels of caffeine were low in all sampling points and collections tested we may say that the sampling points were under low impact from domestic effluents for example since that caffeine is recognized as an anthropogenic biomarker for wastewater and surface water contamination peteffi et al 2018 this fact can be justified due to the rural characterization of the region which has a predominance of agricultural activity fontanella et al 2009 dalzochio et al 2017 even so changes in the mitochondrial activity of v79 cells were observed in both exposure periods 24 and 96 hours but not many biological effects were observed in the cellular protein content srb assay indicating that mitochondrial rupture may have occurred and not an increase in cell viability this mitochondrial rupture can lead to long term mitochondrial stress smith et al 2012 and can be a consequence of reactive oxygen species formation combined with mitochondrial nad p h decrease followed by a slow recovery svendsen et al 2004 these mechanisms can cause cell damage resulting in lipid peroxidation on biological membranes and leading to cell death smith et al 2012 for the purpose of associating and confirming these data we used some in vivo bioindicators such as daphnia magna and danio rerio which are standardized models considered as references for ecotoxicological tests raldua et al 2013 canedo and rocha 2021 however the samples collected at the three sampling points did not show a toxic profile which may be related to the use of a cell culture model and the consequent loss of multiple tissue collaboration that are normally involved in toxicokinetic of a total organism besides that toxic effects on mammalian cells v79 cell line or on microcrustaceans and fishes can even be related to differences between the species and trophic level the short exposure time used in in vivo models and considered acute can also be related with these results other authors have already demonstrated that for these models chronic exposures have greater power to reflect the real state of toxicity of the environments rodrigues et al 2020b the fact is due to the low amounts of environmental pollutants present in these environments which actually require more time to show an effect precisely for this reason another study carried out on the same water resource but using fish species native to the region demonstrated genotoxicity histopathological changes in the gills and bioaccumulation of chromium and nickel dalzochio et al 2017 thus the absence of an in vivo effect danio rerio and daphnia magna in the present study should be attributed to the short exposure period rather than the absence of contaminants or toxicological potential of the collected water samples the assay characterized as being chronic in the alternative model c elegans corroborates this hypothesis since it was observed a reduction in the body length of nematodes exposed to the three sampling points and in the three collection periods when compared to the control group the same type of response has been reported in exposures to persistent organic pollutants endocrine disruptors methylmercury and other water pollutants tseng et al 2013 xu et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 ke et al 2020 measures of worm length indicate development and growth parameters of the organism how et al 2018 so we can assume that water samples from ilha river delayed the growth of c elegans body reduction can result in reduced offspring quality and viability besides having an influence on metabolic rate and consequently survival and life span woodruff et al 2019 and for this reason this parameter is used to assess toxicity finally we also evaluated the activity of liver antioxidant enzymes as a way of checking the status of the animals defense and repair system since sod cat and gpx aim to prevent and control the formation of free radicals in organisms as they play a fundamental role in the defense against reactive oxygen species ros liang et al 2020 as no changes were observed in these enzymes we also verified the activity of ache responsible for the degradation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine rico et al 2007 in order to identify if there were any changes in the antioxidant defense system due to the absence or presence of stressors in the water samples in the january period collection a significant reduction was observed in the muscle ache activity of the animals collected in s3 when compared to the control group the same profile was repeated in the april collection but without significant differences it is known that the reduced activity of ache can lead to the accumulation of acetylcholine in central cholinergic synapses and neuromuscular junctions haverroth et al 2015 resulting in locomotor behavioral impairment and death tilton et al 2011 this response profile was observed in fish exposed to metals especially due to the characteristic of these pollutants being linked to ache functional groups najimi et al 1997 lima et al 2012 organophosphates insecticides and carbamates can also induce this type of response golombieski et al 2008 yen et al 2011 schmidel et al 2014 the region is known to be impacted by rice cultivation dalzochio et al 2017 and it is known that these regions end up being sources of agricultural composition metals such as mn zn fe and cu qian et al 2019 the accumulation of pesticides in the natural environment is considered one of the biggest pollution issues associated with agriculture fao et al 2011 as it generates several biotic damages to the ecosystem including changes in the defense system and oxidant repair clasen et al 2018 therefore we can assume that especially those animals exposed to the s3 samples collected in the period of january came into contact with some type of contaminant of this type capable of reducing the activity of ache such response is often associated with an exacerbated production of ros in the organism colovic et al 2013 although in the present study it is unlikely since there were no changes in the levels of sod cat and gpx these findings lead us to look for justifications in the inflammatory pathways and paul and borah 2017 report the involvement of inflammation in decreasing ache activity since the anti inflammatory activity of ache inhibitors occurs only in much lower concentrations than those capable of inhibiting the enzyme furman et al 2014 it is precisely for this reason that they are used in treatments of neurodegenerative diseases taha et al 2021 the present study demonstrated that acute toxicity tests in vivo do not reflect the real state of toxicity of environmental samples possibly due to the concentrations of pollutants present in the water which are usually low however when in prolonged contact with the organism these pollutants end up causing losses as was demonstrated in the chronic assay with c elegans the in vitro test also demonstrated greater sensitivity than the acute toxicity tests in vivo for the evaluation of environmental samples both in 24h and in 96h of exposure the reduction in ache activity in animals collected in s3 may have occurred mainly due to the use of agricultural products in this collection point as it is located inside a private property with rice planting activity however for better reliability the identification of these contaminants could be carried out in a future study historically the first study carried out in the evaluated region fontanella et al 2008 classified the water samples from rio da ilha as of good quality through the water quality index wqi however years after this publication dalzochio et al 2017 demonstrated the low nutritional quality and histopathological changes in fish collected at the site which possibly derived from the presence of metals such as cr and ni that were above the allowed limit in the present study we obtained varied responses by restricting some variables and evaluating more sensitive biomarkers which could provide information about the toxicity pathway even though in this work few parameters were evaluated in the water in another study not yet published by our research group data not available the fish collected at the site once again show high concentrations of metals in their tissues corroborating with dalzochio et al 2017 therefore for a final conclusion on the water quality of this water body all publications with data from the region must be considered it is also important to point out that among the possible and recommended management measures we consider the screening of chemical substances such as pesticides not only in the surface water of the region but also in the supply waters declaration of competing interest none declared acknowledgments mgm and gzpr received respectively master and phd s degree scholarship from capes 
938,the ilha river is one of the main tributaries of the sinos river consequently contributing to its ecological impact the present study aimed to associate the use of different biomarkers in vitro and in vivo to assess the water quality of three points along the ilha river during 2019 for this purpose water samples were collected at the source and mouth of the river and in an intermediate section in the laboratory samples were used for in vitro toxicity tests with the v79 cell line in which we evaluated the protein content and mitochondrial activity through the mtt assay the results indicated a possible disruption in cellular mitochondrial activity acute toxicity tests were also carried out in danio rerio and daphnia magna and a chronic toxicity test was performed in c elegans no significant differences were observed in the antioxidant defense enzymes sod cat and gpx however the point of greatest agricultural impact inhibited the activity of muscle ache in zebrafish all samples delayed the development of c elegans characterizing toxicity phosphorus was above the limit established by brazilian legislation at the three sampling points in two of the three collections indicating the probable presence of agricultural components in the water the results alert to the need for the association of different bioindicators and whenever possible the use of chronic toxicity tests for the best environmental diagnosis keywords daphnia magna zebrafish cell culture environmental monitoring 1 introductin environmental pollution especially water contamination has been one of the most relevant concerns for world development and quality of life gursoy and atun 2019 complex mixtures from anthropogenic activities such as industrial agricultural and domestic wastes released into surface waters have become an environmental issue because of its potential toxic effects on aquatic ecosystems in this scenario these pollutants can cause lethal and sub lethal effects on organisms besides affecting the health of human populations exposed to drinking water nunes et al 2011a musoke et al 2018 currently a variety of analytical methods bioassays and biomarkers is used with both in vitro and in vivo techniques thus identifying possible evidence of adverse effects on exposed organisms bianchi et al 2019 rodrigues et al 2020a liu et al 2021 hahn nascimento and linden 2021 the physicochemical parameters of water commonly approach to assess the water pollution impact however several published studies have been demonstrated that these parameters alone are not capable of efficiently evaluate toxic effects caused by polluting agents nunes et al 2011b dalzochio et al 2017 garcia et al 2017 bianchi et al 2019 for this reason bioindicators of environmental quality were introduced which in turn include biological processes species or communities used to assess the quality of the environment and how it changes over time holt and miller 2010 it is important to highlight that the use of a bioindicator requires the choice of one or more biomarkers associated that answer the questions of the study in order to obtain a more adequate response it is determined that a good bioindicator should have a well defined and easily recognized taxonomy low ecologic and genetic variability and may be suitable for laboratory assays johnson et al 1993 aiming to further refine and ensure the results obtained in an environmental toxicological assessment the combination of different bioindicators emerge as a frequent tool among the studies of this research area nunes et al 2011a bianchi et al 2019 various organisms are routinely recommended as bioindicators of environmental quality among the tests used for ecotoxicological analyses danio rerio fish daphnia magna microcrustacean and caenorhabditis elegans nematode representatives of the aquatic and terrestrial environment are well described as acceptable and sensitive organisms to detect pollutants from complex mixtures hoss et al 2012 martínez sales and espinós 2015 fajardo et al 2020 sackey and koci 2020 danio rerio and daphnia magna present high sensitivity martins et al 2007 and are indicated by the international recommendations for ecotoxicological studies oecd 2012 oecd 2013 besides that numerous alternative methods to the use of animals have been used to complement in vivo studies the use of cell culture like the chinese hamster lung fibroblasts v79 cell line is an example of recommended and standardized assay to detect cytotoxic effects of environmental samples boeira et al 2001 garcia et al 2017 oecd 2018 caenorhabditis elegans is a promising alternative model for environmental chemical mixture effect assessment wittkowski et al 2019 southern brazil specifically the state of rio grande do sul has one of the most polluted rivers in the country sinos river the importance that this water resource has in the state s economy is irrefutable given all the agricultural and livestock activities that are developed on its riverside therefore studies evaluating the quality of these waters are numerous jacociunas et al 2010 dalzochio et al 2018 bianchi et al 2019 simões et al 2019 and have relevance not only for the environmental aspect but also for socioeconomic aspects consequently evaluating the hydrographic basin in which the river is inserted as well as its main tributaries can assist in tracing the sources of the main polluting contributions ilha river one of the main tributaries of the sinos river is located in taquara city in the middle of sinos river basin a low population density characterizes the region where the economy is predominantly agricultural ilha river drains an area of 318 km2 of the basin representing 8 6 of the total volume rodrigues et al 2016 some authors have demonstrated the low quality of the waters through studies using fish and the allium cepa bioassay at different exposure times rodrigues et al 2016 dalzochio et al 2017 therefore this study aimed at evaluating the toxicity and cytotoxicity of surface water from the ilha river collected in 2019 in the state of rio grande do sul brazil using three bioindicators in vivo and one in vitro assay with v79 cell line biomarkers such as enzymes superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat glutathione peroxidase gpx and acetylcholinesterase ache were analyzed in zebrafish analysis

dilution with 5 neonates being exposed in each beaker during the test period the organisms were maintained at 18 c to 22 c after the exposure time to the different dilutions of the sample the number of immobile individuals per concentration was observed 2 6 acute toxicity test with danio rerio for in vivo tests with danio rerio 160 fishes were used per collection 40 fishes per experimental group the fish were obtained from a commercial supplier and acclimatized for 7 days at a temperature of 26 2 c in reconstituted water being fed daily at 8 a m and 1 p m with commercial flake food and at 5 p m with artemia salina for the test fish were acutely exposed for 96 hours to the different samples of each collection source intermediate and mouth of the ilha river and a fourth group named as the control group was kept in reconstituted water during the same exposure period all quality of life parameters of the animals were maintained during the test and the water was renewed every 48 hours at the end of the exposure the animals were anesthetized and sacrificed in a 160 mg l 1 tricaine solution for the collection of livers and muscle which were immediately stored in saline solution at 80 c after thawing 2x and centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes the homogenates obtained were used to determine the activity of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase protein content sod described by misra and fridovich 1972 catalase cat described by beutler duron and kelly 1963 glutathione peroxidase gpx described by pleban et al 1982 besides protein quantification by the lowry method modified by peterson 1977 2 6 1 determination of superoxide dismutase sod activity for the quantification of sod the protocol described by misra and fridovich 1972 adapted for 96 well microplates was used which is based on the inhibition of adrenaline auto oxidation the samples were diluted in saline solution 1 10 v v in increasing amounts of the homogenate 10 20 30 40 and 50 µl plus glycine buffer ph 10 2 at 32 c solution 50 mm catalase and 60 mm adrenaline acid solution the absorbance reading was performed on a microplate spectrophotometer molecular devices m3 set at 480 nm for 180 seconds every ten seconds the results were calculated by linear regression and expressed in sod mg 1 protein protein quantification was performed using the lowry method modified by peterson 1977 2 6 2 determination of catalase cat for catalase activity the protocol described by beutler duron and kelly 1963 adapted for microplate was used for the tests 5 µl of tissue homogenate was used added to 50 µl of phosphate buffer 10 mm ph 7 0 and 20 µl of 2 mm h2o2 the reaction was stopped by adding 100 µl of 5 potassium dichromate and glacial acetic acid 1 3 the absorbance reading was performed at 620 nm in 0 and 15 seconds the results were calculated by linear regression and expressed in u mg protein 2 6 3 determination of glutathione peroxidase gpx the enzymatic activity of glutathione peroxidase was performed as described by pleban et al 1982 adapted for reading on a microplate firstly the working reaction was prepared with 50 mmol l of tris buffer at ph 7 6 containing 1 mmol of na2edta per liter 2 mmol of reduced glutathione 0 2 mmol of nad p h 4 mmol of sodium azide and 1000 per liter u of glutathione reductase in order to determine the enzyme activity in the homogenate 30 µl of diluted homogenate was added to 200 µl of the working reaction to start the reaction 10 µl of h2o2 8 8 mmol l 1 was added and the absorbance reading at 340 nm was performed for 180 seconds every 60 seconds the results were calculated by linear regression and expressed in u mg 1 protein 2 6 4 determination of acetylcholinesterase ache the muscle samples were partially dissociated manually and homogenized to 25 mg ml 1 in 0 1 m sodium phosphate buffer ph 8 0 with 0 1 tritonx 100 sigma to quantify ache the protocol described by sandahl and jenkins 2002 was followed briefly after this preparation the samples were centrifuged 1000 rpm for 10 minutes subsequently 50 µl of the homogenate was transferred to a 1 5 ml tube to which 900 µl of 0 1 m sodium phosphate buffer ph 8 0 and 50 µl dtnb 6 mm were added the mixture was gently stirred and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes in the absence of light to allow the non enzymatic activity to stabilize and then 200 µl was transferred to plate wells in triplicate the reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 µl atchi 15 mm and change of absorbance 412 nm was measured at 12 s intervals for 10 min at 25 c the results were expressed in mmol min 1 mg 1 protein 2 5 statistical analysis the normality of the variables was tested using the shapiro wilk test in enzymatic assays sod cat gpx and ache statistical analysis was performed using the kruskal wallis test the medians and percentile were considered 25 and 75 for the comparison between groups and control for the assay with daphnia magna the effective concentration for 10 of the organisms ce10 is usually calculated using linear interpolation but was not necessary in the c elegans tests the statistical analysis was performed by one way anova followed by the tukey post test due to the normality of the variables analyzed for the statistical analysis was using the graphpad prism 5 0 program differences were considered significant when p 0 05 3 results 3 1 water parameters and rainfall data the physicochemical parameters and caffeine determination were examined at all water collection points showing results below the limits specified by the brazilian legislation for surface water brasil 2005 except phosphorus in all collections carried out in january and april table 1 3 2 cell cytotoxicity assays the data referring to cytotoxicity tests performed on the cell line can be seen in fig s 2 and 3 where we can also see that changes in cell mitochondrial activity were more frequent than changes in protein content the response profile presented for the mtt assay fig 2 was similar between the sampling points and throughout the collections with an increase in mitochondrial activity especially in the crude samples and 75 both after 24 hours and 96 hours of exposure regarding protein content the major changes were observed in the 24 hour cell exposure assay fig 3a 3c there were predominantly small increases in the protein content especially in the crude samples and 75 but also less frequently 50 in the 96 hour trial virtually all samples were similar to the control group 3 3 toxicity in daphnia magna and c elegans for the immobility test using daphnia magna no toxicity occurred in any of the samples collected the results for the toxicity tests of c elegans table 2 showed a significant reduction in the body length of nematodes in relation to the control group for all points in all collections 3 4 enzymatic activity in danio rerio for the activity of the antioxidant enzymes sod cat and gpx determined in danio rerio liver homogenate the results obtained showed no statistical difference when comparing with the controls and comparing the same point between the different collections fig 4 for the ache assay only in the january collection was observed a reduction in s3 when compared to the control group p 0 013 4 discussion the main aim of this study was to evaluate and monitor the water quality of ilha river one of the main tributaries of sinos river through the association of different indicators firstly the water samples tested did not show any major changes in the physicochemical parameters evaluated except for the increase in phosphorus in the first two collections although phosphorus is essential for aquatic biota it can also accelerate eutrophication when present in excess chislock et al 2013 this nutrient is a common constituent of agricultural fertilizers manure and organic waste however as the levels of caffeine were low in all sampling points and collections tested we may say that the sampling points were under low impact from domestic effluents for example since that caffeine is recognized as an anthropogenic biomarker for wastewater and surface water contamination peteffi et al 2018 this fact can be justified due to the rural characterization of the region which has a predominance of agricultural activity fontanella et al 2009 dalzochio et al 2017 even so changes in the mitochondrial activity of v79 cells were observed in both exposure periods 24 and 96 hours but not many biological effects were observed in the cellular protein content srb assay indicating that mitochondrial rupture may have occurred and not an increase in cell viability this mitochondrial rupture can lead to long term mitochondrial stress smith et al 2012 and can be a consequence of reactive oxygen species formation combined with mitochondrial nad p h decrease followed by a slow recovery svendsen et al 2004 these mechanisms can cause cell damage resulting in lipid peroxidation on biological membranes and leading to cell death smith et al 2012 for the purpose of associating and confirming these data we used some in vivo bioindicators such as daphnia magna and danio rerio which are standardized models considered as references for ecotoxicological tests raldua et al 2013 canedo and rocha 2021 however the samples collected at the three sampling points did not show a toxic profile which may be related to the use of a cell culture model and the consequent loss of multiple tissue collaboration that are normally involved in toxicokinetic of a total organism besides that toxic effects on mammalian cells v79 cell line or on microcrustaceans and fishes can even be related to differences between the species and trophic level the short exposure time used in in vivo models and considered acute can also be related with these results other authors have already demonstrated that for these models chronic exposures have greater power to reflect the real state of toxicity of the environments rodrigues et al 2020b the fact is due to the low amounts of environmental pollutants present in these environments which actually require more time to show an effect precisely for this reason another study carried out on the same water resource but using fish species native to the region demonstrated genotoxicity histopathological changes in the gills and bioaccumulation of chromium and nickel dalzochio et al 2017 thus the absence of an in vivo effect danio rerio and daphnia magna in the present study should be attributed to the short exposure period rather than the absence of contaminants or toxicological potential of the collected water samples the assay characterized as being chronic in the alternative model c elegans corroborates this hypothesis since it was observed a reduction in the body length of nematodes exposed to the three sampling points and in the three collection periods when compared to the control group the same type of response has been reported in exposures to persistent organic pollutants endocrine disruptors methylmercury and other water pollutants tseng et al 2013 xu et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 ke et al 2020 measures of worm length indicate development and growth parameters of the organism how et al 2018 so we can assume that water samples from ilha river delayed the growth of c elegans body reduction can result in reduced offspring quality and viability besides having an influence on metabolic rate and consequently survival and life span woodruff et al 2019 and for this reason this parameter is used to assess toxicity finally we also evaluated the activity of liver antioxidant enzymes as a way of checking the status of the animals defense and repair system since sod cat and gpx aim to prevent and control the formation of free radicals in organisms as they play a fundamental role in the defense against reactive oxygen species ros liang et al 2020 as no changes were observed in these enzymes we also verified the activity of ache responsible for the degradation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine rico et al 2007 in order to identify if there were any changes in the antioxidant defense system due to the absence or presence of stressors in the water samples in the january period collection a significant reduction was observed in the muscle ache activity of the animals collected in s3 when compared to the control group the same profile was repeated in the april collection but without significant differences it is known that the reduced activity of ache can lead to the accumulation of acetylcholine in central cholinergic synapses and neuromuscular junctions haverroth et al 2015 resulting in locomotor behavioral impairment and death tilton et al 2011 this response profile was observed in fish exposed to metals especially due to the characteristic of these pollutants being linked to ache functional groups najimi et al 1997 lima et al 2012 organophosphates insecticides and carbamates can also induce this type of response golombieski et al 2008 yen et al 2011 schmidel et al 2014 the region is known to be impacted by rice cultivation dalzochio et al 2017 and it is known that these regions end up being sources of agricultural composition metals such as mn zn fe and cu qian et al 2019 the accumulation of pesticides in the natural environment is considered one of the biggest pollution issues associated with agriculture fao et al 2011 as it generates several biotic damages to the ecosystem including changes in the defense system and oxidant repair clasen et al 2018 therefore we can assume that especially those animals exposed to the s3 samples collected in the period of january came into contact with some type of contaminant of this type capable of reducing the activity of ache such response is often associated with an exacerbated production of ros in the organism colovic et al 2013 although in the present study it is unlikely since there were no changes in the levels of sod cat and gpx these findings lead us to look for justifications in the inflammatory pathways and paul and borah 2017 report the involvement of inflammation in decreasing ache activity since the anti inflammatory activity of ache inhibitors occurs only in much lower concentrations than those capable of inhibiting the enzyme furman et al 2014 it is precisely for this reason that they are used in treatments of neurodegenerative diseases taha et al 2021 the present study demonstrated that acute toxicity tests in vivo do not reflect the real state of toxicity of environmental samples possibly due to the concentrations of pollutants present in the water which are usually low however when in prolonged contact with the organism these pollutants end up causing losses as was demonstrated in the chronic assay with c elegans the in vitro test also demonstrated greater sensitivity than the acute toxicity tests in vivo for the evaluation of environmental samples both in 24h and in 96h of exposure the reduction in ache activity in animals collected in s3 may have occurred mainly due to the use of agricultural products in this collection point as it is located inside a private property with rice planting activity however for better reliability the identification of these contaminants could be carried out in a future study historically the first study carried out in the evaluated region fontanella et al 2008 classified the water samples from rio da ilha as of good quality through the water quality index wqi however years after this publication dalzochio et al 2017 demonstrated the low nutritional quality and histopathological changes in fish collected at the site which possibly derived from the presence of metals such as cr and ni that were above the allowed limit in the present study we obtained varied responses by restricting some variables and evaluating more sensitive biomarkers which could provide information about the toxicity pathway even though in this work few parameters were evaluated in the water in another study not yet published by our research group data not available the fish collected at the site once again show high concentrations of metals in their tissues corroborating with dalzochio et al 2017 therefore for a final conclusion on the water quality of this water body all publications with data from the region must be considered it is also important to point out that among the possible and recommended management measures we consider the screening of chemical substances such as pesticides not only in the surface water of the region but also in the supply waters declaration of competing interest none declared acknowledgments mgm and gzpr received respectively master and phd s degree scholarship from capes 
939,while de icing salts improve safety on roads and sidewalks during winter they have a negative impact on the environment this has spurred the search for more environmentally friendly alternatives the present study tests the impact of nacl and six other de icing salts pure cacl2 cacl2 nacl eco label cacl2 mgcl2 solid and liquid ch3cook promoted as more eco friendly alternatives to nacl on four zooplankton species from biotests ceriodaphnia dubia ceriodaphtokit daphnia magna daphtoxkit brachionus calyciflorus rotoxkit and thamnocephalus platyurus thamnotoxkit 24 h ec50 evaluation showed that only solid ch3cook was less toxic for all tested species than nacl the other tested de icing salts had similar or even higher toxicity with cacl2 mgcl2 and liquid ch3cook being significantly more toxic for all species than nacl of the tested species thamnocephalus platyurus demonstrated toxicity response at significantly lower concentration of all used de icing salts while daphnia magna had significantly the highest concentrations of toxicity response our findings demonstrate that these alternatives are not less toxic in this regard than the commonly used nacl and underline the need to verify the accuracy of the term eco friendly on the labels of these products key words de icing salt road salt ecotoxicity zooplankton biotest 1 introduction in many countries freshwater areas are increasingly subject to salinity input from anthropogenic sources such as agriculture mining effluents industry effluents and urbanization indeed such trends in salt ion concentrations have been observed in aquatic ecosystems in the usa corsi et al 2015 dugan et al 2017 canada lembcke et al 2017 many european countries e g löfgren 2001 salminen et al 2011 müller and gächter 2012 espinha marques et al 2021 niedrist et al 2021 china yu et al 2014 zhao et al 2021 and australia shenton et al 2022 the salinity level of an area depends on a range of climate topography geology hydrology and catchment characteristics as well as the nature of any anthropogenic sources in cold regions one of the main freshwater salinization sources is road salt commonly used in winter for de icing roads cañedo argüelles et al 2013 cunillera montcusí et al 2022 kaushal et al 2021 the complex interrelationship between salt ions and chemical biological and geological parameters and their environmental and socio economic consequences have been named freshwater salinity syndrome fss long term studies indicate that without urgent remedial action fss will continue to increase the salinity of freshwater ecosystems groundwater and soils at local regional and global scales and alter their ionic composition kaushal et al 2021 despite this standards for chloride ion concentrations in freshwater ecosystems i e the most standard chemical determinant of salinity have not generally been established in european countries schuler et al 2018 with a few exceptions such as germany and sweden schulz and cañedo argüelles 2019 in addition research indicates that chloride concentration limits set in the us and canada do not sufficiently protect lake food webs research to revise existing standards or to establish new legal guidelines is therefore urgently needed to protect freshwater ecosystems from human induced salinisation hintz et al 2022 the combined effect of increasing eutrophication and salinization on freshwater ecosystems promotes the formation of large blooms of phytoplankton and periphyton and the decline of many species of invertebrates and macrophytes delaune et al 2021 gillis et al 2022 honarvar nazari et al 2021 kaushal et al 2021 lind et al 2018 szklarek et al 2022 a particularly salinity sensitive group of organisms is the zooplankton according to published studies elevated road salt concentrations cause a decrease in zooplankton reproduction and an increase in mortality resulting in an overall decrease in zooplankton density arnott et al 2020 hintz and relyea 2017 furthermore salinity stress affects planktivore zooplankton interactions road salt and predation stress have additive negative effects on the abundance of daphnia hintz et al 2017 and at higher salinities changes are observed in daphniid life history and behavioural responses to predation liu and steiner 2017 as zooplankton play an important role in top down processes in lakes and other standing freshwaters their sensitivity to increasing salinity due to various causes such as the use of road salt may cause disturbances in the trophic cascade the use of de icing salts therefore induces a number of direct and indirect effects in the biotic structure which may alter ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services jones et al 2017 hintz and relyea 2017 schuler et al 2017 consequently in an era of excessive use of de icing agents and salinisation of freshwater ecosystems detailed studies are needed on the complex effects of road salts on the quantitative and qualitative structure of zooplankton communities furthermore as many zooplankton demonstrate species specific responses to stressors studies on the responses to elevated concentrations of de icing salts should include a range of zooplankton genera rather than focusing on the model genus daphnia despite being the most commonly used de icing salt sodium chloride nacl is responsible for a number of negative effects on the environment around the application site road car and infrastructure corrosion deteriorating vegetation and alternative road salts are currently sought however while is assumed that these new salts will be less harmful to the human infrastructure and vegetation near the road their impact on water ecosystems is rarely considered in studies if at all a few have investigated the impact on freshwater organisms of alternative de icing salts particularly those based on magnesium and calcium chloride mgcl2 and cacl2 their findings suggest that nacl alternatives could have a similar or higher toxicity on freshwater species than nacl lee et al 2017 nutile and solan 2019 schuler and relyea 2018 and are usually more expensive achkeeva et al 2015 consequently little is known about the effects of new de icing salts promoted as eco friendly alternatives to nacl many of which have been put into use without prior studies of their environmental impact especially on the freshwater ecosystem in addition laboratory studies published to date have tested the effects of pure chemical salts on zooplankton organisms rather than commercial de icing salts which may have a different toxic response in addition these studies usually used in house cultures which varied genetically from laboratory to laboratory e g mount et al 1997 elphick et al 2011 mount et al 2016 to fill this gap the aim of this study was to compare the 24 hour toxicity effective concentration 24 h ec50 of seven different de icing salts viz nacl and six other commercial de icing salts promoted as eco friendly alternatives to nacl on four pure laboratory lines of zooplankton species daphnia magna ceriodaphnia dubia brachionus calyciflorus and thamnocephalus platyurus delivered by the microbiotest company 2 materials and methods 2 1 de icing salts seven different de icing salts commercially available in poland were used in the study table 1 more info about manufacturer is given in table s1 the first was sodium chloride nacl the most commonly used salt worldwide with an added anti caking agent the next three contained calcium chloride cacl2 pure cacl2 cacl2 mixed with nacl and corrosion inhibitor and cacl2 with an eco label also containing a corrosion inhibitor and ph regulator the fifth salt was based on magnesium chloride mgcl2 and the last two were based on potassium formate ch3cook these were sold in two states of aggregation solid and liquid additionally the cost in euro of removing the ice and snow from 100 m2 was calculated this calculation was based on the average efficiency given by the producer up to 10 c and the price in poland per one kilogram of deicer the highest concentration of nacl used in the biotest was set at 15 200 mg l which corresponds to the chloride concentrations reported in previous studies in urban areas szklarek et al 2018 2015 and the highest cl concentration noted in other field studies gallagher et al 2011 mayer et al 2011 prosser et al 2017 therefore each de icing salt was diluted in standard freshwater included in each test to a concentration of 15 200 mg l and then sent to a certified commercial laboratory for analysis using the methods presented in table s2 in addition to the ion content of the salts such as chlorides sodium calcium potassium and magnesium the de icing salts were also tested for compounds that might be present in the de icing salts such as the anti caking agents sodium ferrocyanide and iron ferrocyanide pandolfo et al 2012 they were also tested for the presence of any anti corrosion inhibitors in addition to these analysed chemicals our study also included basic ions cl na k mg and ca at threefold fourfold and fivefold dilutions 25 00 12 50 and 6 25 of the initial concentration 15 200 mg of salts per l the correctness of the prepared dilutions was confirmed using a dionex ion chromatograph with a cg18 cation column ionpac cs18 csrs ultra ii and an ag22 anion column ionpac as22 asrs e ultra ii the test was only started if those results did not differ from the assumed dilution series by more than 5 2 2 toxicity tests four different zooplankton species were used in the study ceriodaphnia dubia richard 1894 daphnia magna straus 1820 brachionus calyciflorus pallas 1766 and thamnocephalus platyurus packard 1877 all tests were performed according to the microbiotests inc protocols ceriodaphtokit daphtoxkit rotoxkit and thamnotoxkit respectively which meet international standards and guidelines table 2 the first step in toxicity assessment was the range finding test in accordance with the test protocols individuals were exposed for 24 hours to a dilution series of de icers starting from 15 200 mg l 100 00 followed by four more concentrations 7 600 mg l 50 00 3 800 mg l 25 00 1 900 mg l 12 50 and 950 mg l 6 25 in the second step a definitive test was performed to determine the 10 and 50 effect concentration 24 h ec10 and 24 h ec50 dilution series were prepared with the values ranging from the lowest dilution producing a 100 effect to the highest one producing less than 10 effect as identified in the range finding test first step in most cases this range was from 7 600 mg l 50 00 to 1 900 mg l 12 50 however a more concentrated solution had to be prepared for the ch3cook solid de icer because it did not demonstrate a 100 effect even at the highest concentration 15 200 mg l the maximum concentration was doubled to 30 400 mg l with the lower concentrations being 24 320 mg l 21 280 mg l and 18 240 mg l according to the test protocols standard freshwater was aerated for 15 minutes by bubbling air through a tube connected to an aquarium air pump following this the dilutions of the de icing salt given above were prepared and these were incubated for two hours to reach the temperature demand by each test protocol table 3 for all prepared dilutions the dissolved oxygen ph and electrical conductivity were measured in a volumetric flask using a ysi professional plus handheld multiparameter meter before test t0 and after 24 hours incubation t24 after a 24 hour incubation the numbers of dead and immobilized neonates were compared with those of the actively swimming test organisms in each well the immobilized neonates were considered to be those not able to swim after gentle agitation of the liquid for 15 seconds even if they could still move their antennae according to the test protocol the results were valid if the number of dead immobile organisms did not exceed 10 in the controls this condition was met in all tests following this the 24 h ec50 and ec10 values for each salt and zooplankton species were determined by the regtox macro in excel delivered by the company author eric vindimian available online http www normalesup org vindimian en index html this method gives the 24 h ec50 and ec10 value with 95 confidence intervals to evaluate the toxicity response of each species to de icing salts the 24 h speciesec50 and ec10 value was determined i e the mean of the 24 h ec50 and ec10 values from the seven tested salts to assess the possible impact of each deicer on the zooplankton species the 24 h saltec50 and ec10 value was determined this was calculated as the mean 24 h ec50 and ec10 value of all those determined for the four tested organisms the significance of the difference between 24 h salt ec50 and ec10 and 24 h species ec50 and ec10 were calculated by the mann whitney u test with p 0 05 regarded as significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical analyses of de icers of all of the analyzed de icers the traditional road salt nacl had the highest levels of sodium chlorides sulphates and bound cyanides table 3 pandolfo et al 2012 report that sodium ferrocyanide and ferric ferrocyanide are often added to road salts as anti caking agents this could account for the higher content of bound cyanides 190 µg l detected in the traditional road salt used in this study which had an anti caking agent as additional component the deicer based on cacl2 also contained higher levels of chlorides compared to the other substitutes cacl2 and cacl2 eco label had the highest calcium ion concentrations 4 917 8 mg l and 4 266 5 mg l respectively finally the ch3cook deicer in solid form showed the lowest levels of all of the analyzed parameters including potassium 10 0 mg l the liquid form demonstrated slightly higher values for sodium 10 2 mg l potassium 1 890 mg l and chlorides 29 mg l 3 2 24 h ec50 toxicity of de icers of the tested salts nacl was found to be the most toxic for t platyurus and b calyciflorus 24 h ec50 3 289 mg l and 3 318 mg l respectively it was less toxic for cladoceran species with 24 h ec50 4 328 mg l for c dubia and 5 244 mg l for d magna figure 1 of the six purportedly de icing salts more environmentally friendly de icers only solid ch3cook soild demonstrated a higher 24 h ec50 value for all four tested organisms in this case the lowest 24 h ec50 value was obtained for t platyurus 19 274 mg l and the highest for b calyciflorus 22 786 mg l most of the remaining de icers had a 24 h ec50 lower than nacl only cacl2 and nacl cacl2 had little higher 24 h ec50 values 3 727 mg l and 3 432 mg l respectively than nacl observed for b calyciflorus figure 1 the lowest 24 h ec50 values for t platyrus c dubia and d magna were noted for cacl2 871 mg l 1 473 mg l and 2 224 mg l respectively of the tested organisms t platyrus had the lowest 24 h ec50 values for six of the tested de icers not solid ch3cook while d magna had the highest 24 h ec50 similar dependencies were observed for 24 h ec10 figure s1 the ec10 values were 5 63 lower than ec50 the smallest difference was noted for ch3cook liquid for t platyurus and the highest for ch3cook solid for b calyciflorus table s4 due to the limited availability of analogous studies our 24 hour results were compared with those from a korean laboratory experiment based on d magna which used a longer exposure time 48 hours lee et al 2017 the study yielded a 48 h ec50 value of 4 000 mg l for nacl which is similar to our 24 h ec50 result of 4 328 mg l obtained after only 24 hours figure 1 in contrast lee and co workers 2017 obtained a lower value for cacl2 with a 48 h ec50 of 1 600 mg l compared to 2 224 mg l after 24 hours in our present experiment mount and coworkers 1997 noted lower 24 h lethal concentration 24 h lc50 values for c dubia for nacl 3 380 mg l and for d magna for mgcl2 1 560 mg l than the 24 h ec50 values noted in our study figure 1 they also reported higher 24 h lc50 values for nacl cacl2 nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 for those species briefly cacl2 had the highest toxicity impact 24 h lc50 for c dubia and mgcl2 for d magna while nacl had the lowest for both species in our tests cacl2 had also the highest toxicity for d magna and nacl the lowest toxicity 24 h ec50 for both species the remaining three salts had a similar toxicity for c dubia figure 1 table s5 those differences may be due to genetic differences between the used culture lines and methodological approaches mount et al 1997 used analytical grade chemicals and observed the lc effect while our study used commercial chemicals table 1 and table s2 and determined the ec effect moreover research conducted to determine 144 h lcx values for mayfly colobruscoides giganteus ephemeroptera colobruscoidea found some difference in toxicity between analytical grade salts and salts commercially used on winter roads moulding et al 2022 these findings as well as previously noted differences in the toxic doses of the two types of salt underline the need to examine the real environmental impact of de icing salt used for winter maintenance indeed commercial salt may have extra ingredients that can pose a toxic hazard either itself or through antagonistic synergistic additive or reversing interactions differences in the toxicity of the seven de icing salts were evident in the 24 h ec50 calculated for all tested zooplankton species 24 h saltec50 index figure 2 solid ch3cook had a significantly higher 24 h saltec50 value 21 089 mg l than the other tested salts three salts cacl2 mgcl2 mgcl2x6h2o and ch3cook liquid 2 073 mg l 2 497 mg l and 2 515 mg l respectively had significant lower 24 h saltec50 values than nacl 4 026 mg l the 24 h saltec50 values for nacl cacl2 3 380 mg l and cacl2 eco label 3 132 mg l were not significantly different to those of nacl figure 2 similar dependencies were observed for 24 h ec10 figure s1 lee et al 2017 examined the impact of nine de icing salts with six eco label certificate on acute toxicity against d magna for 48h exposure all of tested de icers contained chloride but three of the liquid eco label de icers had lower cl content 17 9 21 3 than the three solid eco label de icers 37 6 51 6 cacl2 44 8 and nacl 62 8 the liquid eco label de icers were less toxic to d magna 24 h ec50 from 4 600 to 5 700 mg l than the solid eco label de icers 1 400 3 300 mg l in our experiment no relationship was observed between lower cl level and lower toxic impact on zooplankton species mgcl2 mgcl2x6h2o had 0 61 times the amount of cl measured in nacl figure 1 table 4 but demonstrated significantly higher toxicity figure 3 moreover ch3cook liquid had a very low amount of cl but similar 24 h ec50 figure 1 and 24 h saltec50 values figure 3 to other tested de icers except ch3cook solid this might be caused by k cations which were found to be present at higher concentrations in liquid ch3cook compared to the other deicing salts table 3 this is particularly significant as k ions employ a different toxicity mechanism resulting in higher toxicity than other salt cations erickson et al 2018 2017 mount et al 2016 interestingly k demonstrated 230 mg l 24 h ec50 values for t platyurus 197 mg l for c dubia and 289 mg l for d magna table s4 these were similar to ec50 values noted in other studies 126 mg l for t platyurus 24 h ec50 129 mg l for c dubia and 386 mg l for d magna both 48 h ec50 ivey et al 2017 most ecotoxicity assessments on zooplankton are performed using daphnia spp e g martínez jerónimo and martínez jerónimo 2007 in contrast there is little data about the effect of de icers on other zooplankton species the studied zooplankton species demonstrated different sensitivities as indicated by 24 h speciesec50 index figure 3 the lowest 24 h speciesec50 value was observed for t platyurus at 4 317 mg l and the highest i e 6 333 mg l was recorded for d magna both values were significantly different from the 24 h speciesec50 calculated for b calyciflorus and c dubia which in turn did not differ from each other figure 3 for t platyurus b calyciflorus and c dubia the 24 h speciesec10 index value had no significant difference 4 317 mg l 3 379 mg l and 3 589 mg l respectively figure s3 however a significantly higher value was observed for d magna than the other analysed species 5 189 mg l thamnocephalus is considered a very sensitive organism and in many cases it appears to be more sensitive than other crustacean species in acute tests t platyurus demonstrated significantly greater sensitivity to the toxicity of the herbicide atrazine and the insecticides endosulfan sulphate and chlorpyrifos than daphnia magna and vibrio fischeri palma et al 2008 however we are not aware of any studies other than those presented here on the effects of road salts on t platyurus little information exists on the long term effects of chloride or salt exposure on zooplankton communities valleau et al 2020 examined long term changes in cladocera assemblages preserved in five lake sediments in ontario canada impacted by road salt application the authors report cl concentrations in the range 32 8 90 9 mg l in those lakes and note that bosmina spp were replaced by more generalist scraping feeders i e chydorus brevilabris and eurycercus spp unless daphnia spp were present this may suggest that daphnia spp have higher tolerance to road salt pollution indeed a study by coldsnow and coworkers 2017 found that daphnia pulex populations reared for 2 5 months under elevated salt concentrations i e 100 1 000 mg cl l had higher survival rates than populations previously exposed to natural background levels 15 mg cl l elphick and coworkers 2011 also found that for d magna toxicity occurred at higher concentrations of cl pollution lc50 3 630 mg cl l compared to c dubia lc50 1 068 mg cl l and b calyciflorus lc50 1 645 mg cl l in our present study d magna also demonstrated higher 24 ec50 against cl 4 667 mg cl l than the other three species table s4 the ability of daphnia to adapt evolutionarily to salinity stress may be important in maintaining the stability of the trophic cascade in freshwater ecosystems liu and steiner 2017 other studies indicate that cladoceran abundance significantly decreased with increasing chloride concentration r2 0 69 while rotifers were more chloride tolerant these demonstrated a slower decrease in abundance r2 0 31 with increasing cl level tested chloride gradient was from 0 41 to 1 500 mg l greco et al 2021 in a mesocosm experiment it was found that at a high cl concentration 1 067 mg l the zooplankton community was dominated by the rotifer family brachionidae 93 in contrast at a low cl concentration 177 2 mg l it consisted of only 27 of brachionidae about 30 of copepods and about 25 of cladocerans with the remainder being made up of other rotifers and ostracods van meter et al 2012 an outdoor experiment comparing the effects of three different de icing salts nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 found no significant difference in their effect on population profile after 12 day exposure to a high chloride concentration 855 mg cl l induced by exposure to the de icing saltsde icers all samples demonstrated 87 92 fewer cladocerans and 93 97 rotifers compared to controls coldsnow and relyea 2021 schuler et al 2017 report that exposure to two de icing salts geomelt beet juice proprietary blend and magic salt mgcl2 mixed with a distillation by product resulted in significant higher zooplankton abundance at a concentration of 200 mg cl l compare to controls 25 mg cl l all these findings demonstrate the variable nature of the response of the zooplankton community to de icing salt pollution our own laboratory tests also showed different levels of toxicity response to de icing salts among organisms not previously exposed to chloride or other pollutants figure 1 figure 3 further analysis is needed to determine the probable cause of this varying response between the test species 3 4 further perspectives new solutions are needed to prevent the further contamination of water ecosystems and their degradation one such approach to ensuring sustainable development that balances the need for road safety during winter while reducing anthropogenic pollution involves the use of more environmentally friendly de icing salts however our results indicate that most of the tested nacl alternatives had similar or even higher toxicity for the analysed zooplankton species compared to nacl only one from six eco friendly alternatives had significant lower toxicity figure 1 figure 3 in addition to the short term effects of high salt concentrations many studies report long term toxicity for zooplankton abundance egg production and neonate release arnott et al 2020 brown and yan 2015 coldsnow and relyea 2021 delaune et al 2021 it has also been found that the proposed alternatives to nacl de icers might have similar toxicity for other freshwater species including chironomus dilutes nutile and solan 2019 filamentous algae and amphipods coldsnow and relyea 2021 while it seems that the cl free de icing salts should be less toxic to the environment like the solid ch3cook studied in our experiment figure 2 table s4 these salts may still might be toxic to the aquatic ecosystem for example the organic de icing salts may increase biological oxygen demand bod de icing salts leading to the depletion of dissolved oxygen terry et al 2020 however the dissolved oxygen concentration did not change significantly during the realised 24 h incubation table s3 our present findings and those of other studies indicate that the impact of de icing salts on the environment remains poorly verified their application might result in further degradation of freshwater ecosystems and together with other factors like global warming and increasing water eutrophication donis et al 2021 encourage a greater incidence of cyanobacterial blooms as cyanobacteria demonstrate higher tolerance for salinity than other phytoplankton species tonk et al 2007 the decision to use alternative de icers also has an economic dimension while all the tested alternatives had a higher cost the information given by the manufacturers suggest they are in fact more efficient table 1 the most environmentally friendly de icer solid ch3cook was almost five times more expensive than nacl but it was also five times less toxic for all tested zooplankton species figure 1 this indicates the need for a combined approach comprising both socio economic research and studies examining the toxic impact of de icing alternatives on freshwater ecosystems to provide the comprehensive data needed to reduce the negative impact of winter road maintenance on water communities such studies would be useful in developing uniform regulations for defining acceptable levels of acute and chronic chloride toxicity in surface waters 4 conclusion this study compares the toxic impacts of nacl and six alternative de icing salts on four zooplankton species our findings showed that cacl2 mgcl2 mgcl2x6h2o and liquid ch3cook had significantly lower values of 24 h saltec50 2 073 mg l 2 497 mg l and 2 515 mg l respectively than those noted for nacl 4 026 mg l only solid ch3cook salt had a significantly higher value of 24 h saltec50 21 089 mg l of the four tested species the lowest toxicity response for all seven de icing salts was observed for t platyurus with a 24 h speciesec50 value of 4 317 mg l significantly lower than for the other three species the highest toxicity response was demonstrated by d magna with a 24 h speciesec50 value of 6 333 mg l significantly higher than the other three species most of the tested de icing salts promoted as being more environmentally friendly de icing salts than the more commonly used nacl might in fact have similar or higher toxicity for zooplankton species our results underline the need to perform more

939,while de icing salts improve safety on roads and sidewalks during winter they have a negative impact on the environment this has spurred the search for more environmentally friendly alternatives the present study tests the impact of nacl and six other de icing salts pure cacl2 cacl2 nacl eco label cacl2 mgcl2 solid and liquid ch3cook promoted as more eco friendly alternatives to nacl on four zooplankton species from biotests ceriodaphnia dubia ceriodaphtokit daphnia magna daphtoxkit brachionus calyciflorus rotoxkit and thamnocephalus platyurus thamnotoxkit 24 h ec50 evaluation showed that only solid ch3cook was less toxic for all tested species than nacl the other tested de icing salts had similar or even higher toxicity with cacl2 mgcl2 and liquid ch3cook being significantly more toxic for all species than nacl of the tested species thamnocephalus platyurus demonstrated toxicity response at significantly lower concentration of all used de icing salts while daphnia magna had significantly the highest concentrations of toxicity response our findings demonstrate that these alternatives are not less toxic in this regard than the commonly used nacl and underline the need to verify the accuracy of the term eco friendly on the labels of these products key words de icing salt road salt ecotoxicity zooplankton biotest 1 introduction in many countries freshwater areas are increasingly subject to salinity input from anthropogenic sources such as agriculture mining effluents industry effluents and urbanization indeed such trends in salt ion concentrations have been observed in aquatic ecosystems in the usa corsi et al 2015 dugan et al 2017 canada lembcke et al 2017 many european countries e g löfgren 2001 salminen et al 2011 müller and gächter 2012 espinha marques et al 2021 niedrist et al 2021 china yu et al 2014 zhao et al 2021 and australia shenton et al 2022 the salinity level of an area depends on a range of climate topography geology hydrology and catchment characteristics as well as the nature of any anthropogenic sources in cold regions one of the main freshwater salinization sources is road salt commonly used in winter for de icing roads cañedo argüelles et al 2013 cunillera montcusí et al 2022 kaushal et al 2021 the complex interrelationship between salt ions and chemical biological and geological parameters and their environmental and socio economic consequences have been named freshwater salinity syndrome fss long term studies indicate that without urgent remedial action fss will continue to increase the salinity of freshwater ecosystems groundwater and soils at local regional and global scales and alter their ionic composition kaushal et al 2021 despite this standards for chloride ion concentrations in freshwater ecosystems i e the most standard chemical determinant of salinity have not generally been established in european countries schuler et al 2018 with a few exceptions such as germany and sweden schulz and cañedo argüelles 2019 in addition research indicates that chloride concentration limits set in the us and canada do not sufficiently protect lake food webs research to revise existing standards or to establish new legal guidelines is therefore urgently needed to protect freshwater ecosystems from human induced salinisation hintz et al 2022 the combined effect of increasing eutrophication and salinization on freshwater ecosystems promotes the formation of large blooms of phytoplankton and periphyton and the decline of many species of invertebrates and macrophytes delaune et al 2021 gillis et al 2022 honarvar nazari et al 2021 kaushal et al 2021 lind et al 2018 szklarek et al 2022 a particularly salinity sensitive group of organisms is the zooplankton according to published studies elevated road salt concentrations cause a decrease in zooplankton reproduction and an increase in mortality resulting in an overall decrease in zooplankton density arnott et al 2020 hintz and relyea 2017 furthermore salinity stress affects planktivore zooplankton interactions road salt and predation stress have additive negative effects on the abundance of daphnia hintz et al 2017 and at higher salinities changes are observed in daphniid life history and behavioural responses to predation liu and steiner 2017 as zooplankton play an important role in top down processes in lakes and other standing freshwaters their sensitivity to increasing salinity due to various causes such as the use of road salt may cause disturbances in the trophic cascade the use of de icing salts therefore induces a number of direct and indirect effects in the biotic structure which may alter ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services jones et al 2017 hintz and relyea 2017 schuler et al 2017 consequently in an era of excessive use of de icing agents and salinisation of freshwater ecosystems detailed studies are needed on the complex effects of road salts on the quantitative and qualitative structure of zooplankton communities furthermore as many zooplankton demonstrate species specific responses to stressors studies on the responses to elevated concentrations of de icing salts should include a range of zooplankton genera rather than focusing on the model genus daphnia despite being the most commonly used de icing salt sodium chloride nacl is responsible for a number of negative effects on the environment around the application site road car and infrastructure corrosion deteriorating vegetation and alternative road salts are currently sought however while is assumed that these new salts will be less harmful to the human infrastructure and vegetation near the road their impact on water ecosystems is rarely considered in studies if at all a few have investigated the impact on freshwater organisms of alternative de icing salts particularly those based on magnesium and calcium chloride mgcl2 and cacl2 their findings suggest that nacl alternatives could have a similar or higher toxicity on freshwater species than nacl lee et al 2017 nutile and solan 2019 schuler and relyea 2018 and are usually more expensive achkeeva et al 2015 consequently little is known about the effects of new de icing salts promoted as eco friendly alternatives to nacl many of which have been put into use without prior studies of their environmental impact especially on the freshwater ecosystem in addition laboratory studies published to date have tested the effects of pure chemical salts on zooplankton organisms rather than commercial de icing salts which may have a different toxic response in addition these studies usually used in house cultures which varied genetically from laboratory to laboratory e g mount et al 1997 elphick et al 2011 mount et al 2016 to fill this gap the aim of this study was to compare the 24 hour toxicity effective concentration 24 h ec50 of seven different de icing salts viz nacl and six other commercial de icing salts promoted as eco friendly alternatives to nacl on four pure laboratory lines of zooplankton species daphnia magna ceriodaphnia dubia brachionus calyciflorus and thamnocephalus platyurus delivered by the microbiotest company 2 materials and methods 2 1 de icing salts seven different de icing salts commercially available in poland were used in the study table 1 more info about manufacturer is given in table s1 the first was sodium chloride nacl the most commonly used salt worldwide with an added anti caking agent the next three contained calcium chloride cacl2 pure cacl2 cacl2 mixed with nacl and corrosion inhibitor and cacl2 with an eco label also containing a corrosion inhibitor and ph regulator the fifth salt was based on magnesium chloride mgcl2 and the last two were based on potassium formate ch3cook these were sold in two states of aggregation solid and liquid additionally the cost in euro of removing the ice and snow from 100 m2 was calculated this calculation was based on the average efficiency given by the producer up to 10 c and the price in poland per one kilogram of deicer the highest concentration of nacl used in the biotest was set at 15 200 mg l which corresponds to the chloride concentrations reported in previous studies in urban areas szklarek et al 2018 2015 and the highest cl concentration noted in other field studies gallagher et al 2011 mayer et al 2011 prosser et al 2017 therefore each de icing salt was diluted in standard freshwater included in each test to a concentration of 15 200 mg l and then sent to a certified commercial laboratory for analysis using the methods presented in table s2 in addition to the ion content of the salts such as chlorides sodium calcium potassium and magnesium the de icing salts were also tested for compounds that might be present in the de icing salts such as the anti caking agents sodium ferrocyanide and iron ferrocyanide pandolfo et al 2012 they were also tested for the presence of any anti corrosion inhibitors in addition to these analysed chemicals our study also included basic ions cl na k mg and ca at threefold fourfold and fivefold dilutions 25 00 12 50 and 6 25 of the initial concentration 15 200 mg of salts per l the correctness of the prepared dilutions was confirmed using a dionex ion chromatograph with a cg18 cation column ionpac cs18 csrs ultra ii and an ag22 anion column ionpac as22 asrs e ultra ii the test was only started if those results did not differ from the assumed dilution series by more than 5 2 2 toxicity tests four different zooplankton species were used in the study ceriodaphnia dubia richard 1894 daphnia magna straus 1820 brachionus calyciflorus pallas 1766 and thamnocephalus platyurus packard 1877 all tests were performed according to the microbiotests inc protocols ceriodaphtokit daphtoxkit rotoxkit and thamnotoxkit respectively which meet international standards and guidelines table 2 the first step in toxicity assessment was the range finding test in accordance with the test protocols individuals were exposed for 24 hours to a dilution series of de icers starting from 15 200 mg l 100 00 followed by four more concentrations 7 600 mg l 50 00 3 800 mg l 25 00 1 900 mg l 12 50 and 950 mg l 6 25 in the second step a definitive test was performed to determine the 10 and 50 effect concentration 24 h ec10 and 24 h ec50 dilution series were prepared with the values ranging from the lowest dilution producing a 100 effect to the highest one producing less than 10 effect as identified in the range finding test first step in most cases this range was from 7 600 mg l 50 00 to 1 900 mg l 12 50 however a more concentrated solution had to be prepared for the ch3cook solid de icer because it did not demonstrate a 100 effect even at the highest concentration 15 200 mg l the maximum concentration was doubled to 30 400 mg l with the lower concentrations being 24 320 mg l 21 280 mg l and 18 240 mg l according to the test protocols standard freshwater was aerated for 15 minutes by bubbling air through a tube connected to an aquarium air pump following this the dilutions of the de icing salt given above were prepared and these were incubated for two hours to reach the temperature demand by each test protocol table 3 for all prepared dilutions the dissolved oxygen ph and electrical conductivity were measured in a volumetric flask using a ysi professional plus handheld multiparameter meter before test t0 and after 24 hours incubation t24 after a 24 hour incubation the numbers of dead and immobilized neonates were compared with those of the actively swimming test organisms in each well the immobilized neonates were considered to be those not able to swim after gentle agitation of the liquid for 15 seconds even if they could still move their antennae according to the test protocol the results were valid if the number of dead immobile organisms did not exceed 10 in the controls this condition was met in all tests following this the 24 h ec50 and ec10 values for each salt and zooplankton species were determined by the regtox macro in excel delivered by the company author eric vindimian available online http www normalesup org vindimian en index html this method gives the 24 h ec50 and ec10 value with 95 confidence intervals to evaluate the toxicity response of each species to de icing salts the 24 h speciesec50 and ec10 value was determined i e the mean of the 24 h ec50 and ec10 values from the seven tested salts to assess the possible impact of each deicer on the zooplankton species the 24 h saltec50 and ec10 value was determined this was calculated as the mean 24 h ec50 and ec10 value of all those determined for the four tested organisms the significance of the difference between 24 h salt ec50 and ec10 and 24 h species ec50 and ec10 were calculated by the mann whitney u test with p 0 05 regarded as significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical analyses of de icers of all of the analyzed de icers the traditional road salt nacl had the highest levels of sodium chlorides sulphates and bound cyanides table 3 pandolfo et al 2012 report that sodium ferrocyanide and ferric ferrocyanide are often added to road salts as anti caking agents this could account for the higher content of bound cyanides 190 µg l detected in the traditional road salt used in this study which had an anti caking agent as additional component the deicer based on cacl2 also contained higher levels of chlorides compared to the other substitutes cacl2 and cacl2 eco label had the highest calcium ion concentrations 4 917 8 mg l and 4 266 5 mg l respectively finally the ch3cook deicer in solid form showed the lowest levels of all of the analyzed parameters including potassium 10 0 mg l the liquid form demonstrated slightly higher values for sodium 10 2 mg l potassium 1 890 mg l and chlorides 29 mg l 3 2 24 h ec50 toxicity of de icers of the tested salts nacl was found to be the most toxic for t platyurus and b calyciflorus 24 h ec50 3 289 mg l and 3 318 mg l respectively it was less toxic for cladoceran species with 24 h ec50 4 328 mg l for c dubia and 5 244 mg l for d magna figure 1 of the six purportedly de icing salts more environmentally friendly de icers only solid ch3cook soild demonstrated a higher 24 h ec50 value for all four tested organisms in this case the lowest 24 h ec50 value was obtained for t platyurus 19 274 mg l and the highest for b calyciflorus 22 786 mg l most of the remaining de icers had a 24 h ec50 lower than nacl only cacl2 and nacl cacl2 had little higher 24 h ec50 values 3 727 mg l and 3 432 mg l respectively than nacl observed for b calyciflorus figure 1 the lowest 24 h ec50 values for t platyrus c dubia and d magna were noted for cacl2 871 mg l 1 473 mg l and 2 224 mg l respectively of the tested organisms t platyrus had the lowest 24 h ec50 values for six of the tested de icers not solid ch3cook while d magna had the highest 24 h ec50 similar dependencies were observed for 24 h ec10 figure s1 the ec10 values were 5 63 lower than ec50 the smallest difference was noted for ch3cook liquid for t platyurus and the highest for ch3cook solid for b calyciflorus table s4 due to the limited availability of analogous studies our 24 hour results were compared with those from a korean laboratory experiment based on d magna which used a longer exposure time 48 hours lee et al 2017 the study yielded a 48 h ec50 value of 4 000 mg l for nacl which is similar to our 24 h ec50 result of 4 328 mg l obtained after only 24 hours figure 1 in contrast lee and co workers 2017 obtained a lower value for cacl2 with a 48 h ec50 of 1 600 mg l compared to 2 224 mg l after 24 hours in our present experiment mount and coworkers 1997 noted lower 24 h lethal concentration 24 h lc50 values for c dubia for nacl 3 380 mg l and for d magna for mgcl2 1 560 mg l than the 24 h ec50 values noted in our study figure 1 they also reported higher 24 h lc50 values for nacl cacl2 nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 for those species briefly cacl2 had the highest toxicity impact 24 h lc50 for c dubia and mgcl2 for d magna while nacl had the lowest for both species in our tests cacl2 had also the highest toxicity for d magna and nacl the lowest toxicity 24 h ec50 for both species the remaining three salts had a similar toxicity for c dubia figure 1 table s5 those differences may be due to genetic differences between the used culture lines and methodological approaches mount et al 1997 used analytical grade chemicals and observed the lc effect while our study used commercial chemicals table 1 and table s2 and determined the ec effect moreover research conducted to determine 144 h lcx values for mayfly colobruscoides giganteus ephemeroptera colobruscoidea found some difference in toxicity between analytical grade salts and salts commercially used on winter roads moulding et al 2022 these findings as well as previously noted differences in the toxic doses of the two types of salt underline the need to examine the real environmental impact of de icing salt used for winter maintenance indeed commercial salt may have extra ingredients that can pose a toxic hazard either itself or through antagonistic synergistic additive or reversing interactions differences in the toxicity of the seven de icing salts were evident in the 24 h ec50 calculated for all tested zooplankton species 24 h saltec50 index figure 2 solid ch3cook had a significantly higher 24 h saltec50 value 21 089 mg l than the other tested salts three salts cacl2 mgcl2 mgcl2x6h2o and ch3cook liquid 2 073 mg l 2 497 mg l and 2 515 mg l respectively had significant lower 24 h saltec50 values than nacl 4 026 mg l the 24 h saltec50 values for nacl cacl2 3 380 mg l and cacl2 eco label 3 132 mg l were not significantly different to those of nacl figure 2 similar dependencies were observed for 24 h ec10 figure s1 lee et al 2017 examined the impact of nine de icing salts with six eco label certificate on acute toxicity against d magna for 48h exposure all of tested de icers contained chloride but three of the liquid eco label de icers had lower cl content 17 9 21 3 than the three solid eco label de icers 37 6 51 6 cacl2 44 8 and nacl 62 8 the liquid eco label de icers were less toxic to d magna 24 h ec50 from 4 600 to 5 700 mg l than the solid eco label de icers 1 400 3 300 mg l in our experiment no relationship was observed between lower cl level and lower toxic impact on zooplankton species mgcl2 mgcl2x6h2o had 0 61 times the amount of cl measured in nacl figure 1 table 4 but demonstrated significantly higher toxicity figure 3 moreover ch3cook liquid had a very low amount of cl but similar 24 h ec50 figure 1 and 24 h saltec50 values figure 3 to other tested de icers except ch3cook solid this might be caused by k cations which were found to be present at higher concentrations in liquid ch3cook compared to the other deicing salts table 3 this is particularly significant as k ions employ a different toxicity mechanism resulting in higher toxicity than other salt cations erickson et al 2018 2017 mount et al 2016 interestingly k demonstrated 230 mg l 24 h ec50 values for t platyurus 197 mg l for c dubia and 289 mg l for d magna table s4 these were similar to ec50 values noted in other studies 126 mg l for t platyurus 24 h ec50 129 mg l for c dubia and 386 mg l for d magna both 48 h ec50 ivey et al 2017 most ecotoxicity assessments on zooplankton are performed using daphnia spp e g martínez jerónimo and martínez jerónimo 2007 in contrast there is little data about the effect of de icers on other zooplankton species the studied zooplankton species demonstrated different sensitivities as indicated by 24 h speciesec50 index figure 3 the lowest 24 h speciesec50 value was observed for t platyurus at 4 317 mg l and the highest i e 6 333 mg l was recorded for d magna both values were significantly different from the 24 h speciesec50 calculated for b calyciflorus and c dubia which in turn did not differ from each other figure 3 for t platyurus b calyciflorus and c dubia the 24 h speciesec10 index value had no significant difference 4 317 mg l 3 379 mg l and 3 589 mg l respectively figure s3 however a significantly higher value was observed for d magna than the other analysed species 5 189 mg l thamnocephalus is considered a very sensitive organism and in many cases it appears to be more sensitive than other crustacean species in acute tests t platyurus demonstrated significantly greater sensitivity to the toxicity of the herbicide atrazine and the insecticides endosulfan sulphate and chlorpyrifos than daphnia magna and vibrio fischeri palma et al 2008 however we are not aware of any studies other than those presented here on the effects of road salts on t platyurus little information exists on the long term effects of chloride or salt exposure on zooplankton communities valleau et al 2020 examined long term changes in cladocera assemblages preserved in five lake sediments in ontario canada impacted by road salt application the authors report cl concentrations in the range 32 8 90 9 mg l in those lakes and note that bosmina spp were replaced by more generalist scraping feeders i e chydorus brevilabris and eurycercus spp unless daphnia spp were present this may suggest that daphnia spp have higher tolerance to road salt pollution indeed a study by coldsnow and coworkers 2017 found that daphnia pulex populations reared for 2 5 months under elevated salt concentrations i e 100 1 000 mg cl l had higher survival rates than populations previously exposed to natural background levels 15 mg cl l elphick and coworkers 2011 also found that for d magna toxicity occurred at higher concentrations of cl pollution lc50 3 630 mg cl l compared to c dubia lc50 1 068 mg cl l and b calyciflorus lc50 1 645 mg cl l in our present study d magna also demonstrated higher 24 ec50 against cl 4 667 mg cl l than the other three species table s4 the ability of daphnia to adapt evolutionarily to salinity stress may be important in maintaining the stability of the trophic cascade in freshwater ecosystems liu and steiner 2017 other studies indicate that cladoceran abundance significantly decreased with increasing chloride concentration r2 0 69 while rotifers were more chloride tolerant these demonstrated a slower decrease in abundance r2 0 31 with increasing cl level tested chloride gradient was from 0 41 to 1 500 mg l greco et al 2021 in a mesocosm experiment it was found that at a high cl concentration 1 067 mg l the zooplankton community was dominated by the rotifer family brachionidae 93 in contrast at a low cl concentration 177 2 mg l it consisted of only 27 of brachionidae about 30 of copepods and about 25 of cladocerans with the remainder being made up of other rotifers and ostracods van meter et al 2012 an outdoor experiment comparing the effects of three different de icing salts nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 found no significant difference in their effect on population profile after 12 day exposure to a high chloride concentration 855 mg cl l induced by exposure to the de icing saltsde icers all samples demonstrated 87 92 fewer cladocerans and 93 97 rotifers compared to controls coldsnow and relyea 2021 schuler et al 2017 report that exposure to two de icing salts geomelt beet juice proprietary blend and magic salt mgcl2 mixed with a distillation by product resulted in significant higher zooplankton abundance at a concentration of 200 mg cl l compare to controls 25 mg cl l all these findings demonstrate the variable nature of the response of the zooplankton community to de icing salt pollution our own laboratory tests also showed different levels of toxicity response to de icing salts among organisms not previously exposed to chloride or other pollutants figure 1 figure 3 further analysis is needed to determine the probable cause of this varying response between the test species 3 4 further perspectives new solutions are needed to prevent the further contamination of water ecosystems and their degradation one such approach to ensuring sustainable development that balances the need for road safety during winter while reducing anthropogenic pollution involves the use of more environmentally friendly de icing salts however our results indicate that most of the tested nacl alternatives had similar or even higher toxicity for the analysed zooplankton species compared to nacl only one from six eco friendly alternatives had significant lower toxicity figure 1 figure 3 in addition to the short term effects of high salt concentrations many studies report long term toxicity for zooplankton abundance egg production and neonate release arnott et al 2020 brown and yan 2015 coldsnow and relyea 2021 delaune et al 2021 it has also been found that the proposed alternatives to nacl de icers might have similar toxicity for other freshwater species including chironomus dilutes nutile and solan 2019 filamentous algae and amphipods coldsnow and relyea 2021 while it seems that the cl free de icing salts should be less toxic to the environment like the solid ch3cook studied in our experiment figure 2 table s4 these salts may still might be toxic to the aquatic ecosystem for example the organic de icing salts may increase biological oxygen demand bod de icing salts leading to the depletion of dissolved oxygen terry et al 2020 however the dissolved oxygen concentration did not change significantly during the realised 24 h incubation table s3 our present findings and those of other studies indicate that the impact of de icing salts on the environment remains poorly verified their application might result in further degradation of freshwater ecosystems and together with other factors like global warming and increasing water eutrophication donis et al 2021 encourage a greater incidence of cyanobacterial blooms as cyanobacteria demonstrate higher tolerance for salinity than other phytoplankton species tonk et al 2007 the decision to use alternative de icers also has an economic dimension while all the tested alternatives had a higher cost the information given by the manufacturers suggest they are in fact more efficient table 1 the most environmentally friendly de icer solid ch3cook was almost five times more expensive than nacl but it was also five times less toxic for all tested zooplankton species figure 1 this indicates the need for a combined approach comprising both socio economic research and studies examining the toxic impact of de icing alternatives on freshwater ecosystems to provide the comprehensive data needed to reduce the negative impact of winter road maintenance on water communities such studies would be useful in developing uniform regulations for defining acceptable levels of acute and chronic chloride toxicity in surface waters 4 conclusion this study compares the toxic impacts of nacl and six alternative de icing salts on four zooplankton species our findings showed that cacl2 mgcl2 mgcl2x6h2o and liquid ch3cook had significantly lower values of 24 h saltec50 2 073 mg l 2 497 mg l and 2 515 mg l respectively than those noted for nacl 4 026 mg l only solid ch3cook salt had a significantly higher value of 24 h saltec50 21 089 mg l of the four tested species the lowest toxicity response for all seven de icing salts was observed for t platyurus with a 24 h speciesec50 value of 4 317 mg l significantly lower than for the other three species the highest toxicity response was demonstrated by d magna with a 24 h speciesec50 value of 6 333 mg l significantly higher than the other three species most of the tested de icing salts promoted as being more environmentally friendly de icing salts than the more commonly used nacl might in fact have similar or higher toxicity for zooplankton species our results underline the need to perform more
